1
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:13,863
Your plan was perfect.

2
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,682
Then the look on Mr. Sevilla's face

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,267
when he saw the note on the eraser.

4
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:18,292
Priceless!

5
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,020
We had a deal, right?

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,690
Why did it say in the GC
that Mr. Sevilla was terminated?

7
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:25,692
Who the fuck are you

8
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,819
to boss me around
and call me dumb, huh?

9
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:30,739
This month, Possenti has been chosen

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,616
to represent the Teen Genius Quiz.

11
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,993
You even got a scholarship for next sem.

12
00:00:35,248 --> 00:00:36,248
Congrats!

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,179
How did you get in here

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,328
so effortlessly?

15
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,730
You really think you got in
here fair and square?

16
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:44,882
I’ll use the clock in our classroom.

17
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:47,255
The minute hand
corresponds to the question.

18
00:00:47,304 --> 00:00:48,757
Just watch my right hand.

19
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,341
I’ll move it to wherever

20
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,968
the second hand of the clock lands.

21
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:52,969
One is A,

22
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,903
two is B,

23
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,846
three is C,

24
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:55,905
and four is D.

25
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,930
Got it?

26
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,270
What now?

27
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,999
I can't concentrate because of you.

28
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,697
What are you guys talking about?

29
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,159
What just fell, Tristan?

30
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,914
Tristan, what’s that paper you’re holding?

31
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:22,956
Is that a cheat sheet?

32
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:24,885
Give it to me.

33
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,754
This isn’t a cheat sheet, ma’am.

34
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:29,964
Then hand it over.

35
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:33,670
Hand it over, Tristan.

36
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,346
One.

37
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,641
Two.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,062
- You really won’t give it?
- Ma’am!

39
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,480
- I said hand it over!
- Ma'am!

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,399
What’s this?

41
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,950
That’s a list of addresses
of people we do laundry for.

42
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,166
Tristan, seriously.

43
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:10,296
You know that paper is strictly
not allowed in my exam.

44
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,465
I am very disappointed in you.

45
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,095
I didn’t expect you’d be the one
to cause trouble in my exam.

46
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,271
Tristan!

47
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,397
What the fuck?

48
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,023
Are you okay?

49
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,692
Tristan!

50
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,278
Tristan!

51
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,572
Tristan!

52
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:37,698
Tristan!

53
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,292
You know, thanks to him,

54
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,920
at least all of Ms. Robles’
attention went to him.

55
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,755
Such a drama queen.

56
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,131
Says he’s distracted by Lin.

57
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,757
He even threw up.

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,027
Damn it was fucking disgusting, man.

59
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,178
Smells so bad.

60
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,181
But to be honest,

61
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,059
okay, even if he is arrogant,

62
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,311
I still feel bad for him.

63
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,980
I think he's just not feeling well.

64
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,440
I say deserve.

65
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,042
Why do you feel bad for him?

66
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,568
And I still can’t figure out
why he won’t just

67
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,403
admit that it was a list of his customers?

68
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,237
Idiot.

69
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,115
If Bank is an idiot,

70
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,951
what does that make you?

71
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,203
Idiot to the nth power?

72
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,224
The National Comission
on Education Secretary insists

73
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,226
that NCET is a major advancement

74
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,269
in the country's education system.

75
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,398
He believes that through NCET,

76
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,652
we can finally keep up with
other countries in terms of education.

77
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,364
I'm now with Mr. Vicente Ramirez

78
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,824
to give a statement.

79
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,866
Well, if...

80
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,079
The goal is for us to compete on
an international level and...

81
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,122
Dad?

82
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,499
...to enhance the educational quality here.

83
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,499
Did you have dinner?

84
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,501
Do you want me
to fix you a plate?

85
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,771
No need.

86
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,743
My co-teachers and I already ate.

87
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,637
You know what, get some rest.

88
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,655
It’s late, Lin.

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,850
I’ll rest for a while then
finish the rest of my work.

90
00:05:13,258 --> 00:05:14,633
- Dad?
- Hmm?

91
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,524
Sorry.

92
00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:18,933
I’m sorry.

93
00:05:20,532 --> 00:05:21,713
I doubted your decisions.

94
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,739
I get it now.

95
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,615
I really am sorry.

96
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,578
It’s nothing. It's way past us.

97
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,831
I understand now as well

98
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,235
where you’re coming from.

99
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,960
My mistake as your father is that

100
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,755
I should’ve asked what
you really wanted.

101
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,172
I’m sorry.

102
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,315
It's okay.

103
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,567
It’s really okay.

104
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,343
Just know, if you ever need help,

105
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,471
I’m right here.

106
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,515
There’s no one else we can
rely on but each other.

107
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,267
Thank you.

108
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,148
Maybe the takeaway from this is

109
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,318
There’s really nothing wrong
with doing what you want.

110
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,485
Just,

111
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,488
what matters is making sure no one else

112
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,531
gets affected by your decision, okay?

113
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Mhmm.

114
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,575
Okay, Dad.

115
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,576
Alright, I’ll go get changed.

116
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:11,215
Okay, Dad.

117
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:18,211
Uhm, I still believe
that it is essential to…

118
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,839
prioritize the improvement of programs and

119
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,884
curricula first before implementing…

120
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,137
more assessment like that of NCET.

121
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,238
Because

122
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,739
it uses taxpayers’ money.

123
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,644
Hey!

124
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,896
What are you doing there?

125
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,372
Why are you the one doing that?

126
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:39,771
Go back upstairs!

127
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,901
Come on, take a break.

128
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,653
You might throw up on that.

129
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:45,613
You’re so extra, Ma.

130
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,698
You’re the one who
should be resting, remember?

131
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,408
Wasn’t it you the doctor told

132
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,370
to avoid doing strenuous
activities for now?

133
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,871
Don’t be stubborn, Ma.

134
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,164
Just let me do this

135
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,833
while you’re still not fully okay.

136
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,127
Let me be.

137
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,795
I’ll just finish this.

138
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,257
I don’t like doing nothing.

139
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,968
You know me,
I’m not rich or anything.

140
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,428
If we don’t move,
what’ll happen to me?

141
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,429
Okay, fine.

142
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,347
Then go ahead and do it.

143
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,351
Good morning.

144
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,853
Good day.

145
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,724
Are you here for laundry, young lady?

146
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,855
Oh, no.

147
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,941
Bank,

148
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:24,902
can I talk to you?

149
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,406
Please?

150
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,753
Why are you here?

151
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,429
I just wanted to tell you that
you can have the scholarship

152
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,429
for next year.

153
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,598
Huh?

154
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,217
Why, don’t you want it anymore?

155
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,607
Because we won the lotto.

156
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,066
You won?

157
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:06,569
How much? How many tickets?

158
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,153
That’s a secret.

159
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,613
It’s just that,

160
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,033
someone might try to rob us or something.

161
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,243
Dad doesn’t want to say anything,

162
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,060
but I know he won big.

163
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,165
And he probably bet on a lot.

164
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,713
So, what did your dad say about you
giving up the scholarship?

165
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,299
Dad’s fine with it.

166
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,552
Competing is just too stressful now.

167
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,972
And the scholarship should’ve been
yours from the start, right?

168
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,902
Why aren't you talking?

169
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,321
Are you mad again?

170
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,618
I was just thinking of Mama,

171
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,496
she bets on the lotto almost every day.

172
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,333
Sometimes she even forgets
to buy her meds because of it.

173
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,127
It made me realize,

174
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,589
life really is all about
luck sometimes, huh?

175
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:13,728
But,

176
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,804
thank you.

177
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,610
I actually have a question for you.

178
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,280
But please don’t get mad, okay?

179
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,450
Why do you already think I’ll get mad?

180
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:37,659
See?

181
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,496
There, you’re already mad.

182
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,625
No, I’m not mad.

183
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,167
Why?

184
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,838
Ah, during the exam,

185
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,800
why didn’t you just show
Ms. Robles the paper right away?

186
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,639
I just didn’t want them to remember
our laundry business again.

187
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,642
They used to put their
dirty uniforms in my bag

188
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,977
for Mama to wash.

189
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,689
I don’t really care when
they tease me and call me Banky.

190
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,125
But what I don’t like is

191
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,068
when they push it,
and drag my mom into it too.

192
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,782
I know there’s nothing wrong
with being a laundrywoman.

193
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,451
It’s a decent job.

194
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,538
But the way they say it
feels belittling sometimes,

195
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,582
and it hurts.

196
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,460
It hurts me for my mom.

197
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,297
She’s doing everything she can
to lift us out of this.

198
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,008
We just really had a tough life.

199
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,928
But the way they say it,

200
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,848
it’s like my mom isn’t
doing anything to help us rise up.

201
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,727
You know,

202
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,730
their mom doesn’t love them.

203
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:50,830
That’s why they take out
their frustrations on others.

204
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,737
And honestly, they should be the ones
ashamed of their nasty attitudes,

205
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,530
they’re the rude ones.

206
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,911
But you,

207
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,912
you’re kind.

208
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,458
So if you ever want to have laundry done,
just let me know.

209
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,878
That way I can somehow repay you
for giving up your scholarship.

210
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,840
Oh, no, it's okay—
I’d feel bad for your mom.

211
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:17,482
But sure,

212
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,346
I’ll have Papa’s polo washed.

213
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,947
Make it super white, okay?

214
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,183
Like there's no grime left on the collar.

215
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,434
Got it.

216
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,522
You know,

217
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,900
you should smile more often.

218
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:34,818
Because,

219
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,487
it actually suits you.

220
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,363
You look cuter.

221
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,951
You know,

222
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,996
I’ve been cute even without smiling.

223
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,011
What?

224
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,382
Here you go.

225
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,134
To protect your wound.

226
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,846
You know,

227
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,537
this is the first time I’ve had
a schoolmate be this kind to me.

228
00:12:55,654 --> 00:12:56,417
You’re…

229
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,610
you’re being too dramatic.

230
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,614
Here, take this.

231
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,200
I’ll go ahead.

232
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,617
Wait.

233
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,951
Let me walk with you.

234
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,732
No. It’s fine.

235
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,582
I can go home on my own.

236
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,999
Nope.

237
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,292
Hold on.

238
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:19,818
I’ll walk you.

239
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,968
Because, well,

240
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,349
there are lots of muggers in our area.

241
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,396
And you guys just won, right?

242
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,973
That’s risky.

243
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,189
Okay.

244
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,982
Alright.

245
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,324
Let’s go.

246
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,706
My dearest Don Juan.

247
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:54,999
Oh,

248
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,754
how my soul yearns for you.

249
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,968
And now you shall be mine.

250
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,347
And I shall be yours until the end of time.

251
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,892
Fortune smiles upon me.

252
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,020
Now I am the happiest

253
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,773
maiden in the kingdom of Berbania.

254
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,773
I object!

255
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,985
And who are you?

256
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,364
Don Juan, have you forgotten me?

257
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,033
It is I,

258
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,911
Doña Maria.

259
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,789
I am your one true love,

260
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,416
your soulmate,

261
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,376
your destiny.

262
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,130
Alas, you have been bewitched.

263
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:46,010
Come into my arms and
with one kiss, remember me.

264
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,272
- Congratulations, sis!
- Thank you, sis!

265
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,440
Wow, you were amazing!

266
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,209
I almost didn’t recognize you.

267
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,529
How did you do that?

268
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,447
You know, Lin, I wouldn't even be
here if it weren’t for you.

269
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,736
What are you saying?

270
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,054
I just helped you with your grades.

271
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,786
It was your hard work and
talent that got you here.

272
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,539
- You deserve all this.
- Thanks, sis!

273
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,167
- Congratulations, you were really great!
- Thank you!

274
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,476
You were so good!

275
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,753
Like seriously, so impressive...

276
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,771
Ah, congrats, hon!

277
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,214
Can I get a fansign?

278
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,841
Oh, hon!

279
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,884
Thank you!

280
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,594
You were so good earlier.

281
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,112
I'm so proud of you.

282
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,155
Thank you!

283
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,842
But seriously, hon?

284
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,517
I kind of stuttered a bit.

285
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:36,560
Sheesh!

286
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,728
So humble!

287
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,730
Show Lin your crying-on-cue trick.

288
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,428
Lin, look at this.

289
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,108
Okay.

290
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,266
I knew it.

291
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,060
Eye drops who?

292
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,881
How’d you even do that?

293
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,857
See?

294
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,817
Wait.

295
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,528
Are you pinching yourself?

296
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,741
That’s impressive!

297
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,327
So that’s how you’re able to cry!

298
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:43,961
Thank you, thank you.

299
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,341
Hon, just ignore Claire.

300
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,343
She’s overrated anyway.

301
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,929
You’re way better than her, for sure.

302
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,890
And I’m sure your time will come, sis.

303
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,627
Maybe in the next play,
you’ll get the lead role.

304
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,395
Auditions are coming up, right?

305
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,665
I doubt it.

306
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,817
Claire has more experience than me.

307
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,616
But, you know,

308
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,702
I’m really grateful because I have you guys

309
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,579
to support me in my theater era.

310
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,709
If only my mom was here to see this.

311
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,795
Hon, I'm sure she's
watching the whole time.

312
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,923
Yeah.

313
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:32,735
You did so good.

314
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,553
You did it!

315
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,265
I’ll always be your fan babe.

316
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,020
Hey, take a photo, you guys.

317
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,286
Hon,

318
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,871
is it okay now?

319
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,956
It’s okay now, hon.

320
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,925
Dad doesn’t like me wearing makeup.

321
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,480
He might just think I'm

322
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,089
in a school play again.

323
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,385
You know, you’re really lucky.

324
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,349
You can ask anything from your dad
and he will literally give it to you.

325
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:27,856
My dad will give me everything
I want just to shut me up

326
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,526
so he doesn't have to talk to me.

327
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,946
Well, you are a drama king yourself.

328
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,660
That’s why we’re the perfect match.

329
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:41,862
Okay, last one.

330
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,538
Oh, again.

331
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:44,854
How do I look?

332
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,652
Like you just came from making out.

333
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,629
Pat, no.

334
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,382
My dad might see us.

335
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,718
He’s not even here.

336
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,012
Well, you know that I'm not ready.

337
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:07,151
Look,

338
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,566
you know that I just
want my first time to be special.

339
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,860
As promised, right?

340
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,988
We will wait until the time is right.

341
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,617
Not like I have a choice.

342
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,579
What did you say?

343
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,538
Nothing.

344
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,833
I said you’re mine.

345
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,128
Just, don’t go back to the States, okay?

346
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,548
As if.

347
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,800
My dad won’t even leave his business here.

348
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,176
So I’m not going anywhere.

349
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,597
Okay, go.

350
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,639
Before my dad sees us.

351
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,810
Are we just going to keep hiding, hon?

352
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,148
Hon,

353
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,902
I love you very much.

354
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,738
And that’s enough for now, right?

355
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,282
Okay.

356
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,618
I love you too.

357
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,119
Alright.

358
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,136
Attention, grade 11 students.

359
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,390
You will begin your
midterm exams at exactly

360
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,849
10 o’clock.

361
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,604
Only your pencils and erasers are allowed

362
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,898
to be inside the classroom.

363
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,566
Understood?

364
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:38,486
Yes, ma’am.

365
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,282
Lin,

366
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,534
are you okay?

367
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,458
Lin,

368
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,003
don’t make it too obvious.

369
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,379
Just stay chill.

370
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,590
We’ve done this before.

371
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,757
It’s just midterms.

372
00:21:00,817 --> 00:21:01,985
Tioseco!

373
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,903
Dizon!

374
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,054
Estrella!

375
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,013
Quiet please.

376
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,770
Everyone, you will have
two hours to complete the test.

377
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,271
No talking

378
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,649
and absolutely

379
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,734
no cheating.

380
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,290
Begin.

381
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,554
I’m done, Ms. Briones.

382
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,847
Should I just leave this here?

383
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,198
Answer sheet here.

384
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,223
Questionnaire here.

385
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:00,161
Excuse me.

386
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,311
Excuse me.

387
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:02,415
What’s that?

388
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
Mr. Espejo.

389
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:04,699
What’s that?

390
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,289
Do you have something in your hand?

391
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,964
What’s in your hand?

392
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,138
Answer me.

393
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,856
Mr. Espejo, open your hand.

394
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,783
The other hand.

395
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,558
Open it.

396
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,684
I will count to three.

397
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,709
One.

398
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:08,162
Two.

399
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,443
Where did you get this?

400
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,528
Where did you get this?

401
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,906
Espejo, answer.

402
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:40,278
Look at me.

403
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,405
Mr. Espejo, look at me!

404
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,334
If you don't tell the truth,

405
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,835
I have to fail you.

406
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,212
Do you hear me?

407
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,672
Do you hear me?

408
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,672
Look at me!

409
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:52,918
Everybody, listen up!

410
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,137
If Mr. Espejo doesn't confess,

411
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,514
all your classmates

412
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,558
will retake the midterm exams!

413
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,828
Kyle is not a client.

414
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,203
How did that happen?

415
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,833
There's no way he could've
cracked our signals.

416
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,961
So how did he get the answers?

417
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,679
Because someone leaked it.

418
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,732
It wasn't me, bro.

419
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,067
I paid for those answers.

420
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,445
I'm not just gonna share it with anyone.

421
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,323
Especially Kyle.

422
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,824
I don't even know him that well.

423
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,783
He's right.

424
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,829
Varsity and Drama Club Boys don't mix.

425
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,543
Pat,

426
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:10,962
you know me.

427
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,355
Bro, sorry.

428
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,423
But this is serious.

429
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,009
If we never find out who leaked the test,

430
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,177
we're all dead.

431
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,179
Ping, we talked to Thirdy.

432
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,931
We know there’s guesting in the
drama club for your show.

433
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,767
- Kyle's part of it too.
- Lin.

434
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,977
I'm just promoting the school play!

435
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,187
What's so wrong with that?

436
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,730
Ask Grace.

437
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,523
I only interviewed Claire.

438
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,525
Not her sidekicks.

439
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,863
Yes.

440
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,239
That is true.

441
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,992
I'm not the one you're looking for.

442
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,642
I'm not the one who leaked it.

443
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,002
Why so defensive?

444
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,754
- Feeling guilty?
- No.

445
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,356
I promise.

446
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,423
Please believe me.

447
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,758
- Get it together, Ponce.
- I'm innocent!

448
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,276
No need to shout.

449
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,928
Yell at me again and
you’ll fucking regret it.

450
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,653
Don't gang up on me here.

451
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,723
Yes, Kyle's my friend.

452
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,225
I'm not gonna deny that.

453
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,311
But please believe me.

454
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,980
Grace, Lin, please.

455
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,090
I'm innocent.

456
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,527
Hon, just chill out. Okay?

457
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,320
Maybe we should all just

458
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,197
take a breather, right sis?

459
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Lin!

460
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,074
Lin!

461
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,135
Lin!

462
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,278
We’re not done here.

463
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,001
Lin!

464
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Lin!

465
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:35,754
Lin, wait up!

466
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,382
We’re not done yet!

467
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,599
We still don't know who the leak is.

468
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,345
I know, but I hate what’s happening.

469
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:45,390
We can't get to the truth if you
keep threatening them.

470
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,724
Well, no one’s coming clean.

471
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:47,976
What do you want me to do?

472
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,285
Speak nice to them?

473
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:49,978
It’s so frustrating.

474
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,438
I hate being lied to!

475
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,856
We lied too.

476
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,336
We cheated too, remember?

477
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,488
Look, I just need time to myself.

478
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,531
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,616
What are you gonna do?

480
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,077
I just need to think about this on my own.

481
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,370
I'm sorry, okay?

482
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,165
Please.

483
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,085
Okay.

484
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,379
Let's just

485
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,841
give her some space for now.

486
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,138
Bank.

487
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,391
You better just come clean.

488
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,019
For the last time,

489
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,855
were you the one who
gave the answers to Kyle?

490
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,404
For the last time, Miss Briones.

491
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,781
I'm a scholar.

492
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,868
I have never cheated in my life.

493
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:48,108
And I don't need to.

494
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:51,247
So don't you dare
accuse me of that.

495
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,125
Because I would never do that.

496
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:58,947
I'm sorry, Bank. But...

497
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:01,216
I really want to believe you

498
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,717
but someone has to answer for this.

499
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,429
You were seated in front of Kyle.

500
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,933
You were the first to finish the exam.

501
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,143
Everything was correct.

502
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:14,812
Everything.

503
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,440
All the answers from the cheat sheet.

504
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,529
So if it’s not you, then who?

505
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,700
What?

506
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,793
Ayo, theater kids!

507
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,005
Audition for the next
"Wuthering Heights" is coming up

508
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,090
in 10 minutes. Break a leg!

509
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,843
You have nothing to lose, Kyle.

510
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,262
Just tell me who gave you the answers.

511
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,688
Bank.

512
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,649
There you are.

513
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,401
Grace.

514
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,447
I wanted to talk to Kyle.

515
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,573
Alone.

516
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,951
Can’t you see that we’re still talking?

517
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,578
Oh.

518
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,456
You're not going to your audition?

519
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,290
Did you forget?

520
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,005
Uhm, you're right.

521
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,341
Thanks for reminding me.

522
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,724
Sorry, me too.

523
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,226
Drama club’s looking for me.

524
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Hold on.

525
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,450
This won't take long.

526
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,583
If you don’t want this to get worse.

527
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:26,202
Face me now.

528
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,406
I’m not your enemy.

529
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,993
But I’m the one being blamed
for giving you the answers.

530
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,619
Kyle.

531
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,039
We both know that’s not true.

532
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,927
What more do you want, Bank?

533
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,950
I already failed, didn’t I?

534
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:43,461
They already called my parents.

535
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,338
I just want the truth to come out.

536
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,756
Tell the truth.

537
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,466
I’m just a scholar.

538
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,552
So don’t drag me into your mess.

539
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,679
Sorry, Bank.

540
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,567
But I’m not throwing my
friends under the bus

541
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,934
just for you.

542
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,698
Bank.

543
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,741
Bank.

544
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,511
I’ve been looking for you.

545
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,536
Oh.

546
00:33:17,638 --> 00:33:18,638
Me too.

547
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,663
Let’s talk first.

548
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:21,891
This won’t take long, Lin.

549
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,836
Weren’t we the only top scorers
in the midterms exam?

550
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,754
We didn’t need to cheat.

551
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,592
And we definitely won't
give out answers, right?

552
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,632
Right.

553
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,260
Here’s the seat plan.

554
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,153
This is me,

555
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,013
Kyle sits behind me,

556
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,890
then you’re in front of me.

557
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,458
Okay.

558
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,145
But why is Grace’s name here?

559
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,896
What does she have to do with this?

560
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,481
Sorry, Lin.

561
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,527
You might not like what you’re
about to hear but

562
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,363
I have a hunch that Grace

563
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,123
was the one who gave Kyle the answers.

564
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,662
Lin?

565
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,040
There’s a hole in your logic.

566
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,167
Okay, here.

567
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,420
Let’s say the cheat sheet came from Grace.

568
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,338
But Kyle’s too far from her.

569
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,467
Claire and Baz were sitting between them.

570
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,219
I’ve thought of that too.

571
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,013
But it’s also very possible

572
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,307
that Claire and Baz
were involved on the cheating.

573
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,618
Come to think of it,

574
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,936
what do they all have in common?

575
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,620
Drama club.

576
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,277
Exactly.

577
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,823
I also saw Grace talking to
Kyle in secret earlier.

578
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,948
Grace?

579
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:38,408
No way.

580
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,388
Just because they’re all in drama club?

581
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,165
That’s your conclusion?

582
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,837
I'm sorry. I know it hurts hearing
your best friend might be the cheater.

583
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,631
What did they talk about?

584
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,966
I heard earlier

585
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,635
that Grace was asking Kyle

586
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,762
who gave him the answers.

587
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,472
But what’s weird is,

588
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,558
if she wasn’t involved,
why does she seem so interested?

589
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,644
I know Grace better.

590
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,271
And I’m sure she didn’t do it.

591
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,207
Come on, Lin,

592
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,733
let’s be objective here.

593
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,211
I didn’t even want to get involved.

594
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,946
I have nothing to do with this.

595
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:18,783
But I’m being blamed for
something I didn’t do.

596
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,331
I get your point.

597
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,751
It’s not fair that this
is happening to you.

598
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,505
But it’s also not fair to accuse Grace.

599
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,257
Maybe she was just talking to Kyle

600
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:35,633
because she wanted to find out

601
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,926
who gave him the answers.

602
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,885
You’re right.

603
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,265
It’s also unfair to Grace if I accuse her.

604
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,060
I'm sorry, Lin.

605
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,246
I don’t have any proof either.

606
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,647
The logic just made sense.

607
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,651
Maybe just don’t tell her about this.

608
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,402
It's okay.

609
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,487
Let it go.

610
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,782
I'll talk to Grace.

611
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,775
I need your help.

612
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,258
Sis.

613
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,287
What's wrong?

614
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:44,647
What did you want to talk about?

615
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,914
I still can’t believe it.

616
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,290
But it’s just so hard.

617
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,268
But I think you gave the answers to Kyle.

618
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,045
You made the cheat sheet.

619
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,258
You gave it to Claire.

620
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,303
She passed it to Baz.

621
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,306
Then Baz gave it to Kyle.

622
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:07,808
Am I right?

623
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,525
How could you think that of me?

624
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,945
I'm your best friend.

625
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,490
I just want to know.

626
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,075
Why did you do it?

627
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:25,785
But I didn't do it.

628
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,870
I didn't do it.

629
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,640
Sis, please.

630
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,416
You have to believe me.

631
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,129
I want to and I trust you.

632
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,633
But even those who had nothing
to do with it are affected.

633
00:37:55,924 --> 00:37:58,261
I wouldn't do that to you, sis.

634
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,076
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

635
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,890
Calm down, Grace.

636
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,041
Just take a breath.

637
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,835
Breathe, sis.

638
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,336
I'm so sorry.

639
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,713
Maybe I’m wrong, okay?

640
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,297
I believe you, sis.

641
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,966
I'm so sorry.

642
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,845
It's okay.

643
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,596
It’s okay, sis.

644
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,432
Breathe. I'm sorry.

645
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,559
I'm sorry, Grace.

646
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,769
Everything's gonna be okay.

647
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:36,771
Breathe.

648
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,648
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,590
Look at you, you're such a crybaby.

650
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:04,744
Hon?

651
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:14,810
Hey, Tony boy.

652
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:19,148
Tell them what you told me earlier, okay?

653
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,278
Guys.

654
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:29,134
The cheat sheet came from me.

655
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,520
I was the one who leaked it.

656
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,960
I told Kyle that you
were giving out answers.

657
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,546
So he asked me for help.

658
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,132
Then he pulled in Claire and Baz.

659
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,303
I knew we couldn't
trust you, you little bitch.

660
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,473
Tony.

661
00:39:56,393 --> 00:39:57,686
When we asked you,

662
00:39:58,444 --> 00:39:59,444
you denied it.

663
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,190
Why the change of heart?

664
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,319
Well, it’s because...

665
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,421
Because, Lin,

666
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:10,157
I knew you’d all figure
out the truth anyway.

667
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,636
Also, Lin,

668
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,870
I’m just tired.

669
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,498
I didn’t want to lie to you anymore.

670
00:40:17,523 --> 00:40:18,524
Oh, really?

671
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,101
Did you know?

672
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,919
Your guilt means nothing now.

673
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,672
Even Bank, who had nothing
to do with it, got blamed.

674
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,049
You should be the one
held accountable, not him.

675
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,424
Lin.

676
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,971
It won’t happen again, I swear.

677
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Fine.

678
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,435
Then tell Miss Briones
you made the cheat sheet.

679
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:39,770
Tell her that

680
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,439
you got the questionnaire
before the exam started.

681
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,275
Wait, Lin.

682
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,236
I think you should just
think this through first.

683
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,238
I don't think that's a good idea.

684
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,031
I agree, Lin.

685
00:40:51,632 --> 00:40:54,326
I know we should teach
this idiot a lesson, but

686
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:56,620
snitching ain't it.

687
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,290
Everyone’s moving on already.

688
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,734
Yeah. Pat is right.

689
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,629
If they question Baz and Kyle

690
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,260
and even Claire, then they'll

691
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,469
tell on us too.

692
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,237
Probably.

693
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,572
You know, it was...

694
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,866
it was really suspicious on your end.

695
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,101
You know, how did you
find out that it was Tony?

696
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:24,991
Right?

697
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,027
Okay, Lin.

698
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,052
Look.

699
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,988
I spoke to Kyle.

700
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,867
He's the only one who got
an 'F' on midterms.

701
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,873
All of us and even Bank,

702
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,247
we are safe.

703
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,290
We're safe.

704
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,419
Yeah?

705
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,215
Alright.

706
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:52,634
But Tony,

707
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,429
if this issue comes back,

708
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:57,681
you better own up to it.

709
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,441
First of all,

710
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,361
I just want to thank all the auditionees.

711
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,858
Give yourselves a round of applause.

712
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,746
I am so excited to announce to you
our production's rendition of

713
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,249
Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë.

714
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,030
Without further ado,

715
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,168
let’s do it!

716
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,647
Don't worry, hon.

717
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,298
I know you'll get the lead role.

718
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,261
For the role of Catherine Earnshaw,

719
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,639
who do you think is our sad girl lead?

720
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,517
Let's hear a drumroll, guys!

721
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,274
Congratulations,

722
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,820
Claire O'Reilly.

723
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,780
Oh, it's me.

724
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,576
Are you serious? Her?

725
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,287
This is bullshit.

726
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,838
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Baz.

727
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,459
Hon,

728
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,546
I'm sure you're gonna get another role.

729
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,505
It's okay.

730
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,305
But it's not the lead role.

731
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,141
Up next,

732
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:25,459
playing the role of Ellen "Nelly" Dean,

733
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,896
our narrator will be

734
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,568
Grace Dizon.

735
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,446
I told you. You got this.

736
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,031
Congrats, hon.

737
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,497
Good luck.

738
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,749
Congratulations.

739
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,088
Claire!

740
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,136
We had a deal, right?

741
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,180
If I gave you the test answers,

742
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,516
you said that you won’t audition
for the lead role.

743
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:07,853
Here’s the thing.

744
00:44:09,015 --> 00:44:10,767
You offered first, Grace.

745
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,400
You didn’t even give me a choice.

746
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,444
You just thought we had a deal,

747
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,071
but did you ever hear me say yes?

748
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:19,823
You liar!

749
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,701
And to make things worse,

750
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,871
you shared it,
you passed it with other people!

751
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,665
That was just for you, Claire.

752
00:44:28,665 --> 00:44:30,209
Just for you.

753
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,311
That was not part of the deal.

754
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,254
How could you do this to me?

755
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:35,572
They’re my friends.

756
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,592
So what's it to you
if I helped them out?

757
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,637
Also,

758
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,930
I didn’t ask for the lead role.

759
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,057
Baz gave it to me.

760
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,724
So if,

761
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,012
you have a problem with that,

762
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:51,730
just accept it.

763
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:53,690
Stop being so bitter.

764
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,360
You traitor!

765
00:44:57,637 --> 00:44:58,637
Really?

766
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,989
That’s coming from you?

767
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:03,158
Don’t you feel bad for Lin?

768
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:05,177
Or Pat?

769
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,412
Your boyfriend?

770
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:10,499
You lied to them just to get the lead part?

771
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,876
So if there's a traitor here,

772
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:15,379
it's you, Grace.

773
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,963
Grace, what was that?

774
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,966
What was that?

775
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,634
Just come here.

776
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,844
Can you talk to me?

777
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,763
Grace, what’s wrong?

778
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,222
I need your help.

779
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,533
Huh?

780
00:46:09,573 --> 00:46:10,741
What happened?

781
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,185
Did you do something?

782
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,396
Grace?

783
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,072
Hey, Grace!

784
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,369
I need your help.

785
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,997
Why, what happened?

786
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,548
Did you do something?

787
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:40,922
Grace?

788
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,886
The cheat sheet came from me.

789
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:48,679
What?

790
00:46:50,127 --> 00:46:51,211
I know.

791
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,352
And I'm so sorry.

792
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,024
Why did you do it?

793
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,740
I just wanted to pass it to Claire.

794
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,408
Just to her.

795
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,952
But then she shared it with the other

796
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,371
drama club members including Kyle.

797
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,379
And I just wanted to get the lead part.

798
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,675
I just wanted the lead part.

799
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:29,513
If I give Claire the answers,
then she won't audition.

800
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,765
And it is the only way.

801
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:41,857
Tony,

802
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,905
don't tell anyone, please.

803
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,700
I can't tell Lin and not even Pat.

804
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,243
They would not forgive me.

805
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,037
You need to help me.

806
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:55,789
Please.

807
00:47:57,367 --> 00:47:58,374
Fine.

808
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,794
What do I have to do?

809
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,890
I need you to admit to Lin and Pat

810
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,223
that you gave Kyle the answers.

811
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,599
What?

812
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,518
That's hard, Grace.

813
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:18,770
Tony, please.

814
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,583
Please, I'll make sure that they
won't tell any of our parents

815
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:23,734
or our teachers.

816
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:25,386
The worst that could happen is that

817
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:27,195
they’ll just get mad at you.

818
00:48:27,632 --> 00:48:29,197
But once this is all done,

819
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,241
they'll forget about it.

820
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,077
And Pat and Lin, they won't
do anything to you either

821
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,079
because that would implicate them too.

822
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,208
Tony, please.

823
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,003
Please.

824
00:48:49,473 --> 00:48:50,473
Before,

825
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,639
you just kept avoiding me.

826
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,602
No matter how hard I tried
to get close to you,

827
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:00,562
you push me away.

828
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,278
But,

829
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,198
I love Pat.

830
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,579
Then go ask him for help.

831
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,748
What do you take me for?

832
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:21,375
Wait.

833
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,584
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

834
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,251
Tony.

835
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,252
Tony, please, please.

836
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:25,629
I'll do anything that you want.

837
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,506
Please, I just, I need you to help me.

838
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,256
I'm begging you.

839
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,549
Please.

840
00:49:30,497 --> 00:49:31,310
Please.

841
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,343
Please help me.

842
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,694
I just want one thing.

843
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:02,833
We need to start looking for clients now.

844
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:04,916
Can you handle that, Pat?

845
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,210
What?

846
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:07,862
Happy anniversary, hon.

847
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:09,428
Hon, I'm ready.

848
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:12,363
Sir, I’ll go pick up my girlfriend

849
00:50:12,527 --> 00:50:15,154
She was just here earlier,
but isn’t answering.

850
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,440
The, uh, audition?

851
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,014
Sir, what audition?

852
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:19,975
There’s no audition happening here.

853
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,996
- Oh, here are your copies.
- Alright.

854
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:24,517
- Let’s just meet at the library first.
- Sure, game.

855
00:50:24,542 --> 00:50:26,350
Perfect timing,
I was gonna tell you something.

856
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,899
- What is it?
- I like you.

857
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,276
Did she send a code?

858
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,402
Miss Briones, I think there’s

859
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,487
something wrong with the speakers.
