1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,406
Good morning, ma'am.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,866
Thank you for accepting me
into your scholarship program.

3
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,184
The school is really big,

4
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,120
the facilities are nice,

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,043
but the culture of the
students here is different.

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,916
I know we just met,

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,694
but I was wondering
if you could help me?

8
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:29,890
I want in.

9
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,049
I want you to share your
answers with me just like with Grace.

10
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,577
Dad, can you please
explain what this is?

11
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:36,928
Lin,

12
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:37,954
open your eyes.

13
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:42,034
We’re already competitors in
the scholarship until we graduate.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,085
So there will be
winners and losers.

15
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,664
Deal with it.

16
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:46,396
You’re right

17
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,840
if the school is profiting from us.

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,426
Then let’s profit from them, too.

19
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:02,258
Even if what you’re saying
is true, I’ll still fight fair.

20
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:03,824
I’m not like you.

21
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,815
Hon, come here.

22
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,244
Grace?

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,175
Are you home already?

24
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,827
Sorry, I forgot to text you.

25
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,154
But yeah, I’m home.

26
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,406
After everything I’ve done
for her, she was the first

27
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,533
girl I ever took seriously,
and then she does this to me?

28
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,676
Sorry, I’m so sorry.

29
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,723
Grace!

30
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,995
Don’t make a fool out of me.

31
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,880
Grace!

32
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,124
Don’t you wonder why
I suddenly admitted that

33
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:25,084
I was the one who leaked
the answers to our exam?

34
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:29,088
Grace was the one who leaked
it, that’s how it reached Kyle.

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,757
You’re really good
at acting, huh?

36
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,717
You already fooled me once.

37
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,611
Have some mercy on me.

38
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,347
I leaked the answers
to help others.

39
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:42,249
Linette Estrella, you are suspended
for the rest of the semester.

40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,205
This is it!

41
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,773
Wow, we’ve really
come a long way, huh?

42
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,462
Before we begin,
some simple rules.

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,926
Fill up every blank in your
information sheet as well as

44
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:01,135
every blank in
your answer sheet.

45
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,749
I didn’t realize I was an
accomplice in a cheating scheme.

46
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,050
Leaving the premises
is absolutely forbidden.

47
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,515
Failure to comply
with these simple rules

48
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,243
would lead

49
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,016
to the immediate
cancellation of your score.

50
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,694
Miss, please open the door.

51
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,907
Miss, we’re gonna
count till three.

52
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,577
One.

53
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,761
What am I, stupid?

54
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,454
I won’t let that bastard
order me around!

55
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,831
Two.

56
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,765
Son of a bitch!

57
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,083
Pat, just stop!

58
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,256
You are the reason why this
mess started in the first place.

59
00:03:45,932 --> 00:03:50,411
Rhea, so integrity refers to doing
what’s right based on your values,

60
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,524
while honor is about
how others respect you.

61
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,711
For example,

62
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,238
integrity is acting honestly,

63
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,759
and honor is
recognition that you earn.

64
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,620
Can you please try
using integrity and honor

65
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,580
in different sentences
for me, Rhea?

66
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,006
Rhea, can you
please stop doodling?

67
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,637
Teach, how many minutes
left before we finish?

68
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,136
Rhea, as I’ve said,

69
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,180
please speak to
me only in English

70
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,766
during our tutorial
lessons for practice.

71
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,672
Fine, in English.

72
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,688
How many minutes
before we end this?

73
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,609
You know what, Rhea?

74
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,239
If you’re too lazy to study, then
maybe you shouldn’t have gotten a tutor.

75
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,123
It’s just a waste of your
parents’ money, right?

76
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:45,775
Didn’t you ever think of that?

77
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,138
You know what, never mind.

78
00:04:52,163 --> 00:04:53,331
Let’s just continue.

79
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:57,529
Sorry to disrupt your session.

80
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,856
Lin,

81
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,258
can I have a word
with you, please?

82
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,718
Ah yes, Ms. Maya.

83
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,392
Yes, Ms. Maya?

84
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,276
What is it?

85
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,206
Yes?

86
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,775
I noticed that you
called out the client.

87
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,945
Ah, yes, um, because
she was misbehaving

88
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,238
so I just decided to tell—

89
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,251
I know, I know.

90
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,366
You don’t need to explain.

91
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,454
But please, don’t do
that to your clients.

92
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,080
Not just with Rhea.

93
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,207
There have been
other complaints.

94
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,418
You just started here.

95
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:37,748
Just focus on doing your job.

96
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,477
But I am doing my job.

97
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,091
That includes calling
out students when they’re

98
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,218
evidently being rude or lazy.

99
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,763
That’s not really done here.

100
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:48,847
Why, ma’am?

101
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,727
Usually the teacher tells the students
when they’re not listening to them.

102
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,064
Why can’t I do that?

103
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,858
First of all,

104
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,943
you’re a paid tutor,

105
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,528
not a teacher.

106
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,742
You are being paid to tutor a
client based on their specific needs.

107
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,997
But what if they need discipline?

108
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,292
Ms. Maya, I just want to
make sure that my clients

109
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:20,591
actually learn something so the money
of their parents doesn’t go to waste.

110
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,177
It’s not your concern if
their money is wasted.

111
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,764
What matters is we’re being paid.

112
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,364
It’s not your concern
whether or not

113
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:34,143
the result of your tutoring is good.

114
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,983
But they’re paying for our services
and yet they’re not learning?

115
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,656
I’m sorry, Ms. Maya,
but isn’t that unfair?

116
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:50,450
Why, Lin?

117
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,802
Since when has the
world ever been fair?

118
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,919
Choose your battles, Lin.

119
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:57,612
The world is already
complicated enough.

120
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,757
Don’t make things
harder for yourself.

121
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,231
Thank you.

122
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,612
Get some rest now.

123
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,186
Do you need help?

124
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,838
No, I’m good.

125
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,872
Thanks.

126
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:33,803
Okay then.

127
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,218
Goodnight, Dad.

128
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,867
Mom?

129
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,803
Lin?

130
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,842
My child?

131
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,711
I’m so happy to
hear your voice again.

132
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,589
How are you? How was your day?

133
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,902
My child?

134
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,846
Are you okay?

135
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,306
Do you have a problem?

136
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:19,637
It’s nothing, Mom.

137
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,352
Are you sure?

138
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,864
My child,

139
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,110
I understand if you’re
not ready to share yet

140
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:31,722
but I want you to know that if
ever you need someone to talk to,

141
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,316
I’m always here
whenever you need me.

142
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,370
Okay?

143
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:47,478
If only I could,

144
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,880
I would carry you myself.

145
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,468
Because I know that’s the only
way I could ever comfort you.

146
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,149
Oh, Mom.

147
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,807
You know, when
you were still a baby,

148
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,917
you cried a lot.

149
00:10:01,942 --> 00:10:05,362
You always wanted me to
carry you, to hold you in my arms.

150
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,989
And whenever I put you
down, you’d cry again.

151
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,769
Well, it’s because

152
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,944
I really thought

153
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:15,791
you were just a clingy baby
but I realized the reason was,

154
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,790
you wanted me to carry you so

155
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:22,832
you could watch everything
happening around you, always observing.

156
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,586
Because of course, if you
were just left in the crib, right,

157
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:32,965
all you’d see were the
ceiling and the walls.

158
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,678
Oh, my child, even
when you were young,

159
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,350
it’s like you were already
ready to face the world and

160
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:48,647
I’m so happy because you
grew up smart and brave.

161
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:52,851
It’s really amazing to think

162
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,509
that now, you’ve
grown so much and

163
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:57,573
look at you, so brave,
you’re very strong,

164
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,824
you’re very tough,

165
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,598
and I’m so proud
of you, my child.

166
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,497
You know what, Mom,

167
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,459
I don’t remember the
things you’re saying.

168
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,044
But,

169
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,339
what I do remember

170
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,718
is when I was five
years old, how I cried.

171
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,431
How I cried when I saw that

172
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,558
your clothes were
gone from the cabinet.

173
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,980
When I realized that what Dad said
was true, that you weren’t coming back.

174
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,456
Lin,

175
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:38,465
that’s not true.

176
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,537
You know, what happened was,

177
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,289
I really, really did
mean to come back.

178
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,974
Okay?

179
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,795
My contract at the school,
it was only for two years.

180
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,466
But I was definitely coming back
because I was going to get you.

181
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,554
But then, your dad didn’t
want to, he wouldn’t allow it,

182
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,180
he wouldn’t give you to me.

183
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,683
And I can’t blame him because

184
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,978
of course, he was
angry at me since

185
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,421
I was the one who left, I
was the one who ended it.

186
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:16,772
My child,

187
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,364
I’m trying.

188
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,507
I hope it was worth it

189
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,019
whoever you chose over us.

190
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:33,480
Was it, Mom?

191
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,508
Was it?

192
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,263
My child, I don’t think
that’s a fair question.

193
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,213
When has the
world ever been fair?

194
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:54,774
Lin?

195
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:01,759
I don’t think you called
to reminisce, Mom.

196
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,965
Did you have something to say?

197
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,706
Nothing really.

198
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,545
I just really wanted to
congratulate you personally.

199
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,882
Because you’re now
studying at Possenti,

200
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,218
and I’m so proud of you

201
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,139
because you got into a prestigious
school with a scholarship.

202
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,479
My child, do you need anything?

203
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,982
Like, do you need me to buy
something for school, for this sem

204
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,926
or for the next sem?

205
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,005
Just let me know.

206
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,239
No need, Mom.

207
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,213
All good.

208
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,270
Mommy, let’s go.

209
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,546
Why are you taking so long?

210
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:48,609
Wait, baby.

211
00:13:48,609 --> 00:13:49,860
Just wait, I’ll be there.

212
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,957
I’ll be out there.

213
00:13:51,737 --> 00:13:52,917
Sorry.

214
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:53,484
Sorry, my child.

215
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:54,461
Sorry about that.

216
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:56,695
Go on, Mom.

217
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,740
They’re waiting for you.

218
00:14:02,868 --> 00:14:03,880
Are you sure?

219
00:14:04,537 --> 00:14:05,538
Are you okay?

220
00:14:08,136 --> 00:14:09,143
Bye.

221
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,149
Please get the checks
ready to be released.

222
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,582
Yes, sir. Copy.

223
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:33,982
Good.

224
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:39,369
Grace, can you please double
check the design for our pencil.

225
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,591
Then compare it to the
mock-up from our artist.

226
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:43,616
Alright?

227
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:44,802
Then after that,

228
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,512
the next step is very important.

229
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:49,331
The size needs to match.

230
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:49,974
Okay?

231
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:55,170
The size must match the PSD
format of the mock-up design.

232
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,397
Alright?

233
00:14:56,422 --> 00:14:58,910
Then after that, put
in the sample for me,

234
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:01,051
then give it to
me and that’s it.

235
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:03,044
Got it?

236
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:09,518
Wait, sorry.

237
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:10,518
Grace,

238
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,314
it’s only hard at the beginning.

239
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:14,773
But you’ll get used to it.

240
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Okay?

241
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:21,029
Okay.

242
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,323
You got this.

243
00:15:22,323 --> 00:15:25,868
Sir, the room is ready
for the next meeting.

244
00:15:25,868 --> 00:15:26,994
Okay. Great.

245
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:28,236
Thank you.

246
00:15:37,087 --> 00:15:38,087
So?

247
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:40,341
You take care of this first.

248
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:42,151
Yeah.

249
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:43,349
I got it.

250
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:44,616
You can handle it. Okay?

251
00:16:34,144 --> 00:16:35,187
Hi.

252
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:38,691
How are you, hon?

253
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:44,845
Pat.

254
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,323
Sorry.

255
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,255
Thanks for inviting
me to meet up.

256
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:02,214
I really wanted
to talk about us.

257
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,298
Don’t get your hopes up.

258
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:06,510
It was my dad’s idea to
invite you here to dinner.

259
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:08,555
He wants to talk to you.

260
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:12,349
Uh, your dad, why?

261
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:13,749
The hell do I know?

262
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,561
I’m just following orders.

263
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,458
Does your dad know that we’re…

264
00:17:21,483 --> 00:17:22,496
No.

265
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:24,166
He doesn’t know.

266
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:26,726
So don’t tell him.

267
00:17:27,698 --> 00:17:30,242
- Well, well, well.
- Uncle Philip.

268
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,827
Is that you, Grace?

269
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:34,586
Hi.

270
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,206
Hi, Uncle.

271
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,946
Look at you.

272
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,084
It’s so good to see you.

273
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:42,229
You too.

274
00:17:42,254 --> 00:17:43,284
Thank God.

275
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,773
And by the way, thank you

276
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,301
for your terrific
influence on my son here.

277
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,511
He’s doing fantastic in school.

278
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,708
Uh, yes, Uncle.

279
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:53,056
Anything for Pat.

280
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:55,726
You’re very kind, Grace.

281
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,047
So, let’s eat.

282
00:17:58,437 --> 00:17:59,437
Sit. Sit.

283
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:17,623
So how are your parents, Grace?

284
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:21,891
Oh, um, I just live with my dad.

285
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,879
My mom passed
away when I was 13.

286
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,316
Dad, uh, remember I told you
about Grace’s parents, right?

287
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:28,467
Sorry, sorry.

288
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,676
It just slipped my mind.

289
00:18:29,802 --> 00:18:30,886
It’s okay, Uncle.

290
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,805
So you live with your father?

291
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:36,241
If you don’t mind,
what does he do?

292
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,977
He owns a printing
press company.

293
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:39,066
Wow.

294
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:40,229
Salute to him.

295
00:18:40,229 --> 00:18:41,989
A single father
and a businessman.

296
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,360
And he successfully raised a
beautiful and smart daughter.

297
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,365
I need to invite him for a
whiskey night one of these days

298
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:55,202
So we can talk business and all
about business-minded people.

299
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,156
Sure.

300
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:58,427
You know,

301
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,477
my family,

302
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,835
we weren’t always this well-off.

303
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,987
My father was a
small-time businessman.

304
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,798
He sold steel for construction.

305
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,091
And I was his assistant.

306
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,385
I looked up to him.

307
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,222
He taught me the value of
hard work and determination.

308
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:19,685
That’s why I worked hard
to reach my current status.

309
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,228
It’s because of his teachings.

310
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:24,439
And I’m passing on
those lessons to Pat here

311
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:28,151
so he’ll work hard even if he
didn’t experience our hardships.

312
00:19:29,528 --> 00:19:31,467
Success is sweeter

313
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:33,615
when it’s earned
through hard work.

314
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:34,792
Right, son?

315
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:35,935
Yes, Dad.

316
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:38,553
That’s why I’m so proud of him.

317
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,348
His improvement in school is

318
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,415
dramatic.

319
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,710
And that’s thanks to you, Grace.

320
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,505
Actually, I didn’t
just invite you here

321
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:50,173
for a delicious dinner, Grace.

322
00:19:50,173 --> 00:19:52,217
I wanted to give you
something special.

323
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:55,929
Something that would show
you how much I appreciate

324
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,431
what you’ve done for my son.

325
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:05,647
I want you, Grace,

326
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:08,108
to go with Pat

327
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:11,320
to study at Boston University.

328
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,280
I’ll cover all the expenses.

329
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:14,464
Dad,

330
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:15,532
isn’t that a bit,

331
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,676
sudden? I mean,

332
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:19,202
- Grace has to think about it.
- I know.

333
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:20,078
I’m sorry.

334
00:20:20,078 --> 00:20:22,289
It’s a big decision.

335
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:24,333
But don’t worry.

336
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,959
I’ll talk to your father.

337
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,377
And I’m sure he’ll
come on board.

338
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,464
Who would say no to an
opportunity like this, right?

339
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,092
What do you think, Grace?

340
00:20:43,931 --> 00:20:44,960
Uncle,

341
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,387
I don’t need any
more time to think.

342
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:50,822
I’ve already made my decision.

343
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:04,831
Why did you say that?

344
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,917
Why did you accept Boston?

345
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,160
Are you really that selfish?

346
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,321
You’ll do everything
just to get what you want?

347
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:13,004
First with Tony, now this?

348
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,096
For God’s sake,

349
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:23,266
how many times
do I have to tell you?

350
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,686
I don’t love Tony.

351
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,815
I was just scared
to face all of you.

352
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:31,501
I was scared to face Lin.

353
00:21:32,317 --> 00:21:34,069
But especially you.

354
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:37,906
Grace, I’m done with your drama.

355
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,968
I don’t want this anymore.

356
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:43,453
Then why didn’t you tell
your dad that we’re broken up?

357
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:46,881
Look,

358
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,003
I know that you’re
angry with me.

359
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:55,924
I can feel it.

360
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:00,387
But deep down, I know
that you still love me.

361
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,152
Pat,

362
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:15,195
I just said yes to your dad’s
offer for me to study in Boston

363
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:20,693
because I know that that is the
only way that I can be with you.

364
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,895
I still love you, Pat.

365
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,333
But I don’t,

366
00:22:37,966 --> 00:22:39,217
I don’t love you, Grace.

367
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,538
I don’t believe you.

368
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,831
Believe what you
wanna believe, Grace.

369
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,309
Yes, I loved you.

370
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,728
But you hurt me.

371
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:51,642
You lied to my face.

372
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:55,901
How can I love you after that?

373
00:22:59,905 --> 00:23:01,125
You know what you destroyed?

374
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:05,540
Trust.

375
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:08,789
Trust, Grace.

376
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,586
Did you ever really love me?

377
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,762
Because me…

378
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,541
Yes, I did.

379
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:27,778
But you?

380
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:29,982
Huh?

381
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:33,015
What, after just one mistake?

382
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:38,144
One mistake, and it’s so easy for
you to just throw away everything

383
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,529
that we have been through.

384
00:23:50,664 --> 00:23:51,664
Fine,

385
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,212
if you wanna end this right now

386
00:23:57,212 --> 00:23:59,047
then admit to your
dad that we’re over.

387
00:24:03,593 --> 00:24:07,013
It’ll only mean that you
don’t love me anymore.

388
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:15,647
I’ll understand.

389
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:23,071
I don’t wanna force myself onto
someone that doesn’t want me.

390
00:24:25,448 --> 00:24:26,491
I don’t.

391
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,516
For this month’s payment.

392
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,435
Thank you, Ms. Maya.

393
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,936
Let's talk tomorrow.

394
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:56,396
There's a new
client that came in.

395
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,096
Ms. Maya,

396
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:02,616
Yes?

397
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:08,408
Is it still possible for my salary to
increase if I can get more clients?

398
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:10,926
I just need to pay for
something at home.

399
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:12,537
How much do you need?

400
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,126
Sounds like a big amount.

401
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:19,461
100,000?

402
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:22,797
150

403
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:27,527
Oh my god!

404
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,762
200,000?

405
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:33,642
300,000.00

406
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:37,520
That's huge!

407
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,607
You're still young but you
already have a mind that big.

408
00:25:41,524 --> 00:25:42,594
Well, that's

409
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:46,238
one and a half year of tutoring
stubborn students if you want.

410
00:25:46,351 --> 00:25:49,373
What if you double or triple
the clients you sign me?

411
00:25:50,992 --> 00:25:52,327
That's not possible, Lin.

412
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:54,454
The amount you need

413
00:25:54,454 --> 00:25:57,290
is equal to the total
clients we have in a month.

414
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,269
And I can't possibly
give you all of our clients.

415
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:01,962
You're not the only tutor here.

416
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:04,089
Do you have other
jobs you can recommend

417
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:07,717
so I can earn that amount in
a span of one to two months?

418
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:11,179
If regular tutoring, none.

419
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:13,347
But,

420
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:16,487
unless

421
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,354
you want to consider
what I have in mind?

422
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:21,456
I have a client

423
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:25,902
who needs a stand-in for the Standard
Test for International Colleges exam.

424
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,655
Stand-in means

425
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,764
the exam is under
the client’s name

426
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:33,113
but you’re the one who will
go to the STIC center

427
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:35,599
to answer the exam for them.

428
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,481
That’s one sitting,
250,000 flat.

429
00:26:41,084 --> 00:26:42,961
And maybe the 50,000 shortfall,

430
00:26:42,961 --> 00:26:45,171
you can cover with
your regular tutoring.

431
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:54,133
I’m sorry, Ms. Maya.

432
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,371
But,

433
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:58,893
why did you suggest
this kind of job to me?

434
00:26:58,893 --> 00:27:00,228
Lin,

435
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:03,440
let’s not pretend here.

436
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:04,797
I know

437
00:27:05,728 --> 00:27:08,122
that you had a cheating
record in your school.

438
00:27:08,862 --> 00:27:10,447
I already did a
background check on you.

439
00:27:11,906 --> 00:27:13,742
Yes, but don’t worry.

440
00:27:14,242 --> 00:27:15,410
I don’t judge.

441
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,453
I don’t care.

442
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:18,288
That’s why I still
took you in, right?

443
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:21,683
All I’m saying is, here you are.

444
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:26,540
Asking for my help to find
you a job for instant money.

445
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:29,883
I only suggested the
best and only option.

446
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:33,048
But it’s still up to you,
whether you accept it or not.

447
00:27:33,338 --> 00:27:34,338
Okay?

448
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,017
I don’t want to do
something wrong again.

449
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:40,477
Suit yourself.

450
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:42,633
But think about it still.

451
00:27:43,188 --> 00:27:45,940
And if you change your
mind, just let me know.

452
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,044
Integrity here in Possenti?

453
00:27:51,351 --> 00:27:52,197
Since when?

454
00:27:52,197 --> 00:27:54,574
How much do you
charge our parents?

455
00:27:55,035 --> 00:27:57,204
How many bribes have
gone through this office?

456
00:27:57,994 --> 00:27:59,621
The world is already
too complicated.

457
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:02,248
Don’t make it
harder for yourself.

458
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,251
Son, do you need anything?

459
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,462
Like, do you need me to
buy something for school

460
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:09,964
for this sem or the next sem?

461
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:12,050
No need, Ma. I’m okay.

462
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:15,324
Papa and I are okay
here. Okay, Ma?

463
00:28:18,473 --> 00:28:19,473
Ms. Maya,

464
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:25,063
I’ll accept your offer.

465
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,245
Kuya sorry, I think I
went to the wrong place.

466
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:42,622
You said secret
guardian, ma’am, right?

467
00:28:42,956 --> 00:28:43,972
This is it.

468
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:45,542
Okay, thank you.

469
00:29:22,662 --> 00:29:23,667
So,

470
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,375
why are you here?

471
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:33,993
Do you work with Ms. Maya?

472
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,139
Look,

473
00:29:42,974 --> 00:29:43,974
I’m sorry.

474
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:45,767
I didn’t know.

475
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:48,559
If you want, I can message
Ms. Maya right now

476
00:29:48,938 --> 00:29:52,275
and I can ask her for
recommendations for other stand-ins.

477
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:58,197
Grace,

478
00:30:01,576 --> 00:30:02,576
it’s okay.

479
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,325
We’re already here.

480
00:30:06,612 --> 00:30:07,612
It’s okay.

481
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:10,792
Okay.

482
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:24,558
So, how are you, Lin?

483
00:30:27,644 --> 00:30:28,686
I’m fine.

484
00:30:47,997 --> 00:30:49,123
So, how does this work?

485
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:53,586
What do I need to do?

486
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:55,629
So,

487
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:57,715
basically,

488
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:01,903
Pat's dad wants to send
me to Boston to study and

489
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:04,055
he wants me and Pat
to go there together.

490
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:06,974
But

491
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,211
before we do head there,

492
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,572
we need to pass the STIC exam.

493
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,151
That’s why I need your help.

494
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,910
But

495
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:30,957
Pat already has his own stand-in,

496
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:35,628
but he's in the next
batch, so he let me go first.

497
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,257
So, are you and Pat okay now?

498
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,065
Yeah.

499
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,761
Pat and I are okay.

500
00:31:45,213 --> 00:31:46,213
That's good.

501
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:53,021
I hope we will be too.

502
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:03,947
Look,

503
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,493
if you feel like
you're being forced,

504
00:32:07,683 --> 00:32:09,258
you can back out anytime.

505
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,496
It's okay.

506
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,726
Just think of me as your stand-in.

507
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,710
That's all.

508
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:20,965
So, tell me.

509
00:32:25,303 --> 00:32:26,596
What should I do?

510
00:32:29,098 --> 00:32:30,099
Ms. Maya said,

511
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:32,518
you should memorize
all of my information.

512
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,990
- Next please.
- So, you're prepared if anyone asks.

513
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:37,442
The photo is yours,
but the info is mine.

514
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,177
The documents? Passport?

515
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:43,528
Full name?

516
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:45,229
Grace Anne L. Dizon

517
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:47,158
and date of birth?

518
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,661
February 21, 2007.

519
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,019
Okay,

520
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:00,088
you may surrender your
bag and phone over there.

521
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,630
Thank you.

522
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:03,731
Next please.

523
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:09,262
Lin?

524
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:10,347
My child?

525
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:11,619
Hello, Ma.

526
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:13,753
Oh, thank you. You
answered my call.

527
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:16,187
I was just trying my luck.

528
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,330
Ah,

529
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:18,564
why did you call?

530
00:33:18,857 --> 00:33:21,501
Ah, no. Nothing. I just
wanted to check on you again

531
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:24,278
because last time our
conversation was cut short, right?

532
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:25,737
Are you busy?

533
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:28,950
Ah, I’m just at the
STIC Center, Ma.

534
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,077
I’m going to take an exam.

535
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:33,496
It starts at 8:00 a.m. I only
have 50 minutes.

536
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:35,998
Sorry, sorry. I disturbed
you with my call.

537
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,309
Wait a moment, my child.

538
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:40,878
You mentioned STIC?

539
00:33:41,638 --> 00:33:43,640
Why? Are you going
to study abroad?

540
00:33:46,718 --> 00:33:47,443
Child.

541
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:49,595
If you want, you can just
study here in Australia,

542
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,264
the schools here are good.

543
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,686
Then I already mentioned
that to your Uncle Greg because

544
00:33:54,711 --> 00:33:57,798
he has lots of contacts here
who can help you. That’s for sure.

545
00:33:58,649 --> 00:34:00,734
And then, won’t
we be together too?

546
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:03,025
I want to study in the US.

547
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:04,377
Not in Australia anymore.

548
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:08,030
Papa and I can manage.

549
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:11,909
Is that so? Okay.

550
00:34:12,285 --> 00:34:13,536
Okay. Sorry.

551
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,788
I just got excited.

552
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:18,293
Ah, Ma. I have to go.

553
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,501
I’m really sorry. I forgot

554
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:22,670
that it’s 10:50 a.m.
here in Australia.

555
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:25,465
Isn’t it more advanced
here than in the Philippines?

556
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:26,673
Sorry again.

557
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:29,926
Bye.

558
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,744
7:50 a.m. in the Philippines.

559
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,338
10:50 a.m. in Australia.

560
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:52,325
Time zones.

561
00:34:52,876 --> 00:34:54,844
Look at the time
here in the Philippines.

562
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:56,496
It's 12:00 p.m.

563
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:59,332
While in Australia,
it's already 3:00 pm.

564
00:34:59,332 --> 00:35:01,372
Because of daylight
savings, Australia is

565
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:03,795
three hours ahead
compared to the Philippines.

566
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:08,342
Only one exam is used
when taking the STIC.

567
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,106
It’s done at the same
time and on the same day.

568
00:35:12,131 --> 00:35:14,884
So if the exam is at
9:00 a.m. in Australia.

569
00:35:15,598 --> 00:35:17,433
6:00 a.m. for us here?

570
00:35:18,669 --> 00:35:19,535
Correct.

571
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,561
So what will happen is,

572
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,688
I’ll take the exam
first in Australia

573
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:26,275
then I’ll send the answers
before the exam starts here.

574
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,403
Would it be too expensive if
you only sent the answers to us?

575
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:32,850
Who said you’d be the only
ones benefiting from my answers?

576
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:35,727
With what we’re going to do,

577
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:39,338
the whole Philippines can
benefit from the STIC answers.

578
00:35:39,831 --> 00:35:40,940
But Lin,

579
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:43,676
how are you supposed to
get the answers for the exam?

580
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:46,016
Memorization.

581
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:50,016
I’ll memorize all the answers
then I’ll send them to you.

582
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,824
Didn’t you already
take the exam?

583
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:54,303
Can you memorize all of that?

584
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,925
I can, if I have enough time.

585
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:59,142
I tested it with
the remaining time

586
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:01,336
I was able to memorize
half of the exam.

587
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,743
That means,

588
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:05,106
I can’t do this alone.

589
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:09,014
Someone has to help me.

590
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:13,457
And I have no assurance that this
will be the only exam in Pat’s batch.

591
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:15,291
I see.

592
00:36:16,063 --> 00:36:17,815
So you need someone else.

593
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,582
Who else is as smart as you?

594
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,306
Your x-ray shows that the
spaces in your spine are thinning.

595
00:36:38,806 --> 00:36:40,224
So every time you move,

596
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:44,145
your bones rub against each other,
causing your pain and discomfort.

597
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:47,567
This is what we call spinal stenosis.

598
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:49,526
So, doc,

599
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:52,169
is there a treatment or
medicine that needs to be done?

600
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:54,082
Given how severe it is,

601
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:56,007
the best option I would
recommend your mom

602
00:36:56,032 --> 00:36:58,492
to help her get back
to her normal activities

603
00:36:58,701 --> 00:36:59,750
is surgery.

604
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:01,095
Doc,

605
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,593
maybe we can
manage with medicine?

606
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,584
Like herbal
remedies? Or maybe...

607
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,376
massage?

608
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,213
Sad to say, ma'am.

609
00:37:10,547 --> 00:37:11,894
There’s no medicine for this.

610
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:14,544
If we don’t operate on her,

611
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:17,138
it could potentially
get worse over time.

612
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:20,055
Ah, Doc.

613
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:23,476
The problem is,

614
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,613
we don’t have
money for the surgery.

615
00:37:28,981 --> 00:37:30,056
- If…
- Alright, Doc.

616
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,985
Whatever the best option is,

617
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:34,917
that’s what we’ll do.

618
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:36,571
Alright.

619
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:44,622
I don’t understand you

620
00:37:44,622 --> 00:37:48,542
why you agreed with that
doctor that I should have surgery.

621
00:37:48,947 --> 00:37:50,782
You know those doctors,

622
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:54,371
all they do is make
us spend money.

623
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:56,217
I even know someone

624
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:59,011
who just took herbal
medicinal drinks.

625
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:00,638
It cured their

626
00:38:01,222 --> 00:38:02,233
liver disease.

627
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,532
Ma,

628
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:05,559
what’s the point of
consulting doctors

629
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:07,425
if we’re not going
to listen to them?

630
00:38:07,603 --> 00:38:10,398
They’re the experts. They
know what they’re doing.

631
00:38:10,862 --> 00:38:11,862
Child.

632
00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:16,195
Where will we get money

633
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:17,697
for the surgery?

634
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:19,603
We have no money.

635
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:23,321
And then you won’t even
let me take laundry jobs.

636
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:24,374
So, how?

637
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:26,247
- Ouch!
- There! Ma!

638
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:28,582
- Ouch!
- Go slow, just take it easy.

639
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:29,582
Ouch!

640
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:30,126
Ow, ow!

641
00:38:30,126 --> 00:38:30,643
Wait, wait.

642
00:38:30,668 --> 00:38:31,727
Ouch!

643
00:38:31,752 --> 00:38:32,852
It hurts!

644
00:38:33,112 --> 00:38:33,938
Oh, there, Ma, look.

645
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,965
Wait! Just wait a second!

646
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,363
- Ma!
- It hurts!

647
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,011
My God! My God!

648
00:38:40,928 --> 00:38:41,928
It hurts!

649
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:43,346
It hurts!

650
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:46,200
Are you okay now?

651
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:47,225
Okay.

652
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:48,435
I’m okay now.

653
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:50,186
I’m okay now.

654
00:38:52,398 --> 00:38:53,398
Ma,

655
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:56,001
you know, I need to find a job

656
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:58,112
so we can save up
for your back surgery.

657
00:39:01,157 --> 00:39:02,575
And what about your studies?

658
00:39:05,161 --> 00:39:06,595
Ma, we don’t really
have a choice.

659
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,680
No,

660
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:08,998
Tristan. No.

661
00:39:10,207 --> 00:39:12,793
That could ruin your schooling.

662
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,589
Son, just one more
year and you’ll graduate.

663
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,842
All I need is to rest.

664
00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:21,028
That’s it.

665
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:24,467
Then I’ll be the
one to find a job.

666
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,865
- I’ll do it.
- Ma!

667
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,349
Why are you so stubborn?

668
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:30,978
Do you want to make
your condition worse?

669
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:33,331
Don’t you feel
sorry for yourself?

670
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:36,108
You can’t even stand up.

671
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,027
You can barely
lean properly, Ma.

672
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:51,706
Ma,

673
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,335
my decision is final.

674
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:56,587
Please don’t stop me.

675
00:39:58,005 --> 00:40:01,258
My life is less important to
me than your life is to me.

676
00:40:03,302 --> 00:40:05,137
So please, Ma, don’t
be stubborn anymore.

677
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:30,412
Hi, Lin.

678
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:36,377
Why did you come by?

679
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,297
Is there a problem
with our plan?

680
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:47,972
Lin, I’m really sorry.

681
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,809
And I’ve missed you a lot.

682
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:55,020
Like, a lot.

683
00:40:58,095 --> 00:40:59,471
It’s okay, Grace.

684
00:41:00,276 --> 00:41:02,236
We already talked
earlier, right?

685
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:15,456
But,

686
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:18,377
it’s different.

687
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,412
We’re not close anymore.

688
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:27,457
And I want us to be okay
like how we were before.

689
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:28,482
And...

690
00:41:29,763 --> 00:41:33,434
I really hope that you’ve
forgiven me for what I did last sem.

691
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:37,479
That’s nothing.

692
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,024
We all have our reasons.

693
00:41:40,483 --> 00:41:41,859
And we all have our mistakes.

694
00:41:43,986 --> 00:41:45,112
That’s over now, Grace.

695
00:41:47,907 --> 00:41:48,952
Thanks, Lin.

696
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:51,770
And, yes,

697
00:41:52,912 --> 00:41:55,372
I have learned from
my past mistakes.

698
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,419
Which is why I am also here.

699
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,397
Honestly, I'm really
concerned about you

700
00:42:03,422 --> 00:42:05,549
with this new cheating
scheme that we're planning.

701
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:08,510
I don't want you to get
in trouble like last time.

702
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:12,181
I'm okay now, don’t
worry about me.

703
00:42:13,036 --> 00:42:14,036
All is well.

704
00:42:15,476 --> 00:42:16,727
Okay, but

705
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,773
I can't help but wonder,

706
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:20,842
why do you want to
go through that again?

707
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:25,194
Let's just say that

708
00:42:25,986 --> 00:42:27,696
I really need the
money right now.

709
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,963
Because,

710
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:33,157
I don’t want to keep
relying on other people.

711
00:42:36,747 --> 00:42:37,747
Actually,

712
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,116
I’m doing all of this for Dad.

713
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:43,295
He deserves more.

714
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:44,505
He deserves better.

715
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:47,049
He’s been through
too much hardship.

716
00:42:52,798 --> 00:42:53,798
Okay.

717
00:42:55,432 --> 00:42:56,558
Anyway, sis,

718
00:42:57,103 --> 00:42:58,730
no matter what happens,

719
00:43:00,503 --> 00:43:02,964
I'm just always
here for you, okay?

720
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:06,443
Thanks, sis.

721
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:11,489
So, here.

722
00:43:12,483 --> 00:43:16,112
So, here are the following
candidates that I have for our plan.

723
00:43:22,322 --> 00:43:23,330
Bank?

724
00:43:25,129 --> 00:43:26,463
What are you doing here?

725
00:43:30,386 --> 00:43:32,805
Aren’t you making money
from leaking exam answers?

726
00:43:35,306 --> 00:43:36,473
Teach me.

727
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:43,230
- Hey!
- Ouch!

728
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:45,232
Ouch, son!

729
00:43:45,607 --> 00:43:47,318
My God, I think I’m dying.

730
00:43:47,318 --> 00:43:48,819
If Bank isn’t part of our plan,

731
00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:50,487
the plan won’t push through.

732
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:51,487
You know that.

733
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,209
We’re going to Australia

734
00:43:55,565 --> 00:43:57,317
to take the STIC exam.

735
00:43:57,342 --> 00:43:58,345
So, Bank,

736
00:43:58,370 --> 00:43:59,847
you memorize the first half

737
00:43:59,872 --> 00:44:00,581
and then,

738
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:02,207
Lin gets the second half.

739
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:03,892
We have a contract signing here

740
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:05,669
and all meetings are recorded.

741
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:08,769
No one will tell on anyone
because you’re already accomplices.

742
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:12,943
Why did you do
that to us, Pat, huh?

743
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:14,386
Why did you do that to us?

744
00:44:14,386 --> 00:44:15,220
No, come on, guys.

745
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,725
You’re really going
to believe him?

746
00:44:16,764 --> 00:44:17,965
He's just stressed out.

747
00:44:20,186 --> 00:44:22,290
Bank, just focus on your mom.

748
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,752
I’ll take care of the STIC.

749
00:44:25,814 --> 00:44:27,066
You’ll still get your share.

750
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,940
Thanks, Lin.

751
00:44:29,651 --> 00:44:30,736
But you and I both know

752
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:33,105
that you can’t memorize
the whole STIC exam.
