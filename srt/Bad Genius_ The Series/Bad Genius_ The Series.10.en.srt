1
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,357
Section 3.

2
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:15,419
You did not come
here alone, did you?

3
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:19,033
There's that other
participant, Tristan Bangkat.

4
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:20,368
I don't know him.

5
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,911
My mom lives here.

6
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,179
I came to visit her.

7
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,685
But I'm still your mom.

8
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:27,125
I can't help but be bothered by
what's been happening to you.

9
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,876
I'm always on your side, Lin.

10
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,628
I heard shit went down, bro.

11
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:31,521
Tell me more.

12
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:33,089
I was caught but
I didn't go to jail.

13
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:34,732
We have nothing
more to talk about.

14
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:42,098
As you know, the National
College Entrance Test is upon us.

15
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:49,272
Every Filipino student on their
senior year is expected to take the NCET.

16
00:02:50,398 --> 00:02:51,566
Oh, Tristan.

17
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:54,527
You need to prepare
for this exam, okay?

18
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,780
Mrs. Bangkat, didn't
Tristan tell you?

19
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,115
Will I be suspended, ma'am?

20
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:00,133
Suspended?

21
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:01,008
No!

22
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,785
Ma'am, just a moment.

23
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:05,079
I'm begging you.

24
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:09,333
The universities declared
that all STIC results,

25
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,712
from that round are
automatically invalid.

26
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:20,972
Bank, what's this?

27
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:23,973
What's going on?

28
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:28,770
Are we here to talk about
what happened at STIC?

29
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,688
I saw the news too.

30
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,317
We don't have any information about that.

31
00:03:36,194 --> 00:03:38,321
Anyway, we're good, Lin.

32
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:39,864
No one's coming after us anymore.

33
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:42,033
No reruns, no retakes.

34
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,118
That's the clients' problem now.

35
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:48,873
And our dads found out
about the STIC tests, but

36
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:50,625
they're not calling the cops.

37
00:03:53,252 --> 00:03:54,266
That's how it is.

38
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:58,508
Because if they're decent
parents, they'll protect you.

39
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:01,343
But Lin,

40
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,472
we're not here to talk about STIC.

41
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:06,140
We need your help.

42
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,976
We have a new plan.

43
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:12,437
What's the plan?

44
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:16,317
The National College Entrance Test.

45
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:17,945
NCET?

46
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:20,258
NCET.

47
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:22,840
There will be more clients,

48
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:25,535
Because the whole Philippines
will be taking that test.

49
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,121
I don't believe this.

50
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,958
We're just through with
what happened in the STIC.

51
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,709
Bank, you already got caught.

52
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,169
The news already leaked.

53
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,631
So we're really going to repeat all that?

54
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:40,775
For what?

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,094
For ten million pesos.

56
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:47,014
Ten million pesos each.

57
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:47,723
Damn!

58
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:48,724
Ten million?

59
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,602
Wow, Lin!

60
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:54,730
STIC and NCET are different.

61
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,983
There's only one
timezone in the Philippines

62
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:59,527
and a single schedule for all the students.

63
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,904
Your plan is impossible, Bank.

64
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:05,157
We won't be taking it
with the other test takers.

65
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:07,869
We'll get the test exam first.

66
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:10,204
Before the exam date.

67
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:13,082
Lin, Banky's plan is solid.

68
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:14,041
I think this will work.

69
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,169
- This is easy.
- No.

70
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:18,713
I already said this before.

71
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:20,171
I'm done.

72
00:05:21,716 --> 00:05:25,595
If you need money, why don't
you use my share from STIC?

73
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,221
You can split that.

74
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:30,099
Sis, that's not enough.

75
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,144
You know, Pat and I,

76
00:05:33,853 --> 00:05:36,480
we could use that
money to start over again.

77
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:39,108
And just be free.

78
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,318
Finally.

79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,655
And twenty million?

80
00:05:44,947 --> 00:05:46,657
I mean for the both of us.

81
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:48,628
That...

82
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,578
That would change our lives!

83
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:52,816
Come on, Lin.

84
00:05:54,206 --> 00:05:56,363
Haven't we learned from the STIC?

85
00:05:57,084 --> 00:05:58,169
Even at school?

86
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:00,007
Grace,

87
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,826
what we're doing is a crime.

88
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:07,685
Please,

89
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:09,739
don't include me in your plans anymore.

90
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,307
I'm done with cheating.

91
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:14,403
Lin.

92
00:06:15,193 --> 00:06:16,698
Wait, there's something you need to know.

93
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,483
In compliance with our school regulations,

94
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:24,403
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Ma'am, but

95
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:26,444
Tristan Bangkat,

96
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:29,307
you are expelled effective today.

97
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,787
I'm expelled.

98
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,998
It's already on my permanent
records the expulsion and cheating.

99
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:38,751
I can't go to med school anymore.

100
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:41,963
I have no hope left, I won't
become a doctor anymore.

101
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,507
Why didn't you tell me this right away?

102
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:45,967
We met, didn't we?

103
00:06:46,425 --> 00:06:47,718
I could've done something, Bank.

104
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:49,595
There's nothing more we can do, Lin.

105
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:51,806
It hurts, yes.

106
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:55,101
But I accept it now,
that this is as far as I go.

107
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:57,870
That's why I need the NCET.

108
00:06:58,396 --> 00:06:59,563
If I'm not going to
become a doctor anymore,

109
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:02,549
I need the money for
my future and for Mom.

110
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:04,443
That's my only way, Lin.

111
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:08,990
But it's up to you.

112
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,185
While you can still study in Australia.

113
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:13,709
You still have a choice.

114
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:15,662
But me,

115
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,146
I have no choice left, Lin.

116
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,298
If I help all of you with the NCET,

117
00:07:27,133 --> 00:07:29,218
are you sure this is the last?

118
00:07:29,802 --> 00:07:30,678
Promise, Lin.

119
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:31,787
This is the last one.

120
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:34,349
Yes, sis.

121
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,033
This is the last one.

122
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:37,373
After this,

123
00:07:38,394 --> 00:07:39,395
no more cheating.

124
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,273
We just have to do this,

125
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:45,158
together.

126
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Okay.

127
00:07:58,184 --> 00:07:59,209
Let's do this.

128
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:01,751
One last time.

129
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,202
Hello, Mom?

130
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:02,180
Lin!

131
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:03,498
Hi, Lin!

132
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:06,607
I'm so happy we
were able to talk again.

133
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:07,483
But sorry, okay?

134
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:10,662
I was only able to call now because
so many things are happening.

135
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,596
But I got your message.

136
00:09:12,822 --> 00:09:14,573
And thank you, thank you.

137
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,242
And I'm happy because

138
00:09:16,242 --> 00:09:18,786
you've decided that you'll study here.

139
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:19,779
Yay!

140
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:22,679
And Lin, I still have
to get the place ready.

141
00:09:22,998 --> 00:09:26,460
I also need to know what
documents you need to submit.

142
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,965
So, well, I just want you to know
that it's not just us who are happy,

143
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:33,843
everyone's excited, especially Carson.

144
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:36,804
Oh Lin, what? What's wrong?

145
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:39,014
Oh, have you talked to your dad already?

146
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,266
What did he say?

147
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:41,617
That's it, Mom.

148
00:09:42,184 --> 00:09:44,895
I haven't had the
chance to talk to dad.

149
00:09:45,855 --> 00:09:47,606
I'm just waiting for the perfect time.

150
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,608
Oh, that's okay.

151
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,627
We're not in a rush, right?

152
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:55,114
What's important is that
you talk to your dad first,

153
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,049
then we'll plan, right?

154
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,242
All right mom.

155
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,662
I'm also thinking about...

156
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:04,014
Vin!

157
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,499
Hey Vin, is that you?

158
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,437
No, no. It's okay.
Just talk.

159
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:08,310
It's fine.

160
00:10:08,335 --> 00:10:09,773
Oh no Vin, don't.

161
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,005
Sit beside Lin.

162
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,289
Let's talk now.

163
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:14,024
Let's talk like a family.

164
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:15,102
Come here, Dad.

165
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:19,359
Thank you, Nona.

166
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:22,141
Did I understand correctly? It's like...

167
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:24,974
our Lin has already decided.

168
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:26,145
That's right.

169
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:30,117
We need to talk first
because of course we need

170
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:32,395
to know what you're going to say.

171
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:35,654
Because I don't want this to
cause any misunderstanding.

172
00:10:35,654 --> 00:10:36,664
You know that.

173
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:40,784
No need, we're mature people—
what matters is Lin's future.

174
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:43,871
Right, right.

175
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,211
Thank you, Dad.

176
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,268
Mom.

177
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:52,671
My mind hasn't changed but

178
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:54,798
I would like to move the date.

179
00:10:55,424 --> 00:10:56,842
I'll leave next month.

180
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,471
I'll just stay here with
Dad for his birthday.

181
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:02,556
No problem, Lin.

182
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:04,183
Don't worry about that.

183
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:08,270
Um, Vin, thank you.

184
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:10,189
Thank you because...

185
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:13,609
you gave me this chance
to be a mother to Lin again.

186
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:15,068
Thank you so much.

187
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:23,494
Okay, bye mom.

188
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:24,890
I love you.

189
00:11:27,322 --> 00:11:28,322
See you soon.

190
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:33,711
Thank you, Dad.

191
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,047
Love you.

192
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
Love you.

193
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:44,949
Thanks.

194
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:45,532
Thank you.

195
00:11:45,557 --> 00:11:46,642
Oh, you're just in time.

196
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:47,993
Here's some freshly cooked

197
00:11:48,018 --> 00:11:49,144
Banana fritters.

198
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:50,179
Please eat.

199
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:51,647
I hope you guys enjoy.

200
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:52,827
Do you even eat Banana fritters?

201
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:54,250
Oh, yeah.

202
00:11:54,275 --> 00:11:54,692
No, no, no.

203
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:55,526
Thank you, Tito Choi.

204
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:56,694
Actually, this is my favorite.

205
00:11:56,944 --> 00:11:57,991
Hey, Choi!

206
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:01,782
I didn't know you have a
nice and English-speaking niece.

207
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,284
Gosh, that's basic.

208
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,119
Look at our faces.

209
00:12:05,286 --> 00:12:06,890
It runs in the blood, right?

210
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,474
Yeah, whatever you say.

211
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:11,500
She's something else.

212
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:13,477
Go ahead, Lin.

213
00:12:13,502 --> 00:12:14,003
Just eat.

214
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:15,003
Don't be shy, okay?

215
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:16,005
Please.

216
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,106
Thank you.

217
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:19,717
You know, This is where
I also order

218
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,636
food packs for my employees.

219
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:25,983
Beside being good cooks,
they're also affordable.

220
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:28,233
Thank you.

221
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:31,895
Thank you very much too, for
touring us around your printing press.

222
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:34,546
Good thing you're not busy today.

223
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:36,609
No problem with that.

224
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,970
At least, I can help
with your research, right?

225
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:41,773
Anything for my niece, Grace.

226
00:12:42,197 --> 00:12:42,913
Right?

227
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:46,410
The timing is actually perfect
because in a few weeks,

228
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,765
we're going to be extremely busy here.

229
00:12:49,371 --> 00:12:50,648
Because of the NCET.

230
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:52,741
Really?

231
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:56,241
We've long been

232
00:12:56,266 --> 00:12:58,741
a government-accredited printing partner.

233
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:00,812
So we take on

234
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:05,220
the big print jobs when
the NPO can't handle them.

235
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:06,637
Huh?

236
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:07,849
- Really?
- Actually,

237
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:12,369
we're behind schedule because
they only gave us two weeks lead time.

238
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:13,585
What will happen then?

239
00:13:13,687 --> 00:13:15,147
NCET is on Monday.

240
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:16,523
Oh, no.

241
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:17,583
No problem with that.

242
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:20,413
If we finish in the early
hours right before the exams,

243
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,654
it can still reach the testing sites.

244
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:23,922
So, we're good.

245
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:25,093
Don't worry about it.

246
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:27,618
Good day, boss.

247
00:13:27,951 --> 00:13:30,079
May I speak with you
even if just for a moment?

248
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:32,069
My goodness, Fidel.

249
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:34,291
Can't you see I have visitors?

250
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,554
Can it be later?

251
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:37,628
Now is really the right time.

252
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:40,077
Because whenever I go up
to your office, you're not there.

253
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:43,050
And then, when you are in
the office, I need to go home.

254
00:13:44,802 --> 00:13:45,652
Let's talk over there.

255
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:46,726
Excuse me, girls.

256
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:54,882
What now, Fidel?

257
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:56,729
Huh?

258
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:59,263
Another advance?

259
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:01,960
Sorry, boss.

260
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:04,343
You still haven't paid for last time.

261
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,490
Oh no, Fidel, don't do anything stupid.

262
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:09,885
Huh? You still have so
many mistakes in your work.

263
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,036
Sorry, boss.

264
00:14:11,453 --> 00:14:13,288
I really need the money right now.

265
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,207
But that script was from before.

266
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:16,183
Isn't there anything else?

267
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,710
We all need money here.

268
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:22,273
Tito Choi is furious.

269
00:14:23,966 --> 00:14:25,801
I've never seen him like that before.

270
00:14:26,343 --> 00:14:27,277
Yeah.

271
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:28,971
He's scary when he's angry.

272
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:33,280
What's wrong with you?

273
00:14:37,729 --> 00:14:38,981
Hon, this is the admin, right?

274
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:40,483
Yeah. Mhmm.

275
00:14:42,109 --> 00:14:42,894
Why?

276
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,170
What are you drawing?

277
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,117
Hon, stop!

278
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:51,822
Don't! It's cute, right?

279
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,807
Excuse me, can you do that later?

280
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:56,122
Please?

281
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,433
Lin,

282
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:58,250
can you just chill?

283
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,376
Can't we have fun?

284
00:14:59,797 --> 00:15:00,939
Do you think, Pat,

285
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,872
that I still have time to enjoy
what we're doing right now?

286
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,815
Just a reminder, okay?

287
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:08,944
This isn't like before where
I'll just give the answers.

288
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:10,637
What we're doing is a crime.

289
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,432
We're going to steal documents.

290
00:15:15,142 --> 00:15:18,604
One small mistake and
for sure, we'll end up in jail.

291
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:25,794
Okay.

292
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,005
According to Tito Choi,

293
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,133
the clients' information
is important to them.

294
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:35,120
They signed an NDA to make sure
that everything is strictly confidential.

295
00:15:35,454 --> 00:15:38,457
Also, documents for
printing aren't sent by email.

296
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,686
To avoid online spread and at
the same time, prevent hacking.

297
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:45,005
So, scrap the fact that we
can get the soft copy.

298
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,215
Printing is ongoing

299
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:48,832
which means we only have
a few days to prepare a plan.

300
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:52,654
The earliest we can get the
documents is the day before the exam.

301
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,640
Also, CCTV cameras are everywhere.

302
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,684
Even if we get them, they'll
have strong evidence against us.

303
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:00,771
The chance is low.

304
00:16:01,522 --> 00:16:02,814
But it's not zero, right?

305
00:16:03,148 --> 00:16:05,082
We just really need to plan carefully.

306
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,191
But we also prepared for the STIC.

307
00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:11,847
But you still got caught.

308
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:15,168
I was the only one caught.

309
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:17,829
But it didn't ruin the plan, right?

310
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:19,581
The clients still received
what they needed,

311
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:21,350
the answers, and they passed.

312
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,855
So if we managed before,

313
00:16:23,794 --> 00:16:25,087
we can do more now.

314
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,023
Fine.

315
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,134
I'll walk you through the
main process of printing

316
00:16:31,134 --> 00:16:32,594
so we're all in-sync.

317
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:33,668
Okay?

318
00:16:33,762 --> 00:16:35,430
These are the five main processes.

319
00:16:35,681 --> 00:16:37,355
One, sampling.

320
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:38,642
Actual printing.

321
00:16:39,184 --> 00:16:40,369
Quality assurance.

322
00:16:40,394 --> 00:16:41,370
Packaging.

323
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:42,613
And dispatch.

324
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:45,349
Keep this in mind, guys,
because this is where we'll look for

325
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:47,877
the possible window to
get a copy of the exam,

326
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:48,877
okay?

327
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:50,237
Okay, run it, teacher Lin.

328
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,005
Okay.

329
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,532
At the sampling stage,

330
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:57,703
this is where they print samples to
check if the color and formatting are okay.

331
00:16:57,728 --> 00:17:00,063
But if there's a problem at
this stage, they then adjust the

332
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:02,543
color plate to the
correct color and format.

333
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,918
Once they adjust the color plate,

334
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:07,838
they then proceed to the next
step which is actual printing.

335
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:10,632
Now, once the documents
are printed, they then imprint

336
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:12,759
a barcode for each and every single copy

337
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:15,345
so they can trace it if
a copy goes missing.

338
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,197
After that,

339
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:20,642
they bring all the printed copies
to the QA and packaging room.

340
00:17:21,184 --> 00:17:23,312
All the good copies,
go straight to packaging.

341
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,856
But all the damaged
copies, even if readable,

342
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:29,568
if there's misalignment or even a small
error, they're disposed of immediately.

343
00:17:30,277 --> 00:17:32,362
Now, if the documents are confidential,

344
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:35,616
they run them through
shredding before disposal.

345
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,284
Around here.

346
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:39,543
Now guys, please take note

347
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:44,124
that they record the barcode numbers
of the copies they shred for tracing.

348
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:49,129
And finally, in the QA and packaging room,

349
00:17:49,129 --> 00:17:51,882
there's a connecting
door to the dispatch room.

350
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,926
So once all of the documents
are packed and sealed,

351
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:58,004
they then proceed to the final
stage which is dispatch for delivery.

352
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:05,502
Got it?

353
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:08,931
Did you know we can get
a full copy at sampling, right?

354
00:18:11,151 --> 00:18:12,486
I've thought of that.

355
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:17,032
But Tito Choi said, printing is ongoing.

356
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:19,451
So all the samples have been thrown away.

357
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:24,081
The window where we
can get a copy of the exam

358
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,916
is before it's packed and delivered.

359
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,084
Around here.

360
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,464
But security's really tight.

361
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:34,466
They're super strict, right?

362
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,949
They're so strict that even
if there's just a slight error

363
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:42,057
and it's still readable, it's discarded.

364
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:46,603
Maybe we can get a damaged
copy before it's shredded.

365
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:50,273
That would also be the safest
copy because it can't be traced.

366
00:18:51,692 --> 00:18:54,986
But we just need someone
inside who will work for us.

367
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,990
Right.

368
00:19:00,283 --> 00:19:01,285
I like that.

369
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,870
We should look for someone we can pay.

370
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:12,324
Ma'am, Sir...

371
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,339
you've ordered so much.

372
00:19:16,091 --> 00:19:17,332
Please take some.

373
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:18,385
Please eat.

374
00:19:20,345 --> 00:19:21,355
Go ahead, kuys.

375
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:23,432
We're still full.
That's all for you.

376
00:19:24,141 --> 00:19:25,225
All of this mine?

377
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:28,228
Ma'am Grace, maybe

378
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:30,814
you'll hang me after
feeding me this much?

379
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,483
No, Kuya Fidel.

380
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,904
It's a work opportunity.

381
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,114
Work?

382
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:42,773
I have work but okay.

383
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,703
What, what job is that?

384
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,922
Can you help us get a copy
of the NCET exam paper?

385
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,050
Wait sir, okay?

386
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:02,946
It seems...

387
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,918
It seems difficult, that
thing you're asking because

388
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,371
first, it's dangerous.

389
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,269
Second, if Boss catches me,

390
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:09,686
I'll be in trouble.

391
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:10,886
You know, Ma'am,

392
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,230
he's still pissed at me.

393
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:13,190
Maybe—

394
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,525
Even if we pay you 100,000?

395
00:20:21,364 --> 00:20:22,364
One?

396
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:24,746
One hundred thousand?

397
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:29,414
The offer can still increase depending
on your involvement in our plan.

398
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:31,464
So, are you G?

399
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:36,386
Not that it matters, but,

400
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:38,757
where will you get that much money?

401
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:49,351
As per request, you
already have 800 clients.

402
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:50,394
Thanks to me.

403
00:20:50,936 --> 00:20:54,731
Just make sure they get 280 over 300.

404
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,233
Because that's what I promised them.

405
00:20:57,776 --> 00:20:59,069
Thank you, Ms. Maya.

406
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:03,532
Did you also bring their IDs?

407
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:08,235
Wait.

408
00:21:08,787 --> 00:21:10,872
What are the IDs for?

409
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,785
What will you do with them?

410
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,086
Because they asked me,
and I don't know what to answer.

411
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,339
Aren't they entitled to
know that as clients?

412
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:24,636
With all due respect, Ms. Maya,
but we can't disclose that information

413
00:21:24,636 --> 00:21:26,930
for the safety of everyone involved.

414
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,642
But I can ensure you that we can
inform the clients once their IDs are done.

415
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:33,728
So secretive.

416
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:36,356
Well, okay, for my client's safety.

417
00:21:36,356 --> 00:21:37,899
I won't give this to you either.

418
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:39,317
Wait a moment,

419
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:41,444
we need their IDs.

420
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:43,947
Because that's where we'll
put the answers for the exam.

421
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:46,198
How?

422
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:48,952
When we found out

423
00:21:48,952 --> 00:21:51,788
the IDs are the only thing that
you can bring into the exam room,

424
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:55,375
given that NCET and pencils
are provided on the day.

425
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:57,425
Yes.

426
00:21:57,961 --> 00:22:01,715
This is their precautionary measure
after what happened at STIC.

427
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,800
Nice!

428
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:05,468
Game changer.

429
00:22:05,635 --> 00:22:06,803
Anyways,

430
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,222
since only IDs can be
brought into the exam room,

431
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:11,600
the answers— we printed
on the barcode sticker.

432
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,227
and the number will represent
the answer on the exam.

433
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,317
Can we get them?

434
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:25,655
Actually, I just realized.

435
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:28,825
My involvement is actually vital here.

436
00:22:29,618 --> 00:22:30,952
I'm thinking of

437
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:31,953
raising my cut?

438
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,291
Instead of just 5 percent,
make it 10 percent.

439
00:22:36,426 --> 00:22:37,430
Is that okay?

440
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:38,466
Wait.

441
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:42,047
It seems like there are too many demands.

442
00:22:43,506 --> 00:22:44,841
Isn't that unfair to us?

443
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:46,896
Unfair?

444
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:50,221
You have clients because of me
Is it still unfair?

445
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:52,459
So,

446
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:53,756
do we have a deal?

447
00:22:56,645 --> 00:22:57,779
Okay.

448
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,900
We'll give you your 10 percent.

449
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:04,646
But you'll hire the people...

450
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:07,530
who will get their IDs at the testing sites

451
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,658
so they won't take them from us,

452
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:11,717
they won't take them from you either.

453
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,287
Fine.

454
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:15,431
I'll take care of that.

455
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:18,333
I'll just message you the bank details.

456
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:24,923
Thank you, Ms. Maya.

457
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:34,693
He's an hour late.

458
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:36,652
Are you sure he's made up his mind?

459
00:23:38,061 --> 00:23:39,079
Yeah.

460
00:23:39,104 --> 00:23:40,355
He said he was G.

461
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:42,148
Can you just chill?

462
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,233
So impatient.

463
00:23:43,233 --> 00:23:44,651
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

464
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:49,489
Pat, how sure are you

465
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:51,758
that he'll agree to help us with our plan?

466
00:23:51,783 --> 00:23:53,034
Well, money talks.

467
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,286
I offered him 300k.

468
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:57,607
But he's actually gonna
help us to the heist.

469
00:23:58,707 --> 00:24:01,292
He has a child too,
so I think he'll go for it.

470
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,537
Yeah, if you saw his reaction, guys,

471
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:06,089
from that reaction, he's for
sure gonna take the money.

472
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:07,674
He badly needs it.

473
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:11,348
Well,

474
00:24:12,144 --> 00:24:14,420
desperate measure calls
for desperate actions.

475
00:24:15,181 --> 00:24:16,933
He needs the money for his family.

476
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:18,279
Like you.

477
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,689
Maybe they're just trying to survive.

478
00:24:24,357 --> 00:24:25,984
You know, I get your point.

479
00:24:27,027 --> 00:24:30,280
But I don't think survival is an
excuse to do something wrong.

480
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,465
Because whatever your reason,

481
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,482
if you're wrong,

482
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:34,756
you're wrong.

483
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:36,834
Right?

484
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,541
Sir.

485
00:24:43,126 --> 00:24:44,144
It's about time.

486
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:44,794
Hi, kuya.

487
00:24:44,794 --> 00:24:46,963
Speaking of the devil. Sup, Kuya Fidel?

488
00:24:48,673 --> 00:24:50,029
Here's Bank, by the way.

489
00:24:50,175 --> 00:24:51,303
- Lin.
- Sir.

490
00:24:53,094 --> 00:24:54,146
Ma'am.

491
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:55,471
Lin.

492
00:24:55,597 --> 00:24:57,432
Sorry I'm late.

493
00:24:58,767 --> 00:24:59,873
But,

494
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,828
let me clarify again,

495
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:04,773
the reason I accepted this

496
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,884
is because I really need
money for my child's insulin.

497
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:12,389
Because Boss Choi, even though
I've worked for him for a long time,

498
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,888
he's stingy.

499
00:25:14,066 --> 00:25:16,185
They never increased my salary there.

500
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:18,369
So the money I have left,

501
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:20,205
that little amount,

502
00:25:20,205 --> 00:25:21,810
I used it to gamble. But,

503
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,337
bad luck, I always lose.

504
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,185
But okay.

505
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:27,253
For my child, I'll gamble here.

506
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:29,717
That's my guy.

507
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:32,258
Well, don't worry, Kuya Fidel.

508
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:34,068
We're not gonna judge you.

509
00:25:34,344 --> 00:25:34,986
Thanks.

510
00:25:35,011 --> 00:25:35,695
Okay.

511
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,696
Alright.

512
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:38,306
So, here's the plan I thought of.

513
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:40,683
While printing is happening,

514
00:25:41,392 --> 00:25:44,162
Kuya Fidel will casually
go to the QA room.

515
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:46,523
He'll get the test
paper's damaged copy,

516
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:49,818
then you'll send it to us.

517
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:53,863
I can't be the one to take
the test paper out because

518
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,033
we get body-checked
when leaving the factory.

519
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,618
I'll get caught for that.

520
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:02,914
What if you just use your phone instead,

521
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,333
take photos of the test
papers, then send them to us.

522
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:08,336
Cellphones, sir, and all kinds of cameras

523
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:11,303
are surrendered to the guard. So,

524
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:13,036
that's a no-go, Sir.

525
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:14,092
Yeah, Bank.

526
00:26:14,676 --> 00:26:16,444
I already mentioned this before.

527
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,179
They're checked at the entrance.

528
00:26:18,805 --> 00:26:22,475
So we need to get a phone inside
without going through the entrance.

529
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:27,105
What if through food delivery?

530
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,207
Lin,

531
00:26:29,232 --> 00:26:32,527
remember the woman selling
maruya at the food stall we ate at?

532
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:34,112
Ah, yes.

533
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:35,947
Tito Choi said,

534
00:26:36,281 --> 00:26:38,533
they usually order food packs there.

535
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:41,077
Perfect timing.

536
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:43,163
We'll put the phone inside the food packs

537
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:45,623
and then mark them so
you can spot them easily.

538
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:46,697
Is that okay?

539
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,086
Sir, that's risky because this area,

540
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:53,006
as far as I recall, has...

541
00:26:53,381 --> 00:26:56,467
one to four CCTVs.

542
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:58,428
It's really risky, Sir.

543
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:05,602
We need a power outage
so the CCTVs won't work.

544
00:27:05,602 --> 00:27:08,813
Unless the printing press has a generator.

545
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,149
They don't have a generator there.

546
00:27:11,357 --> 00:27:12,384
There!

547
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:13,744
Perfect.

548
00:27:14,402 --> 00:27:15,753
Power outage is the way.

549
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:18,715
When there's no power,
you stop operation.

550
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,658
No CCTV, complete darkness.

551
00:27:20,867 --> 00:27:23,578
No one will see you taking
pictures of the test papers.

552
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:25,180
Yeah.

553
00:27:25,205 --> 00:27:26,973
Bro, I think that's the plan.

554
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:29,083
Ah, that's not possible either, Sir.

555
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:31,285
Because when there's a brownout...

556
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,088
everyone is sent out of the factory.

557
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:37,008
Only Boss Choi is allowed in.

558
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,193
We'd just come back later,

559
00:27:38,218 --> 00:27:41,471
when the power's back, so it's
unlikely I can get in while it's dark.

560
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:43,765
Figure something out, bro.

561
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:44,769
Oh no, Sir.

562
00:27:44,794 --> 00:27:47,463
It's not part of our agreement
that I would lose my job.

563
00:27:47,685 --> 00:27:51,022
Also, I don't even know what
you'll ask me to photograph.

564
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:52,398
I might mess up later.

565
00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:55,558
If so,

566
00:27:56,402 --> 00:27:59,739
one of us must pretend to
be an electrician to get inside.

567
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,027
And he's the one who will
send the test papers to us.

568
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:11,434
Me?

569
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,603
Why me? Why not you?

570
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:14,045
What are you?

571
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:14,938
Why me?

572
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:16,027
Why us?

573
00:28:16,297 --> 00:28:17,924
Lin and I will be taking the exam, right.

574
00:28:17,924 --> 00:28:19,496
So we're already waiting by the van.

575
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,301
- Bro.
- It's unlikely

576
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:22,371
for Grace to pretend to be an electrician?

577
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,051
Bro, I don't want that.

578
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:27,141
I'm not the right person for it.

579
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:29,519
Yeah, you talk to me as
a client, but not like that.

580
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:32,152
I'm not even a fucking
electrician. What would I do there?

581
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,232
Messing with wires?
I'll look like an idiot!

582
00:28:34,232 --> 00:28:35,984
Then you'll expect me
to bring you the

583
00:28:35,984 --> 00:28:37,379
damaged test papers?!

584
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:39,230
Okay, fine.

585
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:41,066
We'll hire a real electrician.

586
00:28:41,322 --> 00:28:43,783
But you still have to be the
one to send the test papers to us.

587
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,176
Wait, Bank.

588
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,327
Are you sure?

589
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:50,707
Isn't it too dangerous if we
add more people to our plan?

590
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:53,151
Guys, can we even trust them?

591
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:55,228
Lin.

592
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,561
They're just outsiders like Maya's crew.

593
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,215
It's not personal so the risk is lower.

594
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,024
Besides,

595
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:01,637
we have no other way.

596
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,721
We really need someone to fix the
power while Pat is in the QA room.

597
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,600
So, do you know any
electrician who can be bribed?

598
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,356
My nanny's brother is an electrician.

599
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,638
We can trust him.

600
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:18,710
Hon.

601
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:20,668
Are you okay with me going in?

602
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:24,032
Well, of course it's not okay with me
but we don't have any other choice.

603
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:27,952
Hon, please, do it for us.

604
00:29:30,527 --> 00:29:31,527
Pat,

605
00:29:31,754 --> 00:29:33,124
there won't be a problem.

606
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,643
We'll plan this carefully.

607
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:37,683
This whole thing, this is the panel.

608
00:29:38,588 --> 00:29:40,424
These two are the circuit breakers.

609
00:29:40,449 --> 00:29:42,242
Then these are the power cables.

610
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,831
Just remember these basics so when
they ask you, you know something.

611
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:47,905
So Kuya Fidel,

612
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,223
once you get the phone,

613
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:51,659
make a way to cause a power outage.

614
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:53,036
Short circuit, can you do it?

615
00:29:53,061 --> 00:29:54,020
Possible, sir.

616
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,313
But the problem is,

617
00:29:55,938 --> 00:29:58,488
before you reach the breaker,
you have to pass through the admin.

618
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:00,027
But,

619
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,409
I think I can figure out a way.

620
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:04,019
Okay.

621
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,740
When the power goes out,

622
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:07,950
pretend to call an electrician.

623
00:30:08,451 --> 00:30:09,118
Okay, sir.

624
00:30:09,118 --> 00:30:10,754
And that's when you go in, Pat.

625
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,872
You go with the real electrician.

626
00:30:13,373 --> 00:30:16,209
Kuya Fidel will meet
you, hand you the phone.

627
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:18,461
And you, Kuya Fidel,
you'll just leave right away.

628
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:19,896
And Pat,

629
00:30:19,921 --> 00:30:22,871
the real electrician will be
left in the electrical room.

630
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:24,988
He'll pretend to fix the power.

631
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,708
And you, Pat, go to the QA room.

632
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:30,166
Use all that time to

633
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:32,892
photograph and send
us every single test paper.

634
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:34,202
And when you're done,

635
00:30:34,227 --> 00:30:37,324
you can signal him to
actually fix the power again.

636
00:30:38,022 --> 00:30:39,082
Are you serious?

637
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:40,277
That's a long route, see?

638
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:41,734
Then make a way!

639
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,611
Go to the restroom or whatever.

640
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,405
Actually, Sir, that's right.

641
00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:46,801
Because from here...

642
00:30:47,573 --> 00:30:50,785
going toward the parking area, there's...

643
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:52,980
there's a restroom here.

644
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:54,143
You can go through there.

645
00:30:54,168 --> 00:30:55,748
Also, Sir, from up there,

646
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:57,166
there's a small window.

647
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,230
It overlooks the QA.

648
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,520
Wait, what about the phones?

649
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:02,379
He'll be caught by the guard at the exit.

650
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:07,193
The phone needs to be hidden
in a place that's really not obvious.

651
00:31:07,218 --> 00:31:08,970
Everything inside must be wiped clean.

652
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,847
Sir, in— in the restroom,

653
00:31:11,055 --> 00:31:12,765
there's a drain with a cover.

654
00:31:12,974 --> 00:31:14,767
You can hide the cellphone there.

655
00:31:14,934 --> 00:31:15,576
There.

656
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:16,577
Pat.

657
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:19,647
before you return to the electrical
room, make sure you pass by there, okay?

658
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:21,059
Don't forget.

659
00:31:22,151 --> 00:31:23,151
Okay.

660
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:25,753
And you, Grace,

661
00:31:25,778 --> 00:31:27,155
you need to tell the electrician,

662
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:29,490
that before he restores the power,

663
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,826
Pat must be in the electrical room, okay?

664
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,580
And when everything
is done, and Pat is out,

665
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:37,807
we all go together to your warehouse.

666
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:40,017
There we'll print all the QR stickers.

667
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,502
And we must send them,

668
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:44,130
so we can deliver to
all the clients their IDs

669
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,757
before seven in the morning, understand?

670
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:49,259
Pat.

671
00:31:50,277 --> 00:31:51,429
This depends on you.

672
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:53,638
Can you do it?

673
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,512
Yeah, I got it.

674
00:32:02,773 --> 00:32:03,773
Good.

675
00:32:04,317 --> 00:32:05,621
If you have no more questions,

676
00:32:06,569 --> 00:32:07,612
that's our plan.

677
00:32:09,071 --> 00:32:10,406
Okay, thank you.

678
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Hey, Faye.

679
00:32:14,285 --> 00:32:16,662
I just got off the
electrician. He's good to go.

680
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:18,556
Though,

681
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:21,584
I thought he was going to back out but
it turns out he just wanted a higher rate.

682
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:24,911
Okay.

683
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,803
Are you sure you're okay, sis?

684
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:36,681
Yeah.

685
00:32:37,225 --> 00:32:38,225
I'm okay.

686
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:41,854
Maybe I'm just worried.

687
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:44,774
So many people involved.

688
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:48,402
Maybe we need a plan B.

689
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah.

690
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:55,034
I agree with you.

691
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:56,911
Is there another way?

692
00:32:56,911 --> 00:32:59,038
So Pat doesn't have to go back in?

693
00:32:59,342 --> 00:33:00,355
I know, Pat.

694
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:02,785
This is kind of,

695
00:33:03,543 --> 00:33:05,127
weird to do.

696
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:08,714
I've been there before.

697
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:11,387
I even got caught.

698
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:15,513
As much as I wanna have another plan,

699
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:18,432
there really isn't one.

700
00:33:20,726 --> 00:33:21,769
This is it.

701
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,230
We have no choice.

702
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:28,442
We need to do this so we don't
go back to our miserable lives.

703
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:31,278
And me?

704
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,288
I don't want to go
back to my old life

705
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,200
buried in debt and a
broken washing machine.

706
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:41,414
My life was ruined since I got expelled.

707
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,000
I have no future, Pat.

708
00:33:47,295 --> 00:33:48,921
This is the only way I see to recover.

709
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:51,558
As for me,

710
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:54,760
what I want is to stop
being controlled by my dad.

711
00:33:56,846 --> 00:33:57,871
But,

712
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:02,393
I thought if there's one stage
in our plan that can go wrong,

713
00:34:04,395 --> 00:34:05,771
let's back out.

714
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:09,984
Let’s not risk it anymore.

715
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,789
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

716
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:16,191
Though,

717
00:34:16,216 --> 00:34:17,234
with Bank,

718
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:19,577
I don't know.

719
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:22,622
Backing out doesn't
seem like an option for him.

720
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:24,874
Come on, let’s do one last regroup.

721
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:29,420
Grace, Lin, last regroup.

722
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:31,796
Yeah.

723
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:36,385
So here’s what will happen.

724
00:34:38,471 --> 00:34:41,682
At 10pm, Kuya Fidel will start his shift.

725
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:46,062
Sir, just checking.

726
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:47,063
Yes.

727
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:57,531
Before 12 midnight,

728
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:01,444
the food packs should already be delivered
for the employees’ midnight break.

729
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:12,063
How’s it going?

730
00:35:12,088 --> 00:35:13,064
All good.

731
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:15,007
We already placed the
phone in the food pack.

732
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:17,385
The utility will bring it in now.

733
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:19,670
Okay.

734
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:21,576
I hope you weren’t recognized.

735
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,726
And once the food is inside,

736
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,564
Kuya Fidel needs to find his food
pack with the label chicken adobo...

737
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:31,691
- Papi.
- ...with no egg.

738
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:34,068
Mine’s a special order.

739
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:36,445
Chicken adobo labeled no egg.

740
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:37,672
- No egg.
- No egg?

741
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,458
- Okay.
- Doesn’t look like it’s here, bro.

742
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:43,536
Hey.

743
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:45,246
You guys aren’t eating mine, right?

744
00:35:45,413 --> 00:35:47,665
No way, this one has egg.

745
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:51,210
Oh, this is pork adobo.

746
00:35:52,128 --> 00:35:54,271
You’re such a mess,
we’re already eating here.

747
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:56,549
- Where is it?
- "Chicken adobo with no egg."

748
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:57,858
Fidel,

749
00:35:57,883 --> 00:35:58,968
I think this is yours.

750
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:00,282
Here.

751
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,455
This one’s special.

752
00:36:02,972 --> 00:36:04,094
Hey, Fidel.

753
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:05,725
Come here.

754
00:36:08,018 --> 00:36:09,018
Sir, eat.

755
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:12,148
Fix the plate over there.

756
00:36:12,898 --> 00:36:15,151
Your guy didn’t fix the plate over there.

757
00:36:15,317 --> 00:36:16,485
Sir, dinner break.

758
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:18,696
Can I please eat first?

759
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:21,407
Later.

760
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:23,117
Fix it over there.

761
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:25,745
It’s like they’re not feeding you.

762
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,163
This greedy bastard.

763
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:28,497
Hurry!

764
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:30,166
Yes, sir, I’ll follow.

765
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:31,792
Right now.

766
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:33,169
Come with me.

767
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:34,044
Don’t let anyone touch—

768
00:36:34,044 --> 00:36:35,312
Hey, no one touches this.

769
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:37,131
Whoever does, dies.

770
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:39,550
Okay, fine!

771
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,510
Like you’re the boss here!

772
00:36:46,098 --> 00:36:47,808
Before 1:00 a.m.,

773
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:51,391
we should already receive a text
from Kuya Fidel that he has the phone.

774
00:36:52,108 --> 00:36:53,397
- Grace,
- Mmm?

775
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:54,690
where’s the electrician?

776
00:36:57,943 --> 00:36:59,039
He’s on his way.

777
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,362
He said he’s almost here.

778
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,388
Okay.

779
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Pat,

780
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,664
get ready.

781
00:37:20,424 --> 00:37:23,177
Papi, where’s the food I set aside?

782
00:37:23,385 --> 00:37:24,391
I don’t know.

783
00:37:24,678 --> 00:37:26,931
Maybe it was thrown out into the trash.

784
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,857
And by 12:30, their break should be over.

785
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:39,109
Here, the color plates are ready.

786
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:41,403
So, the brownout needs
to happen by this time.

787
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:45,074
Why isn’t it happening yet?

788
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:46,509
What happened?

789
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:48,828
He need to cut the power out by now.

790
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:07,680
Bank, the electrician’s here.

791
00:38:24,864 --> 00:38:25,985
Where the hell is it?

792
00:38:26,991 --> 00:38:28,784
What the hell is happening?

793
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:30,035
Everything’s ruined!

794
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:31,102
It’s still not done?!

795
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,429
Bank.

796
00:38:32,454 --> 00:38:33,706
We’re still on the initial step,

797
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:34,832
but the plan isn’t being followed—

798
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:35,907
Wait!

799
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:38,167
Wait!

800
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:49,905
It doesn’t matter if
Kuya Fidel doesn’t text.

801
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:51,974
What matters is that he kills the power.

802
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,162
Let’s wait.

803
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,753
Can Kuya Fidel really pull this off?

804
00:39:23,923 --> 00:39:25,299
I’m out of time.

805
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:38,985
What now, Bank?

806
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:41,844
Looks like it’s not
happening, it’s almost 1:00 a.m.!

807
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:43,133
There’s still one minute.

808
00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:51,992
- Oh, thank god.
- Yes!

809
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:53,750
The power is off.

810
00:39:54,036 --> 00:39:54,845
Pat,

811
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,455
in 15 minutes you’ll go in.

812
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:09,510
Kuya Fidel will pretend to
be calling for an electrician.

813
00:40:10,094 --> 00:40:12,137
After 15 minutes of brownout,

814
00:40:12,763 --> 00:40:16,725
Pat will go in together with the real
electrician we hired for the building.

815
00:40:23,148 --> 00:40:24,566
Alright, take care.

816
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,328
Sir, let’s check your stuff.

817
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:29,154
Oh boy, you’re drenched in sweat.

818
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:31,875
Ah.

819
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,759
Ah, yes boss,

820
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:35,828
our vehicle’s aircon is broken.

821
00:40:35,828 --> 00:40:36,914
Is that so?

822
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,724
And boss, I really sweat a lot.

823
00:40:39,832 --> 00:40:40,499
Alright.

824
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:42,001
Please leave your cellphones here.

825
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:43,001
Okay.

826
00:40:45,904 --> 00:40:47,982
Please work quickly.

827
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:49,341
We’re chasing a deadline.

828
00:40:50,465 --> 00:40:51,492
Okay.

829
00:40:52,094 --> 00:40:56,031
Ah boss, may I use the
restroom? I really need to pee.

830
00:40:56,056 --> 00:40:58,075
Oh, Fidel, why are you still here?

831
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,019
Boss, I’ll accompany him to the restroom.

832
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:01,603
I really need to pee too.

833
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:03,497
Go on, take him to the restroom.

834
00:41:03,522 --> 00:41:04,415
Then,

835
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,607
head outside.

836
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:06,583
Thank you, boss.

837
00:41:06,608 --> 00:41:07,710
Quickly.

838
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:08,828
Thank you, boss.

839
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:13,173
Come with me.

840
00:41:13,198 --> 00:41:14,211
Okay, boss.

841
00:41:16,618 --> 00:41:17,618
Come here.

842
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:22,166
It smells bad here.

843
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:27,012
Why did you bring me here, bro?

844
00:41:27,037 --> 00:41:27,980
What happened?

845
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:29,102
Because...

846
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:30,766
the cellphone,

847
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:33,094
is missing.

848
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:38,307
The cellphone,

849
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:40,976
- is missing.
- Huh?

850
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:44,705
Bank, can we
still pull this off?

851
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:47,041
Almost 2:00 AM now but Pat
still hasn't sent anything.

852
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:48,078
Yeah, Bank.

853
00:41:48,525 --> 00:41:50,444
Lord, we are totally
blind out here.

854
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:52,654
And I'm so worried for Pat.

855
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:55,674
We don't have time left.

856
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:57,743
If they can't manage to
take pictures of the exam paper,

857
00:41:57,743 --> 00:42:00,079
I'll just do it myself and
I'll figure a way to get them.

858
00:42:00,871 --> 00:42:01,871
Bank!

859
00:42:02,836 --> 00:42:04,414
Why is there an
electrician here?

860
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,503
Sorry, but Boss
Choi asked me to say

861
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:09,588
that you're not needed now.

862
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:10,881
Wait, I'll call Choi.

863
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:12,766
Sorry Miss, it's not my fault.

864
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,149
I'm just doing my job.

865
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:18,514
What the hell?
What are you doing?

866
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:27,860
The person with you still
hasn't shown up. Where is he?

867
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:30,692
Check the CCTV monitor.

868
00:42:30,692 --> 00:42:32,236
We just need to
look for something.
