1
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:16,275
Please hurry with the work.

2
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,041
We’re chasing a deadline.

3
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:19,432
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:19,464 --> 00:00:21,354
The cellphone
is missing.

5
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,379
Huh?

6
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:23,971
How did you lose it?

7
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:25,018
Bank.

8
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:26,537
Can we still do this?

9
00:00:28,044 --> 00:00:30,175
It’s almost 2 AM, and Pat
still hasn’t sent anything.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,423
We’re out of time.

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,466
If they can’t take
pictures of the exams,

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,716
I’ll do it myself and find a way.

13
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:38,886
I thought you guys were smart,
why didn’t you think of this?

14
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:41,912
Out of all things,
you forget the breaker?

15
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,027
Why’s there an electrician here?

16
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:45,844
Sorry.

17
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,373
But Boss Choi asked me to
say you’re not needed now.

18
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,398
Ah, I see.

19
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:53,635
Choi usually calls us for this stuff.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,952
You’ll see me in the window.

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,730
Once I secure the test papers,

22
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:58,487
I’ll give the go signal.

23
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,737
Huh?

24
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,057
I won't sign that.

25
00:01:03,804 --> 00:01:05,607
Not until I see your colleague.

26
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:10,612
We got blocked by the guard.

27
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,597
The phone was
on me the whole time,

28
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,491
it was in my pocket
but I thought...

29
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:15,925
I thought he saw it!

30
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,950
Yes already!

31
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,287
I paid the guard so
he would let me in

32
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,040
and I paid him big so
he would let us out too.

33
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:23,240
That was the plan B.

34
00:01:23,265 --> 00:01:24,267
Guys!

35
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,186
There is something
wrong with the answers.

36
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,797
We are missing one, two, three,

37
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,222
six more items.

38
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,455
Bank has photographic memory.

39
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,386
If he can’t recite the answers,

40
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,153
maybe he didn’t really answer at all.

41
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,348
Just play along.

42
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,809
You won’t lose anything.

43
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:43,326
Just turn a
blind eye to this, Lin.

44
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,996
We should've
just listened to Lin.

45
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,690
We should've just stopped
and returned the money.

46
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,234
I've made all the arrangements.

47
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,802
You're going to the US.

48
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:52,362
You'll study there.

49
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,155
No. What about Grace?

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,824
It’s better if you break up.

51
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:58,859
Please wait.

52
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,037
Hold on a second.

53
00:02:02,214 --> 00:02:04,008
- What did you do?
- Sorry, Mom.

54
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:05,986
Sorry, Mom.

55
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,774
Grace.

56
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,842
Didn’t I tell you

57
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,385
to stay away from her?

58
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:16,584
Sis.

59
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:21,589
I don't think you
need to leave Possenti.

60
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:44,893
Hi.

61
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,505
I hope that the auditorium

62
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:52,422
gets done in time for
your batch's graduation.

63
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,243
You know,

64
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,809
I genuinely thought

65
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:01,297
either you, or Tristan would
be valedictorian of your class.

66
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,035
As it turns out,

67
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:08,210
in the history of Possenti,

68
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,242
the top

69
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:10,777
students

70
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:15,044
were also the ones who did the
most shameful act they could possibly do.

71
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:17,853
Maybe in the next tournament,

72
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,430
Possenti might also
make it to the championship

73
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,416
if Lin plays.

74
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:32,765
That is if you'll give her a chance

75
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,000
to be a scholar of Possenti.

76
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,379
Well, that's asking
for too much, Vin.

77
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:41,042
I know.

78
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:44,801
That’s why I’m thankful you
came so you could witness Lin.

79
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:46,775
that she could be
the student to win

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,635
all of your academic competitions,

81
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,745
if you give her a chance.

82
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,755
You're right.

83
00:03:54,967 --> 00:03:56,635
I mean, she's highly intelligent.

84
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:00,995
I would like to ask
for your forgiveness.

85
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:04,113
I'm truly sorry for
everything that happened.

86
00:04:05,046 --> 00:04:07,257
You could expel me, but...

87
00:04:07,558 --> 00:04:08,558
you didn't.

88
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,690
Right.

89
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:14,267
You should also be punished
like what happened to Tristan.

90
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:16,087
But,

91
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,216
you have shown remorse.

92
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,034
You surrendered
to the authorities.

93
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,346
Which brings me to my point.

94
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:26,869
I think, you don’t
need to leave Possenti.

95
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:29,644
But I need your help.

96
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,130
What is that?

97
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,225
This year,

98
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:39,032
applications opened

99
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:42,136
for Alami-Khatib Scholarship.

100
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,762
This only happens
every two years

101
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:46,443
for applicants.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,670
In my opinion, this is the
most difficult scholarship

103
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:51,960
compared to all.

104
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:58,569
You will be competing against
students from all over Southeast Asia.

105
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:01,941
And,

106
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,702
Lin, I think you’re the
only one who can win this

107
00:05:07,055 --> 00:05:08,139
in the whole school.

108
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:09,995
Bank, a letter for you.

109
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:23,310
Dear Bank,

110
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:25,963
I was planning on telling
you this in person.

111
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:29,286
but I know you don't
want to see me right now.

112
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,810
I recently read one
of Nietzsche's book.

113
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,765
There goes a quote, saying...

114
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,104
He who fights with monsters

115
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:39,799
might take care lest
he become a monster.

116
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,511
That's us.

117
00:06:41,872 --> 00:06:43,908
Together with Grace and Pat.

118
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,089
But sis...

119
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,017
That'd be the last, okay?

120
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,028
We might not get
away with it next time.

121
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:56,050
I need more time with Grace,

122
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,555
more travel dates with her,
more time for basketball.

123
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,806
And I can’t have that
if my grades are low.

124
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,800
So I just wanna make sure—

125
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,740
You’ll let me copy
again next semester, right?

126
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,185
Of course, you’re a scholar.

127
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:26,412
You don’t need tutorials
just to pass your exams.

128
00:07:26,971 --> 00:07:28,218
But what about the rest?

129
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:31,246
They’re smart in other ways,
but they’ll fail.

130
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:34,702
Their lives could be ruined
just because of one subject like calculus.

131
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:37,296
Can you really blame them?

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,293
Just leave them alone.

133
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,381
The system is cheating us.

134
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,549
Because if Possenti accepts bribes,

135
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,966
our miscellaneous fees can
reach one hundred thousand pesos,

136
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:51,614
even though we’re scholars.

137
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,641
The school was the first to cheat us.

138
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,312
Because of our thirst for revenge
on a rotten system,

139
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,532
we became rotten ourselves.

140
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:03,303
They wanted to cheat, right?

141
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:06,252
They should accept the fact
that they'll be cheated too.

142
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:09,884
I’ll memorize all the answers
then I’ll send them to you.

143
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,478
Didn’t you already
take the exam?

144
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,078
Can you memorize all of that?

145
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:16,688
I can, if I have enough time.

146
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:18,856
I tested it with
the remaining time

147
00:08:18,881 --> 00:08:21,105
I was able to memorize
half of the exam.

148
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:22,596
That means,

149
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,805
I can’t do this alone.

150
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,841
Someone has to help me.

151
00:08:29,097 --> 00:08:30,968
So you need someone else.

152
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,581
Who else is as smart as you?

153
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,635
We need your help.

154
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,505
We have a new plan.

155
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,059
What's the plan?

156
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,919
The National College Entrance Test.

157
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:51,651
NCET?

158
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,792
NCET.

159
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,160
There will be more clients.

160
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,029
Because the whole Philippines
will be taking that test.

161
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,504
Our lives are falling apart.

162
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:07,220
I'd rather go broke
than go back to my dad.

163
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,946
We're going to steal documents.

164
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,034
One small mistake and
for sure, we'll end up in jail.

165
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,038
That's why I decided to come clean.

166
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:20,362
That's the only way for this to end.

167
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:23,552
I thought I made the right choice.

168
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:26,445
But was my choice right for everyone?

169
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:31,936
Even though all of us were wrong,
you're the one that suffered the most.

170
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:51,411
Thank you, Grace.

171
00:09:51,436 --> 00:09:53,730
We'll post the results tomorrow.

172
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:55,880
Okay. Thank you.

173
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,043
Thank you.

174
00:10:03,034 --> 00:10:04,285
Grace is kinda good.

175
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:08,450
Too bad, Sherry's parents are
expecting her to be the lead.

176
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:11,186
They might pull their
donations out for the theater.

177
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:15,042
Maybe we can ask Grace's family
for donations?

178
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,536
They own a chain of
printing press, right?

179
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,983
Yeah.

180
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,802
You can ask her dad for donations.

181
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:24,898
Claire!

182
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,039
We had a deal, right?

183
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:31,981
If I give you the test answer,

184
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:35,375
you told me you will
not audition for the lead role.

185
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:37,308
You offered first, Grace.

186
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:40,022
You didn’t even give me a choice.

187
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,033
You just thought we had a deal,

188
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,684
but did you ever hear me say yes?

189
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,100
You traitor!

190
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Really?

191
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:49,763
That’s coming from you?

192
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,064
Don’t you feel bad for Lin?

193
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:53,969
Or Pat?

194
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,245
Your boyfriend?

195
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:59,306
You lied to them just
to get the lead part?

196
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:05,133
We can justify our actions,

197
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:08,079
there are lot's of reasons
why people cheat.

198
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,627
If you feel burdened,

199
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:12,061
you'll start to look
for the easier way.

200
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,067
Hey, man.

201
00:11:23,276 --> 00:11:24,934
If you need help
with your report.

202
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:28,086
You can just pay a guy,
to write it for you.

203
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,191
I know someone.

204
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,659
You want his number?

205
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,526
Sometimes, I think...

206
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:36,515
there's no end to this cheating.

207
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:39,189
It's a cycle.

208
00:11:39,739 --> 00:11:41,103
If you get cheated,

209
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:42,692
you'll cheat in return.

210
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,490
But is this how it’s going to be?

211
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:10,037
Ma’am, please buy some.

212
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,313
Sampaguita.

213
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:12,379
Okay, give me two.

214
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,525
Thank you.

215
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:27,944
But you know what?
I still have so many questions.

216
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:31,733
But earlier at school, when
I talked to Ma’am Perez,

217
00:12:31,946 --> 00:12:34,261
I also found the answer
I was looking for.

218
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:37,800
So, if I get the scholarship,

219
00:12:38,614 --> 00:12:39,915
Possenti will be recognized

220
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,202
under your term.

221
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,827
You’ll benefit from it too.

222
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:43,852
Is that right?

223
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:46,921
Okay, I know what
you’re thinking.

224
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:48,701
Lin, you know what?

225
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,186
That’s just how
the system works.

226
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:52,008
This is how the world works.

227
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,317
If that’s the case...

228
00:12:57,804 --> 00:12:59,839
Thank you, Ma'am Perez.

229
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,057
Huh?

230
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,878
What are you talking about?

231
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:06,685
If you win this scholarship,
you get to study here

232
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,710
and next year.

233
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:11,274
Your dreams of studying
abroad will come true.

234
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:14,210
Lin, come on.

235
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:17,545
I’ve just made
my final decision.

236
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,351
I don’t want to study
abroad anymore.

237
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:25,399
And if, as you say, this
is how the system works,

238
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,167
with all due respect,
I don’t want to be part of it.

239
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:37,143
Bank, you might not
agree with me, as usual.

240
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:40,114
Thank you, Ma’am Perez.

241
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,643
But I think I made
the right decision.

242
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,756
I haven’t apologized
to you personally.

243
00:13:54,614 --> 00:13:56,950
Sorry if you were the only
one who paid attention.

244
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:02,960
Well, that’s just
how the system is.

245
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:05,137
Of course, she has money.

246
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,781
It’s okay, Lin.

247
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:15,159
No one’s going
to pity me anyway.

248
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,471
I’ve accepted it.

249
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:21,185
There was really
nothing we could do.

250
00:14:24,747 --> 00:14:26,323
I just want to know one thing.

251
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,677
If you could turn back time,

252
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:31,720
would you still tell the
Education Commission

253
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,545
the truth if you knew
this would happen to me?

254
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,607
I’d still do it.

255
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,104
Then why are you apologizing?

256
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:47,909
Because I regret nothing.

257
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:53,460
I’m not sorry for
doing what’s right.

258
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:58,183
Maybe I’m sorry because I
couldn’t do anything to help you here.

259
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,995
And with everything else
that’s happening to you,

260
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,250
Your pity won't be of any help, Lin.

261
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:10,639
Why are you here?

262
00:15:11,525 --> 00:15:14,070
Maybe I just wanted to
see if you’re still around.

263
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,512
My friend Bank.

264
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:23,148
Maybe I’ll miss
the old Bank too.

265
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:28,933
The Bank who helped
that kid get his balloon back.

266
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,760
I miss him.

267
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,481
I miss the old Bank.

268
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,324
I just really need that toy.
My dad gave it to me.

269
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:50,168
You might fall trying to reach that.

270
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:54,518
You know, you’ll only reach that

271
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:56,096
if you grow taller.

272
00:15:56,141 --> 00:15:57,202
Okay, let me just help you.

273
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,266
Come here.

274
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:02,803
There.

275
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,067
Got it.

276
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:11,580
Actually, I was going to print
my application form,

277
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,931
but our printer at home is broken.

278
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,058
Then,

279
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:17,128
the computer rooms are closed too.

280
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:18,971
I’ll just go somewhere else.

281
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,435
Where do you think there’s one?

282
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,818
Oh, no. The computer shops
around here are far.

283
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,834
You still need to take a tricycle.

284
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,170
You'll hail a ride then find a jeep.

285
00:16:27,795 --> 00:16:28,795
Yeah, right.

286
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:30,364
Back in my old school,

287
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:32,297
there were printing shops everywhere.

288
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:34,362
This place is just too

289
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:35,934
exclusive.

290
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:38,362
You want me

291
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:39,723
to print it for you instead?

292
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,333
There’s a shop right across from us.

293
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:42,478
I’m already a regular there.

294
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:44,923
So you won’t have to stay out late.

295
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,200
I’ll give it to you on Monday.

296
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:47,497
Really?

297
00:16:48,852 --> 00:16:49,894
That's what friends do.

298
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:51,438
Okay.

299
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,767
Me too.

300
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,835
I miss my old self.

301
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:03,436
I'm sure,

302
00:17:03,461 --> 00:17:05,724
there's more to why
you're here.

303
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,492
Next week, your detention
period ends, right?

304
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:14,227
Yeah.

305
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:17,936
So, I have a proposal for you.

306
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,136
I want us to help
each other again.

307
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:26,458
Help? With what?

308
00:17:29,035 --> 00:17:34,499
As Aristotle once said, “Poverty is
the parent of revolution and crime.”

309
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:39,597
We’re suffering under our
education system, right?

310
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,730
But this time, I don’t
want to choose crime.

311
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:47,698
So that means...

312
00:17:48,306 --> 00:17:49,555
Revolution?

313
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,143
A quiet revolution.

314
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:55,909
And we'll start,

315
00:17:57,418 --> 00:17:58,460
with us.

316
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,650
I talked to Grace.

317
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,211
I really regret the things I did.

318
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:10,929
If you think about it,
it started with me.

319
00:18:23,691 --> 00:18:25,651
I know we just met but

320
00:18:25,676 --> 00:18:27,840
I was wondering if you could help me.

321
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,799
I heard you play and
you’re really good!

322
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:37,459
So I was thinking if you could
help me rehearse

323
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,902
while the others are not here yet.

324
00:18:38,927 --> 00:18:40,043
Is that okay?

325
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:42,475
Sure.

326
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,679
Well.

327
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,102
There’s this new rule.

328
00:18:49,251 --> 00:18:51,378
Everyone involved in
the school production must

329
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:55,676
at least have an 85 percent
minimum average.

330
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:57,467
Like, hello?

331
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,666
You know, my grades
have not even reached 82.

332
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:05,481
Why does the required
grade have to be so high?

333
00:19:05,585 --> 00:19:06,585
Right?

334
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:10,005
Like what does Algebra even
have to do with acting and singing?

335
00:19:12,176 --> 00:19:13,343
Uh, Grace.

336
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,155
If you want, I can
tutor you in Math.

337
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:21,586
If your grades go up, maybe you can
audition in the next production.

338
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,078
Sis.

339
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:33,324
Why are you crying?

340
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,308
I'm done for, sis.

341
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:41,295
I was up all night trying to
practice all of the problems.

342
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,309
I can't remember anything.
I don't know.

343
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:49,923
And if I fail this test,
I won’t be able to audition.

344
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,274
Just relax.

345
00:19:52,716 --> 00:19:55,093
When you see the problems,
you’ll remember.

346
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,903
You got this.

347
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,020
If I just studied hard,

348
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:10,111
maybe Lin wouldn't have given me
the answers to Mr. Sevilla's test.

349
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:21,125
I also wish, I didn't
tell Pat about Lin.

350
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:22,493
You’re a scholar.

351
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,765
That means you’re a smart girl.

352
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,060
But it also means you need other
people’s money to study.

353
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,770
Our money.

354
00:20:32,968 --> 00:20:34,541
So let’s help each other get what we need.

355
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,535
I wish, I stopped Pat from paying
Lin to give the answers.

356
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,104
You have nothing to lose, Kyle.

357
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,586
Just tell me who gave you the answers.

358
00:20:53,944 --> 00:20:54,944
Bank.

359
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:57,885
There you are.

360
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,570
Grace.

361
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:02,756
I wanted to talk to Kyle.

362
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:04,855
Alone.

363
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:07,247
Can’t you see that
we’re still talking?

364
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:09,834
Oh.

365
00:21:10,254 --> 00:21:11,925
You're not going to your audition?

366
00:21:12,531 --> 00:21:13,905
Did you forget?

367
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,294
Uhm, you're right.

368
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:21,697
Thanks for reminding me.

369
00:21:26,343 --> 00:21:27,970
Wait... Wait, wait!

370
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,663
Tony. Tony, please, please.

371
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:30,990
I'll do anything that you want.

372
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,916
Please, I just, I need you to help me.

373
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm begging you. Please.

374
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:36,449
There were many moments

375
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:39,018
where I could have done
something to make things right.

376
00:21:39,628 --> 00:21:41,678
But I always made a bad choice.

377
00:21:48,344 --> 00:21:49,428
No signal!

378
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,088
Sir, can I help you?

379
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:56,990
Ah, sir. I’m here to
pick up my girlfriend.

380
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:58,100
The one for the audition?

381
00:21:58,366 --> 00:21:59,788
Sir, what audition?

382
00:22:00,181 --> 00:22:01,766
There’s no audition here, sir.

383
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:04,014
Huh?

384
00:22:08,812 --> 00:22:09,938
Where have you been?

385
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:15,275
The auditions are
at the other studio.

386
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,493
You're quite early, hon.

387
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,273
Grace!

388
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:24,918
Stop making a fool out of me.

389
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:40,709
What!

390
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,734
What?

391
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:44,403
You don’t want me?

392
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,989
You don’t want me?
Huh?

393
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:47,216
Fuck it!

394
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:49,306
Pat.

395
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,329
Pat, wait. Pat!

396
00:22:53,114 --> 00:22:54,114
Pat!

397
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,950
Grace!

398
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,868
And so,

399
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:08,069
I ended up in this hot mess.

400
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,473
Not just by myself.

401
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:12,877
But with you guys.

402
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:14,707
Stop. Please.

403
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:17,525
To you Lin, and of course...

404
00:23:17,818 --> 00:23:19,096
And Pat too.

405
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,080
He was about to
rape you, Grace!

406
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,107
People I cared about were lost.

407
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:30,149
I want you, Grace,

408
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:35,954
to go with Pat to study
at Boston University.

409
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:38,133
I’ll cover all the expenses.

410
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:39,726
Why did you accept Boston?

411
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,961
Are you really that selfish?

412
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,946
You’ll do everything
just to get what you want?

413
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,367
I know that you’re
angry with me.

414
00:23:50,486 --> 00:23:52,196
I can feel it.

415
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:56,930
But deep down, I know
that you still love me.

416
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:06,483
Pat,

417
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:11,821
I just said yes to your dad’s
offer for me to study in Boston

418
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,153
because I know that that is the
only way that I can be with you.

419
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:27,193
I still love you, Pat.

420
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:30,362
But I don’t,

421
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:31,760
Yes, I loved you.

422
00:24:32,767 --> 00:24:34,185
But you hurt me.

423
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,103
You lied to my face.

424
00:24:38,739 --> 00:24:40,407
How can I love you after that?

425
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:53,343
Fine,

426
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,997
if you wanna end this right now

427
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,732
then admit to your
dad that we’re over.

428
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,909
It’ll only mean that you
don’t love me anymore.

429
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:17,046
I don’t wanna force myself onto
someone that doesn’t want me.

430
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:25,631
Okay.

431
00:25:25,656 --> 00:25:26,696
- D.
- D.

432
00:25:26,721 --> 00:25:27,763
- A.
- A.

433
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:28,869
B.

434
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:29,814
A.

435
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,695
B.

436
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,265
It's too late now to
undo my mistakes.

437
00:25:33,352 --> 00:25:34,352
Too bad.

438
00:25:34,404 --> 00:25:37,282
Even if I regret my
decisions, it's too late.

439
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:38,137
It's done.

440
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:40,156
But after all that's happened,

441
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:42,968
I can say that I have learned my lesson.

442
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:44,977
I'm sorry.

443
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,825
I don't want to leave you.

444
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,480
It's okay, hon.

445
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,805
You know, maybe your dad is right.

446
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:58,213
I am lucky.

447
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:00,652
Even if I did something bad,

448
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:03,768
I still have the support
of my dad and my friends.

449
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:05,824
Some people aren't as lucky.

450
00:26:06,276 --> 00:26:08,361
But that doesn't
mean I'm off the hook.

451
00:26:08,386 --> 00:26:12,133
Expectations are higher
because I have more to give.

452
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,450
I should use my talents
and blessings to help others.

453
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:17,475
Just like in acting,

454
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,669
They have a chain
of printing press, right?

455
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:23,273
The actor makes a choice
and commits to it.

456
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:24,611
Excuse me.

457
00:26:25,203 --> 00:26:26,203
Sorry.

458
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:27,916
Sorry.

459
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:34,117
This time, I'm choosing to play fair.

460
00:26:40,524 --> 00:26:41,984
If I only get the part

461
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:45,211
because of my dad's money
and not because of my talent,

462
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:47,936
then I don't want it.

463
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,940
But thank you.

464
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:16,335
And Pat too,

465
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,377
even if he’s abroad.

466
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,138
he’s still with us.

467
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:21,851
Thirty thousand.

468
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,418
Smart girl.

469
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:28,915
Thirty thousand?

470
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:30,695
Sure. No problem.

471
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,258
One condition.

472
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:35,986
Your score and Grace’s should be lower
than mine, so it’s not obvious.

473
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:38,467
Done.

474
00:27:39,173 --> 00:27:40,967
As long as my average is eighty-two.

475
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,328
I'm good.

476
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:44,571
Do we have a deal?

477
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:48,391
I learned way more
when I met you guys,

478
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,543
than in my first three
years of high school.

479
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:53,536
Those are the lessons they
don’t teach in the classroom.

480
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:57,819
Grace and I are lucky
we met you and Bank, Lin.

481
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:01,388
If it weren’t for you, I’d
probably still be the arrogant Pat.

482
00:28:01,531 --> 00:28:03,700
impatient and manipulative.

483
00:28:03,747 --> 00:28:04,748
Sorry, Banky.

484
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:05,982
I did not see you there!

485
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,577
Maybe your vision’s going blurry.

486
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,897
Why don’t you
get your eyes checked?

487
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,632
You're the one in the way.

488
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,524
You go get your eyes checked.

489
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:19,356
What?

490
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:22,430
Pick up my stuff, please.

491
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,677
Why would I do that?

492
00:28:25,308 --> 00:28:27,310
Your mess, your cleanup.

493
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:29,106
And if you still don’t get that,

494
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:31,398
then I don’t know,
you must just be plain dumb.

495
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:36,279
Who the fuck are you

496
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:38,598
to order me around
and call me dumb, huh?

497
00:28:38,664 --> 00:28:39,457
As a matter of fact,

498
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:41,035
why don’t you grab
my shirt and do the laundry,

499
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,103
you fucking bitch.

500
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,990
Why don’t you do it yourself?

501
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:45,681
You're embarrassed?

502
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:47,434
Aren’t you supposed to be cool?

503
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,827
You think you’re tough?
You wanna fight?

504
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,852
Chill!

505
00:28:49,877 --> 00:28:50,941
- Come on.
- Calm down.

506
00:28:51,235 --> 00:28:52,355
I don’t get it.

507
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:55,198
Why does it always
have to end in a fight?

508
00:28:56,662 --> 00:28:58,080
Is that all that goes on in your head?

509
00:28:58,105 --> 00:29:00,415
One more word,
you’re gonna fucking get it, bitch.

510
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,516
- Let’s go.
- Come on!

511
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,949
- Let’s go.
- Hit me!

512
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:04,641
- Hit me!
- Let’s go.

513
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:06,146
Hit me!

514
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:08,513
And you can even
say that I'm a genius

515
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,374
when it comes to convincing
people to do what I want.

516
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:13,387
Nice to meet you.

517
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:15,052
I’m Pat Tioseco.

518
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:20,290
We have contract signing here
and all meetings are recorded.

519
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,344
No one will snitch because
you’re already accomplices.

520
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:25,762
Cheating?

521
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
Nah.

522
00:29:27,593 --> 00:29:28,925
I like the word,

523
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:30,308
investment.

524
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,785
Investment for your future.

525
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:36,184
One test result is all it
takes to change your life.

526
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:37,489
I’m risking.

527
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:43,816
Can you help us get a copy
of the NCET exam paper?

528
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,110
Wait sir, okay?

529
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:50,722
It seems...

530
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:52,868
It seems difficult, that
thing you're asking because

531
00:29:53,014 --> 00:29:54,408
first, it's dangerous.

532
00:29:54,475 --> 00:29:56,169
Second, if Boss catches me,

533
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,487
I'll be in trouble.

534
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:58,512
You know, Ma'am,

535
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:00,239
he's still pissed at me.

536
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,426
- Maybe—
- Even if we pay you a hundred thousand?

537
00:30:04,474 --> 00:30:05,474
Chill.

538
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:07,315
You won't get caught.

539
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:08,828
I promise you.

540
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:12,516
I'm used to always getting what I want.

541
00:30:13,258 --> 00:30:14,843
So, let's work smart.

542
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:16,572
And let's work together.

543
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,441
Eraser.

544
00:30:27,483 --> 00:30:28,483
Give it to me.

545
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,194
What a waste of money.

546
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:54,278
Please send it.

547
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:00,906
Okay, got it.

548
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:10,385
- What's taking so long!
- My gosh!

549
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,006
Good luck, guys!

550
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:13,795
And I learned the hard way that
if you want to achieve something,

551
00:31:13,877 --> 00:31:15,645
there are no shortcuts.

552
00:31:16,112 --> 00:31:19,735
You will retake the STIC and get,

553
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,116
by studying, the high
marks that you got before.

554
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:25,275
Or else...

555
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,027
Or else you'll do what, Dad?

556
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:30,628
Whatever I do, I am never enough for you.

557
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,725
The phone was
on me the whole time

558
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,503
it was in my pocket but I
thought, I thought he saw it!

559
00:31:37,858 --> 00:31:39,831
- You bastard, Bank! Huh!
- Stop! Enough!

560
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,898
- Huh?
- Let go of me!

561
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:43,591
Please, I didn’t want it to be like this.

562
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:46,400
If you cheat, there
are no winners.

563
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:47,945
And sometimes,

564
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,060
You're so messed up...

565
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:51,673
you end up hurting
the people that you love.

566
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,010
You cheated because I cheated?

567
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,337
Out of all people, it’s Tony?

568
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,922
But I have to grow up
and be responsible,

569
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,819
disciplined and trustworthy.

570
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:16,759
And most of all,

571
00:32:17,277 --> 00:32:19,810
and the person my dad can be proud of.

572
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:21,953
- I love you hon.
- No more cheating.

573
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:24,443
In relationships,

574
00:32:24,617 --> 00:32:26,702
in school and in work.

575
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:29,436
what more when we become
managers and leaders someday?

576
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:33,229
what more when we
become managers and leaders.

577
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:34,930
I know someone.

578
00:32:35,478 --> 00:32:36,563
You want his number?

579
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,103
I'll pass on that, dude.

580
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:43,833
I'll try to do it myself.

581
00:32:44,937 --> 00:32:48,065
If I fail, it's all good.
At least I learned my lesson.

582
00:32:49,976 --> 00:32:50,976
Okay.

583
00:33:26,446 --> 00:33:28,657
I invited Pat and Grace
to help me,

584
00:33:28,682 --> 00:33:29,891
and they agreed.

585
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:32,826
Really? They agreed?

586
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:36,311
So, what's the plan?

587
00:33:37,695 --> 00:33:41,074
First of all, I’ll be
staying here for college.

588
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,356
I’ll become a teacher,

589
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,882
and when I graduate,

590
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:48,283
I’ll work for the
Commission on Education.

591
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,679
At least one of us
should get in there.

592
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,717
Pat and Grace, on the
other hand, will sponsor

593
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,233
a free tutorial program
for out-of-school youth

594
00:33:57,793 --> 00:33:59,308
using their network.

595
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:03,548
As for you, Bank,

596
00:34:05,729 --> 00:34:08,254
I want you to study law.

597
00:34:09,196 --> 00:34:11,782
You can take Public Administration
as your pre-law.

598
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:16,722
You want me to go
into public service?

599
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,215
I cheated on the STIC
and NCET, remember?

600
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:27,396
That’s exactly why.
You’re the smartest cheater.

601
00:34:29,813 --> 00:34:32,579
And maybe it takes
a good cheater

602
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:36,816
to redesign a system without
cheating and corruption.

603
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:43,438
All that corruption should
stop with our generation, right?

604
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,631
Okay, visiting hours are over.

605
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:50,672
Bank, let’s go back inside.

606
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:54,328
The decision is yours, Bank.

607
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:05,786
It wasn’t hard to
answer Lin’s question.

608
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:08,693
Because no matter
how smart you are…

609
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:10,195
Colegio de San Gabriel Possenti?

610
00:35:10,905 --> 00:35:14,784
3.14159265358979.

611
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:18,531
We're rivals for the scholarship
until we graduate.

612
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:21,262
So someone will win,
someone will lose.

613
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:22,868
Deal with it.

614
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:27,213
No matter how hard you consider
all the variables,

615
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:31,027
your heart will
always win in the end.

616
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,920
If we just learn to listen to
what our hearts are saying,

617
00:35:36,195 --> 00:35:38,356
we can make the right choices.

618
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:56,261
Thank you, Doc.

619
00:35:57,854 --> 00:36:00,214
It feels so good to the ears, right?

620
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,412
Doctor...

621
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:04,568
Bangkat.

622
00:36:05,001 --> 00:36:06,847
But what ruled me
instead were anger,

623
00:36:07,754 --> 00:36:08,754
envy,

624
00:36:09,143 --> 00:36:12,188
and the desire to outsmart the
system that made our lives difficult.

625
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:15,044
I chose the wrong path.

626
00:36:15,649 --> 00:36:16,649
And in the end,

627
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:20,136
I became no different from
the people I used to despise.

628
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:28,525
I’m sorry to disappoint you, Ma’am, but…

629
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:33,898
Starting today,

630
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:37,657
I won’t let my intelligence be used
for the wrong reasons anymore—

631
00:36:38,511 --> 00:36:40,211
for deceiving others.

632
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,478
Hold on a second.

633
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,966
- What did you do?
- Sorry, Mom.

634
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:47,538
Sorry, Mom.

635
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:48,731
Don't worry, Tristan.

636
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:51,979
Tristan, I’ll get a good lawyer.

637
00:36:52,004 --> 00:36:53,339
I won’t abandon you.

638
00:36:53,364 --> 00:36:55,725
Remember that.
I’m right here.

639
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,214
Come on now, come with us.

640
00:36:57,214 --> 00:37:00,051
- Please wait.
- Mom, don’t leave me.

641
00:37:00,076 --> 00:37:01,255
Come now, come with us.

642
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,303
Come now, come on!

643
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,846
- Mom!
- Wait! Wait!

644
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:04,914
Mom!

645
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,933
Mom, no! Come with me!

646
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,433
Mom!

647
00:37:15,048 --> 00:37:16,048
No, Mom.

648
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:18,686
I’ll make it up to you.

649
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:25,006
I’ll still give you a good life,

650
00:37:25,124 --> 00:37:26,587
no matter what happens.

651
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,940
And if I achieve the dreams
Mom and I once shared,

652
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:35,048
I’ll proudly say I
earned it the right way.

653
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:41,770
I wouldn’t have learned
this if it weren’t for Grace,

654
00:37:42,142 --> 00:37:43,152
Pat,

655
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,177
and most of all,

656
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:45,528
Lin.

657
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:48,457
We’re just both finding ways

658
00:37:48,482 --> 00:37:50,581
to change our situation, right?

659
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:56,638
Life in the Philippines is
hard if you’re not born rich.

660
00:37:57,855 --> 00:38:00,096
But are we just
going to give up?

661
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:03,080
Of course not—we’ll
just work harder, right?

662
00:38:03,592 --> 00:38:05,533
That’s our fight now.

663
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:09,464
I never thought that

664
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:12,058
the reason for my
first trip abroad is

665
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:14,678
because I’m an accomplice in
an international cheating scheme.

666
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:15,703
Hey!

667
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:45,094
Like them,

668
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:49,178
I chose to use the same
intelligence that set me free

669
00:39:49,883 --> 00:39:51,236
to help free others.

670
00:39:51,865 --> 00:39:52,908
Good, or bad,

671
00:39:53,742 --> 00:39:55,298
can be a genius.

672
00:39:56,183 --> 00:39:57,977
The choice is yours.
