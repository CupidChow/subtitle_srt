00:00:08,165 --> 00:00:08,745
What?

4
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:11,193
What's this?

5
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:22,194
Good grief.

6
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:27,297
Whose is this?

7
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,241
What's that?

8
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:15,600
These writing and pictures were
fallen on the ground there.

9
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,506
[...REALLY...]

10
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:20,050
It's definitely not ours.

11
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,998
Looks like someone made these.

12
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:47,910
This time, I will give
the book directly.

13
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:52,115
Meet me tomorrow morning.

14
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,331
From Lee Mong Heon.

16
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,623
I've never seen this book.

00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:04,185
[...THEY TOO...]

19
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,629
Good grief!

20
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:44,668
No, no. It's impossible.
How can I sell books that don't exist?

21
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:45,914
- Come on.
- Where can I find it?

22
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:48,705
I'll look for the book later.

23
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:50,974
You guys go home first.

24
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:51,907
Where is the book?

25
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:54,122
I told you there isn't any.

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,146

27
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,147
Seriously!

28
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:02,485
- There isn't any.
- Geez.

29
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:05,722
Oh my God, how could that be?

30
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,180
Pleased to meet you.

31
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:33,370
I am the publisher at
Cheongwoon Trading,

32
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,984
the person in charge of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

33
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,770
Let me introduce myself.

34
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:57,474
I am...

35
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:00,355
...the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

36
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,012
Lee Mong Heon.

[SHOP]

38
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:13,777
I had a feeling that,

39
00:04:14,703 --> 00:04:19,576
you might be Lee Mong Heon.

40
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:25,914
How did you know?

41
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:32,776
Have you forgotten?
the first day we met?

42
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:36,105
You disguised yourself as a man and went to the HouseGisaeng Cheongwoon to watch...

43
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:41,270
...Prince Hwa Seong lose
his virginity, right?

44
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:47,023
I saw him little thing awake
when he was asleep.

45
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,760
I curious about other people.

46
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:52,036
Aren't you curious?

47
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,303
The clothes you wore that day
very familiar to my eyes.

48
00:04:56,327 --> 00:05:00,366
I wondered for a moment about
where I had seen those clothes.

49
00:05:01,195 --> 00:05:03,113
They looked the same as
Lee Mong Heon's clothes...

50
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:06,075
...who had been secretly
delivering CHun Hwa's Love Story.

51
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:10,480
That's why I got more and more interested in you.

52
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:12,761
I see.

53
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:15,251
Even though I was careful.

54
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:30,202
But why did you ask to meet today
as Lee Mong Heon?

55
00:05:31,215 --> 00:05:35,605
Didn't you intend to
keep the fact that you are...

56
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:37,674
...the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story a secret?

57
00:05:37,698 --> 00:05:40,443
I am in a position right now
where I can't hide the fact anymore.

58
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:45,035
A few days ago,
My brother caught Kim Min Hong...

59
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,496
...thinking that he
was Lee Mong Heon.

60
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,421
He is silently trying to find
those involved in the book.

61
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,603
Had I not gotten there on time,

62
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:57,594
I wouldn't have known
that he was arrested.

63
00:05:58,406 --> 00:06:00,075
How did that happen?

64
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:05,330
Why did he think Kim Min Hong
was Lee Mong Heon?

65
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:09,183
The suspicion was based on the book's paintings
looking similar to Kim Min Hong's painting style.

66
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:15,378
So Kim Min Hong readily admitted it.

67
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:24,174
He knows that I am Lee Mong Heon.

68
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:30,126
He took the blame to
save me.

69
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:34,034
Nobody should know
that he is here.

70
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:37,305
- Make sure no one comes here.
- Good.

71
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:38,571
Yes, Your Honor.

72
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:55,666
Could you polease check
if Kim Min Hong is okay?

73
00:06:56,176 --> 00:06:57,587
Yes, alright.

74
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:00,790
I will find a way to
meet him as soon as possible.

75
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:05,540
Trust me and stay put, Princess.

76
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:11,655
If things get worse, I
will reveal my identity to Father...

77
00:07:12,213 --> 00:07:14,816
...to prove Kim Min Hong's
innocence.

78
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:22,450
What brings Princess here?

79
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:24,478
You're Kim Min Hong, right?

80
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:27,736
You are a famous artist
who works at the academy,

81
00:08:27,834 --> 00:08:31,514
So I asked for Father's permission
to come see your paintings.

82
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:35,218
How did you manage
to paint like this?

83
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:38,600
Is this line drawn?

84
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:42,125
I don't think too much about it, I
just draw based on feeling.

85
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:53,436
You are really amazing!

86
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:58,641
Artist Kim, would you mind teaching me?

87
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:02,024
Artist Kim? You needn't
address me so formally, Princess.

88
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:05,715
So, starting today,
will you be my teacher?

89
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:39,816
It is very difficult to draw duck feathers.

90
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:42,002
In this shadow section,

91
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,464
if you make a line with
darker and lighter black ink,

92
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:46,689
the nuance will be more pronounced.

93
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:49,171
- Wow!
- Like this.

94
00:09:55,315 --> 00:09:57,049
It really looks
like real feathers.

95
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,635
Yes, good job.

96
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:17,017
Even though I draw
for various reasons,

97
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,527
I only hope for one thing.

98
00:10:21,415 --> 00:10:24,811
I hope the feeling I get
when drawing it...

99
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:28,865
...can be delivered
to the person who sees it.

100
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:36,506
Isn't the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story also
writing the book with the same hope?

101
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:56,292
Are you sure that Kim Min Hong
is Lee Mong Heon?

102
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:00,229
You know how
dangerous this is, right?

103
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:04,127
Because you're arresting people
without reporting to the King,

104
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:07,703
if something goes wrong,
we might lose our lives.

105
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:11,153
This time I'm sure.

106
00:11:11,849 --> 00:11:15,945
I even managed to find the
original copy of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

107
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:21,918
The person may feel safe drawing
behind the pen name of Lee Mong Heon.

108
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:28,391
However, he didn't know that I
found the bread crumbs he left behind...

109
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:31,093
...in the pictures in this book.

110
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:43,172
Look at this.

111
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:52,170
That duck.

112
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:03,912
Indeed, Kim Min Hong started
publishing through Choi Hwan...

113
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:06,962
...long before
he held a government position.

114
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:12,270
Writing and printing. It seems
they both have worked together for a long time.

115
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:13,767
Now what should we do?

116
00:12:14,327 --> 00:12:19,508
Before Father gets to know,
should we get finished with Kim Min Hong for good?

117
00:12:19,532 --> 00:12:21,562
Kim Min Hong and Choi Hwan
have worked together.

118
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:25,663
Let's say we shut his mouth,
we can't shut Choi Hwan's mouth.

119
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:29,852
Why did Father free
Choi Hwan just like that?

120
00:12:30,164 --> 00:12:32,182
Choi Hwan is a clever man,
so maybe...

121
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,223
...he found a way to escape the King.

122
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:38,443
We must not act
carelessly towards Choi Hwan...

123
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,811
...until are
certain. Remember that.

124
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:45,180
Okay.

125
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:56,691
Kim Min Hong.

126
00:12:57,137 --> 00:13:01,651
No. What should it be now?
Sould I call you Lee Mong Heon?

127
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:07,657
After being promoted and
freely moving around the palace...

128
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:12,360
...you managed to make
this without people knowing.

[CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY]

130
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:18,000
Why did you write a book like this?

131
00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:22,338
Don't you know that
my family is in trouble?

132
00:13:24,508 --> 00:13:26,568
I wrote the book to make a living.

133
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:33,797
I heard your paintings are very rare.
So they are traded at a high price.

134
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:37,153
You said you wrote this book
just to earn money?

135
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,589
Do you think I will
believe you?

136
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:44,226
Whether you believe it or not,
it is your choice.

137
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:48,415
Well then, let me
ask another question.

138
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:51,313
How much do you know?

139
00:13:52,782 --> 00:13:56,172
Your answer will determine
whether you will live or die.

140
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:59,442
How much do you know
about Hwa Ing's actions?

141
00:14:00,315 --> 00:14:02,712
I do not understand what you mean.

142
00:14:03,148 --> 00:14:06,219
In which part of the book is
Hwa Ing's name mentioned?

143
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:10,786
I just write stories that
I imagine will entertain people.

144
00:14:19,215 --> 00:14:20,863
Are you going to continue acting like this?

145
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:25,019
Chun Hwa's Love Story seems to...

146
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:27,759
...represent the voice of the people
under the pen name Lee Mong Heon.

147
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:30,539
Do you want to gain fame?

148
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:32,141
If you disappear,

149
00:14:32,165 --> 00:14:36,278
Aren't you curious about
the fate of your remaining family?

150
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:42,051
There is one way
you can stay alive.

151
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,161
As the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story,

152
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:50,359
only you can testify that
Hwa Ing's bad reputation is baseless.

153
00:14:57,015 --> 00:14:59,628
Think about while you still have some time.

154
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:03,339
You don't have long.

155
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,122
Your Majesty, it's time to meet
Her Highness the Crown Princess.

156
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,628
Is it time?

157
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:29,765
The appointed hour is near,
Your Majesty must hurry.

158
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:19,849
I am entering now, Your Honor.

159
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,497
Your Honour.

160
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:39,969
His Highness the Crown Prince
is not at his residence.

161
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:44,907
Okay.

162
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:34,843
His Highness the Crown Prince
is not at his residence.

163
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:37,079
What?

164
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,787
How could that be...

165
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:56,425
There is not much time.

166
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:58,640
You don't have any serious injuries, right?

167
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:00,237
No.

168
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:02,831
The Princess is very worried about you.

169
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:05,234
Me too.

170
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:08,996
I'm prepared for whatever happens.

171
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,475
Please tell the Princess
not to worry about me.

172
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,712
Why did you take the blame?

173
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:18,527
Don't you regret it?

174
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:23,552
It all started because of me,
then I have to be responsible.

175
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,257
It is just...

176
00:21:30,816 --> 00:21:33,171
I'm worried about my family.

177
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,331
What will happen to them in the future?

178
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:43,905
If something happens to me,

179
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,110
may I ask you
to take care of my family?

180
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,484
Don't worry.

181
00:21:56,816 --> 00:22:01,190
I will take responsibility
to protect your family.

182
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,228
Thank You.

183
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:09,631
I trust you.

184
00:22:23,382 --> 00:22:24,847
Seriously?

185
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:30,221
You are really persistent.

186
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:33,041
This has been going on for
more than two days. Aren't you tired?

187
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:34,661
Why keep looking for me?

188
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:39,228
There's no way that I can know how
Kim Min Hong is. So, of course, I'm worried.

189
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:42,097
You do not need to know.
Just go home.

190
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:45,601
Brother, he's not the writer of
Chun Hwa's Love Story.

191
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,769
Lee Mong Heon is someone else!

192
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:48,981
You!

193
00:22:57,215 --> 00:23:00,237
The evidence is clear,
but you are still acting like this.

194
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:03,394
If the evidence is clear,
you should have submitted it to the court.

195
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:06,121
Why keep it a secret?

196
00:23:08,582 --> 00:23:10,325
I have to meet him.

197
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:11,927
Where is he?

198
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:13,962
Hey!

199
00:23:13,986 --> 00:23:18,033
Kim Min Hong needs to be kept captive
because he still hasn't confessed.

200
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:21,837
Father already freed
Choi Hwan, the publisher.

201
00:23:21,861 --> 00:23:24,944
So, we have to get
a clear confession from him...

202
00:23:25,928 --> 00:23:27,876
...so that our efforts are not in vain.

203
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:32,714
This is why women
are unreliable.

204
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:38,125
I Heard Chun Hwa's Love Story's
first volume tells your story.

205
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:44,245
The author secretly loves you.
He even painted your portrait.

206
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,763
Is that why you sympathize with him?

207
00:23:47,787 --> 00:23:49,464
Watch your words.

208
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:55,303
If you continue to behave like this,
I will not remain silent either.

209
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:57,706
Then what will you do?

210
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:04,780
This is all for the common good.
Also for your own good.

211
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:09,351
This opportunity must be utilized
to restore order in this chaotic situation.

212
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:14,556
I'll take care of this.

213
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:18,952
So, don't interfere anymore. Understand?

214
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:44,319
His Highness the Crown Prince has arrived.

215
00:24:57,845 --> 00:24:59,434
Why did you call me, Mother?

216
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:05,273
Where were you last night?

217
00:25:11,415 --> 00:25:13,415
I'm went out for a while
to get a breath of fresh air.

218
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:16,685
Wasn't yesterday the night you had to be
together with the Crown Princess?

219
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,123
She is already having a hard time
because she has't gotten pregnant.

220
00:25:21,147 --> 00:25:23,959
Why did you leave her
alone on such an important day?

221
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:28,530
Is it true you that
you went to meet another woman?

222
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:35,637
You all are too much.

223
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:40,208
Do I have to be supervised every time
that the appointed night comes?

224
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:42,242
As an adult man,

225
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:46,615
do I have to ask your permission
to meet a woman?

226
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:49,418
You are not an ordinary man.

227
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:52,754
You are the Crown Prince, the
future successor of this country.

228
00:25:52,778 --> 00:25:55,323
Giving birth to the heir is your duty.

229
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,260
That's precisely why I
feel suffocated and can't stand it anymore.

230
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:01,437
For a night
with the Crown Princess,

231
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:03,417
there must be a specific date and time
which is considered good.

232
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:07,069
Then, I have to do the deed
with everyone watching.

233
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:10,272
It's not just you who
feels the pressure.

234
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:13,512
You never
thinking about the burden that must be...

235
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:15,729
...borne by the Crown Princess,

236
00:26:15,753 --> 00:26:17,941
who has to go through this every month...

237
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:20,582
...with so many eyes watching?

238
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:23,752
Then what should I do?

239
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,022
I really can't stand it anymore.

240
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:29,943
(sighs)

241
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:42,437
I don't know who that woman is.

242
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:45,885
However, if you really
feel so stressed,

243
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:49,945
then bring her
before me officially.

244
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:53,083
It is a form of respect
for the Crown Princess Consort...

245
00:26:53,108 --> 00:26:55,083
...and also for the woman.

246
00:26:56,816 --> 00:27:01,756
Did you know that
The Crown Prince has another woman?

247
00:27:08,682 --> 00:27:11,500
What have you been doing all this time?

248
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:14,593
I brought you to the palace
because of your beautiful face,

249
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,040
but you can't hold back his heart,
now he has moved on to another woman.

250
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:20,975
Forgive me.

251
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:24,112
What if that woman
becomes pregnant?

252
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:26,848
You are really useless.

253
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,918
Useless?

254
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,822
How can you say that?

255
00:27:35,816 --> 00:27:38,150
Is a woman
useless just because...

256
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:40,143
...she isn't getting any attention
from the Crown Prince?

257
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:44,399
If so, is she
also a useless woman?

258
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:47,736
I'm not talking about her.

259
00:27:48,215 --> 00:27:50,338
You are different from her.

260
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:53,842
You are the future queen.

261
00:27:53,987 --> 00:27:59,461
So, can I be useful
if I become the queen?

262
00:28:00,816 --> 00:28:02,517
What do you mean?

263
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:06,221
If I can't conceive, I
can't be queen.

264
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:08,390
Does that mean I
am a useless person?

265
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:11,003
Whatever happens, you have to be the queen.

266
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:14,429
You must become the queen.

267
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:19,834
Being queen is the highest honor
that can be enjoyed by a woman.

268
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,704
Is it really an honor?

269
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:25,040
How can you say that even after
seeing me like this?

270
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:29,945
I struggled to get in
a child from our family to the palace.

271
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:32,103
All this is done for you.

272
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,882
That's not what I wanted.

273
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:37,670
From being born into the Kim family to
sitting in the position of Crown Princess,

274
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:40,028
just once, has there been anyone
who asked for my opinion...

275
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,970
...in determining my life?

276
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:47,162
So, never say
that all this was done for me.

277
00:28:47,186 --> 00:28:48,904
Better to be honest...

278
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:51,437
...and say that this is all
for the glory of Your Honor and Your father.

279
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:52,465
Crown Princess!

280
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:56,238
If you you have finished speaking,
I'll take my leave now.

281
00:29:26,282 --> 00:29:27,749
Her Highness the Crown Princess!

282
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:36,594
Your Majesty must also be worried,

283
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:40,815
but thank you very much
for still defending me.

284
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:45,020
I'm not defending you,
so you don't need to thank me.

285
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:48,623
I'm just expressing my thoughts.

286
00:30:01,415 --> 00:30:05,440
If you show a serious expression
like that, I immediately felt scared.

287
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:06,540
[WISDOM]

288
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:10,312
What do you want to say?
What's the shocking news this time?

289
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:12,689
Older brother.

290
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:16,277
Yeah, tell me what happened.

291
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:22,717
It seems that Hwa Ing has
causing trouble again.

292
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:30,679
He mistook Kim Min Hong for Lee
Mong Heon, author of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

293
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,904
He caught her and took her
to Minister Il Jae's house.

294
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:35,337
What? Is that true?

295
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:36,471
Correct.

296
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:41,908
It's rumored that the third volume of
Chun Hwa's Love Story is about Brother Hwa Ing.

297
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:46,748
It seems like Brother Hwa Ing wants to
get done with Kim Min Hong without telling Father.

298
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:50,085
This time, he has crossed the line.

299
00:30:52,749 --> 00:30:54,322
Nevertheless,
we are brothers.

300
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,209
We can't draw a sword at
our own family.

301
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,890
That is why we must
stop him immediately.

302
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:04,215
With Prince Hwa Ing's reckless nature,

303
00:31:05,116 --> 00:31:08,103
if he makes careless decisions,
things will only get worse.

304
00:31:09,907 --> 00:31:10,987
Since Brother Hwa Ing,

305
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:13,818
won't listen to a single
thing I say,

306
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:17,221
I beg you to try and persuade him.

307
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:19,539
Teacher Kim Min Hong really...

308
00:31:20,186 --> 00:31:21,833
...isn't Lee Mong Heon.

309
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,540
Brother Hwa Ing
misunderstood the situation.

310
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,030
Are you sure?

311
00:31:33,495 --> 00:31:35,635
I know who the author is...

312
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,516
...of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

313
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:40,535
How do you know that?

314
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,316
For now, I can't
explain it in detail.

315
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:47,331
But please believe me,

316
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:49,727
and prevent Brother Hwa Ing,

317
00:31:50,128 --> 00:31:52,352
from committing evil deeds again.

318
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:54,306
(sighs)

319
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,858
Okay.

320
00:32:02,905 --> 00:32:04,733
I will go meet him.

321
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,180
I don't know how long it's been
since we last...

322
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:26,066
sat face-to-face like this,

323
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:28,388
sipping wine together.

324
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:32,162
Since I got married and left the palace,

325
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:34,237
It's been hard to plan meet-ups...

326
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:35,901
...and it seems like it might have
been the same for you.

327
00:32:38,718 --> 00:32:40,045
That happens naturally...

328
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:42,737
...since the both of us
are living our own lives.

329
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,140
Unlike the stiff and rigid Crown Prince,

330
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:51,035
You and I have always been up to some mischief
together since childhood.

331
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:56,049
We once stepped on the hem of a skirt
of one of the ladies-in-waiting until they tripped,

332
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:00,027
threw the book into the water
because we hated studying.

333
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:03,548
Your Highness the Prince.

334
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:05,854
Your Honour.

335
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,848
We even left the palace
together one day,

336
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:10,938
and we got lost and started crying.

337
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:15,020
Yeah, we did that.

338
00:33:18,313 --> 00:33:19,353
Brother.

339
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:24,337
I'm worried about you.

340
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:26,984
What now?

341
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:30,224
What did you hear and from whom
did you hear it?

342
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:32,720
What is it that makes you look
at me like that?

343
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,243
Princess Hwa Ri is
very worried about you too.

344
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:42,815
Was it the Princess who sent you here?

345
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,107
Just now, you were buttering me
up and calling me "Brother".

346
00:33:45,616 --> 00:33:47,623
but in the end, you too, are siding
with your sister and not your half-brother.

347
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:49,256
Do not say that.

348
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,530
Do we really have many siblings?

349
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:54,229
Both the Crown Prince and you,

350
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,610
To me, you both are equally
valuable brothers to me.

351
00:33:57,506 --> 00:34:01,006
You know very well, I struggle
with explaining things properly.

352
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,629
Whatever you plan on doing,

353
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:09,028
please stop.

354
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:12,880
Right now, the rumors from
Chun Hwa's Love Story...

355
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,463
has put you through
a lot of scrutiny.

356
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:18,700
In circumstances like this, it's best
to stay humble and dead silent.

357
00:34:19,173 --> 00:34:20,233
Both you and I,

358
00:34:20,778 --> 00:34:23,518
the more we live as if nothing exists,
the safer we are.

359
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:26,543
Please, Brother.

360
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:30,243
Don't do anything else.

361
00:34:33,003 --> 00:34:34,548
Don't do anything?

362
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:37,337
Whatever...

363
00:34:39,718 --> 00:34:42,595
...everyone just tells me
to do nothing.

364
00:34:46,414 --> 00:34:48,521
Now you're saying the same thing?

365
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:52,415
You are a legitimate descendant,
while I am a concubine's child!

366
00:34:52,877 --> 00:34:54,982
I'm being trampled on and have to stay quiet?

367
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:58,978
At least by wriggling,
I can survive!

368
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:01,198
- Bro...
- I will take care of my own affairs!

369
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:07,636
You don't have to interfere.

370
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:49,101
His Majesty ordered to
bring you to the Palace.

371
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,525
Was the journey tiring?

372
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:09,003
I didn't even walk here.

373
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:12,330
I came in a carriage.
So I was comfortable.

374
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:53,018
The night view
in this place is so beautiful.

375
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:55,719
I really wanted to
show it to you.

376
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:02,516
I see.

377
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,611
Yes.

378
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,517
So, how was your day today?

379
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:16,019
Not much different from usual.

380
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,207
Taking care of housework,

381
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:21,739
teaching Hangul to children,

382
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:24,314
then going to the market,

383
00:38:24,814 --> 00:38:26,807
and seeing how the world works.

384
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:38,705
Don't you want to live in a palace?

385
00:38:52,424 --> 00:38:53,530
I don't.

386
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,712
I...

387
00:38:57,414 --> 00:38:59,720
...prefer to live freely like now.

388
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:05,631
How can I, after living without
limits for so long,

389
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:10,000
possibly survive such a strict
life in the Palace?

390
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:16,523
Is that so?

391
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:20,426
Of course.

392
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:26,945
Okay.

393
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:29,153
If you don't want to
live here,

394
00:39:30,024 --> 00:39:31,244
I won't talk about
it anymore.

395
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:53,617
Hey, let's run away.

396
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,023
- Hey!
- Brother, wait for me.

397
00:40:00,313 --> 00:40:03,300
His Highness the Grand Prince.

398
00:40:04,412 --> 00:40:06,619
- His Highness the Grand Prince.
- Your Honour.

399
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:08,419
- Your Honour.
- Your Honour.

400
00:40:08,444 --> 00:40:09,706
His Highness the Grand Prince.

401
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:12,444
- His Highness the Grand Prince.
- His Highness the Grand Prince.

402
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:15,336
- Your Honour.
- Your Honour.

403
00:40:15,364 --> 00:40:17,302
Where have you been?

404
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,014
Should have gone with us.

405
00:40:20,214 --> 00:40:22,314
- It doesn't matter.
- Does not matter.

406
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,200
It's okay, don't cry.

407
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:57,434
Did something happen?

408
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:05,513
We grew from the same roots,

409
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:12,831
but why are our paths so different?

410
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:27,521
Come here.

411
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:55,222
Getting older is,

412
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,520
very unpleasant,

413
00:42:01,804 --> 00:42:02,917
right?

414
00:42:07,601 --> 00:42:08,647
Yes

415
00:42:55,812 --> 00:42:57,345
It didn't go well?

416
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:00,635
Yes

417
00:43:06,802 --> 00:43:07,835
Can we,

418
00:43:09,502 --> 00:43:11,195
turn a blind eye to brother's affairs?

419
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,570
But what if Teacher
Kim Min Hong gets in danger?

420
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:17,823
Since you and I already
know about this?

421
00:43:20,453 --> 00:43:22,793
I don't think he will
cross the line

422
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:25,432
The limits we we have in mind...

423
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:29,435
are different from
Brother Hwa Ing's.

424
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,028
That's what worries me.

425
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,522
Well then, now we
have to find a way by any means,

426
00:43:40,508 --> 00:43:42,428
to get him out of the house.

427
00:43:43,512 --> 00:43:44,912
As long as Prince Hwa Ing
and Minister Il Jae...

428
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:47,035
think that Kim Min Hong
is Lee Mong Heon,

429
00:43:49,425 --> 00:43:50,708
we don't know what
they will do...

430
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:52,266
to him as the author of
Chun Hwa's Love Story.

431
00:43:59,315 --> 00:44:00,428
What should I do?

432
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:03,541
Should I reveal that I am
Lee Mong Heon right now?

433
00:44:31,318 --> 00:44:33,558
So, have you thought about it?

434
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:36,335
What are you talking about?

435
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:41,022
I already said that
if you just admit,

436
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:44,220
that the third volume of Chun Hwa's Love Story
is not about Prince Hwa Ing,

437
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,519
then I will give you
chance to live.

438
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:48,541
If you do that,

439
00:44:49,226 --> 00:44:51,532
I will even ask
His Majesty to save you.

440
00:44:53,613 --> 00:44:56,526
You also have to think about your family
which must be worrying you.

441
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,746
How can I write that confession,

442
00:45:05,112 --> 00:45:07,705
while I can't even
ensure the safety of my family?

443
00:45:09,678 --> 00:45:12,058
Since being arrested not in prison
but in a secluded room,

444
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:15,040
I believe my death is imminent.

445
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:17,328
What did you say?

446
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:20,776
How dare you talk like that
after being given leeway!

447
00:45:29,315 --> 00:45:30,421
Look at this bastard.

448
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:41,358
Your life may be worthless to you,

449
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:44,330
but what about the lives of the family
whom you love so much?

450
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:47,216
What will you do?

451
00:45:48,304 --> 00:45:50,038
I'm not a patient person.

452
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:51,432
Absolutely not.

453
00:45:52,114 --> 00:45:54,107
I'll give you one night.

454
00:45:54,813 --> 00:45:55,926
Think carefully,

455
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:58,325
and write what you need to write.

456
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,411
Princess.

457
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:46,956
Have you been well so far?

458
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:49,484
I heard you passed the national exam,

459
00:46:49,509 --> 00:46:51,371
as the highest scorer
and that you started working too.

460
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:53,534
That's really good news.

461
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,273
The official uniform suits you very well.

462
00:46:59,902 --> 00:47:00,948
Thank You.

463
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:03,348
By the way,

464
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:05,413
did something happen?

465
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:08,235
You look so worried.

466
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,883
Let's move somewhere else for a moment.

467
00:47:18,023 --> 00:47:19,430
What really happened?

468
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:22,835
Actually,

469
00:47:25,937 --> 00:47:27,144
Kim Min Hong...

470
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:30,837
...has been arrested and detained
at Minister Il Jae's residence.

471
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,532
What?

472
00:47:33,503 --> 00:47:35,223
How could such a thing happen?

473
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,460
Prince Hwa Ing and Minister Il Jae,

474
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:42,724
thought he was Lee Mong Heon, yhe
author of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

475
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,439
Before Father gets to know,

476
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:49,926
they want to force him to
clear Prince Hwa Ing's name.

477
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,044
But,

478
00:47:53,906 --> 00:47:55,406
he is not Lee Mong Heon.

479
00:47:56,514 --> 00:47:57,721
That is for sure.

480
00:48:04,566 --> 00:48:05,973
So what do you want to do?

481
00:48:09,703 --> 00:48:10,937
However,

482
00:48:12,905 --> 00:48:14,338
Prince Hwa Ing is my older brother.

483
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,639
Precisely because of that,
You must not remain silent.

484
00:48:18,507 --> 00:48:20,633
This case needs to be resolved immediately
and brought to public view,

485
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:22,944
and Kim Min Hong must be there
under the supervision of His Majesty the King.

486
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,808
That way, they won't
dare to go further.

487
00:48:27,312 --> 00:48:28,331
If you let it go,

488
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:33,328
circumstances can go beyond your control.

489
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:43,502
If it is difficult for the Princess
to intervene directly,

490
00:48:44,828 --> 00:48:46,015
I will be the one to do it.

491
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:50,337
Sir,

492
00:48:50,591 --> 00:48:51,731
This is serious!

493
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:06,728
Prince Hwa Ing and
Minister Il Jae.

494
00:49:07,127 --> 00:49:08,314
His Majesty the King has ordered,

495
00:49:08,865 --> 00:49:11,361
to bring Kim Min Hong, the suspected
author of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

496
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:13,026
to the Palace immediately.

497
00:49:24,517 --> 00:49:26,117
Where is Kim Min Hong?

498
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:44,221
Can you...

499
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:47,724
...tell me what happened?

500
00:49:55,015 --> 00:49:57,334
Just know that the Princess,

501
00:49:59,615 --> 00:50:01,121
is worried about the safety
of her teacher.

502
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,717
Prince Hwa Ing, how dare you
arrest and detain,

503
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:32,507
Kim Min Hong
without telling me?

504
00:50:33,468 --> 00:50:34,521
Father...

505
00:50:35,514 --> 00:50:36,994
...Actually...

506
00:50:37,812 --> 00:50:38,919
His Majesty the King.

507
00:50:39,107 --> 00:50:40,787
I apologize.

508
00:50:41,476 --> 00:50:42,516
I think that,

509
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,048
Chun Hwa's Love Story
has been playing with...

510
00:50:44,414 --> 00:50:46,334
...the royal family and
destroying the foundations of this country.

511
00:50:46,862 --> 00:50:49,222
Therefore, I did a
deeper investigation.

512
00:50:49,915 --> 00:50:50,994
At that time,

513
00:50:51,101 --> 00:50:52,847
we found that there was
an organized movement,

514
00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:55,974
led by Kim Min Hong,
who is suspected of being the author.

515
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:57,999
So, Prince Hwa Ing,

516
00:50:58,814 --> 00:51:01,041
intended to use
Kim Min Hong as bait,

517
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,213
to find the mastermind behind it
and collect evidence,

518
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:06,433
before reporting it to His Majesty,

519
00:51:06,899 --> 00:51:08,825
to lighten the burden on His Majesty the King,
and uphold state order.

520
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,414
I agree with that idea.

521
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:13,119
That's right, Father!

522
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:16,306
Please don't doubt my devotion.

523
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:19,432
Even if the intention is good,

524
00:51:19,528 --> 00:51:21,350
This country has laws
which must be obeyed.

525
00:51:21,714 --> 00:51:25,894
Detaining someone without the king's approval
and without any evidence that he is guilty,

526
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:27,728
is a form of insult
towards His Majesty the King.

527
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:29,101
You are too much!

528
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:32,931
What's wrong with just ordering?
some family servants to act?

529
00:51:33,077 --> 00:51:34,411
If you have no other intention,

530
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,046
why not report to His Majesty,

531
00:51:36,114 --> 00:51:38,021
and instead detain Kim Min Hong
secretly?

532
00:51:38,493 --> 00:51:39,926
Don't you want
something from him,

533
00:51:40,026 --> 00:51:41,719
to keep his arrest a secret?

534
00:51:41,921 --> 00:51:43,527
What do you think could be the
reason to detain the author of...

535
00:51:43,577 --> 00:51:45,432
...obscene stories that have
insulted the royal family?

536
00:51:46,217 --> 00:51:48,324
Prince Hwa Ing
just wanted to use him...

537
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,896
to trace the organization behind it,

538
00:51:50,923 --> 00:51:53,328
and reveal what their goals were
behind Chun Hwa's Love Story.

539
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:54,611
Enough!

540
00:51:58,319 --> 00:51:59,425
From this moment,

541
00:51:59,712 --> 00:52:02,139
I myself will
interrogate him...

542
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:04,337
...who is being suspected of
being Lee Mong Heon.

543
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:07,933
Bring Kim Min Hong before me!

544
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:35,138

CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY

546
00:52:41,821 --> 00:52:44,622
Why did you write a book like this?

547
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,140
I have committed a sin
that's unforgivable.

548
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:55,435
What is your sin?

549
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:04,921
His Majesty the King.

550
00:53:04,946 --> 00:53:07,519
Volume four of
Chun Hwa's Love Story has been published.

551
00:53:12,608 --> 00:53:15,054
New book, new book!

552
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:17,222
The fourth volume of Chun Hwa's Love Story!

553
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:20,426
"The Story of the Crown Prince" is out!

554
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:23,826
Crown Prince Dongbangguk
who is entangled in love at an old age!

555
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,221
Every night,

556
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:28,511
he jumped over the palace wall
in order to meet a secret woman.

557
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:33,501
What will the Crown Princess do,
when she finds out about this?

558
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,231
- Oh my, this time it's about the Crown Prince?
- Correct.

559
00:53:36,913 --> 00:53:38,213
Give me one volume, please.

560
00:53:38,413 --> 00:53:39,952
Thank You.

561
00:53:40,312 --> 00:53:42,013
Happy reading.

562
00:53:43,714 --> 00:53:45,996
Please buy the book
Chun Hwa's Love Story volume four,

563
00:53:46,021 --> 00:53:48,532
"The Story of the Crown Prince."

564
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:51,089
Let's see.
Good grief!

565
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:53,014
What is this?

566
00:53:53,305 --> 00:53:55,631
Indeed, if it is too late
falling in love is more dangerous.

567
00:53:56,002 --> 00:53:57,735
It's not too late to fall in love
which is dangerous,

568
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:00,086
but physical bond.

569
00:54:01,303 --> 00:54:05,525
Crown Prince and Crown Princess
not being compatible in bed?

570
00:54:07,352 --> 00:54:08,419
Geez.

571
00:54:09,105 --> 00:54:10,125
Why?

572
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:11,620
Look at this.

573
00:54:14,314 --> 00:54:17,914
Oh my, what position is this?

574
00:54:18,302 --> 00:54:20,822
The further you go, the bolder you become.

575
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:23,045
When looking at clothes,

576
00:54:23,575 --> 00:54:26,215
behind, there is a woman
who is observing.

577
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:28,715
Looks like that's the Crown Princess?

578
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:34,507
So, is this really a story about
The Crown Prince having an affair?

579
00:54:35,122 --> 00:54:38,772
Oh my gosh, it seems like
this will be a big scene.

580
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:41,356
We will see!

581
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:42,985
People are already making such a fuss.

582
00:54:44,129 --> 00:54:46,270
The fact that the author of
Chun Hwa's Love Story is...

583
00:54:46,295 --> 00:54:48,347
...the princess of this country herself
was very surprising.

584
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,959
Actually, what made
Princess Hwa Ri...

585
00:54:52,012 --> 00:54:55,339
...write a story like this?

586
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:57,988
About Chun Hwa's Love Story,
What is "The Story of the Crown Prince" like?

587
00:54:58,013 --> 00:54:59,153
What should I do?

588
00:54:59,602 --> 00:55:02,283
Should I reveal that I am
Lee Mong Heon right now?

589
00:55:14,504 --> 00:55:15,636
What if,

590
00:55:16,821 --> 00:55:19,521
The Princess wrote
Chun Hwa's new love story?

591
00:55:21,009 --> 00:55:23,728
- What?
- Currently, the fake Lee Mong Heon is under arrest.

592
00:55:25,008 --> 00:55:26,301
But suddenly,

593
00:55:27,412 --> 00:55:29,091
Chun Hwa's Love Story Volume four,
written by the original Lee Mong Heon...

594
00:55:29,178 --> 00:55:30,232
...appears in the stores.

595
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:35,023
Isn't that the best way?
to prove that...

596
00:55:35,314 --> 00:55:37,014
...Kim Min Hong is not Lee Mong Heon?

597
00:55:37,189 --> 00:55:38,235
Correct!

598
00:55:38,596 --> 00:55:39,756
That is very correct!

599
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:42,330
Before the situation gets worse,

600
00:55:42,523 --> 00:55:43,643
I will write...

601
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:45,949
...Chun Hwa's Love Story

602
00:55:46,361 --> 00:55:47,541
Okay.

603
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:49,551
Leave the rest to me,

604
00:55:49,823 --> 00:55:50,929
and the Princess can...

605
00:55:51,316 --> 00:55:52,996
...just focus on writing.

606
00:56:00,401 --> 00:56:01,933
You've worked hard, Princess.

607
00:56:04,479 --> 00:56:05,732
You too.

608
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,919
It seems like that person isn't Lee Mong Heon,

609
00:56:19,705 --> 00:56:21,618
so tell them to let him go.

610
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:22,926

Aren't we already sure that he
is the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story?

613
00:56:48,022 --> 00:56:50,728
But how can a new volume of
Chun Hwa's Love Story,

614
00:56:50,753 --> 00:56:51,955
suddenly appear out of the blue?

615

by distributing books like this.

We may not know yet
who Lee Mong Heon is,

but we know for sure
who spread it.

621
00:57:07,406 --> 00:57:09,119
It must be Choi Hwan again.

Who is actually the person

ask me that?

hold back my anger,
