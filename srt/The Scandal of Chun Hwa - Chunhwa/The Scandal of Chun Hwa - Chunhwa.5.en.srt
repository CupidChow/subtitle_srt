2
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:49,100
Are you alright?

3
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:53,882
I'm fine.

4
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,520
Have you been waiting long?

5
00:01:06,818 --> 00:01:08,098
Let's go!

6
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:13,279
EPISODE 5

7
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,338
...Geez.

8
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:16,831
Time flies.

9
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,587
After observing him all day,
What do you think?

10
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,274
Does he seem to like me?

11
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:24,604
That...

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,408
I'm not sure about.

13
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,910
But, he does seem to
be interested in you.

14
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:31,763
Really?

15
00:01:31,997 --> 00:01:33,543
Do you really think so?

16
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,682
I don't think there's a single
man on this planet who

17
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:41,038
constantly praises and
helps a woman without reason.

18
00:01:41,697 --> 00:01:44,257
He definitely seems to be
interested. Don't you think so?

19
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:50,898
It's a possibility, but still, there
are many obstacles to face.

20
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,999
How would you convince the elders?

21
00:01:53,957 --> 00:01:55,936
How would Lee Jae Sang's family respond?

22
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:59,231
Success or failure, the probability of
things working out is fifty-fifty.

23
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,834
I have a chance.

24
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:40,774
Young Master.

25
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,793
Her Highness Princess Hwa Jin asked
to give you this letter in secret.

26
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,989
-Her Highness Princess Concubine?
- Yes, Master.

27
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:12,665
Your Honour.

28
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,455
You're here.

29
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:30,002
Yes. Why did Your Highness
want to meet with me?

30
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:34,323
I wanted to thank you for helping me
choose my wedding dress.

31
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:39,010
There's no need to thank me.
I enjoyed it.

32
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,406
You must know about my
upcoming marriage?

33
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:46,638
Yes, Your Honor.

34
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,924
You are engaged to
the General's son.

35
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:50,615
I'm not engaged yet!

36
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:54,276
They've only talked about it.

37
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,329
Ah, I see.

38
00:03:59,482 --> 00:04:01,383
If you allow it...

39
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,767
...I intend to cancel this wedding.

40
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:09,769
Yes?

41
00:04:10,726 --> 00:04:16,016
What does my permission have
to do with Your Honor's wedding?

42
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:25,185
Did you not know about my feelings?

43
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:27,553
What?

44
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,781
I thought that on the day
you helped me choose my clothes,...

45
00:04:35,917 --> 00:04:38,498
...you might have also
liked me back.

46
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,860
Forgive me, Your Honor.
There has been a misunderstanding.

47
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,508
Please don't apologize.

48
00:04:50,927 --> 00:04:54,092
If you apologize for
my misunderstanding,

49
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:57,017
I look pitiful.

50
00:04:58,513 --> 00:04:59,546
Your Honour.

51
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:18,535
You may leave.

52
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,203
This is a feeling
that I cultivated myself.

53
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:27,780
So, I will bear it myself.

54
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:33,776
I don't want to see you leave.

55
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,274
Princess Hwa Jin!

56
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,053
Older brother.

57
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:53,032
What happened?
What causes you to cry like this?

58
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:55,733
It's nothing.

59
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:57,370
What do you mean by nothing?

60
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:02,008
I just saw Lee Jang Won
leave with my own eyes!

61
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:06,226
What happened?
What did he do to you?

62
00:07:06,306 --> 00:07:09,583
Do not interfere.
You do not need to know.

63
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:16,017
Look at her.

64
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,544
Something must be going on.

65
00:07:29,646 --> 00:07:33,206
I came here because I wanted to
introduce someone to you, Your Honor.

66
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,811
This girl is someone we
adopted into our family.

67
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,364
My name is Mi A, Your Honor.

68
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:48,915
From now on, she will serve Your Honor
and His Highness the Crown Prince.

69
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:52,845
I have also submitted a request
to the empress to allow it.

70
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:58,471
Thus, Your Majesty does not
need to feel burdened about pregnancy.

71
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,762
It's important that the Royal Heir
comes from our family,

72
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:07,869
regardless of who gives birth to him.

73
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:13,946
This girl will not threaten your position.
as empress, so don't worry.

74
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:16,555
I'm not worried.

75
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:21,707
The girl will be
of great assistance.

76
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:25,245
Hence, Your Highness and Mi A
can serve His Majesty the Crown Prince well.

77
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:27,808
Yes, Your Honor.

78
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,423
Have you delivered the
message to Prince Hwa Ing?

79
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,025
Yes, I have
that His Majesty wishes to meet.

80
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,626
Did you get home safely?

81
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:11,371
Uh...that...

82
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:15,759
What are you doing?

83
00:09:16,157 --> 00:09:19,447
You plan on secretly meeting
that palace maid again?

84
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:21,713
No.

85
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:24,180
I'd never do that.

86
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:25,685
Don't ever look her way.

87
00:09:26,184 --> 00:09:29,647
Please don't make your mother dizzy.

88
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,377
Okay. Don't worry.

89
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:38,087
By the way, Mother.

90
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:41,921
There is something
I wanted to tell you.

91
00:09:43,978 --> 00:09:45,251
What is it?

92
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,707
It's about Princess Hwa Jin.

93
00:09:49,353 --> 00:09:53,746
What if we marry her off to
Lee Jang Won, son of Lee Jae Sang?

94
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,585
What do you mean?

95
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:04,557
I saw Princess Hwa Jin meet
secretly with Lee Jang Won.

96
00:10:05,591 --> 00:10:07,329
It seems like something
happened between them.

97
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:12,629
After Lee Jang Won left,
Hwa Jin was crying alone.

98
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:17,702
Doesn't it sound like
a romantic relationship?

99
00:10:18,987 --> 00:10:21,376
Is that true?

100
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:22,369
Yes, Mother.

101
00:10:22,787 --> 00:10:26,703
If we take Jang Won as
Princess Hwa Jin's husband,

102
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:28,983
we can take revenge
on Lee Jae Sang, and...

103
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:34,542
...Princess Hwa Jin can also marry
someone who she likes. It's perfect.

104
00:10:35,587 --> 00:10:37,163
Don't talk nonsense.

105
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,887
The marriage has been agreed upon.
How can that be possibly changed?

106
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,987
- But, Mother...
- This is the best for Hwa Jin!

107
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:46,830
If you really care about her,

108
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,304
never talk about
this again. Got it?

109
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:53,794
Yes, Mother.

110
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:07,152
Despite partying and having fun,
in the end...

111
00:11:08,754 --> 00:11:10,679
...I am the one that
is left alone.

112
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:15,871
Since I have money and power, they
at least pretend to be afraid of me.

113
00:11:16,187 --> 00:11:17,925
Why are you talking like that again, sir?

114
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,085
I feel frustrated.

115
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:22,713
I'm frustrated.

116
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,375
What's the point of being the king's son
if I can't do anything?

117
00:11:29,632 --> 00:11:31,156
That is not true.

118
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:33,322
"You have to be careful
because you are the son of the King."

119
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,270
"You have to be careful
because you are a concubine's child."

120
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:38,868
They keep forbidding me from doing anything,

121
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:40,520
but behind my back,
they think I'm stupid.

122
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,224
I feel frustrated. How is this fair?
If I don't drink, how will I relieve my stress?

123
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:01,447
Don't talk like that.

124
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:05,244
Your existence itself is valuable,

125
00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:07,413
How could it be
you think like that?

126
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:10,483
That's true.

127
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:14,475
Right, at least I can still
have fun like this.

128
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:19,308
Let me see.
Show me the good stuff.

129
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,217
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

130
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,811
They laughed after seeing me?

131
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:41,876
Do they not know who I am?

132
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:44,383
Do they not know who I am?

133
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,676
Why have you come here, Your Honor?

134
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:13,913
Are you alone?

135
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,194
Yes.

136
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,884
Do you not know who I am?

137
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,807
Are you okay?

138
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,005
I don't know if I'm okay.

139
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:31,490
If I hate him, at least
I can blame him to my heart's content.

140
00:14:33,726 --> 00:14:36,233
All I feel is
how pathetic I am.

141
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:42,835
I think I've made you
suffer even more by interfering.

142
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:47,507
Maybe...

143
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:50,443
...deep in my heart...

144
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,180
...I already knew the answer.

145
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,183
Still...

146
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,387
...I couldn't stop my feelings.

147
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,524
That's what...

148
00:15:06,332 --> 00:15:08,194
...makes me feel so sad.

149
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,515
Now we are comrades.

150
00:15:17,253 --> 00:15:18,806
Heartbroken comrades.

151
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:23,414
Would it comfort you
to know that

152
00:15:23,439 --> 00:15:25,248
...you are not the only one
who experienced this?

153
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:29,895
I'm even crazier than you.

154
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,923
I almost escaped from the palace
with him, wanting to leave this country.

155
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,526
Do you regret it?

156
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:42,161
No.

157
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:46,666
I am still the same.

158
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,005
The old me. I still am the
person I was at that time.

159
00:15:56,954 --> 00:15:59,679
So what if I acted hopelessly?
I'm still myself.

160
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,630
If I blame myself for feeling things
just because things didn't work out,

161
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,768
wouldn't that be just tragic?

162
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:13,270
Having loved someone
without regrets,

163
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:15,939
If I meet soemone else one day,

164
00:16:15,964 --> 00:16:17,698
I can love him like a
hopeless romantic once again.

165
00:16:18,924 --> 00:16:20,307
When I think like that,

166
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,729
it eases my heart.

167
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,950
Hurry up a little.

168
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:55,442
We are the fastest to get
valuable books from Yanjing.

169
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,978
Today there are new books.

170
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,282
We're going to be late because of you.

171
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,064
Got it. I got it.

172
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:04,434
SHOP

173
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:09,061
Hello? what's the news on the book
that's supposed to be out today?

174
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:22,588
SHOP

175
00:17:40,896 --> 00:17:42,109
SHOP

176
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,891
Your Honor, you're here
to read a book?

177
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,339
I wanted to see if there is any
an exciting new adventure book.

178
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:12,545
A Trip to Mount Geumgang Yang
written by Teacher Deok Won is quite interesting.

179
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,671
The book should be here somewhere.

180
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:18,725
BOOK

181
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:57,323
It looks like Your Honor
really likes adventure books.

182
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:04,700
Even though I am a princess, I
cannot travel as freely as men.

183
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:07,965
Reading books is the only way
for me to experience the outside world.

184
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,234
Do you like it?

185
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,927
It just looks cute.

186
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:23,954
If you like it, choose one.
I will buy it as a gift.

187
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:27,108
No need.
I can buy it myself.

188
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:29,443
You can help me
choose one.

189
00:19:31,554 --> 00:19:32,579
Okay.

190
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,025
What do you think?
Does this look good?

191
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,365
Very beautiful.

192
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:04,122
Why are you smiling like that?

193
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:06,460
Does it look weird?

194
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:10,290
No. It really looks beautiful.

195
00:20:13,164 --> 00:20:14,144
GEUMGANGSAN

196
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,900
If it's weird, it's best
if I don't buy it.

197
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:35,529
Her Majesty is entering.

198
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:07,641
What on Earth happened
between you and Lee Jae Sang's son?

199
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,094
Nothing happened.

200
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,044
I have heard
everything from your brother.

201
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:23,702
Is it true that nothing happened?

202
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,030
(sighs)

203
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:35,760
You are engaged.
How can you meet another man?

204
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,612
Luckily, it was only your brother.
What would happen...

205
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:40,888
...if someone else
saw you and spread rumors?

206
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,817
For a woman,
honor is everything.

207
00:21:45,252 --> 00:21:49,048
Even rumors can force you
to get married. Don't you realize that?

208
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:52,835
When you love each other
and get married,

209
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,767
married life is still difficult.

210
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:59,502
But, if you marry someone who
doesn't love you back,

211
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:04,516
Can you really be happy
by a man's side...

212
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:08,076
...who doesn't share the same feelings?

213
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:12,519
If your husband is not someone
that you can rely on,

214
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:15,405
you will only feel lonely.

215
00:22:18,001 --> 00:22:20,694
I have lived life like that.

216
00:22:22,454 --> 00:22:24,757
You hating me for forcing
you to marry someone...

217
00:22:24,781 --> 00:22:26,842
...who you don't know is
still better.

218
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,198
Because living by the side of a man who is there
near you, but doesn't love you...

219
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,094
...feels like building hell
in your own heart.

220
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:39,773
I don't want you
live a life like that.

221
00:22:42,146 --> 00:22:44,076
So, please, sort out your feelings.

222
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:34,974
Wow!

223
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:38,658
Turn around.

224
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,269
Beautiful, isn't it?

225
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:57,679
Father.

226
00:23:59,044 --> 00:23:59,976
I want to...

227
00:24:03,887 --> 00:24:06,298
...become Princess Hwa Ri's fiancé.

228
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,510
- What?
- Princess Hwa Ri?

229
00:24:10,113 --> 00:24:13,056
What do you mean by you want
to become the Royal fiancé?

230
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:16,242
You know that becoming a husband of a
Princess means giving up your current position.

231
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,444
I've thought it through carefully.

232
00:24:18,932 --> 00:24:22,981
Let me participate in the fiancé election
and send my proposal letter.

233
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:25,862
No way. This concerns
the future of our family.

234
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:29,816
Decisions like this should not be made
on impulse. Forget about it.

235
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,751
I'll assume I didn't hear
what you just said.

236
00:24:32,396 --> 00:24:33,434
Father.

237
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:36,093
No matter how strong your determination is,

238
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:39,785
becoming the Princess' fiancé isn't
a decision you can make alone.

239
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:41,743
You know that, right?

240
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:43,961
Yes

241
00:24:47,726 --> 00:24:50,175
Okay. Now leave.

242
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,707
Why did you send it? What if he's
chosen as the Princess' fiancé?

243
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:12,038
If he's chosen, then
he'll be just that.

244
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:14,033
It's his life.

245
00:25:14,486 --> 00:25:16,133
Does that make sense?

246
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:20,889
Giving up on plans due to family opposition
and changing decisions so easily

247
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:25,580
will weaken his ability to make firm
choices in the future.

248
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:31,202
He has never strayed
from the path I have set.

249
00:25:32,621 --> 00:25:34,186
So just wait and trust him.

250
00:25:56,497 --> 00:25:59,392
Why don't my brush strokes match teacher's?

251
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:02,249
The mountain in front of me,

252
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:05,250
looks as heavy as Mount Taesan.

253
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,728
Isn't it because your mind is filled with
with many thoughts?

254
00:26:19,738 --> 00:26:20,899
Is that it?

255
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:25,471
Yes, because painters pours out
their hearts into their paintings.

256
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,034
Let's wrap up for today.
Go back to the palace.

257
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,777
I also have to stop by the academy
to get something done.

258
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:42,887
But,

259
00:26:43,155 --> 00:26:47,159
don't you want to live freely,
focusing your time on painting?

260
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,895
After getting promoted,

261
00:26:50,424 --> 00:26:54,099
and after you took up work at the Peach Blossom Spring
shop, I haven't seen you make new artwork.

262
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:58,416
Creating new works is always possible
at any time, but...

263
00:26:58,947 --> 00:27:03,211
maintaining your noble family's status
as an official must be done now.

264
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:06,551
Even if we are noble in name only and poor,

265
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,947
my younger brothers must still live as aristocrats.

266
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:14,248
Oh, my goodness.

267
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,008
Oh!

268
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,393
Princess.

269
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,933
It is okay.

270
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,957
You could get sick like this.

271
00:27:44,483 --> 00:27:46,524
Please let me stay like this
until the rain stops.

272
00:27:57,806 --> 00:27:59,026
Your Highness Princess.

273
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:01,073
Let's run.

274
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:24,723
Princess.

275
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,257
Princess.

276
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:35,953
Teacher, it seems like there is no change of clothes,
so I brought spare clothes.

277
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:47,479
Teacher.

278
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:49,364
Please stay like that for a moment.

279
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:46,480
It seems like this must be the
normal heart-rate for everyone.

280
00:29:51,343 --> 00:29:52,863
It wasn't anything important.

281
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:55,180
Please change into these clothes.

282
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,567
Here.

283
00:29:57,772 --> 00:29:59,099
(sighs)

284
00:31:03,556 --> 00:31:04,996
He is waiting.

285
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:22,124
I have received a letter from you,

286
00:31:22,927 --> 00:31:24,580
So I came and waited first.

287
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:29,534
You said you would give
your answer today, right?

288
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,370
Correct.

289
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,070
So, what do you think?

290
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:36,148
After all I have done,

291
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:39,227
am I worthy to be your companion?

292
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:43,919
Before that,

293
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,345
There's something I want to ask.

294
00:31:47,402 --> 00:31:48,735
What's that?

295
00:31:55,286 --> 00:31:56,612
Do you...

296
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,814
...love me?

297
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:11,778
What do you think...

298
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,886
about living as husband and wife
with a spiritual bond...

299
00:32:15,677 --> 00:32:17,359
instead of a romantic bond?

300
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,095
I want you to be my companion.

301
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:29,026
Your idea of a companion, and...

302
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,305
...my idea of a companion...

303
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:33,004
...are completely different.

304
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:39,087
Whether it's young lovers

305
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,428
...or partners ready to risk
their lives for each other,

306
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:45,111
All those who want to spend
their forever together,

307
00:32:45,205 --> 00:32:47,844
whether its called love, a couple's
spiritual bond, or companionship

308
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,848
Regardless of what it
is called,

309
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:54,426
there must be a sense of trust
between the two.

310
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,722
Your words about

311
00:32:58,722 --> 00:32:58,769
Your words about
it being okay to have another
partner after marriage,

312
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,808
it being okay to have another
partner after marriage,

313
00:33:02,923 --> 00:33:06,023
is completely opposite my idea of companionship.

314
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:08,908
I...

315
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:11,275
...want to stand beside...

316
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,280
...a partner who shares my belief.

317
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:18,838
I'm not looking for a companion
without any sense of trust.

318
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:24,027
So, anyway.

319
00:33:24,814 --> 00:33:26,634
You can't be my partner.

320
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,466
I wuldn't have started this...

321
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:38,132
...if I was going to give up that easily.

322
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,502
What do I have to do,

323
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:47,934
to be your companion?

324
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:57,589
You have to give me certainty.

325
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:03,961
Your Honour.

326
00:35:05,966 --> 00:35:07,819
I can't do it.

327
00:35:18,057 --> 00:35:19,444
Why is that?

328
00:35:20,311 --> 00:35:22,305
Did I do something wrong?

329
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:28,916
It is not like that.

330
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:31,510
It is not about that.

331
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,057
Then why are you like this?

332
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,842
It is possible to be fertile, yet not be with child

333
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:42,029
even though you've been married for years?

334
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:49,598
Don't say that.

335
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,113
We are still young.

336
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:55,693
If we are calm,
there will definitely be an opportunity.

337
00:35:57,314 --> 00:36:00,128
I don't want to be afraid anymore
because of vain hopes.

338
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,283
It's better if Your Honor...

339
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,521
...meets another woman.

340
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:14,919
What?

341
00:36:15,117 --> 00:36:17,022
Shouldn't you have an heir?

342
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,563
Isn't that Your Honor's duty?
Ensuring a legitimate successor?

343
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:24,984
All this time,

344
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,340
is that all that you have wanted from me?

345
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:33,519
Don't we...

346
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,104
...have a reationship beyond that?

347
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:41,155
How could you make me
feel miserable like this?

348
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:05,612
Your Honour.

349
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:35,052
Your Honour.

350
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:36,749
If you go out like this...

351
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,195
Your Honour.

352
00:37:41,187 --> 00:37:42,527
Your Honour.

353
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,362
Leave me be.

354
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:00,065
I just want to be alone right now.

355
00:38:51,656 --> 00:38:52,823
Your Honour.

356
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:03,774
That's you, right? Your Highness the Crown Prince?

357
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:11,594
Did you come to see Uncle?

358
00:39:12,552 --> 00:39:13,838
Unfortunately,

359
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,377
He has left for Yanjing as an envoy.

360
00:39:17,862 --> 00:39:20,342
Your Honor must have not heard about this before.

361
00:39:22,284 --> 00:39:24,137
I think I came to see you.

362
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:26,440
Pardon?

363
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:28,775
Would you like to...

364
00:39:30,796 --> 00:39:32,910
...be my drinking buddy tonight?

365
00:39:56,614 --> 00:39:58,927
Do extraordinary people like Your Majesty...

366
00:40:00,423 --> 00:40:02,076
...have worries too?

367
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:06,395
Do I look worried?

368
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:08,989
Yes, Your Honor

369
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:12,715
You have hunger on your face.

370
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:18,618
I am indeed hungry,

371
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:24,340
but it is not the hunger you might think it to be.

372
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,103
Lean back on me.

373
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:50,208
Even an extraordinary person like Your Honor

374
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:53,201
needs a back to lean on sometimes.

375
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,577
Everything will be fine.

376
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:03,656
Everything,

377
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:06,249
will pass.

378
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,581
Thank You.

379
00:41:12,847 --> 00:41:14,447
Let's take a break,

380
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,751
like this for a moment.

381
00:41:52,331 --> 00:41:53,537
Lee Jang Won.

382
00:42:09,673 --> 00:42:10,880
Your Highness Princess.

383
00:42:29,661 --> 00:42:31,795
I heard you had something to say.

384
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:39,796
I am very naive.

385
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:43,044
Even though my feelings are very clear.

386
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:45,043
I deny it,

387
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,265
and pretend not to know.

388
00:42:54,816 --> 00:42:56,796
I love you, Your Highness Princess.

389
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,807
So,

390
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:04,935
I want to participate in the election of Your Honor's husband.

391
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:23,835
Excuse me.

392
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,895
This is too sudden a conversation.

393
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:32,376
You are a good person, but I,

394
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:35,895
never once have had
romantic feelings for you.

395
00:43:41,226 --> 00:43:42,559
In that case,

396
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,771
could you reconsider your feelings for me?

397
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,103
Please give me a chance.

398
00:43:55,988 --> 00:43:58,088
I already like Her Highness the Princess,

399
00:43:59,216 --> 00:44:01,636
so please take your time to think about it.

400
00:44:03,527 --> 00:44:05,274
Whatever be your answer,

401
00:44:06,487 --> 00:44:08,481
I shall await your response.

402
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:28,808
How does it feel here?

403
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:30,489
I am not sure.

404
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:39,700
- Want me to do something else?
- (moans)

405
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:41,709
Wait a moment.

406
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,256
Is this too much?

407
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:51,921
Please stop.

408
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:54,000
Oh my goodness.

409
00:44:59,712 --> 00:45:00,759
Stop-

410
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,354
Want more?

411
00:45:05,817 --> 00:45:07,464
Please stop now.

412
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:08,826
Almost complete.

413
00:45:21,108 --> 00:45:22,331
How was it, honey?

414
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:23,781
Want to proceed to the second round?

415
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:26,161
That's all for today.

416
00:45:26,587 --> 00:45:28,640
I'm so tired of doing it
morning to evening.

417
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,143
I have things to do.

418
00:45:32,807 --> 00:45:33,900
(sighs)

419
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:36,739
You shouldn't start something
if you can't complete it.

420
00:45:37,543 --> 00:45:39,269
You are a very cruel wife.

421
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:41,283
(playfully scoffs)

422
00:45:44,817 --> 00:45:47,643
By the way, what happened?
with Brother-in-law?

423
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,080
What does he mean by he wants to
particpate in the fiancé too?

424
00:45:51,802 --> 00:45:53,994
Their relationship was completely unexpected.

425
00:45:55,489 --> 00:45:57,008
What do you think?

426
00:45:57,376 --> 00:45:58,409
Are they a good match?

427
00:45:58,696 --> 00:45:59,710
No.

428
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:00,978
Why?

429
00:46:03,114 --> 00:46:07,992
Isn't brother-in-law the perfect candidate?

430
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:09,615
No.

431
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:12,836
Isn't it a shame
if he stops being a public servant,

432
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:14,987
and becomes the Princess' husband?

433
00:46:19,879 --> 00:46:21,692
Your perspective is wrong.

434
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:23,259
What?

435
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:28,298
It's not about who is less apt
and who is better.

436
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:32,489
The marriage will indeed be fixed
by the parents,

437
00:46:33,012 --> 00:46:36,186
but more importantly,
it the feeling of both the people.

438
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:42,124
Her Highness the Princess never once,

439
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:45,441
consider my brother as a man.

440
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:47,852
Oh, we don't know about that.

441
00:46:48,287 --> 00:46:51,100
He can be considered by the Princess
if he tries hard from now on.

442
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:52,914
Aren't I like that?

443
00:46:53,627 --> 00:46:55,954
After working hard tirelessly,

444
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
You finally opened your heart, right?

445
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:03,599
My brother's case is different from yours.

446
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:04,945
What?

447
00:47:07,084 --> 00:47:09,251
Aren't you handsome?

448
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:13,590
If you were ugly, I wouldn't even look at you.

449
00:47:15,227 --> 00:47:17,007
Oh, seriously.

450
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:20,294
I didn't expect that my face
would finally prove to be useful.

451
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:23,683
In that case,

452
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,016
Besides the face, what about everything else?

453
00:47:28,655 --> 00:47:30,067
You should put in the effort.

454
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:32,706
You ignore your lessons,

455
00:47:32,774 --> 00:47:34,605
because lately
you just follow me around.

456
00:47:37,042 --> 00:47:38,276
(sighs)

457
00:47:40,879 --> 00:47:43,785
I am not going to be a public servant.
Why should I study?

458
00:47:45,661 --> 00:47:49,081
I will only be a burden to His Majesty
if I stand out.

459
00:47:50,177 --> 00:47:52,711
I like how things are
right now.

460
00:48:38,856 --> 00:48:39,716
(gasps)

461
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:06,622
Please.

462
00:49:23,262 --> 00:49:24,277
Hang in there.

463
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:39,132
It was not life-threatening.

464
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:41,462
It looks like she passed out from exhaustion.

465
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:44,171
I will prescribe some medicine
to restore her health.

466
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:46,356
Okay.

467
00:50:24,577 --> 00:50:25,703
Because of the urgency,

468
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:29,202
I just thought
to bring her here.

469
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,842
Thank you for your help.

470
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:32,779
No problem.

471
00:50:48,857 --> 00:50:50,279
Are you awake?

472
00:50:52,105 --> 00:50:53,683
Are you feeling better now?

473
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:11,580
If you need help, I will help.

474
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:14,724
Try telling me your problem.

475
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,889
Why did you do that?

476
00:51:20,526 --> 00:51:21,792
Just leave it.

477
00:51:23,337 --> 00:51:24,938
No one can help.

478
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:26,314
That is not true.

479
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,366
I am the daughter of this country,

480
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,470
So, you can tell me.

481
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:36,473
Are you a princess?

482
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:38,577
Yes.

483
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:40,559
So just tell me.

484
00:51:40,687 --> 00:51:42,906
So you're Prince Hwa Ing's younger sister?

485
00:51:45,158 --> 00:51:48,109
- Correct.
- Then what kind of help do you mean?

486
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:52,400
Prince Hwa Ing raped me.

487
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,427
He took my purity!

488
00:51:56,934 --> 00:51:59,522
He showed off about it
as if it were a heroic story.

489
00:51:59,976 --> 00:52:02,280
I can't even live because of the shame!

490
00:52:02,643 --> 00:52:07,154
How will the princess as the younger sister,
do anything to help me?

491
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:16,831
Is that the truth?

492
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:21,656
My life is over,
why should I be afraid of tell the truth?

493
00:52:23,297 --> 00:52:25,300
I don't deserve to live anymore.

494
00:52:26,196 --> 00:52:29,951
Who will marry the woman
who lost her purity?

495
00:52:45,101 --> 00:52:47,523
I think it is harder for her, because
of the Princess' presence.

496
00:52:49,192 --> 00:52:50,935
So, please step out for a moment.

497
00:53:15,924 --> 00:53:16,958
Raise your head.

498
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:19,487
Listen to me.

499
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,028
You misunderstood something.

500
00:53:29,503 --> 00:53:31,183
It's not your body that's dirty.

501
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:33,910
But Hwa Ing's perverted mind.

502
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,128
If you want to end your life again,

503
00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:43,395
it's your choice.

504
00:53:44,334 --> 00:53:45,349
However,

505
00:53:46,302 --> 00:53:47,731
if you want to live again,

506
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,190
I will give you another life.

507
00:53:56,214 --> 00:53:57,229
Your value,

508
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:00,926
is not only seen through your purity.

509
00:54:09,293 --> 00:54:10,404
Do you want to follow me?

510
00:54:31,704 --> 00:54:33,710
Is there no news about the incident?

511
00:54:36,203 --> 00:54:38,436
Is it true that Hwa Ing did that?

512
00:54:41,643 --> 00:54:42,676
I don't know.

513
00:54:47,235 --> 00:54:49,009
If that is true,

514
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,636
I...

515
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:56,483
...will not forgive him.

516
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,343
You may leave first.

517
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,217
I will wait until the condition is stable.

518
00:55:06,275 --> 00:55:08,216
I will come back when Gama arrives.

519
00:55:11,331 --> 00:55:12,346
Okay, Your Honor.

520
00:55:31,022 --> 00:55:32,540
Prince Hwa Ing is really...

521
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,853
...worse than an animal.

522
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:38,622
Isn't he using his position?
to rape many women?

523
00:55:38,792 --> 00:55:40,070
Correct.

524
00:55:40,347 --> 00:55:41,523
Do you know?

525
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:43,020
There was a gisaeng who said,

526
00:55:43,059 --> 00:55:45,510
that he still meets with the
palace maid...

527
00:55:45,535 --> 00:55:47,132
...at the Minister's villa on the outskirts of the city.

528
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:48,764
Gosh.

529
00:55:49,736 --> 00:55:51,944
This guy is truly fearless.

530
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:46,850
VILLA

531
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:10,985
Who are you?

532
00:57:14,461 --> 00:57:17,231
Aren't you the eldest son of
Lee Jae Sang's family?

533
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:23,690
Who did you meet in this place?

534
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:25,029
(scoffs)

535
00:57:27,144 --> 00:57:29,182
Seems like you like to make things look weird.

536
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,788
This is my friend's villa.

537
00:57:32,226 --> 00:57:34,236
Of course I came to see him.

538
00:57:35,056 --> 00:57:36,181
What about yourself?

539
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,755
What are you doing here?

540
00:57:39,913 --> 00:57:41,570
I came for something.

541
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:44,044
That's just a rumor about me.

542
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:45,731
There's always something.

543
00:57:45,999 --> 00:57:49,029
Gossipers are alive
for things like that. Right?

544
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,385
Are you sure you don't know
what this is about?

545
00:57:52,486 --> 00:57:53,519
Well...

546
00:57:54,228 --> 00:57:55,908
I don't understand what you mean.

547
00:57:59,127 --> 00:58:01,660
Does this world seem easy to you?

548
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:07,916
The woman you raped is moarning
her chastity and wanted to commit suicide.

549
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:12,785
-Did you know this?
-Who raped anyone?

550
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:15,768
As a student,

551
00:58:16,183 --> 00:58:18,885
how dare you
treat me like this!

552
00:58:23,387 --> 00:58:26,493
You really underestimate me.

553
00:58:27,995 --> 00:58:30,113
I already know everything
about you and Princess Hwa Jin.

554
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:34,043
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

555
00:58:35,175 --> 00:58:36,196
How dare you...

556
00:58:37,604 --> 00:58:39,333
...teach me about these things?

557
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:42,427
I won't let you treat me this way.

558
00:58:43,004 --> 00:58:44,841
I will submit a petition to Father
as soon as possible...

559
00:58:45,078 --> 00:58:47,538
...and reveal everything
about you and Princess Hwa Jin!

560
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:52,060
How the trusted son of Lee Jae Sang's family

561
00:58:52,242 --> 00:58:54,759
is actually doing heinous things behind
his father's back.

562
00:58:55,445 --> 00:58:56,721
Father should know that too.

563
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,295
I...

564
00:59:01,762 --> 00:59:05,302
...will show your dirty face
to the world.

565
00:59:07,367 --> 00:59:08,642
I will reveal everything!

566
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,663
PETITION

567
00:59:46,426 --> 00:59:49,165
If what is said
by Prince Hwa Ing is right,

568
00:59:49,422 --> 00:59:53,513
your family will be punished
for disturbing the royal family.

569
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:56,229
Is there anything you want
to say in your defence?

570
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:00,964
That is not true.

571
01:00:03,165 --> 01:00:04,608
I think so too.

572
01:00:05,459 --> 01:00:06,474
However,

573
01:00:07,294 --> 01:00:09,780
because Hwa Ing has
submitted a petition like this,

574
01:00:10,366 --> 01:00:11,655
as the King,

575
01:00:12,011 --> 01:00:13,339
I have to make a decision.

576
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:16,297
Before that,

577
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:18,877
as your close friend,

578
01:00:19,328 --> 01:00:22,942
and also as the father of Princess Hwa Jin,

579
01:00:23,584 --> 01:00:27,649
I want to ask, what is
best for our children.

580
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,213
What should we do?

581
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:45,245
Father.

582
01:00:45,899 --> 01:00:46,999
I heard father asked for me.

583
01:00:48,202 --> 01:00:49,217
Yes.

584
01:00:53,564 --> 01:00:54,608
Prince Hwa Ing,

585
01:00:55,112 --> 01:00:58,555
has filed a petition about you
and Princess Hwa Jin to the King.

586
01:01:00,341 --> 01:01:02,875
He said, he saw you and
The Princess meet in private.

587
01:01:03,689 --> 01:01:07,417
He wants me removed from my post,
because he can't manage his family.

588
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:13,719
To cover all this
secretly,

589
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:18,121
You must be Princess Hwa Jin's husband
and maintain his honor.

590
01:01:18,823 --> 01:01:20,370
Neither the King,

591
01:01:20,898 --> 01:01:22,742
nor I wanted this to happen.

592
01:01:24,504 --> 01:01:26,441
I have nothing to do with the Princess.

593
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,844
Please trust me.

594
01:01:29,474 --> 01:01:30,489
I believe you.

595
01:01:32,312 --> 01:01:33,615
But the problem is,

596
01:01:34,047 --> 01:01:36,043
it's not just about you.

597
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:40,086
Young people tend to follow their hearts.

598
01:01:40,522 --> 01:01:41,720
Eventually,

599
01:01:41,855 --> 01:01:44,428
it becomes a problem that
determines the fate of the family.

600
01:01:46,226 --> 01:01:47,241
This,

601
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:53,189
is the weight of your name
as a descendant of nobility.

602
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,527
For the honor of the family.

603
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:03,937
If you want to fight this injustice,

604
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,979
even if i have to
resign from my position,

605
01:02:07,047 --> 01:02:08,478
I will oppose Hwa Ing's petition,

606
01:02:08,882 --> 01:02:10,576
and prove that you are innocent.

607
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:15,028
If you really want to
become Princess Hwa Ri's husband,

608
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:17,447
you have to strengthen your heart.

609
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,422
Whatever your decision,

610
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:23,050
I will support you.

611
01:02:24,305 --> 01:02:26,141
Make a decision you won't regret.

612
01:02:52,993 --> 01:02:54,008
Your Honour.

613
01:02:54,379 --> 01:02:57,279
Lee Jang Won has arrived.

614
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:05,035
Princess.

615
01:03:06,204 --> 01:03:08,771
I came because there was something urgent
that I have to convey.

616
01:03:10,379 --> 01:03:11,394
Yes.

617
01:03:12,402 --> 01:03:14,319
My brother told me.

618
01:03:15,883 --> 01:03:16,898
So,

619
01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:18,640
What happened?

620
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,664
Prince Hwa Ing...

621
01:03:23,979 --> 01:03:26,752
...submitted a petition to His Majesty the King
about the Princess and me.

622
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:34,941
Maybe my question is presumptuous,

623
01:03:37,186 --> 01:03:39,933
but, do you still want me
to be your husband?

624
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:45,246
But living by the side of a man who is there
near you, but doesn't love you...

625
01:03:46,148 --> 01:03:48,050
...it's like building hell
in your own heart.

626
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:53,619
I don't want you
live a life like that.

627
01:03:54,754 --> 01:03:56,479
So, please, sort out your feelings.

628
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:01,758
No, I do not.

629
01:04:05,574 --> 01:04:08,141
It's true that I
had feelings for you,

630
01:04:09,654 --> 01:04:11,854
However, that is in the past.

631
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:14,383
I do not have those feelings anymore.

632
01:04:16,947 --> 01:04:19,472
According to Father's plan too,

633
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,889
I will marry the son of a general's family.

634
01:04:24,317 --> 01:04:25,332
So,

635
01:04:26,109 --> 01:04:28,818
there will be no problem
with the petition of Prince Hwa Ing.

636
01:04:34,175 --> 01:04:35,730
Sorry for making you uncomfortable.

637
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:42,596
Any time,

638
01:04:43,704 --> 01:04:44,719
anywhere,

639
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:49,991
I hope peace be with you.

640
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:57,521
Of course.

641
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:04,324
Because of the petition I submitted to Father,

642
01:06:04,663 --> 01:06:08,711
Lee Jae Sang's family must be
in chaos right now.

643
01:06:12,907 --> 01:06:13,988
On this occasion,

644
01:06:14,162 --> 01:06:17,241
let's get rid of everything in
Lee Jae Sang's cunning group,

645
01:06:17,504 --> 01:06:19,859
that blocks your path.

646
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:26,243
There is something that
is happening out there.

647
01:06:26,887 --> 01:06:28,879
Do you have no idea?

648
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:34,942
CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORYWow! New book.

649
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:37,831
Chun Hwa's Love Story Edition Three,

650
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:39,853
Forbidden Summer.

651
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,329
CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY
This is a new book.

652
01:06:42,663 --> 01:06:45,848
Chun Hwa's Love Story
issue three is finally out!

653
01:06:47,413 --> 01:06:49,313
Forbidden love between...

654
01:06:49,508 --> 01:06:52,635
...Prince Dongbangguk
and the Royal Palace Ladies.

655
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,846
Who is the man going after the Palace Ladies?

656
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:57,957
By the way,

657
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:01,096
isn't this like
the story of Prince Hwa Ing?

658
01:07:02,209 --> 01:07:04,877
A descendant of a concubine
who likes to play with women.

659
01:07:05,779 --> 01:07:07,621
The background is very similar.

660
01:07:09,816 --> 01:07:11,629
Impossible.

661
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:13,741
Even though he is very depraved,

662
01:07:14,105 --> 01:07:16,104
how is it possible that he would
touch the palace maids?

663
01:07:17,227 --> 01:07:19,019
It seems like just a made up story.

664
01:07:19,442 --> 01:07:20,752
Correct.

665
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:23,983
If this is real,
can it really be sold freely?

666
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:26,203
It would have cause a total stir in the Palace.

667
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:29,833
What is actually being talked about?

668
01:07:30,281 --> 01:07:31,893
Let's read.

669
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:37,150
Prince Lee, who was born
from a concubine,

670
01:07:37,607 --> 01:07:40,547
raped a woman
named Seon Yi.

671
01:07:40,854 --> 01:07:43,780
Seon Yi who lost her purity,
tried to commit suicide.

672
01:07:43,884 --> 01:07:47,414
However, she was saved
by Jin Yi, the man's younger sister.

673
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:50,131
Then, Jin Yi decided
to take revenge.

674
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:53,112
Jin Yi, who has
the ability to draw,

675
01:07:53,241 --> 01:07:55,626
disguised as a man
and went to the palace.

676
01:07:55,858 --> 01:08:01,802
to secretly draw the figure of Prince Lee
laying with a palace maid.

677
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:03,774
As it turns out,

678
01:08:03,804 --> 01:08:08,319
it was when Princee Lee was sleeping with a maid
who had not lost her virginity,

679
01:08:08,775 --> 01:08:10,807
that Jin Yi appeared.

680
01:08:10,993 --> 01:08:15,192
If such a situation is depicted,
Prince Lee would surely be arrested.

681
01:08:15,912 --> 01:08:19,393
Finally, he got a
severe punishment and was exiled,

682
01:08:19,418 --> 01:08:21,654
for doing so.

683
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:22,749
What's this?

684
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:25,226
It's like the story of Prince Hwa Ing.

685
01:08:26,190 --> 01:08:28,883
They do look alike.

686
01:08:28,966 --> 01:08:31,512
Is what is written in this book true?

687
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:33,734
Ah, that...

688
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:36,825
Is this really your story?

689
01:08:39,547 --> 01:08:41,425
No, this is...

690
01:08:44,137 --> 01:08:47,635
Tell me honestly,
so we can make a plan.

691
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:56,246
What are you actually thinking?

692
01:08:57,224 --> 01:09:00,556
No matter how depraved you are,
there are limits to be maintained!

693
01:09:05,034 --> 01:09:06,219
The person who wrote this,

694
01:09:07,201 --> 01:09:09,273
surely know your problem.

695
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:12,095
If not intentionally,

696
01:09:12,622 --> 01:09:14,162
there's no way it would have spread this fast.

697
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:18,651
Who on Earth could it be?

698
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,437
Before the King knew,

699
01:09:22,556 --> 01:09:24,312
we have to find him immediately.

700
01:10:36,473 --> 01:10:37,326
PRINCE LEE...
