1
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:04,928
Oh my gosh. What is this?

2
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:06,052
EPISODE 4

3
00:00:06,157 --> 00:00:08,333
Is she crazy?

4
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,171
What is this sound?

5
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:51,982
Did something happen?

6
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:55,129
Princess Hwa Ri wants to punish Shim Hak Do.

7
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:59,035
She is hitting the sinmungo to ask for
justice for Her Highness Hyo Jin.

8
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:25,615
Why did you carelessly
hit the sinmungo ?

9
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:30,732
Sinmungo was created so that the people
can demand justice.

10
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:34,625
How dare you hit sinmungo
to vent your anger?

11
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:38,440
For Father, Aunt and I are subjects.

12
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:41,626
Why is my hitting of Sinmungo
to ask for justice...

13
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,992
...considered a display of anger?

14
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:46,538
Sinmungo is inside the Geomcheon Bridge.

15
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:49,742
Common people can't
cross the bridge.

16
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:54,798
I hit sinmungo to
investigate the injustice experienced by Aunt.

17
00:01:55,633 --> 00:01:56,733
The man...

18
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:00,584
...abandoned Aunt
and killed her.

19
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:04,701
It's just a baseless rumor.
What can I do about it?

20
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:08,125
I mean, what should I do?

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,398
Moreover, he is the son of
meritorious family.

22
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,806
Father must punish him.

23
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:15,833
Tear him to death.

24
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:18,930
Uphold justice for Aunt.

25
00:02:19,676 --> 00:02:21,436
Aren't you the king?

26
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,858
Aren't you Aunt's brother?

27
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,587
That's why I did this!

28
00:02:26,217 --> 00:02:27,813
Because I am the king and her brother.

29
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:31,022
Hyo Jin's misfortune...

30
00:02:31,855 --> 00:02:34,551
...has been spread
throughout the capital.

31
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:38,616
Who will guard
her dignity and honor?

32
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:41,225
Should we tarnish...

33
00:02:41,522 --> 00:02:44,508
...royal honor and Princess Concubine's honor
just to kill her husband?

34
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,982
Do you really want to tarnish your aunt's name?

35
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,520
Is the dignity of the kingdom...

36
00:02:49,114 --> 00:02:51,635
...more important than Aunt's life?

37
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:55,235
Can maintaining
My deceased aunt's honor...

38
00:02:55,752 --> 00:02:59,756
...be used as a reason to
forgive her husband's depraved behavior?

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,997
Stop!

40
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:02,835
It could happen to me...

41
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:05,838
...or Princess Hwa Jin.

42
00:03:08,248 --> 00:03:09,518
If I experienced that,

43
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:12,733
would Father still...

44
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,152
...ask me to take care of
my honor as a princess?

45
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:42,828
Time passes so quickly.

46
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,241
When I entered the palace,

47
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,011
both of us...

48
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,932
...only 12 years old.

49
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:55,917
We were still small.

50
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:16,363
I wish I could open my eyes
and be 60 years old.

51
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,661
So that this period...

52
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,911
...could pass without me realizing.

53
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:37,430
Do I need to inform her of your arrival?

54
00:04:39,318 --> 00:04:40,418
No.

55
00:04:41,128 --> 00:04:42,925
Just give her the things.

56
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:55,856
Princess.

57
00:04:56,628 --> 00:05:00,011
Owner of Gisaeng Cheongwoon House
has sent something for you.

58
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:06,441
I'm coming in, Princess.

59
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:54,348
WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD DO THAT?

60
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:55,931
Oh, Queen.

61
00:05:57,843 --> 00:05:59,943
Am I wrong?

62
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:07,259
Hyo Jin's Relationship
and her husband not being good...

63
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,948
I already knew that.

64
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,783
Who would have thought he would do that?

65
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:30,110
Think about your family.

66
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:33,357
Don't be sad and hurt yourself.

67
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:37,658
Eat regularly
and don't get sick.

68
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:52,347
I'm glad to hear you're doing well.
after receiving a letter from you.

69
00:06:53,719 --> 00:06:57,589
Have you seen the silk cloth
that I sent?

70
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:01,615
I hope it can comfort your heart.

71
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:14,034
Come here.

72
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,605
Good grief!

73
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:17,132
Geez.

74
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,148
You've been through a lot of bad things
in your household.

75
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,037
I wrote this because I was hurt.

76
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,887
I hope you can keep your part...

77
00:07:29,127 --> 00:07:32,088
...even if you have to commit a crime.

78
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:42,319
I told her to guard her role
even if she had to commit a crime.

79
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:49,317
At that time, I should have
not asked her to maintain her honor,

80
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:55,739
but rather tell her that
she had a place to come home to.

81
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:01,148
I told her to hold on instead.

82
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:06,028
That wise child...

83
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,940
...lost a place to escape to
because of my words.

84
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:04,709
What a terrible fate.

85
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,379
The husband continues to have sex
with the slave girl...

86
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:11,430
...even though Princess Chun Young almost died.

87
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:15,128
The Princess feels it is unfair
and can't close her eyes.

88
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,819
Isn't he afraid of karma?

89
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:21,218
He is like an animal that is
just chasing pleasure.

90
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:22,560
What a bad guy.

91
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:24,966
The heavens will not ignore this.

92
00:09:25,342 --> 00:09:28,243
The Jade Emperor sends a savior...

93
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:31,514
...and give the princess a
chance to live again.

94
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,895
- Geez.
- I'm grateful.

95
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:37,820
"You will be punished."

96
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,297
"My corpse hasn't even rotted yet,"

97
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:45,422
"How dare you hug another woman
in my bed?

98
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,555
If you are willing to be so sinful
and carry out such evil deeds,

99
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:51,967
I am willing to be a bad wife.

100
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:57,594
Where does honor and the wealth you(/i> enjoy come from?

101
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,811
What exactly are the seven deadly sins?

102
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:03,431
You were born and raised
by a woman,

103
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:05,720
but you have the heart to hurt me.

104
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,237
Why should a sick woman
be sent away like this?

105
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:14,711
Why must criticizm and jealousy of a
wife of a husband who has been unfaithful...

106
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,858
...for the sake of his mistress called a sin?

107
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:20,617
who is the actual sinner in the situation?

108
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:23,472
So true.

109
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:26,957
- I agree with that.
- Be quiet!

110
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,807
"You won't be able to rest easy.
even when you are dead."

111
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:35,065
"Your body will be devoured by wild animals."

112
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:38,097
Right. That's how it should be.

113
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,275
After taking her revenge,

114
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,855
the princess ends her hatred
in this world.

115
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,820
and finally she arrives in heaven...

116
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:49,658
...and live happily
with her savior...

117
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:52,324
...forever.

118
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:53,992
- That's a good ending.
- I'm happy for her.

119
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,383
Who wrote this?

120
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:56,940
The story is very satisfying.

121
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:39,234
Your Honor.

122
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,500
I came to met you because
the match finished faster.

123
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,680
How are you?

124
00:11:49,902 --> 00:11:53,743
Weren't you very close
with Aunt when she was alive?

125
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:56,817
I am o my way to...

126
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,642
...pay a visit
to Her Highness Princess Concubine.

127
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:01,425
I see.

128
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,717
In that case, please go ahead.

129
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:11,685
I will come again another time.

130
00:12:12,782 --> 00:12:13,882
Yes, Your Majesty.

131
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:29,826
Get ready to go.

132
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:34,072
It's been a long time since I breathed outside air.

133
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:39,399
Accessories are the best birthday gifts
for Miss Min Ji.

134
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:40,846
Of course.

135
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,627
- Which one is good?
- How about this?

136
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,111
This suits you.

137
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:46,914
What? Really?

138
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,609
Miss Min Ji will definitely like it.

139
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,835
Let's buy it and go
to her birthday party.

140
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,240
Your Honor...
I mean, sir.

141
00:12:55,264 --> 00:12:56,671
Your uncle's house is over there.

142
00:13:08,635 --> 00:13:10,424
Will my wife be happy?
if I give her this?

143
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:11,955
Of course.

144
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:14,303
All women love gifts.

145
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,538
It's been a long time since I saw her smile.

146
00:13:29,821 --> 00:13:30,921
Excuse me.

147
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,411
Can I ask for your help?

148
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:41,783
I want to give a gift
for my sister and her husband.

149
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,095
I have chosen a gift for my sister,

150
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:46,215
but I don't know what to do
what to give to my brother-in-law.

151
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:49,359
Can you try wearing this?

152
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:51,866
- I...
- Hey! You!

153
00:13:52,547 --> 00:13:54,671
- Don't you know who he is?
- What?

154
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,974
Am I being rude?

155
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,640
No.

156
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:10,118
Is this enough?

157
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:13,678
Compared to that one...

158
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,194
I think this is better.

159
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,044
Don't you dare-!
Get your hands off him!

160
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:23,817
You look good in everything.

161
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,457
How will it look on my
brother-in-law?

162
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,169
Hey, run!

163
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:30,934
- You run too!
- Good grief.

164
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:34,508
You naughty boy. Stop right there!

165
00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:37,209
I don't want to. What did I do wrong?

166
00:14:38,657 --> 00:14:39,779
Come here.

167
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,532
I'll tell you what you did wrong.

168
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:44,051
I don't want to!

169
00:14:50,551 --> 00:14:51,651
Wait!

170
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,438
- Good grief.
- What's wrong with him?

171
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,299
Ouch.

172
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:09,527
Forgive me.

173
00:15:11,386 --> 00:15:12,486
What do I do now?

174
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,499
I can't go home
in this condition.

175
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,326
Forgive me.

176
00:15:20,772 --> 00:15:23,280
Wear my clothes for now.

177
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:29,568
- But...
- Quickly take off my clothes.

178
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:30,898
What?

179
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,328
Okay.

180
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:33,955
Good grief.

181
00:15:58,135 --> 00:15:59,235
Are you stupid?

182
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,751
Why can't you take
off your own clothes?

183
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:03,293
Oh my! How could-!

184
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:05,027
Oh yes.

185
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,269
I apologize.

186
00:16:08,408 --> 00:16:09,508
It seems...

187
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:13,627
...this commotion occurred because
of me and my naughty student.

188
00:16:14,326 --> 00:16:18,141
Torn clothes can be sewn directly
here. It only costs two nyang .

189
00:16:19,084 --> 00:16:21,132
- What?
- Let me talk to the tailor.

190
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:22,712
Come with me.

191
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,520
- Is Mrs. Park in there?
- Yes.

192
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:31,957
It's hard to believe.

193
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:34,963
I was treated like an idiot...

194
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,019
...which can't
undress himself.

195
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:38,535
Exactly.

196
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,795
Your Honor.

197
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:46,411
What would happen to you if I wasn't here?

198
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:00,283
Ugh!

199
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:13,663
Man Bok.

200
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,836
Are you following me?

201
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,499
Oh Lord.

202
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:52,483
You follow a woman
just because of being criticized?

203
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:56,042
I can't believe there are
petty men like you.

204
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:07,801
What's actually going on today?

205
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,183
Am I the weird one or is she the weird one?

206
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:13,890
I think we are just
unlucky today.

207
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,979
Let's hurry to your uncle's house.
before any more problems occur.

208
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:45,749
Oh my God. Sir! Sir!

209
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:47,656
Come here quickly!

210
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,226
That's him! He's the one!

211
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,689
I was just making small talk...

212
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:57,421
...because this grown man
was unable to undress himself.

213
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,964
But he followed me all the way here.

214
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:03,895
He has eyes and a mouth.
He could have spoken.

215
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,778
If a noble like you
acts recklessly,

216
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,956
Will a weak woman like me
just keep quiet and keep her mouth shut?

217
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:14,092
Sir is the King's brother-in-law.

218
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,990
Please teach him a lesson
To that haughty nobleman.

219
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,615
It seems like you are the one who
must be taught a lesson.

220
00:19:21,962 --> 00:19:23,062
What?

221
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,449
- What do you mean...
- Long time no see, Uncle.

222
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:28,584
"Uncle"?

223
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,434
How are you, Your Majesty?

224
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,673
"Your Majesty"?

225
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:37,320
Are you the Crown Prince?

226
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:38,736
Yes.

227
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:41,835
The Crown Prince who can't
take off his own clothes.

228
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,803
That is me.

229
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:54,983
Excuse me.

230
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,898
I didn't recognize Your Majesty.

231
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:58,341
I deserve to die.

232
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:03,633
Am I going to die?

233
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:24,069
I do not
kill people indiscriminately.

234
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:25,819
You may go.

235
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,791
It is not like that.

236
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:32,046
I just want to apologize
in earnest.

237
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:37,878
The Crown Prince certainly never
wore his own clothes.

238
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:43,449
I didn't know anything and
I misunderstood. I apologize.

239
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:45,932
Oh...

240
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:47,087
This.

241
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,962
I'm really sorry.

242
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,835
She was thrown out by her in-laws and parents.

243
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,516
How could that be?

244
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:05,460
Women are human too.

245
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:08,135
They can't live with
eyes, ears, and mouth...

246
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,732
...which are closed.

247
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,713
I made her a translator
because she is good at foreign languages.

248
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:19,984
Why did you suddenly come here?
without telling me first?

249
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,452
I'm frustrated.

250
00:21:23,635 --> 00:21:27,598
Maybe I can find the answer
after meeting Uncle.

251
00:21:28,304 --> 00:21:30,691
Is there any problem?

252
00:21:32,718 --> 00:21:33,902
There isn't any.

253
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,394
There isn't anything,

254
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,052
but somehow
I feel very frustrated.

255
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:45,145
I wear the clothes that have been prepared,

256
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,790
eat the food given,

257
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:51,340
and continue to prepare myself to become...

258
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,586
...a wise king.

259
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:57,321
But lately,

260
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:01,523
it feels like I'm wearing
clothes that don't fit me.

261
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:04,820
Apart from the fact that I am the eldest son,

262
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:09,492
Am I worthy to occupy the king's throne?

263
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:13,408
As the woman said,

264
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:16,457
I'm just a man who can't
wear my own clothes.

265
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,541
- Drink up.
- Let me pour it for you.

266
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,130
By the way,

267
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:30,341
I heard there was a commotion in the palace.

268
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:32,087
Are you okay?

269
00:22:32,324 --> 00:22:35,023
Hyo Jin had a short life.
What can I do?

270
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:40,180
I became a widower because of her.

271
00:22:42,132 --> 00:22:46,123
So, I have to enjoy the rest of my life.

272
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:51,018
- Let's drink.
- Drink up.

273
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,152
Come on.

274
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:56,205
Sir, the girls have arrived.

275
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:57,563
Tell them to come in.

276
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,247
- Come in.
- Here.

277
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:02,561
- Come in quickly!
- Sit here!

278
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:05,781
- Come here!
- Come on, sit down.

279
00:23:07,713 --> 00:23:09,475
Oh my gosh, she's so beautiful.

280
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,923
- Look at her.
- Good grief.

281
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,305
Who is that girl?

282
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:15,618
I've never seen her before.

283
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,440
Come here.

284
00:23:17,832 --> 00:23:20,087
I want to drink alcohol
poured out by a young girl.

285
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,436
Her job is to play the gayageum,
not pouring alcohol.

286
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,818
She is still a virgin.

287
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:30,942
What?

288
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,309
She's still a virgin?

289
00:23:36,906 --> 00:23:38,006
Hey.

290
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:40,433
How much does the girl's first night cost?

291
00:23:41,717 --> 00:23:43,753
I will pay a high price.

292
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:48,120
There is a procedure for the first night
every girl in Cheongwoon Gisaeng House.

293
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:50,831
I will ask the owner
of the gisaeng house.

294
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:53,255
Okay.

295
00:23:53,295 --> 00:23:55,001
- Raise your glasses.
- Come on.

296
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:57,622
- Let's have a drink.
- Let me pour it out, sir.

297
00:23:57,823 --> 00:23:59,646
Oh, it's bitter.

298
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,200
This is bitter.

299
00:24:01,224 --> 00:24:02,865
- What's this?
- There isn't any.

300
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:04,907
Now it's your turn to drink!

301
00:24:06,025 --> 00:24:08,824
- You should drink too.
- The more you look at her, the more beautiful she is.

302
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:17,553
Sir.

303
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:52,595
I heard...

304
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:56,797
...sir wants to buy
Myeong Wol's first night.

305
00:24:57,098 --> 00:24:58,198
Yes.

306
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:01,382
So,

307
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:04,808
how much does it cost?

308
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:11,776
At Cheongwoon Gisaeng House, we
don't sell the first night for money.

309
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:16,500
The girl will choose the man.

310
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,904
Is it really that important?
A girl's first night?

311
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:28,819
If you are so interested in her,
what about making a bet with her?

312
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:29,526
What?

313
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:33,251
She will risk her honor
which is very valuable for a woman.

314
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:38,455
So, you also have to bet
something very precious to you.

315
00:25:42,348 --> 00:25:43,485
How about your house?

316
00:25:50,171 --> 00:25:51,271
Okay.

317
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:55,243
On the condition that I am the one
Who determines the type of bet.

318
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,177
Good grief.

319
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:03,293
- I cannot wait.
- I can't wait either.

320
00:26:19,726 --> 00:26:21,812
Ssangnyuk game.

321
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:26,104
The winner is the person who
collect these pieces first.

322
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:28,572
Ready?

323
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:43,256
Let's get started.

324
00:26:48,863 --> 00:26:50,461
Okay.

325
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:52,696
Here we go.

326
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:58,035
Wow, double sixes!

327
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,493
Let me see. Move it to where, huh?

328
00:27:04,613 --> 00:27:05,713
Good grief.

329
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,651
Good grief.

330
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:18,883
Oh, my?

331
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:22,993
Oh my gosh. It seems like
Today's destiny is in my hands.

332
00:27:29,746 --> 00:27:32,087
More double sixes!

333
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:36,273
Wow, that's great.

334
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:42,494
It seems like the child's first night
will be yours.

335
00:27:42,518 --> 00:27:43,694
So true.

336
00:27:45,591 --> 00:27:48,471
Isn't she still a
a child learning art?

337
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,701
How could she
put in that place?

338
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,639
She is a child who is
usually quiet and obedient.

339
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:55,544
There has never been
such an incident before.

340
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:57,975
I was reckless with my decisions.

341
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:00,704
No.

342
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,709
If he was a reasonable
person,

343
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:06,151
why would Princess Hwa Ri think...

344
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:07,957
...to play the drum for
Princess Concubine Hyo Jin?

345
00:28:10,093 --> 00:28:12,149
Even if I have to risk the
Cheongwoon Gisaeng House,

346
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,850
I will hold his neck rope.

347
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,048
What will you do?

348
00:28:23,012 --> 00:28:24,151
No need to worry.

349
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:26,537
I never lose a bet.

350
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,722
Forgive me.
Forgive me.

351
00:28:46,272 --> 00:28:47,668
Oh my goodness!

352
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,016
Could you please wait a moment?

353
00:28:52,183 --> 00:28:54,329
If she bets with an
appearance like this,

354
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:56,373
surely, you will not be happy.

355
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:59,693
How about she take a quick shower?

356
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:01,645
Why are you quiet?

357
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:04,911
Clean and tidy up yourself again
to look presentable in front of him.

358
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:07,987
In the end, we will
spend a long night together.

359
00:29:11,192 --> 00:29:13,687
It's not a big deal to leave for a while.

360
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:16,892
Go.

361
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:18,512
Thank You.

362
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:33,537
- Let's just drink alcohol.
- Please come this way, sir.

363
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:49,071
Gosh, I'm so bored.

364
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,296
It is taking so long.

365
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:01,652
She didn't run away, did she?

366
00:30:03,141 --> 00:30:04,241
Impossible.

367
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:10,425
A girl does need a
long time to get dressed.

368
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,643
If you are bored,

369
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:17,225
How abut I replace
Myeong Wol to compete with you?

370
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:23,487
Why would I bet with you?

371
00:30:23,663 --> 00:30:27,972
I will bet
Cheongwoon's Gisaeng House in this round.

372
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:36,340
If you win,

373
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,758
you can get Myeong Wol
and Cheongwoon Gisaeng House.

374
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:50,397
Teacher,Min Hong, are you there?

375
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,384
Princess, what's the matter
at this late hour?

376
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,820
I thought you would be here.

377
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:14,191
Whenever I pass by, you're
always drawing until late at night.

378
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:20,740
I can only draw
after my work is over.

379
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:32,757
What...

380
00:31:33,696 --> 00:31:35,612
...can you help me color?

381
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:37,899
What?

382
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:41,256
When there are many thoughts, it's
better to do a physical activity.

383
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:45,452
Good idea.

384
00:32:04,955 --> 00:32:08,017
THE PRINCESS' WEDDING

385
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,971
THE PRINCESS' WEDDING

386
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,181
Aunt.

387
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:46,376
Whatever people say.

388
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,756
Her Highness the Princess Concubine
was very beautiful on that day.

389
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:56,095
She shines, full of
hope for the future.

390
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:01,715
She felt excited, though she didn'tknow what would happen in the future.

391
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:05,148
Nobody could dare
criticize her for that.

392
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:09,947
With all her heart,
she tries to be happy.

393
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:13,838
Compared to anyone else,you certainly know that very well.

394
00:33:21,396 --> 00:33:22,496
Ah, right.

395
00:33:23,186 --> 00:33:24,378
By the way...

396
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:27,470
...I am a candidate for
your future husband too.

397
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:39,396
You will also participate
in choosing my prospective husband?

398
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,710
Yes.

399
00:33:42,288 --> 00:33:45,187
Even though my family has fallen apart,

400
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:47,833
I still come from a
famous noble family.

401
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,365
Is that true?

402
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:52,206
I always tell the truth.

403
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:55,729
That's why I
also sent my astrology paper.

404
00:33:56,485 --> 00:34:00,023
If you become my husband,
you can't have a concubine.

405
00:34:00,696 --> 00:34:02,544
You can't build a career.

406
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,162
People say it's the same as
being a mural.

407
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,650
What's wrong with being a mural?

408
00:34:08,597 --> 00:34:11,672
It is a mural
which will reduce my life's worries.

409
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,707
It seems like you have a lot of worries.

410
00:34:19,816 --> 00:34:20,916
Correct.

411
00:34:23,547 --> 00:34:24,676
Okay.

412
00:34:25,126 --> 00:34:27,031
If I keep looking
But can't find a husband,

413
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,882
I will make you
a mural at the Palace.

414
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,872
You can't back-out from this deal.

415
00:34:50,666 --> 00:34:51,766
Are you going to be okay?

416
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:55,893
I won't lick my own spit.

417
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:18,137
Okay.

418
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:24,321
Let's start.

419
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,631
This is called gecko versus crocodile.

420
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:30,813
That is true.

421
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,308
Here we go.

422
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,552
Okay.

423
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:41,676
Huh?

424
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,278
- Six doubles.
- Double six!

425
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:30,756
You are lucky.

426
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,928
Wait a moment.

427
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,754
What is it?

428
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,904
We have to change the dice.

429
00:37:10,802 --> 00:37:13,554
Both our dice.

430
00:37:15,812 --> 00:37:18,452
Hey, bring me new dice.

431
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:20,195
Yes, sir.

432
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:30,581
Ah?

433
00:37:32,092 --> 00:37:33,382
How's the bet going?

434
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:39,243
These aren't from this place
so maybe you won't trust these.

435
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:43,027
You better choose a dice
by yourself.

436
00:38:12,347 --> 00:38:15,114
Okay. Let's start again.

437
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,139
Okay.

438
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:14,352
- Double six!
- Double six!

439
00:40:03,121 --> 00:40:04,221
Impossible.

440
00:40:06,285 --> 00:40:07,746
There is something strange.

441
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:10,854
Ugh! Too much!

442
00:40:14,323 --> 00:40:18,285
Did you manipulate the game board?

443
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:25,446
Aren't you the one manipulating?

444
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:29,727
The outside world has outside world laws.

445
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:32,527
This game world...

446
00:40:34,848 --> 00:40:37,331
...has the laws of this world too.

447
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,287
If it turns out to be revealed...

448
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:49,610
...that you use trickery
with these dice...

449
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:51,849
...that's when...

450
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:56,902
...you have to be prepared to lose your hand.

451
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:00,659
SsangYuk.

452
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:04,840
The winner is the person who
collects these pieces first.

453
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:26,462
I won the bet.

454
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,448
Now your property is mine.

455
00:41:35,105 --> 00:41:36,251
No objections, right?

456
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,330
So.

457
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,426
Greed must also have limits.

458
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:08,628
Sir.

459
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:13,454
He did he switch his dice.

460
00:42:15,272 --> 00:42:17,425
But why every time you throw,
It always comes out as a six?

461
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:22,013
Aren't the dice that were used
generally used by girls?

462
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:27,000
I've been dealing with people
like that for years.

463
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:31,268
Not only a day or two.

464
00:43:01,837 --> 00:43:03,661
Isn't this place
my aunt's family home?

465
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:08,825
What are you here for?

466
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:13,534
There is something interesting
that I wanted to show you.

467
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:15,998
Let me go!

468
00:43:17,225 --> 00:43:18,325
Let go!

469
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:21,936
Let go!

470
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:31,336
From now on, the house is mine.

471
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:34,666
What?

472
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:40,849
I am an expert at destroying
people with money.

473
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,244
He is fearless when it comes to
ruining women's lives...

474
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,743
...simply by relying on his status.

475
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:52,122
Everything he owned was taken away,
Living that status empty.

476
00:43:53,843 --> 00:43:57,707
In your opinion, isn't that the
scene of justice?

477
00:43:59,927 --> 00:44:01,174
Yes it is.

478
00:44:03,759 --> 00:44:06,250
How can this happen?

479
00:44:07,546 --> 00:44:09,104
He will live
in a humiliating way.

480
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:10,940
Now he will realize...

481
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:14,803
...what is blasphemy.

482
00:44:24,401 --> 00:44:25,501
Oh yes.

483
00:44:25,846 --> 00:44:28,212
I received the items
belonging to Auntie that you sent.

484
00:44:28,504 --> 00:44:30,305
Thank You.

485
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:34,471
Thanks to you, I feel calmer.

486
00:44:37,393 --> 00:44:39,397
I had doubts about whether
I was being too intrusive.

487
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,392
I'm glad you
feel calm now.

488
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:51,521
However, how did you manage
to get your hands on those valuable items?

489
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:05,498
I managed to get them,
somehow.

490
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,074
Why did we come here?

491
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:34,704
You've come all the way from the palace.

492
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:40,717
There is a beautiful view in this place
that I want to show you.

493
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:54,139
Will this really fly?

494
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:57,807
- Is it true?
- No it won't.

495
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,260
Okay. Let's go.

496
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,753
Do you feel
a little better now?

497
00:47:02,178 --> 00:47:03,311
Yes

498
00:47:04,427 --> 00:47:09,882
From above the sky, the world where people
life feels small and trivial, doesn't it?

499
00:47:13,549 --> 00:47:19,886
At that moment, she knew why.
the man brought her to this place.

500
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:22,953
You are right in front of me.

501
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:25,719
I can do anything for you.

502
00:47:27,102 --> 00:47:30,389
That's how the story about
Chun Hwa's love affair,

503
00:47:30,772 --> 00:47:34,170
including Chun Young's story,
ended up like this.

504
00:47:34,194 --> 00:47:35,501
TONIGHT...

505
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,346
Tonight, I will carve
pleasure in my body and mind.

506
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:45,399
Oh, Sky. We will
spend time together like this.

507
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,052
The Princess who has
completed her revenge,

508
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:54,152
finally woke up in Mureungdowon
after releasing the grudge in this world.

509
00:47:54,176 --> 00:47:59,530
She is in a loving relationship
with a nobleman for a very long time.

510
00:47:59,554 --> 00:48:01,829
SHE'S IN A RELATIONSHIP...

511
00:48:16,078 --> 00:48:17,178
Thank You.

512
00:48:18,806 --> 00:48:20,770
Thanks to you, today was a very pleasant day.

513
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:36,265
If you take me as your husband,
every day will be like this.

514
00:48:40,582 --> 00:48:42,789
Do you like me?

515
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,777
Do you like me too?

516
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:54,908
I don't know.

517
00:48:56,472 --> 00:49:01,401
We can be a good couple
even though we may not love each other.

518
00:49:02,716 --> 00:49:05,912
Even though men and women meet
and fall in love with each other...

519
00:49:06,969 --> 00:49:11,834
...you already know
that too has an end, right?

520
00:49:13,758 --> 00:49:16,255
If we don't love each other,
then there will be no change.

521
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:22,279
You remain yourself,
I remain myself.

522
00:49:23,821 --> 00:49:26,630
The only thing that matters
is mutual respect, right?

523
00:49:28,227 --> 00:49:34,123
I will not have a concubine
or have an affair like Shim Hak Do.

524
00:49:39,398 --> 00:49:42,630
If you still don't believe me, I
will provide a marriage contract.

525
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:44,872
If I ignore
my duty as a husband,

526
00:49:45,203 --> 00:49:47,130
I will submit
all my wealth to you.

527
00:49:47,906 --> 00:49:52,216
Instead, I just
ask that you respect my world.

528
00:49:53,102 --> 00:49:54,427
If you can do that,

529
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,947
I wouldn't mind
if you have another partner.

530
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:01,369
How does it sound?

531
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:04,391
It is a win-win situation, right?

532
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:06,766
Good grief.

533
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:10,725
Is this a joke?

534
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:14,864
Why are you always joking,

535
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,232
even playing with feelings like that?

536
00:50:19,105 --> 00:50:21,344
That's not the kind of marriage I want!

537
00:50:25,534 --> 00:50:26,634
Princess!

538
00:50:28,214 --> 00:50:29,314
Princess!

539
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:03,610
Are things going well?

540
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,636
Yes, thanks to the Royal family and help,

541
00:51:06,732 --> 00:51:09,096
things are going well.

542
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:10,442
That's good to hear.

543
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,878
I don't trust Prince Hwa Seong,

544
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:15,229
but I trust you.

545
00:51:15,899 --> 00:51:19,144
Please guide him well.

546
00:51:22,081 --> 00:51:23,821
Don't worry, Father.

547
00:51:24,404 --> 00:51:27,750
I do whatever
that my wife asks for.

548
00:51:28,394 --> 00:51:30,339
In our house, the wife is king.

549
00:51:32,434 --> 00:51:33,584
Hwa Seong...

550
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,309
Just relax. It's okay.

551
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,742
I'm relieved that you two love each other.

552
00:51:54,135 --> 00:51:55,235
Are you,

553
00:51:55,811 --> 00:51:57,313
feeling better?

554
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,510
About what?

555
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:02,022
About Aunt.

556
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:06,069
Unlike me,

557
00:52:07,766 --> 00:52:10,330
Weren't you close to Aunt?

558
00:52:10,955 --> 00:52:12,420
Thanks to someone,

559
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:15,262
I feel better now.

560
00:52:15,842 --> 00:52:16,990
Thanks to whom?

561
00:52:17,462 --> 00:52:18,562
Who's he?

562
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,371
Did something happen?

563
00:52:40,712 --> 00:52:41,927
Actually,

564
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,593
I...

565
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,299
...already spent...

566
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,934
...my first night with Choi Hwan.

567
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,723
- What?
- Good grief!

568
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:57,579
You are crazy!

569
00:53:00,419 --> 00:53:02,073
How can you do that?

570
00:53:06,492 --> 00:53:07,624
We'll talk later.

571
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,498
Oh my, my heart. So shocked.

572
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:18,476
Thank you, my wife.
You must have been nervous.

573
00:53:18,909 --> 00:53:20,211
Hurry home and rest.

574
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,455
Why go home?
You haven't been here for a long time.

575
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:27,005
Is there something at home?

576
00:53:27,254 --> 00:53:29,212
For you the palace is home,

577
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:31,496
but for my wife, this is her in-laws' house.

578
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:34,616
You guys won't understand
because you are not married yet.

579
00:53:34,873 --> 00:53:37,164
Being a daughtee-in-law is like this.

580
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:39,145
Hwa Seong...

581
00:53:40,807 --> 00:53:42,072
Are you uncomfortable with us?

582
00:53:42,096 --> 00:53:43,207
- Yes.
- What?

583
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,583
Now that we are in-laws?

584
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,000
No.

585
00:53:49,253 --> 00:53:51,819
That was just his assumption.

586
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:54,534
I'm comfortable as usual.

587
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:57,026
Look at that. You're the one who's overreacting.

588
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,668
Right?

589
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:00,767
It's hard to get together like this.

590
00:54:00,791 --> 00:54:04,874
Let's find a place
for us women to chat.

591
00:54:05,593 --> 00:54:06,601
Correct.

592
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:09,129
We also have a lot of things
to discuss.

593
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:11,287
Let's go.

594
00:54:23,812 --> 00:54:25,418
How does it feel to be married?

595
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,300
Is it good?

596
00:54:28,992 --> 00:54:30,098
Whell.

597
00:54:30,865 --> 00:54:32,792
There are good things,

598
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:34,540
and there are also bad things.

599
00:54:35,264 --> 00:54:36,667
What kind of good things?

600
00:54:38,723 --> 00:54:41,209
I'm not so anxious anymore.

601
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:44,413
It feels like I'm getting calmer.

602
00:54:44,741 --> 00:54:46,100
I feel stable.

603
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:51,191
I like having
someone strong by my side.

604
00:54:51,728 --> 00:54:52,987
So what's the bad thing?

605
00:54:57,842 --> 00:54:58,942
Rather than bad...

606
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:01,616
...it is just a bother.

607
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:03,803
However,

608
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:06,619
I'm glad you got through it well.

609
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:08,368
Correct.

610
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:11,035
That's why everyone
tells you to get married.

611
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:14,843
Your Honor,
His Highness the Prince has arrived.

612
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:16,266
What? So soon?

613
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,836
It just started, why are you here already?

614
00:55:20,547 --> 00:55:22,958
Please ask him to wait a moment.

615
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:24,413
Yes, Your Honor.

616
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:49,862
So,

617
00:55:50,228 --> 00:55:52,758
what about the calligraphy club
and paint club now?

618
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:55,602
Can we continue?

619
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:59,149
It would be great if we could all get together
and keep meeting.

620
00:55:59,683 --> 00:56:02,688
I'll prepare a place later.

621
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:05,797
Your Honor.

622
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:09,414
The prince asked for you again.

623
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:15,135
Our conversation is not over yet.

624
00:56:15,176 --> 00:56:17,616
Please wait a moment.

625
00:56:18,149 --> 00:56:19,249
Yes, Your Honor.

626
00:56:21,067 --> 00:56:22,167
Ji Won!

627
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:24,972
What are you doing?

628
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:27,359
When are you coming home, my wife?

629
00:56:27,628 --> 00:56:30,187
Looks like he's hungry.

630
00:56:31,479 --> 00:56:33,655
Please give him a snack.

631
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,088
You really know him well.

632
00:56:36,241 --> 00:56:39,104
If there is something to eat,
he will be silent.

633
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,948
He isn't usually like this.

634
00:56:44,058 --> 00:56:45,644
I don't know why today...

635
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,297
Maybe he's afraid that you
feel foreign in the palace.

636
00:56:49,737 --> 00:56:51,360
It's nice to see this side of his.

637
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:55,438
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

638
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:57,660
Okay, I'm done. I'm going home!

639
00:56:58,128 --> 00:56:59,359
Tell him I'm coming home.

640
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:00,892
Yes, Your Honor.

641
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:09,408
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

642
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:12,141
Because the Prince is being so fussy,

643
00:57:12,812 --> 00:57:14,998
I have to go home now.

644
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,398
Okay, please go home.

645
00:57:18,028 --> 00:57:20,394
He might die from exhaustion.

646
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:39,347
Why did you just come out not?
I've been waiting for a long time.

647
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:42,529
Why are you so impatient?

648
00:57:42,697 --> 00:57:45,208
You could have waited a moment,
but you kept whining.

649
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:48,774
Do you know how embarrassed I am?

650
00:57:48,822 --> 00:57:49,922
What now?

651
00:57:49,986 --> 00:57:52,434
Did Hwa Ri and Hwa Jin instigate you?

652
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:54,984
That's why I asked you to come home quickly.

653
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:57,836
Come on, let's go home quickly.

654
00:57:59,022 --> 00:58:00,205
My wife!

655
00:58:07,008 --> 00:58:08,158
Try this.

656
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:11,316
Earlier the waiter gave me this to eat.

657
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:13,510
But I remembered my wife, so I kept it.

658
00:58:14,382 --> 00:58:15,769
Your favorite snack, right?

659
00:58:24,949 --> 00:58:26,562
That is so sweet of you.

660
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:28,870
Next time,

661
00:58:28,894 --> 00:58:30,613
just eat what is given.

662
00:58:30,663 --> 00:58:32,117
You can ask for it again.

663
00:58:33,628 --> 00:58:35,756
You must be hungry from waiting.

664
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:38,079
Okay.

665
00:58:38,103 --> 00:58:39,929
Next time I will do that.

666
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,960
Is it good?

667
00:58:50,104 --> 00:58:51,525
Yes. It's delicious.

668
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:54,205
You really didn't eat it?

669
00:58:54,851 --> 00:58:57,024
I didn't eat any.

670
00:59:00,039 --> 00:59:01,139
What's this?

671
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:04,338
I thought I would see a huge
domestic dispute...

672
00:59:05,904 --> 00:59:07,004
Ah!

673
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:08,497
That is not important.

674
00:59:10,025 --> 00:59:11,125
Follow me!

675
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:12,707
Finish your previous story!

676
00:59:18,136 --> 00:59:19,432
Oh my gosh, wait.

677
00:59:19,779 --> 00:59:21,686
Walk slower!

678
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:25,932
What actually happened?

679
00:59:25,956 --> 00:59:27,963
How could your first night be with him?

680
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:34,971
That,

681
00:59:35,832 --> 00:59:37,051
just happened.

682
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:39,047
Are you planning to marry him?

683
00:59:43,363 --> 00:59:44,554
I don't know.

684
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,868
You are really in trouble.

685
00:59:47,244 --> 00:59:50,195
If you both spent the night,
of course must marry him!

686
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:53,961
What if you marry someone else?
and your chastity is questioned?

687
00:59:55,394 --> 00:59:56,433
Does it matter?

688
00:59:56,457 --> 00:59:57,557
Of course.

689
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:00,711
The issue is clear. Why do
you act so indifferent?

690
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:07,977
By the way...

691
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:12,692
...Is it fun?

692
01:00:12,972 --> 01:00:13,996
What?

693
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,697
You must understand what I mean.

694
01:00:16,622 --> 01:00:17,883
Now that you have tried it,

695
01:00:18,427 --> 01:00:20,768
was is it really fun?

696
01:00:22,169 --> 01:00:23,269
Hey!

697
01:00:25,943 --> 01:00:27,730
Leave it.

698
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:31,591
Fix your issues first,

699
01:00:33,053 --> 01:00:35,030
then help me with mine.

700
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:39,905
Isn't Minister Lee's wife
looking for a partner for Lee Jang Won?

701
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:42,682
What do you want to do?

702
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,516
Don't know.

703
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:49,400
Is there no good solution?

704
01:00:55,775 --> 01:00:58,795
How about this cloth?

705
01:00:59,478 --> 01:01:03,069
This is the silk used during the wedding
of Prince Hwa Seong and his wife.

706
01:01:03,384 --> 01:01:04,484
Like this.

707
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:08,248
If you add a little cloth like this,

708
01:01:08,455 --> 01:01:10,225
the pleats of the skirt look full.

709
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:13,430
Well.

710
01:01:14,822 --> 01:01:16,623
Is there nothing else?

711
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:20,021
I want something special,

712
01:01:20,736 --> 01:01:23,092
but not too flashy.

713
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:24,747
Okay.

714
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:26,372
In that case...

715
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:07,672
Oh, my!

716
01:02:08,606 --> 01:02:09,805
Lee Jang Won?

717
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:13,039
Princess.

718
01:02:15,096 --> 01:02:16,365
Are you alright?

719
01:02:17,894 --> 01:02:20,051
Am I a person who always has problems?

720
01:02:20,253 --> 01:02:22,350
If anyone hears this, they
might think I'm a troublemaker.

721
01:02:23,608 --> 01:02:24,639
That's not what I meant.

722
01:02:24,663 --> 01:02:26,627
We met at the right time.

723
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:30,138
I have something
which must be done together.

724
01:02:31,961 --> 01:02:33,565
Do you have time?

725
01:02:35,036 --> 01:02:36,136
Yes.

726
01:02:36,682 --> 01:02:37,914
I don't mind.

727
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:39,308
Okay, let's go.

728
01:02:39,483 --> 01:02:42,308
This is a thing that is
very important for women.

729
01:02:48,341 --> 01:02:50,363
I styled the hair this way.

730
01:02:50,387 --> 01:02:52,150
Not too flashy.

731
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:56,709
Now let's use accessories.

732
01:03:15,613 --> 01:03:17,452
Have you chosen your wedding dress?

733
01:03:18,665 --> 01:03:19,765
Not yet.

734
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:21,232
I guessed right.

735
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:23,944
I brought the best
groom-to-be in the capital.

736
01:03:28,062 --> 01:03:29,088
Yes?

737
01:03:29,112 --> 01:03:31,752
Marriage can't happen
only by a woman.

738
01:03:32,254 --> 01:03:34,321
It would be good if men also assisted.

739
01:03:34,345 --> 01:03:37,444
So choose a dress you like best.

740
01:03:37,468 --> 01:03:38,743
And please tell us.

741
01:03:40,558 --> 01:03:42,225
Yes, alright.

742
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,090
I don't really understand women's clothing,

743
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,708
but I will try.

744
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:54,326
Stop smiling. Is it that fun?

745
01:03:55,719 --> 01:03:56,819
Who's smiling?

746
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:00,859
I've prepared the stage.

747
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:03,224
So, pay close attention to
Jang Won's reaction.

748
01:04:03,711 --> 01:04:06,413
See if he has feelings
for you or not.

749
01:04:07,227 --> 01:04:08,327
Okay.

750
01:04:44,003 --> 01:04:45,103
How's this?

751
01:04:47,698 --> 01:04:48,798
That's good.

752
01:04:49,112 --> 01:04:50,212
Really?

753
01:04:50,792 --> 01:04:54,242
Doesn't the embroidery on
the shoulder make it look wide?

754
01:04:54,518 --> 01:04:55,618
Right?

755
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:56,767
Doesn't this

756
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:58,203
looks too stiff?

757
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:02,862
I think it looks beautiful.

758
01:05:04,682 --> 01:05:05,782
Are you sure?

759
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:07,937
This is a once in a lifetime wedding.

760
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:11,351
What do you think about
the embroidery though?

761
01:05:12,057 --> 01:05:13,043
Who knows.

762
01:05:13,067 --> 01:05:14,699
I don't understand women's clothing.

763
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:16,390
This doesn't seem right.
Try another one.

764
01:05:16,414 --> 01:05:17,514
Good.

765
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:33,407
You came to see the wedding dresses?

766
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,320
Yes?

767
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:36,906
Oh, yes.

768
01:05:39,374 --> 01:05:40,474
Good.

769
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:42,828
Let me give you a little advice.

770
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:46,015
A man,

771
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:49,070
can't be honest about his impressions
of women's clothing.

772
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:53,789
Then why ask me to
see and judge it?

773
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:56,314
No matter what men think,

774
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,343
they know how to choose good clothes.

775
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:02,956
So, men,

776
01:06:03,491 --> 01:06:06,261
just need to say this is beautiful,

777
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:08,012
and it's beautiful too,

778
01:06:09,085 --> 01:06:10,346
whatever happens.

779
01:06:11,268 --> 01:06:12,507
If you pretend to know,

780
01:06:13,446 --> 01:06:15,372
and tell the truth,

781
01:06:15,901 --> 01:06:17,001
you will definitely be marked,

782
01:06:17,588 --> 01:06:20,211
as an insensitive man
and don't know anything.

783
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:38,037
How's this?

784
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:42,167
Yes.
It's beautiful.

785
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:44,948
I mean compared to the previous one.

786
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,929
The previously one was beautiful,
and this one is also beautiful.

787
01:06:54,953 --> 01:06:57,674
Isn't the skirt too flashy?

788
01:06:58,394 --> 01:07:01,290
Isn't that what a wedding dress is like?

789
01:07:05,567 --> 01:07:08,728
If it's too loud and flashy,
attention of the invited guests,

790
01:07:09,209 --> 01:07:11,737
will be drawn only
to the wedding dress.

791
01:07:12,348 --> 01:07:13,950
The wedding flower is the bride.

792
01:07:13,974 --> 01:07:15,569
She has to stand out.

793
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:19,388
- Not this one?
- Yes.

794
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:34,883
Look at that.

795
01:07:35,702 --> 01:07:37,496
I told you,
they already have a choice.

796
01:07:39,728 --> 01:07:41,472
I understand now.

797
01:07:53,693 --> 01:07:54,913
- How is this?
- How is this?

798
01:07:58,668 --> 01:08:00,515
Wow, beautiful.

799
01:08:00,566 --> 01:08:02,566
Right? This is the right choice, right?

800
01:08:02,623 --> 01:08:04,294
I told you this one was it.

801
01:08:05,192 --> 01:08:07,290
It may seem a little boring,

802
01:08:07,314 --> 01:08:10,318
what if a tail is added
on the back?

803
01:08:12,312 --> 01:08:13,527
Wait.

804
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:24,866
Oh my gosh, that's right.
This is it.

805
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:27,894
Elegant front
and the back is charming.

806
01:08:27,918 --> 01:08:29,018
Geez.

807
01:08:29,169 --> 01:08:31,098
- Isn't that genius?
- Isn't that genius?

808
01:08:31,122 --> 01:08:33,307
Oh my gosh, it truly is.

809
01:08:33,522 --> 01:08:35,223
Absolutely perfect.

810
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:36,701
What's different?

811
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:40,182
Beautiful, isn't it?

812
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:19,121
Thank you for your time.

813
01:09:19,752 --> 01:09:20,852
Thanks to you,

814
01:09:21,276 --> 01:09:23,624
I could choose a
wedding dress easily.

815
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:26,711
No problem.

816
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:28,396
I'm happy too.

817
01:09:33,815 --> 01:09:36,905
Are you getting married too?

818
01:09:37,432 --> 01:09:39,181
What kind of wife do you want?

819
01:09:40,986 --> 01:09:42,086
Who knows.

820
01:09:43,499 --> 01:09:45,234
I hope to find...

821
01:09:45,424 --> 01:09:48,077
...a person who can appreciate
Herself and others.

822
01:09:48,822 --> 01:09:50,153
What about the appearance?

823
01:09:51,332 --> 01:09:54,000
Honestly, don't men focus on
On the physical aspect?

824
01:10:01,057 --> 01:10:02,790
She just has to be beautiful in my eyes.

825
01:10:11,701 --> 01:10:12,807
It seems like,

826
01:10:13,618 --> 01:10:15,411
I have to change my clothes now.

827
01:10:33,224 --> 01:10:34,700
By the way, Princess.

828
01:10:36,944 --> 01:10:38,406
I feel bad,

829
01:10:39,047 --> 01:10:40,764
after our last meeting.

830
01:10:47,999 --> 01:10:49,785
Let's talk about that later.

831
01:11:13,118 --> 01:11:14,218
However,

832
01:11:14,689 --> 01:11:18,337
Has the Princess ever done that too?
Have you tried on a wedding dress?

833
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:20,843
Just looking at them,

834
01:11:21,251 --> 01:11:23,846
and try trying them
are completely different things.

835
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:29,627
Marriage is still far away,
why should I try dresses now?

836
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:34,793
Still far?

837
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,640
Still very far away.

838
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:05,033
- Wait a moment.
- What?

839
01:13:05,057 --> 01:13:06,157
What's that?

840
01:13:12,234 --> 01:13:13,694
Oh my god stop.
