EPISODE 2

3
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:20,854
How about this cloth?

4
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,082
This is premium silk imported from
Yeongyeong, and there are only three pieces.

5
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:29,223
This fabric sparkles like a rainbow
under the sun.

6
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:31,710
Is it true?

7
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:33,593
Let me see.

8
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:39,739
Excuse me, ma'am.

9
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,008
Is the new edition
Chun Hwa Love Story out yet?

10
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:43,510
I am not sure.

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,312
There's no word yet on a sequel.

12
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,889
I heard that Princess Chun Hwa's character...

13
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:50,617
...is inspired by Princess Hwa Ri.

14
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,452
That seems to be true.

15
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,555
The Princess chose to be alone
because of heartbreak,

16
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,157
so there is no continuation of the story.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,456
That is true.

18
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,894
Actually, I feel sorry for the Princess.

19
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,077
I heard she tried to run away from the palace
and invited her lover to join her.

20
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,770
But her invitation was rejected.

21
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:09,122
She even locked herself up for a month.

22
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,035
she must have been devastated.

23
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,145
And then, the lover found another bride

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,816
who is a young 14 year old girl.

25
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,781
- What?
- He is in a hurry to find a wife

26
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:22,297
so that he can avoid the Princess.

27
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:23,650
Is that so?

28
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:26,809
So they don't love each other?

29
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,923
Princess's love is unrequited?

30
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:31,059
We don't know for sure.

31
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:34,461
Poor her.

32
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:37,501
It seems that you are
very worried about me.

33
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:39,466
- Princess.
- Princess.

34
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,302
If you are curious and worried,
ask me directly.

35
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:46,706
This erotica will not
give you the answer.

36
00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:48,408
What's this?

37
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,113
She does not do me justice!
So ugly!

38
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:00,720
Continue reading.

39
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:05,211
Bring all the clothes here!

40
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,782
I will try everything.

41
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:08,764
Good.

42
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:14,389
The most useless thing in the world
is worrying about the Princess.

43
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:17,064
Her mind is as strong as steel.

44
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:39,161
Now, make me become
the most beautiful woman in the country.

45
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,463
Goodness.

46
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:43,538
You are already the most beautifuul.

47
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,768
How could I possibly make you more beautiful?

48
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,891
I plan on properly ending things.

49
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,610
Surely you aren't...

50
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,209
...going to go to his house?

51
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,715
Yes, I am.

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,818
I'm the one who has to end it.

53
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,954
He should know what he is going to lose.

54
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,725
Okay, I understand.

55
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,356
Your hands are like that of a woman
who never works hard.

56
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,583
You are good at drawing with those hands.

57
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,407
I am drawing this because I get paid a lot.

58
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,251
But is this useful for our business?

59
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,189
Regardless,

60
00:03:42,156 --> 00:03:43,724
girls and mothers believe...

61
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:46,278
...that they will
look like a princess...

62
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:48,628
...if they wear clothes
worn by Princess Hwa Ri.

63
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:52,506
They will realize that's not true
after looking in the mirror.

64
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,834
Clothes can make people look different.

65
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:57,552
- That's true.
- They will look...

66
00:03:57,577 --> 00:03:59,859
...more beautiful than usual.

67
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:09,523
The Princess's aura is very charming today.

68
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:13,607
Doesn't she look like a
general going to war?

69
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,057
Park Chae Jun is getting married today.

70
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,615
Park Chae Jun, who is
the princess' lover, right?

71
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:35,434
Does she want to cause a
commotion at his house?

72
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,673
What's on your mind?

73
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:47,881
It is nothing.

74
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,450
I'm just happy to be able to sit down
with my aunt after so long.

75
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,940
Your belly has gotten much bigger.

76
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:00,734
Aren't you tired?

77
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,201
Not at all.

78
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:04,097
All women experience it.

79
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:09,504
Are you okay?

80
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,841
I heard he got married today.

81
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:21,180
I can't be okay.

82
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,021
I thought...

83
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,040
...I would be the one
to accompanying him at the altar.

84
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:43,054
Father will soon
choose my future husband.

85
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,386
However,

86
00:06:46,095 --> 00:06:49,473
I'm not sure I can be happy
with a husband chosen by the elders.

87
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,212
I will have to spend my entire life
with my husband

88
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:55,888
Can the man they choose...

89
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,293
...love me?

90
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,659
This is my wedding.

91
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:06,829
I wish I could choose my own husband.

92
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:15,601
Marrying a man of equal standing
is not always bad.

93
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:19,205
Marriage is not just
between two people.

94
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,676
Everyone is born and raised
in different environments.

95
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,578
If you have
similar backgrounds,

96
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:29,089
will it not be easier to adapt
to your husband's family?

97
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:32,674
- Is that so?
- Of course.

98
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,539
Besides that,

99
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:39,279
what man can't
love a girl as beautiful as you?

100
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,662
You say that
because you're my aunt.

101
00:07:48,363 --> 00:07:50,303
Don't worry.

102
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:55,508
I'm sure you'll get
a good husband.

103
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,899
Has Princess Hwa Ri
returned safely?

104
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,539
Your Majesty was aware of her escape?

105
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,302
I feel sorry towards your brother.

106
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,804
But I am angry at him.

107
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,668
His son hurt our daughter's feelings.

108
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,540
She insisted on wanting to
give him wedding gifts.

109
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,713
Therefore, I let her go.

110
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,112
But she didn't go there after all.
She only sent the gifts.

111
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,515
Then she went to Hyo Jin's house.

112
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,086
She has been close to her aunt
since childhood.

113
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:43,612
Maybe this problem is too tough
for the princess.

114
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,193
She wanted to stay at
Hyo Jin's house for a while.

115
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:49,128
Of course, I had to allow it.

116
00:08:52,176 --> 00:08:53,711
She will definitely get through this.

117
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:59,472
She will realize that this forbidden
love of hers...

118
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,589
...is an insignificant issue in her life.

119
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:19,697
Will he hit to the right...

120
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,994
...or the left?

121
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:25,398
Do you think...

122
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,906
...you can get a hole-in-one?

123
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:34,674
- Do you...
- Move away.

124
00:09:35,114 --> 00:09:36,583
You're distracting me.

125
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,183
Don't mind me.

126
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,185
I'm talking to myself.

127
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:27,456
Yes!

128
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,145
Hooray!

129
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,529
I win!

130
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,016
Look, Ji Won!

131
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,419
Your future husband won!

132
00:10:58,649 --> 00:10:59,825
Ji Won!

133
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:02,995
Look here, Ji Won!

134
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,776
Even peacocks are not
as noisy as him.

135
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:10,745
Excuse me.

136
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,841
He is indeed insensitive and
always blunt about his feelings.

137
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,791
That's Prince Hwa Seong's strength.

138
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:23,950
Not many people in the palace
are honest like him.

139
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,772
That's a strength?

140
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,841
I have always felt embarassed
because of that.

141
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:32,421
Of course, it is a strength.

142
00:11:34,116 --> 00:11:37,511
It means he has nothing to hide.

143
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,690
Looks like he wants to show off
in front of his future wife.

144
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,174
If I keep playing with him,
I will be the one humilated.

145
00:11:56,398 --> 00:12:00,519
You have shown your greatness to
your wife many times already.

146
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,824
Miss Ji Won is not easily impressed.

147
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:09,061
So, I have to collect
brownie points...

148
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:12,589
...so that I can hold her hand.

149
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,668
Goodness!

150
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,539
Where are you running to?

151
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:27,380
- Stop.
- I'm already yours.

152
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:29,562
Do not leave me.

153
00:12:29,845 --> 00:12:31,751
- Does he like her that much?
- Ji Won!

154
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:33,719
Tell me about it.

155
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,839
Even though he is my brother,
sometimes...

156
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,293
...he makes me feel embarrassed.

157
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:43,988
He make me laugh.

158
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,033
I used to feel anxious often.

159
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:58,709
Don't go just yet.

160
00:12:58,857 --> 00:13:00,813
The sun hasn't set yet.

161
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:04,884
Your behavior embarrasses me.
I don't want to be near you.

162
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:07,843
Why should you be ashamed?

163
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,022
I'm already yours...

164
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,876
...and you...

165
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:14,226
You! Don't talk about that!

166
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,729
What if someone hears?

167
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:42,688
I want everyone in the world
to hear it.

168
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,828
I am yours...

169
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:48,027
...and you are mine.

170
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,031
So...

171
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,866
Since that incident,
you never-

172
00:13:56,524 --> 00:13:57,704
That's why,

173
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:02,815
I'm afraid you regret what happened.

174
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,650
Come closer for a moment.

175
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,419
I want to say something.

176
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:36,509
Tomorrow I want to visit the
library of the Royal Academic Institute.

177
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,765
Please pick me up in the morning.

178
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:50,156
Let's go.

179
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,683
Wait. Stop right there!

180
00:15:42,616 --> 00:15:44,844
Are they happy doing it in a carriage?

181
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:47,923
They do!

182
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,152
They're too loud!

183
00:15:59,646 --> 00:16:01,527
The Princess has arrived.

184
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,389
Father. Mother.

185
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:25,317
There's something I want to say.

186
00:16:25,912 --> 00:16:26,876
Don't.

187
00:16:28,909 --> 00:16:30,604
Do you evem know what
I want to talk about?

188
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:32,608
I know it isn't good news.

189
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,660
Therefore, I do not want to hear it.

190
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,042
Father, you have to hear it.

191
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,627
This is about my life.

192
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:40,110
Enough!

193
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:44,477
Let's hear what
what she wants to say.

194
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,638
Oh goodness.

195
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:53,685
I will get married.

196
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,115
- Really?
- Are you really serious?

197
00:16:57,815 --> 00:16:59,109
Yes. Even though I keep refusing,

198
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:02,069
Father will still force me to
get married anyway, right?

199
00:17:02,117 --> 00:17:05,612
- Correct.
- So, I am willing to get married.

200
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:08,617
Good. You made the right decision.

201
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,151
It feels like all of my worries
disappeared instantly.

202
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:15,534
- But.
- What?

203
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,630
Let me choose my future husband
myself.

204
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,671
What did you say?

205
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,511
Did you see that?

206
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:26,587
You're seeing this, right?

207
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,397
I had expected this.

208
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:31,019
That's why I didn't want to listen.

209
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:34,119
Your request is very unreasonable.

210
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,829
Marriage is a sacred ritual.

211
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,320
How could a princess dare to
choose a future son-in-law for the king?

212
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,682
It's not in the laws of this country.

213
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:42,696
Forget it. It's not going to happen.

214
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,193
Father.

215
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,119
I said no!

216
00:17:47,004 --> 00:17:49,606
That will never happen.
Don't talk about it anymore.

217
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:51,481
Hey.

218
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:57,150
You have decided to get married.
Just follow your father's wishes.

219
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:59,878
He will look for
a good partner for you.

220
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:03,657
- Father, you won't be the one living with him!
- This kid!

221
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,754
The person wil be married to me.
I will be the one staying with him for life.

222
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:10,335
Of course I have the right
to make the choice.

223
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,667
What you're saying is too...

224
00:18:13,296 --> 00:18:14,035
My goodness.

225
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,630
We understand.
Leave for now.

226
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,604
Oh my, my my.

227
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:37,282
Why is she like this?

228
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:40,457
We raised her
without any shortcomings.

229
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:44,623
How can a girl dare to
choose her own partner?

230
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,643
Does it make sense?

231
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,463
She’s like that because
she’s like you.

232
00:18:52,117 --> 00:18:53,453
I was never like that.

233
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:56,809
I always obey the rules
and act as an example to others.

234
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,337
You know that.

235
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,682
Did you forget?

236
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:06,574
Your highness, too, ignored Kim Sook Bin
who had been chosen as your future wife,

237
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:09,368
and you married me instead.

238
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:16,288
Just pretend to lsiten to
The Princess' wishes.

239
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,427
After all, the final candidates for Princess's husband
have been determined.

240
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,831
Show her the final candidates
before the official annuncement.

241
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:27,566
Follow the official procedure,
and then finally announce the marriage.

242
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,273
In that way, we can maintain our dignity
and the Princess's pride.

243
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,210
You're right, but...

244
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:43,337
...do I really need to involve the
Princess in the last selection round?

245
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,653
It's never been done before.

246
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:50,506
I've already have an idea.

247
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,935
Princess.

248
00:19:54,757 --> 00:19:56,495
Her Majesty the Queen will be here soon.

249
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:04,917
You haven't been eating enough lately,

250
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,793
So I made your favorite honey cookies .

251
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:10,069
Thank you.

252
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,521
When you said you want to
choose your own husband,

253
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,851
I thought you were back
to being your normal self.

254
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,440
But why do you look so gloomy?

255
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:23,620
That's because...

256
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,659
When I sit still and ruminate,

257
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:33,261
I feel scared about marrying
a man I do not know.

258
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:36,284
To be honest,

259
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:39,905
I don't want to get married yet.

260
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:42,969
Honestly,

261
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,464
I don't understand my feelings.

262
00:20:49,022 --> 00:20:51,216
Sometimes I'm sad,

263
00:20:52,182 --> 00:20:53,519
and sometimes cheerful.

264
00:20:57,243 --> 00:20:59,331
I want to be happy again,

265
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:04,107
but I don't know how.

266
00:21:09,423 --> 00:21:10,402
You've tried your best.

267
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:15,607
It must not be easy to calm your heart.

268
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:20,806
But you chose to move forward
instead of just keeping quiet.

269
00:21:21,374 --> 00:21:22,781
That makes me proud.

270
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,354
Your father...

271
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:34,420
...worries about making you choose your
husband at a formal event,

272
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:38,897
but he gives you the permission
to give your vote before the main event.

273
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:42,000
- Is that true?
- Yes.

274
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,940
I have invited the families of the
possible candidates to a tea party...

275
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,908
...so you can meet them
first and choose the right one.

276
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,278
Meet them and choose the one
that suits you best.

277
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:57,249
Will anyone want to be my husband?

278
00:21:58,091 --> 00:21:59,897
Being the King's son-in-law is not easy.

279
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,487
Princess Hwa Ri.

280
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,026
You are a princess.

281
00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:11,268
A princess does not need to depend on
and follow other people's wishes.

282
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,746
Even though it is difficult,

283
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:16,268
make a decision that
suits your position as the Princess,

284
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,337
and take responsibility for that decision.

285
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,396
You just need to choose the best,

286
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,044
and take responsibility for your choice.

287
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,613
Isn't that why...

288
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,216
...you asked for your Father's permission
to choose in the first place?

289
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,756
I don't know what to do.

290
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,833
All who received
tea party invitation from the Queen...

291
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,348
...are candidates for the King's son-in-law.

292
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,665
It has been disguised as a tea party.

293
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:49,501
It's clear that it's an election event
for the King's future son-in-law.

294
00:22:50,052 --> 00:22:52,919
I wouldn't mind if this event was
for the Concubine-born Princess Hwa Jin,

295
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:56,141
but it turns out to be for
the notoriously strange Princess Hwa Ri.

296
00:22:56,343 --> 00:22:57,843
I don't want to think about it.

297
00:22:58,211 --> 00:23:00,746
I can't possibly refuse an
invitation from the Queen.

298
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:06,319
But if we go, then someone has to be
chosen to be the Princess' husband?

299
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,100
We need to arrange sons'
weddings before...

300
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,063
...the marriage ban is implemented
for the selection of the Royal son-in-law.

301
00:23:13,216 --> 00:23:15,616
There are many things to worry about.

302
00:23:16,102 --> 00:23:18,035
Since the Princess' brother was exiled,

303
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,100
she lives her life as if nothing exists,
as if nothing matters.

304
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,770
But as a result,
her true personality is revealed.

305
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,954
There is a saying that says that
humans don't really change.

306
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:31,631
Oh...

307
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,413
When will the tea party be held?

308
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,349
In one week.

309
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,419
Even though she is very loved
by His Majesty,

310
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,679
The empress who came from
from an ordinary family,

311
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:45,403
does not fully understand the
manners of noble women.

312
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,063
For noble ladies, they
have their own society.

313
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,726
HALL

314
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:12,118
Thankfully, the weather is sunny today.

315
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:16,154
Won't the guests feel burdened?

316
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:21,393
They might feel awkward if they learn
that this is my husband-selection event.

317
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:24,062
Since there is no official order yet,

318
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:26,633
this will only be considered
as a regular tea party.

319
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:28,673
Don't feel pressured,

320
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,769
meet them calmly and comfortably, okay?

321
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,954
Your Honour.

322
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:40,280
The guests started arriving one by one.

323
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:41,646
Okay.

324
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,960
Why are they going that way,

325
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,435
even though the tea party is here?

326
00:25:07,434 --> 00:25:08,673
I'll find out.

327
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,209
Can you heat the tea again?

328
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,379
Let's get up, Mother.

329
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,849
Looks like no one is coming.

330
00:25:58,647 --> 00:25:59,506
Your Honour.

331
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:02,108
It seems that the wives and guests
who were invited to the tea party,

332
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,497
are with Ms. Sook Bin.

333
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,099
What?

334
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:09,319
I have clearly asked
they to come to my party.

335
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:11,485
Did they not accept my invitation?

336
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,006
It is not like that.

337
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:14,577
Mrs. Kim Sook Bin,

338
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,163
organized a charity market to
help people having food shortages.

339
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:22,282
They apologized
because they couldn't come to the party.

340
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:25,705
They said that a tea party can be arranged
any time, but

341
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:30,784
they have the opportunity to help
the poor only today.

342
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,531
I heard you invited
the wives of the officials to a tea party?

343
00:26:39,774 --> 00:26:40,932
Correct.

344
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:43,925
Because you invited them directly,

345
00:26:44,022 --> 00:26:47,626
they can't refuse even if they
have other plans.

346
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:52,014
Is their particpation a direct order
from Your Highness the Queen?

347
00:26:55,195 --> 00:26:56,689
This is not an order.

348
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:02,422
So their particpation
is not mandatory, yes?

349
00:27:08,328 --> 00:27:09,598
Correct.

350
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,867
I just invited them
to have tea and have a chat.

351
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:16,155
So there is no need to feel burdened.

352
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:17,821
Oh, I see.

353
00:27:18,282 --> 00:27:19,437
Okay.

354
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,817
Sorry, Mother.

355
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:33,537
- It's because of me.
- No.

356
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:36,990
A charity market could have
been organized at another time,

357
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:41,094
but with Sook Bin holding the market
at the same time as my tea party,

358
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:45,415
Makes it seem as if I lack in kindness.

359
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,136
Is this the right place
for the tea party?

360
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,882
Is there any fun entertainment here?

361
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,454
This should be enough to return the favor.

362
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,510
Why is he here?

363
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,809
Wait a minute, Mother.

364
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,688
Come, see me for a moment.

365
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,961
Come out, come out quickly.

366
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,865
Why did you come here?

367
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,150
What?

368
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:30,592
I already repaid you with
valuable jewelry that night

369
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,147
Is that still not enough?

370
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:35,073
You came here all the
way to threaten me?

371
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,500
Ah.

372
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:39,132
sighs.

373
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:40,882
You must have already
pawned the jewelry away.

374
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,280
just look at your luxurious appearance.

375
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:45,110
Do I look luxurious?

376
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,920
I am getting blinded
by your gold-threaded clothing.

377
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,117
That means I succeeded.
My efforts were not in vain.

378
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,980
How much?

379
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,961
How much should I pay
so that you keep your mouth shut?

380
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,798
If you think,

381
00:29:59,158 --> 00:30:02,452
you can take the money and
secretly report to His Majesty,

382
00:30:03,004 --> 00:30:05,917
you won't get out
from here alive.

383
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:06,808
I...

384
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,676
...am the princess of this country.

385
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,114
I'm scared.

386
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,762
Forget about the money.

387
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:21,179
If Your Majesty The Princess considers
me as a candidate for your future husband,

388
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,321
I will keep my mouth shut.

389
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:25,911
W-what?

390
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,833
scoffs

391
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,165
You want to take advantage of
my weakness and become my husband?

392
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,267
What is your weakness?

393
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:36,643
That night,

394
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:38,762
when you tried to run away,

395
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:41,559
It felt like I saw you
as a princess for the first time.

396
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,842
Shut up!

397
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,551
It seems like you have misunderstood me.

398
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:47,434
Let me formally introduce myself.

399
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,051
I was invited to the tea party
by the Empress.

400
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:52,552
My name,

401
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,355
Choi Hwan.

402
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:57,389
Choi Hwan?

403
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:05,778
The famous player in Doseong,
who regularly visits the brothel?

404
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,668
- That Choi Hwan?
- Correct.

405
00:31:08,726 --> 00:31:11,119
The Choi Hwan who has more money,

406
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:14,741
- than the kings of this country. That Choi Hwan?
- Correct.

407
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,343
I am the owner of Cheongwoon Gisaeng House,

408
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,746
and the ship to Yanjing is also mine.

409
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,217
Choi Hwan is still unmarried?

410
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,851
Yes, correct.

411
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:35,982
I heard, this event is actually for
choosing a husband for the Princess under the guise of a tea party,

412
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,198
but it seems like I'm the only one who came?

413
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,266
The tea party was cancelled.

414
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,406
Now, please leave.

415
00:31:48,863 --> 00:31:50,108
No way!

416
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:53,899
I came all the way dressed up
in this gold-threaded outfit

417
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,850
I should be compensated for all the effort.

418
00:31:57,384 --> 00:32:02,563
Plus, I'm grateful that my
competitors withdrew voluntarily.

419
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:07,930
Since I'm the only candidate,
will I be chosen as the final choice?

420
00:32:08,084 --> 00:32:09,861
Go away, I'm not in the mood to joke around.

421
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:12,730
Even if you don't mean it,

422
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:15,890
what is lacking for Doseong merchant
and a player?

423
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,272
I'm not joking either.

424
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,142
I don't consider the position of
the Princess' husband as a joke.

425
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,979
This is not your fault.

426
00:32:30,854 --> 00:32:35,387
They don't know yet
how valuable you are.

427
00:32:39,294 --> 00:32:43,799
Competimg people for something
worthless is not fun.

428
00:32:45,326 --> 00:32:49,132
How about we
make an agreement today?

429
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,488
Agreement?

430
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:55,376
I coincidentally heard that Ms. Sook Bin

431
00:32:55,944 --> 00:32:59,064
opened a charity market that coincided
with the Empress's tea party.

432
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,183
So?

433
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,641
Using money to create problems,

434
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:06,555
That's Choi Hwan's speciality.

435
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:23,468
How did Mrs. Sook Bin
think about something amazing like this?

436
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,509
We sell unused items.

437
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,507
and provide assistance
for people in need?

438
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,596
There are many people
facing a food shortage right now.

439
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,847
I was wondering
about what I could do.

440
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:37,922
Thank you, all of you noble wives
who have supported me.

441
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,633
Of course, we must help
when it comes to good deeds.

442
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:48,493
But why does the timing coincide?
with the Empress' tea party?

443
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,898
The Empress shouldn't
hate us for not coming.

444
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,898
No need to worry, this is for the people.

445
00:33:54,566 --> 00:34:01,341
After all, the Empress herself said that
it was not mandatory and that there is no coercion.

446
00:34:02,147 --> 00:34:03,560
Please don't worry.

447
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,812
By the way,
since everyone is here,

448
00:34:07,948 --> 00:34:11,186
I wonder how many people
attended the tea party

449
00:34:11,922 --> 00:34:15,170
There was one person who went, Choi Hwan.

450
00:34:15,206 --> 00:34:16,679
Choi Hwan?

451
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:18,324
That player?

452
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,685
Why did he go there?

453
00:34:21,505 --> 00:34:22,745
Who knows.

454
00:34:22,832 --> 00:34:26,159
Maybe the position of the royal son-in-law is
the only thing he doesn't have yet.

455
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,267
How is it possible
a lowly businessman like him,

456
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:32,354
comes from a family with
long history in public service?

457
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:39,223
Please buy it.

458
00:34:45,057 --> 00:34:47,529
Did Lee Jae Sang's family not come?

459
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,145
They couldn't come because the wedding of
the bride and groom is getting closer.

460
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:54,394
They should have
at least sent Mr. Jang Won.

461
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:58,365
This...

462
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,423
Is this item for sale?

463
00:35:02,863 --> 00:35:03,368
Yes.

464
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:08,639
I used this a lot when I was little.

465
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:13,198
It is a valuable item
because it was used for a good purpose.

466
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,381
Oh, I see.

467
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,783
- His hands.
- What's that?

468
00:35:19,026 --> 00:35:21,666
If so, I will pay more.

469
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:24,448
I would be very grateful
if you did that.

470
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,423
I think my sister will like it.

471
00:35:28,536 --> 00:35:30,362
Do you want to give it to your sister?

472
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,295
Yes.

473
00:35:32,155 --> 00:35:33,761
You are very considerate.

474
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:35,615
Oh, no, no.

475
00:35:36,645 --> 00:35:40,459
In my house, there are many
things I used as a kid.

476
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:43,174
I'm so sorry
I don't have them with me.

477
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,010
They would be perfect for kids.

478
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,247
Is it true?

479
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:52,275
If so, could I please visit
your house with my sister?

480
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,420
Of course.

481
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,155
Anytime.

482
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:58,239
The Princess has arrived.

483
00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:00,583
- Princess?
- Princess?

484
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,232
I came to see Mrs. Sook Bin.

485
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,951
Why did the Princess come with that man?

486
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:28,259
Who?

487
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:30,523
Choi Hwan.

488
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:32,560
Oh, he's the one from the gisaeng house.

489
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:34,572
He's handsome too, huh.

490
00:36:34,632 --> 00:36:35,804
Stop looking at him.

491
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:38,359
I heard the Empress
is having a tea party.

492
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,331
Why are you here?

493
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:43,737
I heard you opened a charity market
for people who do not have food.

494
00:36:44,515 --> 00:36:47,228
I came to join
in this good activity.

495
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,311
A lot has been collected
thanks to the help of many people.

496
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,793
You don't need to participate.

497
00:36:54,847 --> 00:36:55,580
No.

498
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,851
We should do good
deeds together.

499
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:03,054
Incidentally, there is a trader who has the
same goal of wanting to help.

500
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:04,691
Is that so?

501
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:11,131
Incidentally, I have abundantly excess
seeds from the last harvest,

502
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,538
so I wanted to use those
to be of assistance.

503
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,399
- Come here.
- Okay.

504
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,793
Did you spend a lot of money?

505
00:37:40,149 --> 00:37:41,895
This is nothing.

506
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,296
How much money does he have?

507
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,034
He is handsome and rich.

508
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:54,267
Please share all donations
to the people, in the name of the Empress.

509
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,210
- What?
- If it wasn't for the Empress' tea party,

510
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:02,315
I wouldn't have known about
this charity market at the palace.

511
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,785
So all these donations

512
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,953
are therefore a donation under
the Empress' name, right?

513
00:38:10,975 --> 00:38:11,976
Correct.

514
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:15,960
Look.

515
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:22,102
All these donations must be given
to the people in the name of the Empress.

516
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,437
Do you understand?

517
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,137
- Yes.
- Yes.

518
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:41,678
With the collective help of
Mrs Sook Bin and the Empress,

519
00:38:41,707 --> 00:38:44,281
we can save
more than a thousand islands.

520
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,024
I've never felt this happy.

521
00:38:47,294 --> 00:38:48,801
I thank you too.

522
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:51,511
Alright.

523
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,490
HALL
Your name is Choi Hwan, right?

524
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:55,231
Yes, Your Majesty.

525
00:38:55,471 --> 00:38:58,811
I appreciate your good intentions.
and want to give you a gift.

526
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:01,253
What do you want?

527
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,933
Forgive me.

528
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:05,746
That was a sudden question.

529
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:12,101
You followed Princess Hwa Ri's wishes
and provided assistance.

530
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,685
Do you want to be the Princess' husband?

531
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,455
No, Father!

532
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,626
Hey, I didn't ask you.

533
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:23,463
He just has a lot of money.

534
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,533
He just wanted to use it
for the benefit of the people.

535
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,200
Did I say that?

536
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,137
Yes, you did.

537
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,038
It's as the Princess said.

538
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:40,378
Yes, just tell me if there is anything
that you want.

539
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,374
Could you...

540
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,231
...Could you please assist me
when I will need your help one day?

541
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,119
Alright.

542
00:40:11,249 --> 00:40:16,547
I will help you with
your request anytime.

543
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:20,017
Thank you very much, Your Majesty.

544
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:43,476
Calm down, ma'am.

545
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:48,107
This ceremony will be a success
if you stay calm.

546
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:51,302
I know.

547
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:53,626
I know, but

548
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:57,141
the more I try to stay calm,
the more I can't.

549
00:41:14,785 --> 00:41:16,152
Your Honour.

550
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,313
It's time to go to the Crown Princess' chambers.

551
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:24,783
Is today that day?

552
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:25,919
Yes.

553
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,519
You must hurry, Your Majesty.

554
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,390
Today, you must carry out your duties.

555
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:38,062
Okay.

556
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:02,522
I was ordered
to pick up the Princess.

557
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:05,156
Alright.

558
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:06,891
Please come this way.

559
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:24,377
First of all, how
about we make a deal?

560
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,348
What is the deal about?

561
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,755
Consider me as a candidate for
your future husband.

562
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,526
Considering is not
the hard part, but

563
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,702
Do you really
want to be my husband?

564
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:50,097
Yes.

565
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,872
Why? For what reason?

566
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:54,170
Because...

567
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:59,382
...I am fascinated by you.

568
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:10,462
After everything is done today,
could you spare some time for me?

569
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,559
[FAMILY RESILIENCE...]

570
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:26,637
Isn't this the brothel?

571
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,561
Sir is waiting inside, Princess.

572
00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:34,705
Anyone here?

573
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:36,974
Anyone? Hello?

574
00:44:38,612 --> 00:44:40,344
Is no one here?

575
00:44:42,148 --> 00:44:45,719
What is this? It's so scary.

576
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,863
Thank you for coming.

577
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:32,763
I've tried my best
to decorate the place.

578
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,367
What do you think?

579
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:39,570
It's okay.

580
00:45:46,934 --> 00:45:47,745
I'm fine.

581
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:52,419
Ouch!

582
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,723
Are you okay?

583
00:46:00,126 --> 00:46:01,581
No nosebleed?

584
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:05,329
I'm fine.

585
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,969
The Princess who planned to
run away with her lover,

586
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:15,205
is this your first time
falling into a man's arms?

587
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:18,730
That's none of your business.

588
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,883
This is my first time.

589
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,921
This is my first time
trying so hard...

590
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:31,725
...to win a woman's heart.

591
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,622
Usually, showing off
my wealth is good enough.

592
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,559
Must be nice. But wealth
won't be enough...

593
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:44,368
...to make you the king's son-in-law.

594
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:49,328
Then, how about we try
using the power of alcohol?

595
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:34,685
On my way here, I was
thinking about something.

596
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:39,059
Everyone is afraid of being the
king's son-in-law.

597
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:44,464
Why are you so keen
on becoming my husband?

598
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:47,133
I am fascinated by you.

599
00:47:50,384 --> 00:47:52,589
A man who is fascinated with a woman,

600
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:55,140
would not look at her with such an expression.

601
00:47:55,697 --> 00:47:57,235
Do not say such things,
even as a joke.

602
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,580
I am not drawn to you
because you are a woman...

603
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,697
I am drawn to you because of
the kind of person you are.

604
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,975
You bet on your brother's virginity,

605
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:29,042
Tried to elope with your lover.

606
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:34,614
You even demanded to
choose your own husband.

607
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,581
That's why I am intrigued by you.

608
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,920
What does the world look like to you?

609
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,858
Will I see things differently
when I'm by your side?

610
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:54,201
I felt such curiousity and excitement
after a long time.

611
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,876
You will be disappointed.

612
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,443
As for me...

613
00:49:08,001 --> 00:49:09,580
..I am too naive.

614
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:17,063
Even after losing such a
meaningful relationship,

615
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:23,494
I am not trying to find the King's
son-in-law, but a lover.

616
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:29,421
As a princess, I should be looking
for a suitable future husband, but

617
00:49:31,192 --> 00:49:32,382
I...

618
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,041
I, Hwa Ri...

619
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:44,694
...still dream foolosh,
childish dreams

620
00:49:47,337 --> 00:49:49,673
If I wasn't a princess,

621
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,122
Would you still want to
become the king's son-in-law?

622
00:49:58,695 --> 00:49:59,599
No.

623
00:50:01,294 --> 00:50:03,649
I like you because you are a princess.

624
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:08,438
You were born a princess,

625
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:12,500
You were brought up with all the luxury
in the palace for 18 year.

626
00:50:13,769 --> 00:50:15,371
Hwa Ri is a princess.

627
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,887
How can you be Hwa Ri,
if you aren't a princess?

628
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:25,577
- But...
- ...you shouldn't worry about such things.

629
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:30,928
The others might avoid you
because they're afraid of you.

630
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:35,899
Or they might feel burdoned by the
position of the King's son-in-law

631
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:41,760
But that's about it.

632
00:50:44,133 --> 00:50:47,699
I like you because you are a princess.

633
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,647
I like you because you are beautiful.

634
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:56,389
I also like you because being with
you will elevate my status.

635
00:50:57,567 --> 00:51:01,221
Such people are
called materialistic.

636
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,615
Is that so?

637
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:08,865
Well, I think of myself as
an honest person.

638
00:51:11,137 --> 00:51:13,328
If you put it like that,
I guess I have to agree.

639
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,677
So please stay a princess, okay?

640
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:24,618
His Highness the Crown Prince has arrived.

641
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,240
Welcome.

642
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,876
I'm not late, am I?

643
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:52,430
You came just in time.

644
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:51,815
Hey, you materialistic person.

645
00:55:58,255 --> 00:56:00,560
Since you claim to be very honest,

646
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,193
I want to ask you one thing.

647
00:56:12,736 --> 00:56:14,841
What do you think of me,

648
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:20,440
the Princess Hwa Ri?

649
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,550
How honest should
I be?

650
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:30,297
Answer with complete honesty
without the slightest lies.

651
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:33,693
I would greatly appreciate that.

652
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:02,052
If you weren't a princess,

653
00:57:04,325 --> 00:57:09,172
I would have held you
in my arms right now.

654
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,964
I want to hug you tightly,

655
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:19,424
kiss you on your beautiful lips.

656
00:57:22,066 --> 00:57:23,867
Tell you that everything is fine,

657
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,643
tell you that you're beautiful.

658
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:29,867
I would ask you to look at me.

659
00:57:32,276 --> 00:57:34,005
That's how fast I want
to go with you.

660
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:40,411
But since you are a Princess,
I can't do that.

661
00:57:42,567 --> 00:57:45,031
You don't even believe that
I am infatuated by you

662
00:57:45,198 --> 00:57:48,472
So, all I can do is console
myself with alcohol.

663
00:57:51,182 --> 00:57:55,906
Am I actually beautiful?

664
00:57:59,112 --> 00:58:00,145
Yes.

665
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:10,729
If I look at you this way...

666
00:58:13,379 --> 00:58:14,679
...what would you want to do?

667
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,808
Now I...

668
00:58:31,251 --> 00:58:33,231
...am curious about what you just said.

669
00:59:02,267 --> 00:59:03,995
Are you sure you won't regret this?

670
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:49,567
Slow down a bit, my husband.

671
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,071
There were only the two of them in the room.

672
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:59,426
Full of faint sighs
and a sweet, hot taste.

673
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,847
After that, his fingers
merged with her body,

674
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:06,700
opening Chun Hwa's softness,
making her wet

675
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:16,527
Chun Hwa moaned as if she was in pain.
Yeong Jun stopped and asked,.

676
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,052
"Does it hurt?"

677
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:24,902
Chun Hwa looked into Yeong Jun's eyes
and said...

678
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:27,308
"Don't stop."
