00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,134
Did you...

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,055
...approach me with that kind
of intention from the beginning?

4
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,350
Because I’m a princess,

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,103
did you think I could help you...

6
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,022
...achieve your grand dreams?

7
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,279
I’ll take responsibility...

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,156
...for everything that happened
because of me.

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,701
I’ll also do everything I can...

10
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,745
...to protect the innocent.

11
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,373
However,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,252
my relationship with you...

13
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:46,755
...ends here.

[BOOKSTORE]

15
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,512
Are you here to pack your things?

16
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,471
Yes.

17
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,558
I heard the situation has gotten worse.

18
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,063
Are you alright?

19
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,445
Turns out the one chasing
that foolish dream...

20
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,616
...wasn’t the Princess,

21
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,746
but me.

22
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,670
There’s no point...

23
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,048
...regretting it now.

24
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,926
But before I die,

25
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,847
I wish I could experience
just one magical moment

26
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,642
that tells me...

27
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,731
...that my dream...

28
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,864
...wasn’t in vain.

29
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:38,945
Yes.

30
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,155
What is it?

31
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,742
There’s something important I need to say...

32
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,913
...to Father, regarding
Chun Hwa’s Love Story.

33
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:50,707
That’s none of your concern.

34
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,375
That’s not true.

35
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,545
Father.

36
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,424
Lee Mong Heon,
the author of Chun Hwa’s Love Story...

37
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,180
...is me.

38
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,348
What did you say?

39
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,769
What nonsense are you talking now?
You’re saying you’re Lee Mong Heon?

40
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,356
I’m not lying.

41
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,193
How could you do something like this!

42
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,445
I’m sorry, but it’s the truth.

43
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,909
I should have confessed earlier
and apologized,

44
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,619
but I didn’t have the courage.

45
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,288
How dare you!

46
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,083
How dare a princess—who should set
an example for others—

47
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,503
write a story that
corrupts the morals of society!

48
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,129
How dare you!

49
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,342
Because I wanted change.

50
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,887
Even though I’m a princess...

51
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,931
I hate the reality where I
can’t do anything.

52
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,018
That’s why I wanted to live in
a different world—even if only in a book!

53
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,652
Everything that happened because of
Chun Hwa's Love Story is my responsibility.

54
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,656
So please punish me...

55
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,243
...and show mercy to the innocent.

56
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,288
Minister Il Jae...

57
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,832
...linked Chun Hwa's Love Story
to a private school

58
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,834
and accused my uncle.

59
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,212
But he is not the one behind it.

60
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,047
Most of the people involved
in writing the book—

61
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,133
they only did it to make a living.

62
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,345
They had nothing to do
with politics or ideology.

63
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,100
No matter what the punishment,
I’ll accept it.

64
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,353
But please show mercy
to those who did nothing wrong.

65
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,115
You...

66
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,910
You are not...

67
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,120
...Lee Mong Heon.

68
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,664
You’ll never be...

69
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,834
...someone like Lee Mong Heon!

70
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,852
I trusted you...

71
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,065
...and even gave you the chance
to choose your own husband, but you...

72
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,610
...forgot your duties as a princess
and wrote that book...

73
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,935
...titled Chun Hwa’s Love Story.
Because of that,

74
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,909
you almost brought harm...

75
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,452
...to innocent lives.

76
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,164
Don’t dream dreams you can’t...

77
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,167
...take responsibility for!

78
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,591
His Majesty the King has appointed you
as the royal son-in-law,

79
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,635
and wedding preparations are underway.

80
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,722
Does the Princess...

81
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,141
...have to accept this too?

82
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,142
Yes, you're right.

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,106
The King was furious
when Minister Il Jae linked...

84
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,149
...Chun Hwa's Love Story
to private academies.

85
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,195
With the Crown Princess’ position in danger,

86
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,031
he must’ve taken steps to protect her.

87
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,659
This decision...

88
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,994
...was made after serious deliberation.

89
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,163
Please ensure the wedding preparations go smoothly.

90
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,295
The Princess' uncle, you said?

91
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:27,090
And they’re saying
it’s some kind of erotic novel!

92
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,301
They claim it was spread
by people from those schools.

93
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,387
But hey, it’s not even confirmed yet.

94
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,556
The truth will come out, right?

95
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,016
Still, I feel like I’ve seen him before.

96
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,602
Wasn’t he the one handing out petitions?

97
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,022
Oh my gosh, you’re right! That petition!

98
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,733
Let’s get out of here, quick!

99
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,361
Ugh. What is this? The end of the world?

100
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,347
[SEARCHING FOR]

101
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,739
Princess.

102
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,650
When I left the palace,

103
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,528
I saw your wanted posters...

104
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,156
...already posted all over the city.

105
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,535
This is a dangerous situation for you too.

106
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,121
Yes.

107
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,333
I'm aware of that too.

108
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,043
Father...

109
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,170
...has given you one week

110
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,800
to evacuate immediately
with the innocent people...

111
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:35,343
...involved in this.

112
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,431
Thank you, Princess.

113
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,142
I’ll never...

114
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:45,645
...forget what you’ve done for us.

115
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,732
Is it just my help...

116
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,779
...that you won’t forget?

117
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,241
I...

118
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,911
...hope you’re not happy.

119
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,795
I hope you realize what you’ve lost,

120
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,921
and that just like me...

121
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,342
just like me...

122
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,638
...you will end up suffering too.

123
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,724
Princess...

124
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,726
Whatever happens, stay alive.

125
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,478
If...

126
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,731
...something happens to you,

127
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,942
then...

128
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,529
...I’ll never be able to forgive you again.

129
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,742
I hope we can...

130
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,245
...live our own lives,

131
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,834
in our own ways,

00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,047
carry out our own responsibilities,

133
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,052
and go our separate paths.

134
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,919
– Welcome! – Welcome!

135
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,754
– Please come this way. – Welcome!

136
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,803
Welcome!

137
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,763
– Welcome! – Over here, please!

138
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,851
– Please come this way. – Welcome!

139
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:44,115
– Welcome! – Over here!

140
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,201
I heard there were posters...

141
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,995
...put up all over the city looking for...

142
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,663
...the Union Leader
of Cheongwoon Trading.

143
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,543
You don’t look well, so...

144
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,337
...should I lead today’s meeting?

145
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,716
No.

146
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,053
No matter what happens,
I must fulfill my role.

147
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,137
Let’s go.

148
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,279
I’m sure...

149
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,783
...you’ve all heard the rumors
about the Crown Prince.

150
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,330
The situation is becoming critical.

151
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,499
The Crown Princess’ health...

152
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,542
...is deteriorating by the day.

153
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,295
Therefore,

154
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,131
we are gathering petitions...

155
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,760
...to save the former Crown Princess.

156
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,512
We hope that you too...

157
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,056
...will join us in this effort.

158
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,064
We’ve already...

159
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,443
...put our seals on it.

160
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,867
We ask you to be brave enough
to take this step too.

161
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,287
If signing feels too heavy,

162
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,331
even a fingerprint will do!

163
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:21,212
Isn’t the important thing
that many people support it?

164
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,298
We have to save her life first!

165
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,926
We understand that this...

166
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,636
...isn’t an easy choice.

167
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,014
If it weren’t for this incident,

168
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,724
I myself would probably never...

169
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,227
...have imagined doing something like this.

170
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,731
But aren’t we all...

171
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,942
...women who will someday become
matriarchs of noble households?

172
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,404
The ones to lead a household?

173
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,031
Today, it may be
the Crown Princess’ problem,

174
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,575
but in the end,

175
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,869
it reflects our lives too.

176
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,290
If a woman can’t bear a son,

177
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,293
even her place as the main wife
can be threatened.

178
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,378
If her husband takes a concubine,

179
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,838
she must accept it quietly.

180
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,384
Loyalty is seen as a virtue,

181
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,219
but that doesn’t mean...

182
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,222
...we must turn our backs
on those in distress.

183
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,765
...who are in trouble.

184
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,313
Ladies,

185
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,316
if our daughters
are doing their best to save her,

186
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,153
how can we, as mothers,
pretend we don’t see it?

187
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,490
Since we don’t need to give our names,

188
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,160
let’s give them our support!

189
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,455
But still,
I think we need to be cautious too.

190
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,750
After all, the Crown Princess
comes from Minister Il Jae’s family.

191
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,002
Won’t that cause trouble?

192
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,379
Regardless of our husbands’ politics,

193
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,342
weren’t we all once close, like sisters?

194
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,597
Does anyone here
befriend the Duchess?

195
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,016
Your friend’s daughter nearly lost her life,

196
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,560
and you’ll stay quiet
just because of your husband?

197
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:28,005
If His Majesty tells me
to return to the city, I won’t obey.

198
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,799
Once the sword is drawn,

199
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,593
whether we win or lose, we must use it.

200
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,721
Oh my, where did my little princess
learn such a saying?

201
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,182
Sit down!

202
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:48,109

203

...to save the Crown Princess
these past few days,

204
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,781
I’ve also done a lot of thinking.

205
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,868
All this time, I’ve only lived...

206
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:00,204
...focusing on my duty to serve
my family and the kingdom.

207
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,707
I was too busy caring
about how others saw me,

208
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,752

209
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,629
...how I truly feel.

210

211
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,021

may matter more...

212
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,898

365
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,186
keep this a secret from your father, okay?

366
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,396
Alright.

367
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,918
After giving birth to sons
and managing the household,

368
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,295
now you want to

369
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,340
cast off a loyal wife at this age?

370
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,718
Well, fine. At my age,
what do I have to be afraid of?

371
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,345
The kids are all on my side.

372
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,912
It looks like only my handprint is big.

373
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,247
That’s not true. It’s the
same size as mine.

374
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,625
I’ll stamp mine too.

375
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:13,004
Give it to me when you’re done.

376
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,047
Alright.

377
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:38,965
Prince Hwa Seong.

378
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,805
Brother Hwa Ing.

379
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,931
Yes.

380
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,768
Have you come to see Father?

381
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,398
At times like this, it’s best
to avoid him if you can.

382
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,568
The atmosphere inside the
palace is complete chaos.

383
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,404
Okay.

384
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,114
Good grief.

385
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,491
All my life,

386
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,992
I never imagined I'd
see the Crown Prince...

387
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,619
...sending secret messages to
the Crown Princess like this.

388
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,419
This is just between us, alright?

389
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,923
But let’s be honest — isn’t this
a disgrace to the royal family?

390
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,591
Family harmony is the
foundation of everything.

391
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,510
If he can’t manage his own household,

392
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,763
how can he be expected to inherit the
throne and lead the nation?

393
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:33,186
Brother Hwa Ing, that’s enough.

394
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,313
Things are already tense
enough as they are.

395
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,525
How could I, as his younger
brother, dare criticize His Highness?

396
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,193
I was just...

397
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:43,029
...worried. That’s why I said it.

398
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,156
People all over the country
are thinking the same thing.

399
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,117
There have been countless
people saying bad things...

400
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:51,704
...about him to His Majesty.

401
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:54,415
But he always protected you...

402
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:55,959
...and stood up for you.

403
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,047
Prince Hwa Ing.

404
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,300
No matter what happens,

405
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,927
never forget that we...

406
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,972
...are still brothers.

407
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:12,850
Wait...

408
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,324
To revoke the Crown Princess
title without reason,

409
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,744
and then marry her off to
Minister Il Jae’s son?

410
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,789
If we let this go,

411
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,708
our family's honor will be destroyed.

412
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,295
Now, the only way is...

413
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,297
...to do whatever it takes
to make Kim So Hoon...

414
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,840
...the new Crown Princess.

415
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,011
It’s time to stop this,

416
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,137
Father.

417
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,310
Do you really not see
that this whole incident

418
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,478
is His Majesty’s final warning?

419
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,899
From now on, I will...

420
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,986
...protect my children
with my own strength.

421
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,904
So please, Father,

422
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,239
don’t...

423
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,533
...do anything else.

424
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,412
- Sook Bin!
- Yes, that’s right.

425
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,623
I am Sook Bin.

426
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,791
So please mind your words, Minister Il Jae.

427
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,627
And from now on,

428
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,086
don’t come here again.

429
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:25,340
Have you forgotten who helped
you get to where you are?

430
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,592
I haven’t forgotten.

431
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:30,887
I’ve endured this far for the
family, for Father.

432
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,348
Isn’t that enough of a daughter’s duty?

433
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:35,933
Let go...

434
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,853
...of that greed.

435
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,663
Your Honor.

436
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,709
Kim So Hoon, from now on,

437
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,003
stop trying to read other people’s wishes.

438
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,172
Live according to your own heart.

439
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,012
They say a woman’s fate is
like a gourd floating on water,

440
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,057
but that doesn’t mean her happiness

441
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,435
must be decided by others.

442
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,726
My days with you are numbered now.

443
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,229
Yes, that’s true.

444
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,940
Everyone is leaving, one by one.

445
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,453
Are you alright?

446
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,588
How can I...

447
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,340
...ever atone for this sin?

448
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,636
It all started

449
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,641
because of the Chun Hwa's
Love Story I wrote.

450
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,814
I should have done nothing at all.

451
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:52,361
The dream I borrowed under
someone else's name...

452
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,031
...ended up becoming a sword

453
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,412
that wounded others.

454
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,247
Don’t say that.

455
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,542
At the very least,

456
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,337
the Crown Princess and I...

457
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,133
...were able to find a path to
a new world because of you.

458
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:18,554
Even the women who placed
their handprints on the petition—

459
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,432
they wouldn’t have dared

460
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,353
to take that step without you.

461
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:29,023
You really think so?

462
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,029
But still...

463
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,033
Do you know what hurts the most?

464
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,246
Even now, in all of this...

465
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,250
I still...

466
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,262
...can’t stop thinking about Choi Hwan.

467
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,144
Even knowing that he used me—
used the fact that I’m a princess,

468
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,897
to protect the people he was trying to help...

469
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,400
Is there something... worth watching?

470
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,902
Even though I know, deep down,

471
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:18,155
he may have approached me with that intention from the start,

472
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:20,658
what I fear most...

473
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,787
...isn’t losing him.

474
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,747
It’s knowing that...

475
00:44:28,249 --> 00:44:29,959
What if...

476
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,340
...the feelings he showed me all this time...

477
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,428
...were just a lie?

478
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,557
I believe his feelings were real too.

479
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:55,651
How he looked at you,

480
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:00,531
and how you felt when
you looked back at him,

481
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,159
you know better than anyone.

482
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,246

00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,833
I was looking for a painting album,

but all the bookstores were closed.

No, thankfully, I’m alright.

Would you like to stop by for a bit?

I have...

504
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:11,120
...some paintings the Princess made.

505
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,665
Since it’s hard to meet her in person right now,

506
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,753
I thought it’d be better if you
delivered them for me.

...whether she still paints or not.

513
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,964
Because for her,

514
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,134
painting was a way to dream.
