00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:16,506
Is Her Highness the Princess also unable to sleep?

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,343
Crown Princess.

5
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:32,241
Is there anything you are worried about?

6
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,037
Actually,

7
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:42,531
Kim Min Hong is being held captive
at Minister Il Jae's house.

8
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,705
Because the painting styles are similar,

9
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:49,620
Minister Il Jae and Hwa Ing thought...

10
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:54,157
...that it is Kim Min Hong
who wrote Chun Hwa's Love Story.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,054
Before Father learns of this,

12
00:00:59,214 --> 00:01:02,340
there is no other way
to solve this problem,

13
00:01:03,426 --> 00:01:05,843
besides publishing a new volume
of Chun Hwa's Love Story,

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,492
and showing that Lee Mong Heon
is in fact, someone else.

15
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:13,642
After knowing the influence of
Chun Hwa's Love Story in the World,

16
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,834
I can't act rashly.

17
00:01:19,134 --> 00:01:21,150
I don't know what story to write.

18
00:01:29,614 --> 00:01:31,121
Go away for a while.

19
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:32,914
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

20
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:44,292
If you have to write
The new Chun Hwa's Love Story,

21
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:46,524
will you this time,

22
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:49,818

23
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:54,803
Your Majesty, what do you mean by that?

24
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,539
Don't you know what kind of book that is?

25
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:00,328
Of course.

26
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:05,046
I submit this request
because I know very well about that book.

27
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:10,239
It is fiction,
thought it is rooted in reality.

28
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:15,635
It tells a tale of something impossible
becoming possible.

29
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:21,396
I don't understand what you're saying.

30
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:24,927
Why do you want
to do something like that?

31
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,448
The Crown Prince...

32
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:30,802
...has another partner.

33
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,539
At the moment,

34
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,672
I want to try
the remaining opportunities I have.

35
00:02:57,838 --> 00:02:59,937
Please write the story of His Majesty and mine,

36
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:02,723
in Chun Hwa's Love Story.

37
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,843
Goodness.

38
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:39,227
Geez.

39
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,349
How could that be?

40
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:43,236
Good grief.

41
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,646
How is it?

42
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:46,113
Exciting, isn't it?

43
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:47,537
You are really-

44
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,518
How can a princess
write a book like this?

45
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,224
What if someone finds out?

46
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,629
Nobody knows.

47
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,973
Aunt and Her Highness Crown Princess
are my first readers.

48
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,527
Gosh, this is ridiculous.

49
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:08,004
What has your little brain been doing all this time
thinking about things like this?

50
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:10,932
This king's palace is not like a king's palace.

51
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:12,913
There are many prohibitions,

52
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,957
and inside the palace it also felt crowded.

53
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:18,589
At least my imagination has to run wild
like this,

54
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,915
so that life feels enjoyable.

55
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:25,930
However, it should just be in your imagination.

56
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,537
Don't write a book like this.

57
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,244
Actually,

58
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:33,525
This book is a love letter.

59
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:35,344
Love letter?

60
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:36,437
What?

61
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,016
Brother Chae Jun is outside the palace,

62
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:43,275
and I can't just meet up
with him because I am inside the palace.

63
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:49,924
After writing about how I want
to live with him and about other things,

64
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:52,836
it ended up becoming this book.

65
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:55,906
Do you like him that much?

66
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,320
Yes, a lot.

67
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:01,541
I hope my curfew can be
quickly lifted so I can get out.

68
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,128
I hope someday,

69
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:10,522
that the contents of this book
become true.

70
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:30,030

enamored by women outside the palace,

[SHOP]

72
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:38,414
leaving the Crown Princess alone, left the
Palace every night to hug another woman.

73

76

If she sees me, I will cry.

77
00:05:53,143 --> 00:05:54,710
That's ridiculous.

78
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,810
When was the last time the Crown Princess
smiled at me?

79

What does life
mean to her?

82

Where will our love story lead?

83
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:20,636
which clearly starts from
a place of affection?

84
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:26,929
It turns out that your eyes no longer see me.

85

Poor Crown Princess.

91

The Crown Princess who couldn't stand
the humiliation ultimately resorted to suicide.

92

Oh, what a pity.

93
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:05,622
In the end, she died like this huh?

94
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:08,928
No, even so,
why did she commit suicide?

95
00:07:09,215 --> 00:07:12,335
Isn't it common for the Crown Prince
to have multiple partners?

96
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:14,329
Correct.

97
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:19,749
Actually, if she just waited a while,
The Crown Princess would become the Empress.

98
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:26,152
She could punish the mistress
after she became Empress.

99
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:30,056
If she punished the mistress,
how would the Crown Prince ever love her?

100
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:34,844
I also understand the
Crown Princess' feelings.

Everything had been destroyed.

Could it be possible that this time,
Chun Hwa's Love Story

105
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:50,972
is actually based on the real
Crown Prince and Princess?

- What?
- What?

107
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,430
At that time there was a rumor that the
third volume of Chun Hwa's Love Story,

108
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,845
was about Prince Hwa Ing, right?

109
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,849
it said that Lee Mong Heon, the author and the
storkeeper were arrested at the Government office.

110
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:06,147
Those were baseless rumors
and not a part of the actual story.

about His Majesty's personal life?

00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,232
Lee Mong Heon too,

180
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:11,035
is a name derived from the meaning of
"the pavilion that Hwa Ri dreams of".

181
00:14:13,824 --> 00:14:16,564
This place is the first place
where I started writing...

182
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,240
...Chun Hwa's Love Story.

183
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,219
Is that so?

184
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:28,345
I didn't know it would
become such a big problem.

185
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:31,126
The Beginning of Chun Hwa's Love Story,

186
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,741
is actually a love letter
written for my partner.

187
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:40,107
I hope he realizes...

188
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:43,890
...my strong desires.

189
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,973
The second love story of Chun Hwa is
a tribute to Aunt Hyo Jin who passed away.

190
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,146
The third Chun Hwa's Love Story,

191
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:58,664
is a warning for Brother Hwa Ing
who always commit crimes.

192
00:14:59,644 --> 00:15:01,644
The fourth love story of Chun Hwa,

193
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,341
is to prove that Teacher
Kim Min Hong is innocent.

194
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,139
And now, I will...

195
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,132
...write you a love letter,

196
00:15:26,728 --> 00:15:28,231
not by the name of Lee Mong Heon,

197
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:32,116
but with the name Hwa Ri.

198
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,959
I want to touch
the person I love...

199
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:42,836
...in the real world and
not in Chun Hwa's Love Story.

200
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:47,746
Would you,

201
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:51,040
be my husband?

202
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:58,358
Yes.

203
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,628
With pleasure.

204
00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:14,938
What are you doing?

205
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,835
I am painting a duck.

206
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,832
After thinking about it,

207
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:25,025
in every book you wrote,

208
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:27,528
there are paintings of ducks like this.

209
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:29,992
Is there a reason?

210
00:17:31,436 --> 00:17:33,448
The ducks in this palace,

211
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:36,453
very similar to me.

212
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:40,943
They don't fly even though they have wings.

213
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,140
They can't even think
to try to fly.

214
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:49,759
After everyone started calling
the "weird" idea "weird",

215
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:52,985
they were considered strange.

216
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:57,832
I feel like ducks are like me.
We can't do anything.

217
00:18:04,938 --> 00:18:06,225
This,

218
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,248
is Hwa Ri's first wing that
actually get out into the real world.

219
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,429
Even though everyone forbadeg her to fly,

220
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,228
Hwa Ri duck, who thought
that she couldn't fly,

221
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,226
thanks to you,

222
00:18:25,127 --> 00:18:26,460
could gather courage,

223
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,037
to fly
with all her might.

224
00:20:04,814 --> 00:20:06,923
Does the Crown Prince...

225
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:09,256
...really have another partner?

226
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,131
Yes.

227
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:18,529
How will you...

228
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:22,041
...solve this problem?

229
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:28,222
I will punish the Crown Prince.

230
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:12,123
Are the test preparations?
running smoothly?

231
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:14,445
Father.

232
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,327
I am...

233
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:35,980
I wonder if I should
call you "honest" or "stupid".

234
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:40,958
You have always done what I tell you to do
ever since childhood.

235
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,950
You were not a difficult child
like your talkative sister.

236
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:51,612
Was I really like that?

237
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:54,117
Yes.

238
00:21:56,918 --> 00:22:01,333
A child who kept doing something
well even if left alone,

239
00:22:01,926 --> 00:22:05,812
Thats's why your rare mistakes
shocked everyone around you.

240
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,443
Maybe because of that.

241
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:10,757
My memories of scolding you,

242
00:22:11,144 --> 00:22:13,143
are more vivid than my memories
of praising you.

243
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:15,723
No, Father.

244
00:22:15,931 --> 00:22:17,935
I was lacking,
so I deserved your shouting.

245
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,043
I didn't do that because
you were not good enough.

246
00:22:23,421 --> 00:22:25,748
It's because I always had
high expectation from you.

247
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:29,461
But I'm not like that to your brother.

248
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:33,095
It's true that I am
only firm with you.

249
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:36,115
Also because,

250
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:40,804
you will be the my successor
and the future king, right?

251
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,143
Yes.

252
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,990
There are books like this in the capital.

253
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:57,128
This time it contains your story.

254
00:22:58,414 --> 00:22:59,547
What?

255
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:01,118
What does that mean?

256
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,111
I was angry before seeing you today,

257
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,822
but it seems this anger was
not directed towards you.

258
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:11,648
I'm angry about the release of a book like this.

259
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:15,007
Forgive me, Father.

260
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:17,744
Son.

261
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:22,551
To ascend the throne,

262
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,828
don't give anyone
reasons to attack you.

263
00:23:28,313 --> 00:23:30,613
Prove it to everyone
as soon as possible...

264
00:23:31,234 --> 00:23:32,944
...that this book is not true.

265
00:23:52,729 --> 00:23:55,242
Oh my gosh, I'm speechless!

266
00:23:55,829 --> 00:23:57,313
The love story of the Crown Prince he said!

267
00:23:57,907 --> 00:24:00,623
What grudge does Lee Mong Heon
truly have towards the royal family,

268
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:03,342
always making this difficult
for us like this?

269
00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:05,848
But thanks to that,

270
00:24:05,941 --> 00:24:09,127
Prince Hwa Ing's problem
will be buried forever?

271
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:13,035
That is true!

272
00:24:17,746 --> 00:24:19,496
Moreover, in this erotic love story,

273
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:22,723
The Crown Prince had an affair with
an evil and vile woman of this country.

274
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:27,039
So the Crown Princess doesn't need to
worry about it at all.

275
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,019
In fact,

276
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:31,129
It will be The Crown Prince who will
be in a difficult position.

277
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:34,051
What is there to even worry about?

278
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,130
The Crown Prince of this country
is a good person.

279
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:37,604
To be honest,

280
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:40,323
is adding one or two
mistresses into the picture...

281
00:24:40,405 --> 00:24:41,735
...really such a disgrace?

282
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:44,346
Yes,

283
00:24:44,855 --> 00:24:47,050
she is just the wife of
a lowly official.

284
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:48,886
Anyway,
she is a woman...

285
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:50,742
...which doesn't even qualify
to be traded officially.

286
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,139
No matter how great the Crown Prince is,

287
00:24:53,316 --> 00:24:55,045
it means nothing, right?

288
00:24:55,777 --> 00:24:57,111
The lives of women are like that,

289
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,848
determined by affection,

290
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:00,635
from the King and Crown Prince.

291
00:25:01,215 --> 00:25:02,754
Is this about Your Majesty...

292
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,144
...won't there be problems in the future?

293
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,352
Are you okay?

294
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:40,842
Thank You.

295
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:46,145
This problem is a matter between
the Crown Prince and I, but...

296
00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:50,050
...this is the first time anyone has asked...

297
00:25:52,706 --> 00:25:54,344
...how I feel.

298
00:26:05,824 --> 00:26:06,830
Have you aready...

299
00:26:07,426 --> 00:26:09,416
...decided what you want to do?

300
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:15,175
Yes.

301
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:18,531
I know that this is
difficult request...

302
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:22,445
...but I want you to
help me this time.

303
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:26,242
Your Honour.

304
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:39,642
My mother?

305
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:51,630
Your Majesty the Empress.

306
00:26:52,222 --> 00:26:53,851
I heard that my mother in Sagae,

307
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:55,942
is in critical condition right now.

308
00:26:57,228 --> 00:26:59,821
Please allow me to leave,

309
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:01,250
and visit my mother.

310
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,831
Is the condition that bad?

311
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:05,357
Yes.

312
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,921
My brother has also died,

313
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:11,435
and I am the only child
of my mother left.

314
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:13,834
Please help me...

315
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:16,747
...leave to go see my mother...

316
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,336
...just this once.

317
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:24,518
Even though I have heard your explanation,

318
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:28,336
His Majesty the King
might not allow it.

319
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:29,250
Your Honour...

320
00:27:29,275 --> 00:27:30,452
Forgive me.

321
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:34,236
Even though I know how you feel,

322
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:38,239
there's nothing I can do
against the kingdom's regulations.

323
00:27:39,716 --> 00:27:41,233
I will ask the King

324
00:27:41,518 --> 00:27:44,229
to send
our best representative there.

325
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:46,345
So don't worry too much,

326
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,555
and just wait and see how things unfold.

327
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:50,631
Yes?

328
00:28:01,522 --> 00:28:03,917
Quickly turn to the drawing!

329
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:06,001
- I wonder what's in it!
- Oh my! Okay!

330
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:09,134
No, what is it actually?

331
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,432
What does it by the woman...

332
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:14,053
...was the one who
seduced the Crown Prince first?

333
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,453
Oh my gosh, I can't understand it.
because I can't read it!

334
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:20,588
Geez!

335
00:28:20,624 --> 00:28:22,092
Oh my gosh! Teacher!

336
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:22,815
Good grief!

337
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,213
- Teacher, come here!
- Come here, quick!

338
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,876
Come here,

339
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:29,102
and please read this book.

340
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:31,854
This book is said to be very popular!

341
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,943
But we are all illiterate...

342
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:35,451
We are so curious about it!

343
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:39,246
Chun Hwa's Love Story!

344
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,924
You read books
like this too?

345
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:43,175
I bought a copy with
great determination to give it...

346
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:45,152
...to my daughter-in-law
when she got married,

347
00:28:46,049 --> 00:28:47,849
but I'm also curious about the contents.

348
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:50,034
You know, right...

349
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:51,719
You must know!

350
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:52,845
Come on, hurry up! Hurry up!

351
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,994
Okay, I'll read it
for you.

352
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,231
Chun Hwa's Love Story,
The Crown Prince's Story.

353
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:03,049
Crown Prince Hui of the Eastern Kingdom,

354
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,829
is a man with a very
handsome appearance.

355
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:09,344
Crown Princess Si Young too,

356
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:12,042
is a beautiful girl
with a face as beautiful as jade,

357
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:14,185
and the two first met...

358
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:16,710
...on a winter day when
they were twelve years old.

359
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:26,198
Even though the whole
world was watching us...

360
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:28,746
...as people who were
brought together by contract,

361
00:29:29,107 --> 00:29:30,489
but since we were young,

362
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:33,654
we were destined together
and that began our love story.

363
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,125
On the day before the wedding,
when hadn't yet turned fifteen years old,

364
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:45,726
the boy and the girl fell in love
with each other for the first time.

365
00:29:46,596 --> 00:29:47,526
However,

366
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:51,605
the young couple who were
excited about their first night

367
00:29:52,143 --> 00:29:53,510
started experiencing

368
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,369
unavoidable problems as
they started spending

369
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:57,854
- ...nights together...
- Why? Why!

370
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,643
What was the problem?

371
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:01,447
Gosh are you always like this!

372
00:30:05,227 --> 00:30:07,262
According to the customs in
the Eastern Kingdom,

373
00:30:07,287 --> 00:30:09,528
when the Crown Prince and Princess
are about to have sex,

374
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,072
in order to protect their heir,

375
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:16,045
they can never express
emotions or raise their voice.

376
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:20,060
How many times did they have sex?
and how many times they didn't,

377
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:22,617
everything would be observed
carefully by the palace ladies.

378
00:30:22,676 --> 00:30:24,370
Oh my gosh, is that true?

379
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:25,311
Oh my, my goodness!

380
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:27,120
- Oh my God, how is that possible?
- That's right!

381
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,307
Come on, quickly read the next one!

382
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,930
- Come on, quickly!
- Right! Come on!

383
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,530
The moment that should have been...

384
00:30:32,721 --> 00:30:36,807
...beautiful to strengthen love,
starting to feel like a chore,

385
00:30:37,143 --> 00:30:38,321
very heavy...

386
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:42,538
...for the young couple.

387
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:51,543
What is it?

388
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,828
Are you fascinated by the picture?

389
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:55,688
Oh my gosh this woman!

390
00:30:55,712 --> 00:30:56,828
Good grief!

391
00:30:57,426 --> 00:30:58,792
You like it!

392
00:30:58,909 --> 00:30:59,948
No...

393
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:02,721
Oh my gosh, it's only half over
and it's already exciting!

394
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:11,138
A love affair without
any determined future

395
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:14,041
...sweater than any other night...

396
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:16,537
...soaked in pleasure,

397
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:21,342
...what a tragedy this is

398
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,632
Is he in there?

399
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,875
His Majesty is away
for the time being.

400
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:05,734
Then when can I meet him?

401
00:32:07,918 --> 00:32:09,050
That...

402
00:32:13,336 --> 00:32:14,452
Did he...

403
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:16,446
...go outside the palace?

404
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:17,438
You've arrived.

405
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:21,326
Have you seen it?

406
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,933
What is Your Majesty
talking about?

407
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,726
Is there anything I should
have to see?

408
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:36,856
No.

409
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:39,331
You do not need to know.

410
00:34:08,327 --> 00:34:10,046
Remember whn I asked you before?

411
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,544
About you living in the Palace?

412
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:21,659
Yes.

413
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:31,841
Life in the palace perhaps
might be difficult for you,

414
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:37,421
but I want you to be near me.

415
00:34:41,251 --> 00:34:43,324
Can't you reconsider my suggestion?

416
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,236
Yes.

417
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,628
I'll think about it.

418
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:11,727
Let's lean like this for a moment.
and rest.

419
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,525
Today too...

420
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:20,531
...was difficult, right?

421
00:36:08,218 --> 00:36:09,262
Do you...

422
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,933
...want to be my husband?

423
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:14,851
Yes.

424
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:17,648
With pleasure.

425
00:36:43,027 --> 00:36:44,141
Your Honour.

426
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:47,323
Princess Hwa Ri has arrived.

427
00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:51,913
Let her in.

428
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,048
Crown Princess!

429
00:36:58,613 --> 00:37:00,543
What brings you here
this early in the morning?

430
00:37:01,009 --> 00:37:03,421
Did something good happen to you?

431
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,036
It's been a long time since the last time
I saw your cheerful expression.

432
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:07,437
Does I look cheerful?

433
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:10,143
Actually,

434
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,709
there is something I first wanted to tell
Your Honor the Crown Princess.

435
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,653
What's that?

436
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:20,236
I have decided on
who will be my partner.

437
00:37:21,637 --> 00:37:24,046
He is the Leader of the Trade Union
Cheongwoon, Choi Hwan.

438
00:37:24,728 --> 00:37:26,856
Finally you've decided it seems.

439
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:28,640
Very good.

440
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:32,656
But,

441
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:35,536
is Your Majesty alright?
about Chun Hwa's Love Story?

442
00:37:38,546 --> 00:37:39,432
Yes.

443
00:37:41,241 --> 00:37:42,445
Won't you...

444
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:43,850
...regret it?

445
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,341
I asked for your help,

446
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:50,134
so that I don't regret it.

447
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:53,937
I want to decide for myself,

448
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,221
how useful I am.

449
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,820
So, have you decided?
what to do next?

450
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,431
Your Honour.

451
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:14,135
Her Highness the Duchess has come.

452
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:15,544
Let her in.

453
00:38:39,332 --> 00:38:41,834
I have summarized
some reasons for divorce...

454
00:38:42,345 --> 00:38:44,333
...Crown Princess.

455
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:46,442
You've worked hard.

456
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,829
Divorce you say?

457
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,531
What are you both talking
about right now?

458
00:38:56,516 --> 00:38:57,925
I have decided that...

459
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,826
...my use isn't occupying the
seat of the Crown Princess.

460
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:05,927
I wish to part with Your Majesty
the Crown Prince,

461
00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:08,726
and get out of here.

462
00:39:09,172 --> 00:39:10,817
What do you mean?

463
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:12,325
This doesn't make sense!

464
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:15,662
Didn't you ask me to
write you story

465
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,628
so that Brother can return to you?

466
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:20,630
I now...

467
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,313
...want to try the possibility
that is still left with me.

468
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,332
Please write the story of me and the Crown Prince,

469
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:29,142
as Chun Hwa's Love Story.

470
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:30,685
But why are you...

471
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:33,237
...talking about divorce!

472
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:37,051
The possibility I want to test is...

473
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:40,927
...can I really
leave the palace...

474
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,344
...and start a new life.

475
00:39:46,415 --> 00:39:48,036
Asking you to write...

476
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:50,920
...my story in Chun Hwa's Love Story,

477
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:53,628
is the first step I took.

478
00:39:54,534 --> 00:39:55,834
Had you already...

479
00:39:57,233 --> 00:39:59,449
...decided on leaving by that time?

480
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:04,030
I'm sorry I couldn't...

481
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:06,320
...tell you in advance.

482
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:11,338
I don't want to...

483
00:40:12,913 --> 00:40:14,662
...maintain a marriage that looks...

484
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:17,843
...just like a formality anymore.

485
00:40:29,725 --> 00:40:30,768
In that case,

486
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,424
let me tell you the reasons I have

487
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,642
...listed for divorce, Crown Princess.

488
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:53,050
Your Majesty, have committed...

489
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:56,245
...three sins out of the Seven Deadly Sins.

490
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:00,431
First.

491
00:41:01,935 --> 00:41:03,121
Even though the Crown Princess...

492
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,723
...should have given birth to a child
to continue the lineage,

493
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:09,049
she could not bear a son,

494
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:10,811
even after so many years passed...

495
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:17,137
...since the marriage.

496
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:19,463
Yes.

497
00:41:20,804 --> 00:41:21,833
Second,

498
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,230
The Crown Princess feels jealous
towards His Majesty's women.

499
00:41:28,847 --> 00:41:29,714
Yes.

500
00:41:33,847 --> 00:41:34,838
Third,

501
00:41:36,132 --> 00:41:39,634
by spreading the Chun Hwa's Love Story
among the people

502
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:41,941
she became the subject of gossip
and disturbed public morals.

503
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:44,091
Yes.

504
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,545
How could those be the
reasons for a divorce!

505
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,138
None of these events...

506
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,568
...were caused by the Crown Princess!

507
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,833
Among the women who were expelled
because of the Seven Deadly Sins,

508
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:55,739
how many truly sinned...

509
00:41:55,771 --> 00:41:58,225
...if we exclude adultery
and theft?

510
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:02,319
The Seven Deadly Sins...

511
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:05,349
...is grounds for divorce that is
recognized by the state,

512
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:12,021
so even the Crown Princess
cannot be an exception.

513
00:42:16,123 --> 00:42:17,947
After reviewing the Reasons
for the Prohibition of Divorce,

514
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:20,934
even though Your Honor has violated
The Seven Deadly Sins,

515
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:25,128
and wouldn't have a reason to be
allowed to stay married,

516
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:28,822
neither has Your Honor left to attend the
mourning period for your parents...

517
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:31,611
nor was this case such that
your family was poor

518
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:34,243
but became rich after marriage.

519
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,352
So, none of the

520
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:38,939
Reasons for the Prohibition of Divorce
are fulfilled in your situation.

521
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:41,437
Yes.

522
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:43,432
I understand.

523
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,035
Thank You...

524
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:49,652
...for your help.

525
00:43:26,716 --> 00:43:27,732
Gosh.

526
00:43:27,943 --> 00:43:28,929
Oh Goodness.

527
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:30,837
Goodness.

528
00:43:33,434 --> 00:43:35,279
If you had planned to
go to the palace,

529
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,837
you should have told me too.

530
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:39,029
Why did you go alone?

531
00:43:40,844 --> 00:43:42,552
The Crown Princess said,

532
00:43:43,118 --> 00:43:45,924
she wanted to say
something only to me.

533
00:43:46,013 --> 00:43:47,546
The Crown Princess?

534
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:49,477
What now?

535
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:51,736
What happened in the palace?

536
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,211
Actually the...

537
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:00,694
...Crown Princess,

538
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:05,536
wants a divorce...

539
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:07,458
...with His Highness the Crown Prince.

540
00:44:07,536 --> 00:44:08,555
What did you say?

541
00:44:11,224 --> 00:44:12,942
Divorce you say?

542
00:44:13,649 --> 00:44:16,348
This is absolutely ridiculous!

543
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:17,848
You feel the same way, right?

544
00:44:18,818 --> 00:44:19,818
So,

545
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,758
what did you say?

546
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:27,859
She asked me to help her get the divorce.
and leave the palace,

547
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:32,750
so I wrote a divorse will
based on the Seven Deadly Sins.

548
00:44:50,822 --> 00:44:53,127
Do you actually
have a brain or not?

549
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:55,748
Even if the Crown Princess
have such thoughts,

550
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,436
you should have stopped it!

551
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,222
How can you help her!

552
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:04,227
Do you really want the Crown Prince?
to divorce the Crown Princess?

553
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:06,438
I don't want that.

554
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:09,429
But it's the Crown Princess
who wants it!

555
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:11,734
How can life go on
purely based on wishes?

556
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:15,151
When you thought of
helping the Crown Princess,

557
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,909
didn't you think about
how it would affect me later?

558
00:45:17,974 --> 00:45:18,901
Husband...

559
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:20,834
His Highness the Crown Prince is
my big brother!

560
00:45:21,328 --> 00:45:23,937
My wife is trying to help
her brother-in-law get divorced!

561
00:45:26,028 --> 00:45:28,421
There is a limit to
underestimating someone!

562
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,633
Even though we sleep in one bed,

563
00:45:32,922 --> 00:45:35,556
I don't even know
what on my wife's mind.

564
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,480
Your Majesty the King!

565
00:45:59,542 --> 00:46:01,728
Lee Jae Sang is here.

566
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:12,338
Your Honour.

567
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:14,038
I came because you called for me.

568
00:46:14,737 --> 00:46:16,333
Come closer here.

569
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:29,829
I have a secret request from you.

570
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:33,437
What's that?

571
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:36,052
This is about Choi Hwan, the
owner of Cheongwoon Sangdan.

572
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:39,788
I have an appointment with him.

573
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,356
I can't interrogate
more about Lee Mong Heon,

574
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:44,343
the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

575
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,228
It is impossible that the publisher
doesn't know the author.

576
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:52,538
So, try to find out
Choi Hwan's background.

577
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:55,644
Who exactly is Lee Mong Heon?

578
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:59,319
What do want to achieve
by publishing such books?

579
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:04,148
Even though Choi Hwan comes
from a family of meritorious officials,

580
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:06,048
he is not interested in the government.

581
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:10,242
Your Majesty has also
considered him as a son-in-law,

582
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,420
If Lee Mong Heon and Choi Hwan
have the same intention...

583
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:16,054
...regarding Chun Hwa's Love Story,

584
00:47:16,826 --> 00:47:19,048
it changes everything.

585
00:47:20,828 --> 00:47:21,843
Yes, Father.

586
00:47:22,644 --> 00:47:24,339
This is the King's secret order.

587
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,334
Start investigating now
all about Choi Hwan.

588
00:47:27,634 --> 00:47:29,749
Find out who Lee Mong Heon is.

589
00:47:32,211 --> 00:47:33,335
Yes Father.

590
00:47:54,516 --> 00:47:56,228
Prince Hwa Ing and Minister Lee Jae Sang,

591
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:59,084
thought that Kim Min Hong
is Lee Mong Heon,

592
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,135
the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

593
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:03,649
However,

594
00:48:04,521 --> 00:48:06,225
he is not Lee Mong Heon.

595
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:08,331
I am sure of it.

596
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:36,445
Why did you want to meet me?

597
00:48:45,026 --> 00:48:47,631
His Majesty the King is curious
about who is Lee Mong Heon.

598
00:48:50,207 --> 00:48:51,347
I'm only,

599
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:56,923
responsible for
publishing Chun Hwa's Love Story.

600
00:48:57,827 --> 00:49:00,552
I don't know who Lee Mong Heon is.

601
00:49:02,832 --> 00:49:03,934
Is that so?

602
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:08,622
I think that Lee Mong Heon is...

603
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:11,632
...Princess Hwa Ri.

604
00:49:13,738 --> 00:49:15,737
What do you think?

605
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,038
Who knows.

606
00:49:21,037 --> 00:49:22,535
I never thought about that.

607
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:26,030
Whoever Lee Mong Heon is,

608
00:49:26,535 --> 00:49:27,729
after the fourth edition,

609
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:31,735
there will be no more of
Chun Hwa's Love Story.

610
00:49:34,316 --> 00:49:35,823
Isn't this...

611
00:49:36,718 --> 00:49:38,717
...good news for everyone?

612
00:49:48,913 --> 00:49:50,849
Lastly, I will ask you one
more thing.

613
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:55,146
Why did you publish and distribute...

614
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:58,322
...Chun Hwa's Love Story?

615
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:01,934
You must know the impact
wouldn't be small.

616
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,060
In the starting,

617
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:09,331
I didn't distribute the book...

618
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:12,243
...with a certain intention.

619
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:16,546
It was just a matter of money.

620
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:19,734
It was just a business deal.

621
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:23,227
But now,

622
00:50:24,441 --> 00:50:26,752
I think the world needs that story.

623
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:18,745
Why did you publish and distribute...

624
00:51:19,616 --> 00:51:21,936
...Chun Hwa's Love Story?

625
00:51:35,229 --> 00:51:36,436
Have you arrived?

626
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:38,381
Yes.

627
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:42,019
This is enough.

628
00:51:44,856 --> 00:51:46,237
I think it's better that we

629
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:49,332
stop printing Chun Hwa's Love Story.

630
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:52,136
Okay.

631
00:51:52,451 --> 00:51:53,731
I understand.

632
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,044
It seems that His Majesty the King,

633
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,521
is investigating me about
Chun Hwa's Love Story.

634
00:52:04,742 --> 00:52:06,027
Is that true?

635
00:52:07,235 --> 00:52:08,250
Yes.

636
00:52:09,123 --> 00:52:11,307
Lee Jong Won came to see me,

637
00:52:11,752 --> 00:52:13,445
and asked about Lee Mong Heon.

638
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:16,750
Exactly as I feared.

639
00:52:17,711 --> 00:52:20,662
I've been worried because the fourth volume
of Chun Hwa's Love Story...

640
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:23,231
...was about the Crown Prince.

641
00:52:25,532 --> 00:52:28,301
Was there no other story that
could have been written instead?

642
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:32,550
I heard it was a direct request
from Her Highness the Crown Princess.

643
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:37,866
Why would she ask for such a thing?

644
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:41,534
I don't know the exact reason.

645
00:52:45,221 --> 00:52:48,614
Even if you don't know it,

646
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,534
but your actions answer everything.

647
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:55,348
Therefore,

648
00:52:56,136 --> 00:52:58,414
you could get in danger.

649
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,932
I know.

650
00:53:04,536 --> 00:53:06,620
Thank you for caring about me.

651
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,733
You too.

652
00:53:09,646 --> 00:53:11,739
Please take care of yourself.

653
00:53:14,314 --> 00:53:15,457
Okay.

654
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,238
What are you thinking?

655
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:01,744
I think,

656
00:54:03,315 --> 00:54:06,227
The Crown Prince is like the sun.

657
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:13,331
He must enlighten the whole world.

658
00:54:15,122 --> 00:54:16,830
Like the sun,

659
00:54:17,149 --> 00:54:20,129
bright and shiny.

660
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:23,728
Ordinary people like me,

661
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:27,929
won't be able to withstand the heat.

662
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:31,648
Didn't you say
this would be difficult?

663
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:34,761
Better to have not
started at all.

664
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:38,363
However,

665
00:54:39,434 --> 00:54:41,325
do you regret it now?

666
00:54:46,335 --> 00:54:48,034
I have no regrets.

667
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:52,327
Just being by his side,

668
00:54:53,254 --> 00:54:55,728
make my life shine like this.

669
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,257
Where else can I
see light like this?

670
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:05,047
Teacher too,

671
00:55:06,213 --> 00:55:09,337
you'vr seen Chun Hwa's Love Story
volume four, right?

672
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:11,747
Yes.

673
00:55:13,924 --> 00:55:15,724
What my hope to be...

674
00:55:17,531 --> 00:55:21,413
...a safe haven for the Crown Prince
without ever entering the Palace...

675
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,748
...a naive fantasy?

676
00:55:27,338 --> 00:55:28,353
I...

677
00:55:29,446 --> 00:55:33,445
...just felt sorry for
The frustrated Crown Prince...

678
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:36,620
...who was fed up with palace life.

679
00:55:38,442 --> 00:55:41,745
I never thought about how
it would have felt...

680
00:55:43,738 --> 00:55:45,831
...for the woman beside him.

681
00:55:48,328 --> 00:55:49,343
However,

682
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:54,725
Isn't it wrong that...

683
00:55:57,035 --> 00:55:59,335
...my happiness comes from...

684
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:02,847
...the misfortune of the
other woman?

685
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,435
So,

686
00:56:05,014 --> 00:56:07,009
What will you do now?

687
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:11,801
I don't know.

688
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:16,219
Even at a time like this,

689
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:21,035
is it appropriate to
want the Crown Prince?

690
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:24,449
Even I

691
00:56:27,229 --> 00:56:29,242
don't know what I want.

692
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:31,641
However,

693
00:56:36,831 --> 00:56:39,619
if I just look at
the SUn like this,

694
00:56:42,046 --> 00:56:43,240
it feels like,

695
00:56:45,548 --> 00:56:47,928
I'll be blinded.

696
00:56:58,596 --> 00:57:02,942
[HALL]

697
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:12,038
Your Honour.

698
00:57:14,712 --> 00:57:15,816
What happened?

699
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:18,339
What brings you here?

700
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:38,339
There is something I wanted to say.

701
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:49,552
Hee Ryeon is leaving the capital.

702
00:57:50,427 --> 00:57:52,125
So she left this letter for you.

703
00:57:58,006 --> 00:58:00,719
Leaving the capital?

704
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,028
What do you mean?

705
00:58:27,064 --> 00:58:29,737
[WHEN YOUR HONOR SEES THIS LETTER...]

706
00:58:49,228 --> 00:58:50,552
When Your Honor...

707
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:53,139
...sees this letter,

708
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:54,935
I'm sure...

709
00:58:55,817 --> 00:58:58,017
...I'd have left this land.

710
00:59:00,132 --> 00:59:01,949
I don't have the courage...

711
00:59:02,028 --> 00:59:04,720
...to meet you and
say goodbye.

712
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:07,634
I wrote this instead.

713
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:09,532
I apologize.

714
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:16,327
All the moments with you,

715
00:59:16,827 --> 00:59:20,733
for me,they really felt
like a dream.

716
00:59:22,623 --> 00:59:24,150
Just like a dream,

717
00:59:24,854 --> 00:59:28,327
I have to wake up sometime.

718
00:59:33,411 --> 00:59:34,445
Your Honour.

719
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,539
Please take care of yourself.

720
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:23,346
Just wait.

721
01:00:25,335 --> 01:00:27,743
A great person like you,

722
01:00:28,844 --> 01:00:31,828
sometimes it just takes
something to look forward to.

723
01:00:37,733 --> 01:00:38,924
I do not want,

724
01:00:40,339 --> 01:00:42,619
be shaken again.

725
01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:45,329
So,

726
01:00:47,143 --> 01:00:49,428
don't come here again.

727
01:00:52,943 --> 01:00:54,746
I miss you when we don't meet.

728
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:57,756
I am happy when we do meet.

729
01:00:59,245 --> 01:01:02,050
What if I leave the palace?
and meet you?

730
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:05,637
That's all I think about.

731
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,057
Everything will be fine.

732
01:01:17,413 --> 01:01:20,727
Everything will pass.

733
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:43,345
Princess.

734
01:02:45,842 --> 01:02:47,137
Your Highness the Crown Princess.

735
01:02:50,036 --> 01:02:52,439
This should be
a happy moment,

736
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:56,234
but I had to disturb you,
I apologize for that.

737
01:02:57,318 --> 01:02:58,520
No problem.

738
01:03:02,438 --> 01:03:03,640
Do you,

739
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:07,242
really want to separate from the Crown Prince?

740
01:03:10,747 --> 01:03:11,762
Yes.

741
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:15,235
Why so?

742
01:03:16,428 --> 01:03:20,242
Don't you love him?

743
01:03:23,037 --> 01:03:24,546
There are times like that.

744
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:28,344
But not anymore.

745
01:03:31,034 --> 01:03:32,341
I do not want,

746
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:35,531
to live as the Crown Princess anymore.

747
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:40,627
Inside the palace,

748
01:03:41,436 --> 01:03:43,826
I never felt
happy at all.

749
01:03:46,416 --> 01:03:47,647
Now,

750
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,329
I'm not happy.

751
01:04:02,929 --> 01:04:04,949
Don't look at me like that.

752
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:08,650
Please hug me.

753
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:11,442
Actually this,

754
01:04:13,932 --> 01:04:15,539
it's also difficult for me.

755
01:04:20,143 --> 01:04:23,050
I also want to be happy again like you.

756
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:29,533
Your courage made me
and Princess Hyo Jin is very jealous.

757
01:04:31,016 --> 01:04:33,431
I will try to replicate that.

758
01:04:35,932 --> 01:04:38,739
So, don't see me with sadness.

759
01:04:40,036 --> 01:04:41,845
Can you support me,

760
01:04:44,032 --> 01:04:46,237
on this new path of mine?

761
01:05:54,841 --> 01:05:56,940
Her Highness the Crown Princess has arrived.

762
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:09,306
Your Honour.

763
01:06:10,827 --> 01:06:13,331
I have a request for you.

764
01:06:13,929 --> 01:06:15,737
What is it?

765
01:06:17,826 --> 01:06:20,041
Please end my marriage...

766
01:06:21,713 --> 01:06:23,034
...with the Crown Prince.

767
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:27,024
What?

768
01:06:29,643 --> 01:06:30,743
Now,

769
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:33,916
I want to resign...

770
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,631
...as Crown Princess.
