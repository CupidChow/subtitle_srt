I have nothing to say
about the storyline itself

relationship between the man and woman...

186
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:51,099

When my siblings were little,

No, it is not that.

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:38,143
Don't Father and Brother
also often disguise themselves and leave the palace?

358
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,047
But you are a woman!

359
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,627
That's why I wore
Menswear!

360
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:43,831
Good grief.

361
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Geez!

362
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:49,867
The Prince and Princess must restrain themselves,

363
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,501
and I forbid you to leave the palace
for the time being!

364
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:53,399
- There!
- You may go.

365
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,374
[THE KING'S RESIDENCE]

366
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,610
What happened?

367
00:22:08,253 --> 00:22:09,533
Were you scolded badly?

368
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:11,191
No.

369
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,021
It seems they were already too fed up
to see us,

370
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,661
so we were immediately told to leave.

371
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:17,685
You never run out of ways
to make trouble,

372
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,486
Princess Hwa Ri.

373
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,440
It's not her who's in trouble this time,

374
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,053
It is my fault!

375
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:29,920
Miss Ji Won who is already difficult to approach,

376
00:22:30,353 --> 00:22:32,120
now won't even want to see me anymore!

377
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:36,824
Why make a fuss...

378
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:39,130
...and go to the Courtesan house
to lose your virginity?

379
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,901
If it worked, I could still understand,

380
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:43,981
- but it never even got started.
- You!

381
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Here!

382
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,841
Aren't you embarrassed to say that?

383
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,420
What's so embarrassing about that?

384
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:49,687
Everyone does it.

385
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,388
If not for that,
we would not have been born into this world.

386
00:22:54,335 --> 00:22:55,198
Good grief!

387
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:58,381
I'm really worried about who
who would possibly be your future husband.

388
00:22:59,589 --> 00:23:00,856
Don't worry.

389
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:02,769
I already have a plan!

390
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:07,896
By the way, how long?
will we be banned from going out?

391
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:12,053
I heard uncle and brother Chae Jun
brought me a gift from Yanjing.

392
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:15,205
Geez.

393
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,244
Forgive me.

394
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:22,835
This is all because I was not wise enough.

395
00:23:26,001 --> 00:23:27,463
Don't say that.

396
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,676
Those born in the royal family,

397
00:23:30,014 --> 00:23:31,947
Must bear the responsibility
in the end.

398
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:35,150
I am the one who wanted
to give them all the the freedom,

399
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,759
at least before they got married.

400
00:23:40,131 --> 00:23:41,250
By the way,

401
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:44,209
the ministers will definitely
throw endless criticism.

402
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:03,647
Crown Prince.

403
00:24:07,861 --> 00:24:09,367
Would you like some tea before you go?

404
00:24:10,428 --> 00:24:11,540
No, it's not that.

405
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:15,275
The royal wedding ceremony
is coming soon.

406
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:17,265
Oh.

407
00:24:22,482 --> 00:24:23,731
Don't worry.

408
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:25,946
I won't forget it.

409
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:28,630
Good.

410
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:48,349
She didn't even smile when she looked at me.

411
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:51,128
What?

412
00:24:53,847 --> 00:24:54,692
Nothing.

413
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,663
Just talking to myself.

414
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:07,721
The siblings were caught red-handed
together at the Courtesan house.

415
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,472
The empress's dignity was completely tarnished.

416
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:13,576
Plus, I heard Princess Hwa Ri,

417
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:17,447
was wearing men's clothing and
peeking at her brother in the private room.

418
00:25:17,946 --> 00:25:20,914
This has really gone beyond the limit.
It's a shame for the royal family.

419
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,936
The Princess's impudent behavior
is truly endless.

420
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,741
His Majesty The King too,

421
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:29,608
will no longer remain silent on
this issue about The Princess and the Grand Prince.

422
00:25:32,357 --> 00:25:35,829
Then, what about the wedding plans?
between Miss Ji Won and the Grand Prince?

423
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:39,289
Is Miss Ji Won, famous
as a woman of noble character,

424
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:41,022
still going to get married to the Prince,

425
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:42,902
after enduring such shame?

426
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:44,279
Such a ridiculous thing to ask.

427
00:25:45,205 --> 00:25:48,309
What does a royal family wedding
have to do with a woman's feelings?

428
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:51,496
In addition, Mr. Hwa Ing,

429
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:54,410
it's better for the time being to
avoid the Courtesan house for now.

430
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,828
Always remember that there are
many eyes on us.

431
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:59,061
Uh...
Okay.

432
00:25:59,626 --> 00:26:01,763
Anyway, this is
good opportunity for us.

433
00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:04,354
Tomorrow, there will be so many things,

434
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:07,453
that we can report
to His Majesty The King.

435
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,317
His Majesty The King has arrived.

436
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:24,721
Your Majesty, please
let me submit a report...

437
00:26:24,746 --> 00:26:25,613
Wait.

438
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,124
There is something I want
I asked first.

439
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:31,339
I heard that Prince Hwa Seong and
Princess Hwa Ri,

440
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:33,836
created a commotion
in the capital yesterday, right?

441
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:35,423
So,

442
00:26:35,587 --> 00:26:38,594
I intend to discipline
them in a major way,

443
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,586
and immediately arrange their wedding.

444
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,915
What do you think about this?

445
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:45,170
Lee Jae Sang?

446
00:26:47,578 --> 00:26:49,548
I agree with Your Majesty's decision.

447
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:50,475
Okay.

448
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,013
If so, please decide on an appropriate date
for the wedding immediately.

449
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:56,843
between Prince Hwa Seong
and Lee Jae Sang's daughter, Ji Won.

450
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,680
Arrange Princess Hwa Ri's wedding

451
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:00,780
with her future husband...

452
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:02,715
...immediately.

453
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:07,988
Everyone!

454
00:27:08,635 --> 00:27:10,455
I'm getting married!

455
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:41,797
I came to offer
gifts and deliveries,

456
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:44,003
which is given specifically
by Father.

457
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,651
If it's still not enough,

458
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:47,322
I will make up for it during our life together.

459
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:48,738
What do you mean less?

460
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,635
This is more than enough.

461
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:55,854
By the way, where is Miss Ji Won?

462
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,177
Looks like she's still angry
since the incident few days ago.

463
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:01,041
She hasn't come out of her room.

464
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:04,243
Oh, is that so?

465
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,758
Is she still very angry?

466
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:10,708
Miss.

467
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:14,334
Prince Yeol brought
a lot of gifts

468
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:16,666
won't Miss like see them?

469
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:17,731
I am not interested.

470
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:20,530
Goodness.

471
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:24,500
Why did His Highness The Grand Prince
foolishly go to a place like that...

472
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:27,465
Ji Won, His Highness The Grand Prince has arrived.

473
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:32,997
Ji Won, I was definitely in the wrong.

474
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,825
Even though you were cold towards me that day,

475
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,323
I shouldn't have gone there
in such a rush with anger.

476
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:41,247
Even though I went there, I didn't
do anything.

477
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:42,850
Trust me, it's true.

478
00:28:43,524 --> 00:28:45,224
He said he didn't do anything,

479
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:46,961
So, please forgive him.

480
00:28:52,427 --> 00:28:55,620
His Highness The Grand Prince came
all the way to apologize to you directly.

481
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,941
Are you sure you
don't want to see him?

482
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:15,801
[sighs]

483
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,830
This is my fault.

484
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,030
Don't be angry anymore.

485
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:33,901
What exactly did you do wrong?

486
00:29:35,082 --> 00:29:36,669
I went to the Courtesan house?

487
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,466
Or is it that I spread gossip
about our my love for you?

488
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,176
Did Your Majesty apologize
without knowing your mistake?

489
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,788
Does Your Majesty truly feel guilty?

490
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,315
Whatever it is, it's my fault.

491
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:56,979
You know how much I love you.

492
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,373
Of course.

493
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,722
The fact that His Majesty loves me,

494
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,768
It's not just me who knows,
all the people of this country know.

495
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:07,316
Everyone knows that
His Majesty wants to marry me.

496
00:30:08,783 --> 00:30:09,904
But,

497
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:15,417
has your majesty ever
asked me directly?

498
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:22,847
Has Your Majesty ever proposed to me directly?

499
00:30:22,872 --> 00:30:25,220
The woman that His Majesty supposedly loves so much?

500
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:30,327
But our relationship has been such that
we have been engaged from the beginning.

501
00:30:31,817 --> 00:30:33,903
And I have also received permission
from Mr. Lee Jae Sang.

502
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:36,972
But I am the one getting married to you.

503
00:30:39,742 --> 00:30:41,429
Why doesn't Your Majesty ask me?

504
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:49,072
Why doesn't anyone ask
about how I feel?

505
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:52,197
That is what is strange,

506
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:54,084
and it makes me angry.

507
00:30:57,442 --> 00:30:59,462
Am I just a complementary part
of this marriage?

508
00:30:59,948 --> 00:31:01,242
No, it is not like that!

509
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:04,820
That's not what I meant.

510
00:31:08,837 --> 00:31:10,083
Do you hate me?

511
00:31:15,648 --> 00:31:16,741
Enough, just go home.

512
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:19,935
I do not want...

513
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:25,337
...a marriage like this.

514
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:30,250
Ji-Won.

515
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:55,144
Today, it would be best if Your Majesty
returns home for now.

516
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:58,672
It seems like our girl was really offended.

517
00:31:59,643 --> 00:32:01,742
I will explain
well so that she understands.

518
00:32:03,717 --> 00:32:05,230
Isn't that a sign that she hates me?

519
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:10,544
The fact that she asked why
her permission was not taken-

520
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:13,827
Isn't that a bad sign?

521
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:25,072
I'm sorry, Ji Won.

522
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:27,174
I was totally wrong.

523
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:29,067
His Highness The Grand Prince,
polease do not do this.

524
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:31,391
Your Majesty shouldn't have
to do this, please get up.

525
00:32:31,864 --> 00:32:34,028
- What is happening?,
- Miss, what should we do?

526
00:32:34,293 --> 00:32:36,368
His Highness The Grand Prince
has knelt down.

527
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:39,536
My heart is too lost in feelings of love,

528
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:41,675
to not think about your feelings.

529
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:44,623
Please forgive me.

530
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:49,832
Even if I get married a hundred times,
if it's not you, what's the point?

531
00:32:50,923 --> 00:32:52,184
For me, there is only you.

532
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:54,968
If it's not you, then there is nothing.

533
00:32:56,915 --> 00:32:57,736
So,

534
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,806
give me one more chance.

535
00:33:15,873 --> 00:33:18,330
Okay, what do you want to say?

536
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:22,656
I heard Father ordered
to find a husband for me.

537
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:27,531
Yes. In the near future,
we will find a partner,

538
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:29,432
that suits you and
hold a wedding.

539
00:33:29,948 --> 00:33:31,768
I believe that is not needed.

540
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:34,347
That's what I want to say
to Father and Mother.

541
00:33:35,984 --> 00:33:37,262
What do you mean?

542
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:39,455
I...

543
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:42,437
...have someone in mind
already.

544
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:52,627
Park Chae Jun, one of the delegated
envoys to Yeongyeong.

545
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,153
Park Chae Jun?

546
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:58,228
You mean Chae Jun, your uncle's adopted son?

547
00:33:59,023 --> 00:34:01,047
- Correct.
- What is this?

548
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,918
Even though you are my beloved daughter
there is still a limit.

549
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:06,073
How dare you play around like this?

550
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:07,639
Father.

551
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:09,765
I'm not playing around.

552
00:34:10,558 --> 00:34:12,866
Isn't Chae Jun my uncle's adopted son?

553
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,453
Well then, just decide...

554
00:34:14,895 --> 00:34:15,948
Be quiet!

555
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:20,138
What are you guys doing?
Throw out this impudent person immediately!

556
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,237
His Majesty The King,

557
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,398
I am ready to accept the punishment.

558
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:43,342
It was my fault for not being able to
understand our daughter's feelings early on.

559
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:56,385
Please do not leave this room
until there is an order from His Majesty The King.

560
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:08,117
How is The Princess?

561
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,057
[PARK FAMILY RESORT]
His Majesty The King was furious,

562
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:13,433
so he ordered The Princess
to remain inside her room.

563
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,233
Don't worry.

564
00:35:28,712 --> 00:35:30,933
Things that make
Her Majesty The Empress worry,

565
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:32,650
will never happen.

566
00:35:35,021 --> 00:35:36,428
I already have a fiancé.

567
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,806
If so, I will convey
the same.

568
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,029
Her Majesty has arrived.

569
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:28,812
For the time being,

570
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,318
you should also restrain yourself
from leaving the palace.

571
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,850
I heard Princess Hwa Ri is
back to making a scene.

572
00:36:35,145 --> 00:36:35,956
What?

573
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,820
What did she do this time?

574
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,300
She defied His Majesty The King's orders,

575
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:45,379
and insisted on getting married
with the person she calls cousin.

576
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,540
Goodness.

577
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,205
Gosh, she's really gutsy.

578
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:50,025
What a shame.

579
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:52,994
Even the common people avoid
marriage between close relatives.

580
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:54,658
How could she, a Princess,

581
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:56,777
dare to ask permission
to marry her cousin?

582
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:58,226
So true.

583
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:01,279
She acts like she is the
smartest person in the world,

584
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:03,738
but acts stupid when it
comes to things like this?

585
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,719
The Princess must learn that
not everything in the world works,

586
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:07,932
according to her wishes.

587
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,343
You too, don't be tempted
by useless empty wind.

588
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:13,823
Behave,

589
00:37:14,027 --> 00:37:15,640
with care and honor.

590
00:37:16,328 --> 00:37:17,397
Yes, mother.

591
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,099
Don't worry about me.

592
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,713
Her Majesty The Empress enters.

593
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:41,378
Is your heart at peace?

594
00:37:43,098 --> 00:37:44,551
No, it is not.

595
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:47,619
The more I think about it,

596
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,099
I am increasingly convinced that
Brother Chae Jun is the only one for me.

597
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:57,954
Head Lady Park,

598
00:37:59,034 --> 00:38:00,740
just came back from your uncle's house.

599
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,110
As I thought, Mother is
on my side, right?

600
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:12,472
Mother will persuade Father
for me, right?

601
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:20,018
I heard Chae Jun,

602
00:38:22,187 --> 00:38:23,751
already has a fiancé.

603
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:26,332
They will get married soon.

604
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:33,606
That's not possible.

605
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:37,712
That can't be possible.

606
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:40,362
Chae Jun said,

607
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,652
he wants to marry me.

608
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,041
He never once went
against my words.

609
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:51,473
There is not a single person in this country,

610
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,531
who dares to oppose the
words of a princess.

611
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:55,323
Chae Jun is no ordinary person!

612
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:56,880
He is my lover!

613
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:58,756
For you he is a lover.

614
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:01,968
But, for Chae Jun you are
a princess he couldn't refuse.

615
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:03,524
Know that and forget about him.

616
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,841
That can't be!

617
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,433
That's not possible!

618
00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:11,850
Who would misunderstand
that loving gaze?

619
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:14,285
Am I that stupid?

620
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:22,944
Your mother must have ordered it, right?

621
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:28,541
Ordered him to leave me
and marry someone else, right?

622
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:30,592
If it weren't for that
How could it be,

623
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,553
that Chae Jun chose to reject me!

624
00:39:34,364 --> 00:39:37,523
It's all because of Mom!
Because of Mother!

625
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,398
Chae Jun would never
treat me like this.

626
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:41,635
Get yourself together!

627
00:39:43,592 --> 00:39:45,863
Now even you continue to
belittle Chae Jun

628
00:39:45,897 --> 00:39:47,137
down to the bones.

629
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:50,733
How can you blame
others for the absence of love!

630
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,930
If you were not a Princess,

631
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:58,023
Would Chae Jun have stayed?
Would he have said to you?

632
00:40:33,217 --> 00:40:34,838
His Highness The Grand Prince...

633
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:37,492
...is still kneeling in front of Ji Won's room
and begging for forgiveness.

634
00:40:39,058 --> 00:40:42,051
Go and tell him to stop.

635
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:44,657
It's been four hours.

636
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:46,674
And,

637
00:40:47,416 --> 00:40:49,129
If His Majesty The King gets to know,

638
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:51,345
that His Highness The Grand Prince is
left kneeling like this...

639
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,250
In the palace, he is indeed
His Highness The Grand Prince,

640
00:40:53,455 --> 00:40:55,135
but in my house,
he is the future son-in-law.

641
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:58,053
I am entrusting my daughter's
future with him.

642
00:40:59,317 --> 00:41:00,889
Let him be punished a little longer.

643
00:41:02,322 --> 00:41:04,255
If we show authority and strength
in the beginning,

644
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:06,318
Ji Won will be more
comfortable in the future.

645
00:41:07,404 --> 00:41:08,538
That's true too.

646
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:11,164
Let's wait another two hours.

647
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:31,051
Hey.

648
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:34,554
I'll just talk for
a moment with her.

649
00:41:50,529 --> 00:41:51,690
Look at yourself now.

650
00:41:52,336 --> 00:41:54,576
You used to act up
as if you could do anything.

651
00:41:57,296 --> 00:41:58,715
Have you come here to
stir up my emotions?

652
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:02,087
No.

653
00:42:02,942 --> 00:42:05,635
I came to entertain.
Do you feel like I'm instigating you?

654
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,064
It seems like you are really good at
misunderstanding other's intentions.

655
00:42:12,578 --> 00:42:15,563
I heard you misunderstood
with Chae Jun's feelings too.

656
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:21,745
Get out of here right now.

657
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:24,863
Do you like him that much?

658
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,229
Can't you tell?

659
00:42:28,538 --> 00:42:30,755
I did all this
because i love him!

660
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:33,543
How can you be so sure of him?

661
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,754
What makes you smile like that?

662
00:42:39,518 --> 00:42:41,308
Am I that beautiful?

663
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:44,360
Of course.

664
00:42:45,216 --> 00:42:46,943
You are the most valuable,

665
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:48,833
and the most beautiful in this world.

666
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:57,625
That feeling can't lie.

667
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:03,106
He was just forced by circumstances
and tried to avoid his feelings.

668
00:43:09,526 --> 00:43:10,821
This problem has gotten bigger.

669
00:43:12,272 --> 00:43:14,931
He might marry someone,
even though there really isn't one.

670
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:19,583
That can't happen!

671
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:21,759
I won't let it happen!

672
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:25,349
I must meet Chae Jun.

673
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,062
Help me.

674
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,439
I can't let it
ends like this, right?

675
00:43:38,788 --> 00:43:40,345
Hwa Jin.

676
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:45,189
Are you ready to bear the consequences?

677
00:44:20,384 --> 00:44:21,964
It looks like the palace gates
will be closed.

678
00:44:24,626 --> 00:44:27,723
Seeing Ji Won's character,
The Prince will be left outside all night.

679
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,890
If His Highness The Grand Prince
hurts himself because of this...

680
00:44:33,326 --> 00:44:34,439
Stay here.

681
00:44:35,938 --> 00:44:38,938
This is a conversation that can only be
take place between women.

682
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:44,378
I didn't know you had
such thoughts about marriage.

683
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,405
I just feel relieved as a mother
because he loves you so much.

684
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,021
It turns out I've never asked
you about your feelings.

685
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:57,741
Do you dislike
Your Highness The Grand Prince?

686
00:45:59,685 --> 00:46:00,979
No.

687
00:46:01,115 --> 00:46:02,299
Exactly.

688
00:46:02,732 --> 00:46:04,346
If you don't like it,

689
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,649
you definitely won't
give him a place by your side.

690
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:08,033
But,

691
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:10,778
about marriage,

692
00:46:10,803 --> 00:46:12,333
I'm still not sure.

693
00:46:12,702 --> 00:46:13,721
Why is that?

694
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:14,972
His Highness The Grand Prince,

695
00:46:15,728 --> 00:46:17,328
said he loves me,

696
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:19,746
but he still went to the C ourtesan house.

697
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:23,342
If one day,
he stops loving me,

698
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,918
what will I do?

699
00:46:27,862 --> 00:46:29,834
Why should I marry someone,

700
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:31,628
who meets other women,

701
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,925
but acts like it
isn't a problem?

702
00:46:36,602 --> 00:46:39,136
I'd rather be a man.

703
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,066
If I were a man,

704
00:46:42,462 --> 00:46:44,628
I won't need to
think about things like this.

705
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:46,666
I understand.

706
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:49,268
Imagining your husband
with other women,

707
00:46:49,846 --> 00:46:52,826
will definitely make your heart
ache and burn.

708
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,387
But Ji Won,

709
00:46:56,427 --> 00:46:58,511
an axe is indeed a tool
to cut down trees,

710
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,555
but the one that moves the
axe is its handler, right?

711
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:09,263
Which tree to cut and how to cut
it is something you have to decide yourself.

712
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:17,497
So, ask your heart
properly once again.

713
00:47:19,031 --> 00:47:21,298
But, don't take
too long.

714
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:08,411
Promise, okay?

715
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,114
You must marry me.

716
00:48:38,177 --> 00:48:39,192
Older brother!

717
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:55,349
What are you doing here?

718
00:49:52,746 --> 00:49:54,125
The news that you have a fiancé,

719
00:49:54,942 --> 00:49:56,121
that's a lie, right?

720
00:49:57,687 --> 00:50:00,518
You will not get married
to another woman, right?

721
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,081
You left the palace
just to ask that?

722
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:05,994
What if you get caught?

723
00:50:06,151 --> 00:50:07,166
Answer my question!

724
00:50:07,564 --> 00:50:08,684
That's not true, right?

725
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:16,160
The news that I have a fiancé is a lie.

726
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:20,356
But it is true that I will get married
to another woman.

727
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:25,813
Why?

728
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:28,448
Why did you abandon me?

729
00:50:30,602 --> 00:50:31,935
You said I was beautiful.

730
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:35,065
You said I was the most
precious thing in the world.

731
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:40,434
You are still beautiful

732
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,031
and you are still the most
precious thing in the world.

733
00:50:45,638 --> 00:50:48,655
But why do you want to marry
another woman and leave me?

734
00:50:50,624 --> 00:50:52,670
Is it because I'm a princess?

735
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:55,680
I don't need my Princess title.

736
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,635
I'm willing to sacrifice everything for you!

737
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,040
We better leave
this land together.

738
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:08,148
With this money, we can stay
secretly anywhere!

739
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:17,449
I can't.

740
00:51:18,494 --> 00:51:19,931
Go back to the palace.

741
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:21,188
Why?

742
00:51:22,104 --> 00:51:23,337
Goodness, why?

743
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:27,336
I will do it

744
00:51:28,225 --> 00:51:29,902
I can do it.

745
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:31,308
I can throw everything away,

746
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:33,143
Then we can run away together!

747
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:39,307
Everything to you,

748
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:43,367
Nothing to me.

749
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:47,002
In your world where
you have everything,

750
00:51:48,446 --> 00:51:52,298
you can put in your all for love
but for me who has nothing,

751
00:51:55,141 --> 00:51:57,118
Love is not something
I can fight for.

752
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,617
So, please don't bother me anymore.

753
00:52:05,718 --> 00:52:06,738
I will be waiting for you.

754
00:52:10,089 --> 00:52:11,712
Until you come to me.

755
00:52:12,766 --> 00:52:13,799
I will be waiting for you.

756
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:16,335
Don't wait for me.

757
00:52:16,478 --> 00:52:18,788
Then don't look at me
like that.

758
00:52:21,294 --> 00:52:24,298
How could that look mean nothing?

759
00:52:31,373 --> 00:52:34,847
I heard a ship is leaving
to Yeongyeong tomorrow morning.

760
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:37,647
I will wait until you come.

761
00:53:22,373 --> 00:53:23,577
Ji-Won.

762
00:53:25,507 --> 00:53:26,617
Follow me.

763
00:54:42,203 --> 00:54:44,455
Are you not angry anymore?

764
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,329
From now on,

765
00:54:50,646 --> 00:54:52,174
I will try to feel calmer from now.

766
00:55:24,635 --> 00:55:25,985
What's the matter?

767
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:28,346
What do you want to do?

768
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,293
I will take...

769
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,972
...my husband's first night.

770
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:02,473
I'm your husband?

771
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:05,986
Yes.

772
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,186
- Ouch!
- Oh my gosh, Ji Won.

773
00:57:41,521 --> 00:57:42,641
Are you alright?

774
00:59:30,263 --> 00:59:31,278
Don't listen.

775
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:40,420
And don't see either!

776
00:59:42,742 --> 00:59:43,952
- But Your Highness-
- It's alright

777
00:59:44,123 --> 00:59:45,325
Open the door.

778
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,209
Are you sleeping already?

779
01:00:11,593 --> 01:00:12,752
For this afternoon,

780
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:15,778
I apologize.

781
01:00:17,563 --> 01:00:20,414
No matter how angry I was,
shouldn't have done that.

782
01:00:22,063 --> 01:00:23,542
You must be very upset, right?

783
01:00:29,686 --> 01:00:30,717
Princess Hwa Ri.

784
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,057
Princess Hwa Jin?

785
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:49,413
Forgive me.

786
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,310
Princess Hwa Ri has...

787
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:58,078
...gone to see Chae Jun.

788
01:01:05,586 --> 01:01:07,330
What should we do?

789
01:01:07,685 --> 01:01:09,515
I explained everything to her.

790
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:12,578
She still snuck out to
meet Chae Jun.

791
01:01:13,574 --> 01:01:15,631
What if she really runs away?

792
01:01:16,609 --> 01:01:19,003
What if His Majesty finds out?

793
01:01:23,676 --> 01:01:24,802
Don't worry.

794
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:27,388
I will bring her back
safely,

795
01:01:28,115 --> 01:01:29,644
without anyone knowing.

796
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:12,366
If so, finish it well.

797
01:02:12,391 --> 01:02:14,230
Okay, sir. Don't worry.

798
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:34,313
Excuse me.

799
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,806
Is this the ship that is leaving?
to Yeongyeong tomorrow morning?

800
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,151
Oh my!

801
01:03:05,804 --> 01:03:07,750
- Who...
- Shush.

802
01:03:13,419 --> 01:03:14,286
Oh.

803
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:16,388
Looks like you're trying to sneak out.

804
01:03:17,803 --> 01:03:19,525
Don't you realize you're being followed?

805
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:29,150
Come on, quickly.

806
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:34,373
Search carefully.

807
01:03:34,558 --> 01:03:35,440
Good.

808
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,058
Thanks.

809
01:03:49,324 --> 01:03:51,686
That's all I get for saving you?

810
01:03:52,366 --> 01:03:53,191
Oh...

811
01:03:53,824 --> 01:03:55,027
Thank you very much.

812
01:03:59,206 --> 01:04:01,430
Are you trying to run away
in the name of love?

813
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,815
This should be enough to
return the favor.

814
01:04:17,506 --> 01:04:18,149
Here.

815
01:04:27,383 --> 01:04:29,661
What a mysterious woman.

816
01:04:58,932 --> 01:05:00,084
Older brother?

817
01:05:00,936 --> 01:05:02,068
Don't wait.

818
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:04,197
He won't come.

819
01:05:14,873 --> 01:05:16,537
That's not possible.

820
01:05:21,049 --> 01:05:23,812
He always listens
to me.

821
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:27,376
It's not that he can't come.

822
01:05:28,788 --> 01:05:30,637
But it's that he won't come.

823
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:34,148
The person who told us where you were,

824
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:36,903
was Chae Jun himself.

825
01:07:12,417 --> 01:07:16,509
Therefore, Princess Chun Hwa swore
a life together forever with her husband.

826
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:20,954
Becoming one body and one heart.

827
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:24,333
Both of them became
one complete unit.

828
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:43,240
I love you.

829
01:07:44,773 --> 01:07:47,946
Until this life crumbles to dust.

830
01:07:50,044 --> 01:07:51,590
My feelings for you,

831
01:07:53,078 --> 01:07:55,011
will never change.

832
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:39,345
[I LOVE YOU]

833
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,085
[UNTIL THIS LIFE CRUMBLES TO DUST]

834
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:42,813
[MY FEELINGS FOR YOU
WILL NEVER CHANGE]
