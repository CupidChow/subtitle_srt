1
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:02,251
I'm borrowing your clothes for a while.

2
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,773
Since you are very rich, it'd be...

3
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,581
great if you let me take
the clothes as a gift

4
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,667
EPISODE 3

5
00:01:40,298 --> 00:01:42,054
Your Majesty, Madam Shin has arrived.

6
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:54,003
Your Honour.

7
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:56,145
Where were you until now?

8
00:01:57,804 --> 00:01:59,884
I spent the night
to paint in Peach Park,

9
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,701
and time passed by so quickly
without me realizing.

10
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,190
What if Your Majesty
gets to know?

11
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:06,215
I need to rest.

12
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:07,826
You may go.

13
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,155
Wait a minute!

14
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,641
SHOP

15
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:36,029
What's going on?

16
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:42,565
What?

17
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,156
Who's this about?

18
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:46,531
It says it's the princess.

19
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:48,015
Princess Hwa Ri.

20
00:03:58,531 --> 00:03:59,677
ROYAL SON-IN-LAW WANTED

21
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:15,976
"Royal Son-in-law wanted."

22
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:18,665
"Qualifications:"

23
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:24,861
"Must impress Princess Hwa Ri."

24
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,242
ROYAL SON-IN-LAW WANTED
QUALIFICATION: MUST IMPRESS PRINCESS HWA RI

25
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,633
ROYAL SON-IN-LAW WANTED
QUALIFICATION: MUST IMPRESS PRINCESS HWA RI

26
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:44,998
Wow!

27
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:48,887
As I expected,
she is truly one of a kind.

28
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:58,263
I'm ready.

29
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:09,441
Stop right now!

30
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,375
What are you doing?

31
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:15,919
How can you remove the poster
without my permission?

32
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,551
Other people don't need to know.

33
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,203
So I reported it
to the authorities.

34
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:30,283
On what basis did you do that?

35
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:33,685
Of course, it is the right of
the future royal son-in-law,

36
00:05:33,894 --> 00:05:36,368
who has been selected from the
current pool of candidates.

37
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:40,590
Don't you think that if
I put this poster up,

38
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:43,742
it means that I don't like the
current candidates?

39
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:47,416
I didn't think about that.

40
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:49,214
Well, that settles it.

41
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,149
More importantly, isn't...

42
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,960
...there something we need to talk about?

43
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,540
When I woke up, you were gone.

44
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,951
I thought it was just a dream,

45
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:38,129
but it turned out not to be a dream.

46
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:51,776
- About what happened that night...
- About what happened that night...

47
00:06:57,756 --> 00:06:59,217
You go first.

48
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,457
I will take responsibility.

49
00:07:10,856 --> 00:07:11,996
Responsibility?

50
00:07:13,456 --> 00:07:14,456
Why?

51
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:19,086
Because I have touched
the honor of a woman.

52
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,656
As a man,

53
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,636
shouldn't I be the
one responsible?

54
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:23,787
You don't need to...

55
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,613
...do that for me.

56
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,849
Luckily, I am a princess.

57
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,279
My life...

58
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:34,831
...I have the ability
to be responsible for it.

59
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:40,294
Will you be alright?

60
00:07:41,356 --> 00:07:43,923
They say a woman's honor is
more valuable than gold.

61
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,923
Those are not words that deserve to come out,

62
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:49,234
from the mouth of the man who has slept
with so many women.

63
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:52,337
Have you married all the women
with whom you spent the night?

64
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,338
Or perhaps,

65
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,875
Following this principle,
did you give concubine status...

66
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:57,609
...on 99 different levels
to all the women?

67
00:08:04,723 --> 00:08:06,490
They are not my concubines.

68
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,156
Are you perhaps thinking,

69
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,789
I would sleep with several concubines
if I am chosen as Your Highness' future husband?

70
00:08:12,656 --> 00:08:15,290
I know how precious life is.

71
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:18,196
Yes.

72
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:21,099
It is good you know that.

73
00:08:25,977 --> 00:08:26,838
Was I...

74
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:28,373
...that bad?

75
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,379
I mean, that night.

76
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,451
You must have enjoyed it.

77
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,530
Didn't you enjoy it?

78
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,999
Am I the only one who enjoyed it?

79
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:49,963
Did I misunderstand?

80
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:51,896
Is that it?

81
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,673
Alright then.

82
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,649
Thank You.

83
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:17,229
Thanks to you,

84
00:09:17,813 --> 00:09:19,546
...I can dream again.

85
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:24,462
That dream...

86
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:27,218
...let's dream it together.

87
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:31,784
I will try my best
to impress the Princess.

88
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:35,640
You will allow me to
do that, right?

89
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,313
With pleasure.

90
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,552
Wow! Amazing!

91
00:09:51,837 --> 00:09:55,766
Is it true that all these household items
were given by Prince Hwa Seong?

92
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,395
Yes.

93
00:09:57,956 --> 00:10:01,742
I didn't believe it at first
but it turned out to be true!

94
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,970
Wow!

95
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:08,306
Wow, you hit the lottery! The lottery!

96
00:10:08,628 --> 00:10:09,756
The Prince treasures you so much,

97
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:12,103
That even the gifts he gives
you are so beautiful!

98
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:13,254
Eee!

99
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:15,452
It seems like in a previous life
you saved the country,

100
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:16,476
Miss Ji Won.

101
00:10:17,246 --> 00:10:19,213
It seems like you saved the
country more than once.

102
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:22,506
What good deed do I have to do,

103
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:25,723
so that the person I love
loves me like this too?

104
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:27,224
Goodness.

105
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:36,386
- Hmph.
- Goodness.

106
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,066
Why are you pretending to be jealous?
That really doesn't suit you.

107
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,379
Just search, right?

108
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,493
I don't know...

109
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,080
By the way,

110
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,890
I'm engaged, so I am
definitely getting married,

111
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,663
but how can i be sure
he is my husband for life?

112
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,093
Miss Ji Won, what attracted
you to Prince Hwa Seong?

113
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:03,706
I liked his face.

114
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:09,943
His looks are exactly my type.

115
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:15,590
People say, men start doing annoying
things after marriage.

116
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,579
If my husband does those
things too,

117
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,256
at least, he will still
be handsome.

118
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:29,220
But Brother Yeol isn't
that handsome, is he?

119
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,290
He is my type, though.

120
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:40,129
Geez.

121
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:44,156
Some say that a
handsome man is best,

122
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,906
there are also those who say
that the man must be competent.

123
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,071
What do you guys think?

124
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:52,756
What kind of man should be
made one's husband...

125
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,732
...to achieve the greatest happiness?

126
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,183
Of course, a man who loves you!

127
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,268
He loves me,

128
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:02,524
and I love him too.

129
00:12:04,652 --> 00:12:05,990
Isn't the happiness of a woman...

130
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,126
...just that?

131
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:11,290
I thought so too.
So, I asked my mom.

132
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:12,837
but she said it is not so.

133
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:16,000
According to mom, the best man is the one who
is wealthy and competent.

134
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:21,778
Look!

135
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,356
The strength of the family is
the power of a woman.

136
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,556
Who would dare to look down on me?

137
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,631
You should get married into
a strong family too.

138
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:31,656
To be happy.

139
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,793
Competency and wealth?

140
00:12:34,724 --> 00:12:37,057
- What if the family gets destroyed?
- What?

141
00:12:38,228 --> 00:12:41,461
What if he uses his strength to
appoint many concubines?

142
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,890
Oh my goodness! Yes!

143
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,596
Turns out that's not everything!

144
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:51,299
That's why mother said that you should
find a man who comforts your heart.

145
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,198
Marrying into a strong and influential family...

146
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,143
...means having a tough life at home.

147
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:58,862
As you go through life,

148
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,823
you realize that having
just enough is best.

149
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:04,616
Marry into a family like that
so that you are happy.

150
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:06,379
But...

151
00:13:06,903 --> 00:13:08,970
Regarding that 'sufficient' standard,

152
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,376
it's different for everyone.

153
00:13:11,862 --> 00:13:13,422
How much is enough?

154
00:13:14,032 --> 00:13:15,926
Oh, I don't know.

155
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:19,931
Honestly, just between us,

156
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:24,734
my auntie said
a man needs strength! Strength!

157
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:28,037
Even though everything else is good,

158
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,600
if the man is not strong,
it's hard to live together.

159
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,195
You always say
it is so hard to live like this,

160
00:13:33,504 --> 00:13:34,838
but why are you pregnant so often?

161
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:37,476
You will understand later, Miss.

162
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:42,601
As long as you have room to sleep in
and three meals daily, it's enough.

163
00:13:43,398 --> 00:13:48,598
Nothing really matters after the nights
you spend together.

164
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:50,367
Everything will be fine.

165
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:53,334
Life isn't such a big deal, really.

166
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:57,331
What?

167
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,418
So an ideal man is one who is strong?

168
00:14:01,356 --> 00:14:02,959
That doesn't make sense.

169
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,365
So now we know how
an ideal man should be!

170
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,790
He should be handsome,

171
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,457
powerful, influential enough

172
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,881
or maybe more the merrier?

173
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:13,675
And his strength must be good!

174
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,733
Yes, that's it!

175
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:16,990
Yes, that's it!

176
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,028
By the way...

177
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:23,206
...why would men like that
be interested in us?

178
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:30,098
Can't we...

179
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:31,187
Can't we even dream?

180
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:32,445
We can at least dream, right?

181
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,738
That's your dream?

182
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,375
The Crown Princess has started menstruating.

183
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,771
Did the pregnancy fail again?

184
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:42,673
Yes.

185
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,443
It seems so.

186
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:50,956
Maybe the Crown Prince didn't
touch the Crown Princess?

187
00:15:51,113 --> 00:15:52,413
That is not true, Your Majesty.

188
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,553
Both obligations had been carried out
in their entirety.

189
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:02,026
Your Majesty must immediately
give birth to an heir to the throne!

190
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,832
For the welfare of the country,

191
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:06,523
before they request to appoint
more concubines.

192
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:09,934
Crown Princess must first
give birth to the heir.

193
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,750
Because His Majesty is still young,

194
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:25,756
if you serve with all your heart,
good news will surely come soon.

195
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,866
Have you been regularly giving
the fertility enhancing herb?

196
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,956
to the Crown Princess?

197
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:35,846
Yes, Madam.

198
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,356
Make sure the Crown Prince
often accompanies the Crown Princess.

199
00:16:40,028 --> 00:16:40,864
Yes, Madam.

200
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,290
It looks like this won't work.

201
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,150
I have to ask Father to bring the child.
from the family he once said,

202
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:50,190
to become the Crown Prince's concubine.

203
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:52,223
If your brother learns this...

204
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,632
...he definitely won't stay silent.

205
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:55,206
If he doesn't stay silent, so what?

206
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,047
If a concubine
from Lee Jae Sang's family came in,

207
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:57,817
and gave birth to a son,

208
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:59,482
wouldn't that be a big problem?

209
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,166
Especially after the wedding
between Prince Hwa Seong...

210
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,990
...and Lee Jae Sang's family,

211
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,695
now the line of people who want to...

212
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,852
...establish a relationship with
Lee Jae Sang's family keeps coming.

213
00:18:09,001 --> 00:18:10,001
First grandchild...

214
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:13,591
...must come from our family blood.

215
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:16,223
It is our lifeline.

216
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:34,362
Now Miss Ji Won is also married.

217
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:37,690
We will also soon have
our fiancé picked soon, right?

218
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,387
Once married, will I be able
to live happily with my husband?

219
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,396
Yes, you should choose someone like that.

220
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,594
Do you know why I hate you?

221
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,334
Of course not! How can I
know what's in your heart?

222
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:58,769
This is what I don't like.

223
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,972
You act like you are going to choose
your fiancé yourself.

224
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:04,608
if other people are worried,

225
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,529
can't you listen seriously?

226
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:09,651
You take me for granted, don't you?

227
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:11,683
I never took you for granted,

228
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:12,884
but now, yes.

229
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:14,485
What?

230
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:21,395
I...

231
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,695
...get to vote for
my own future husband.

232
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,120
Didn't you hear that?

233
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,020
If we do nothing,
nothing will happen.

234
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,656
Why feel jealous if you
don't do anything yourself?

235
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,056
You're the one who underestimates yourself.

236
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:36,958
Therefore, I said you are also trivial.

237
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,480
Hmph.

238
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:56,467
Whatever.

239
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,653
If faced with you,

240
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:02,733
It seems like a person needs to be mentally strong.

241
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:19,329
You can really make
people die with words, yes!

242
00:20:19,756 --> 00:20:20,918
What's going on here?

243
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,331
I'm waiting to meet you
with you, Princess.

244
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,010
Didn't I promise,

245
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,935
to try my best
to impress you?

246
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:29,426
Yes.

247
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:32,471
Ah, so it turns out that not only
do you have a lot of money, but

248
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,852
but you have a lot of
time too?

249
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,443
How did you know I was coming?

250
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,703
That's how money makes money.

251
00:20:40,325 --> 00:20:41,645
If you have a lot of money like me,

252
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,640
the money will continue to pile up
automatically.

253
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,642
Ah...

254
00:20:45,423 --> 00:20:46,423
That must be nice.

255
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:49,652
Now that you have seen me,
you may go.

256
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:52,483
The sun is scorching hot.

257
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:55,481
Use this.

258
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:58,913
What's this?

259
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,725
This umbrella is for protection.

260
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:17,435
Protection?

261
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:23,635
HWARIJIHWAN

262
00:21:29,607 --> 00:21:34,449
HWA RI'S HAPPINESS

263
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:54,877
That's why he is often called a great seducer.

264
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:57,235
An absolute expert.

265
00:21:58,386 --> 00:21:59,712
Hah, geez.

266
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:31,456
"The husband I believe in."

267
00:22:34,518 --> 00:22:35,352
One.

268
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:49,496
THE HUSBAND I BELIEVE IN
The husband I believe in...

269
00:22:51,945 --> 00:22:53,838
The husband I believe in, hmm...

270
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,528
Oh, it's Aunt !

271
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:21,603
Don't be in too much of a hurry!

272
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:23,890
If we stay calm,

273
00:23:24,023 --> 00:23:25,523
good news will surely come.

274
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:27,994
Right. That's what I have to do.

275
00:23:29,323 --> 00:23:31,066
Time really flies.

276
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,426
When I first entered the palace,

277
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:36,991
we were both still
12-year-old little girls...

278
00:23:40,656 --> 00:23:45,356
Now, Her Highness is
preparing to become a mother to a child.

279
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:48,692
Even though my heart is still in the past,

280
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:51,996
I feel time is passing
by rapidly.

281
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:54,456
That's so true.

282
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:57,485
Aunt!

283
00:23:58,356 --> 00:23:59,581
Her Highness the Crown Princess!

284
00:23:59,854 --> 00:24:01,987
- Princess Hwa Ri!
- Princess Hwa Ri.

285
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:05,523
Did you come to the palace just to
just meet the Crown Princess?

286
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,565
Didn't you want to meet me?

287
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:08,965
Actually,

288
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,023
I was on my way
to meet you.

289
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:12,665
Seeing you cheerful,

290
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,971
I think you're back to being your
true Princess Hwa Ri-self.

291
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:17,506
What's the point of lamenting your fate?

292
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:19,002
It's all in the past, right?

293
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,771
Yes, that's the Princess Hwa Ri I know.

294
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,790
Oh yes, the King has given you the permission to
choose a husband from a noble family.

295
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,930
How is it going?

296
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,437
It's something that has never happened before.

297
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:37,076
Marriage is my business.

298
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,716
Isn't it strange if my elders
determine my partner?

299
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,516
When I mentioned that it was weird,

300
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,779
I was even considered a strange child.

301
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,802
The king also felt lazy
to worry too much,

302
00:24:50,423 --> 00:24:53,090
and just said 'just wait and see'.

303
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,561
It turned out to be a strange tradition.

304
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:01,416
Until now, I thought it was
the obvious way.

305
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:04,234
This is a hard-to-get opportunity,

306
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:05,723
So think carefully.

307
00:25:06,123 --> 00:25:08,323
And choose the best
among those choices.

308
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,773
That's how it should be.

309
00:25:12,198 --> 00:25:13,861
But, I don't know which one is the best.

310
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,054
I'm really confused.

311
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,270
Don't worry!

312
00:25:17,676 --> 00:25:20,456
A smart kid like you
will definitely find the answer.

313
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,460
- Is that so?
- Yes!

314
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:36,066
Aunt.

315
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:37,701
Yes?

316
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:40,003
You're happy, right?

317
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,310
Yes.

318
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:49,371
That's a relief.

319
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:04,256
Good grief.

320
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,990
Why are you so late?

321
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:13,216
Mrs. and Mr. Kim are waiting.

322
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,283
- Mom and Grandpa?
- Yes.

323
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:28,652
Excuse me.

324
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:30,737
The calligraphy meeting went on
for longer than usual.

325
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:34,618
That's enough.

326
00:26:35,456 --> 00:26:37,723
We don't have time anyway
for a walk.

327
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:39,162
What?

328
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,382
What happened?

329
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:43,723
Her Majesty, The Concubine Princess'
marriage has been determined.

330
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:45,569
What?

331
00:26:46,323 --> 00:26:47,638
Why all of a sudden like this?

332
00:26:49,023 --> 00:26:51,141
He is the sole son of
General Seo Byeong Cheon.

333
00:26:51,715 --> 00:26:53,158
Because he was your grandfather's closest person,

334
00:26:53,183 --> 00:26:54,863
This wedding will go ahead
smoothly.

335
00:26:56,546 --> 00:26:57,953
No!

336
00:26:58,802 --> 00:27:01,516
How can I marry
a man I've never even seen?

337
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:04,556
I...

338
00:27:05,636 --> 00:27:07,369
I already have someone I like.

339
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:09,683
How could you say that
despite seeing Princess Hwa Ri?

340
00:27:09,856 --> 00:27:12,536
How will you maintain your reputation
if you say things like this?

341
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,643
How can you say that, despite
knowing the weight of your words?

342
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,497
Good grief.

343
00:27:18,522 --> 00:27:20,470
Princess, you don't need to do anything.

344
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,241
If you do nothing,
there will be no problem.

345
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:28,779
It is no coincidence that your fiancé
is called the King's son-in-law.

346
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:32,343
Then what about me?

347
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,686
What about my life?

348
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,723
Yes, you can just be a Princess Concubine.

349
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,261
Kingdoms and palaces
will run by themselves.

350
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,430
The proposal has been sent,

351
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:49,174
So prepare for the wedding
quietly.

352
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:05,381
Princess Hwa Jin is getting married soon.

353
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:08,769
The General's son
Seo Byeong Cheon, right?

354
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,690
Are you sure he's okay?

355
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:16,026
Of course...

356
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,029
...not.

357
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:24,033
I know very well the intentions of those who want to...

358
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:26,298
...accumulate military power
through political marriage.

359
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:31,274
Don't worry, I've prepared
everything.

360
00:28:32,383 --> 00:28:34,454
After all, he is
Il Jae Sang's closest person,

361
00:28:34,856 --> 00:28:37,736
at least he won't be ordered to
work hard after marriage.

362
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:42,319
I heard that Princess Concubine just came,

363
00:28:42,738 --> 00:28:44,071
and she seemed to be doing fine?

364
00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:48,585
Yes, her condition is stable and
she also seems comfortable.

365
00:28:49,254 --> 00:28:50,227
That's a relief.

366
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:00,616
He likes me.

367
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:02,673
He likes me not.

368
00:29:03,987 --> 00:29:04,942
He likes me.

369
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:06,857
He likes me not.

370
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:10,481
He likes me. He likes me not.
Ugh, why doesn't he like me?

371
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:14,032
He likes me.

372
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,845
He likes me not.
He likes me.

373
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:18,732
He likes me not.

374
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:20,617
He likes me.

375
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:22,545
He likes me not.

376
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:24,398
He likes me.

377
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:26,798
He likes me not.

378
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,598
An easily-angered child

379
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:31,101
gets upset even when
exposed to wind.

380
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,172
Did you come to make fun of me?

381
00:29:36,323 --> 00:29:38,604
Why are you blowing on the fire
in a house that's already burned down?

382
00:29:39,264 --> 00:29:41,824
I see from the physical records,
He is a man of great courage and honor.

383
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,823
Besides, he is an only child,

384
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,066
so no need to worry
about a dispute with my brother-in-law.

385
00:29:46,104 --> 00:29:47,570
He was also close to your grandfather,

386
00:29:47,595 --> 00:29:49,386
so he definitely won't make you suffer
after marriage.

387
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,222
Isn't he the
perfect candidate?

388
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,624
If so, why don't you just
marry him then?

389
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:57,260
I guess my hobby isn't stealing
other people's husbands.

390
00:30:04,323 --> 00:30:06,370
If you do nothing,

391
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:08,171
then nothing will happen.

392
00:30:09,356 --> 00:30:11,116
You said we can
try anything, right?

393
00:30:12,956 --> 00:30:14,521
But my grandfather said,

394
00:30:15,423 --> 00:30:17,414
that doing nothing is the...

395
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,250
...way court ladies
gets married.

396
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,988
So, I don't know what to do.

397
00:30:33,518 --> 00:30:35,078
I'm only telling this to you, but

398
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:40,756
There's...

399
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:44,685
There's someone I like.

400
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:46,710
Who?

401
00:30:47,587 --> 00:30:48,587
Lee Jang Won?

402
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:53,183
How do you know that?

403
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:55,456
Everyone already knows,
So I wouldn't I?

404
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:56,486
What?

405
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:03,819
- Does Jang Won know about it too?
- Obviously, I don't know.

406
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,914
Whether he really doesn't know,
or pretends not to know.

407
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:07,643
Good grief.

408
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:08,953
Everyone knows,

409
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,412
that Mr. Lee Jae Sang and
your grandfather are sworn enemies.

410
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,686
So even if Jang Won might already know,
it would be difficult for him to show it.

411
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:17,324
Good grief.

412
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
Just in case,

413
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,931
why not try to
just confess your feelings?

414
00:31:22,969 --> 00:31:24,009
No!

415
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,551
Then what if it I'm rejected?

416
00:31:26,908 --> 00:31:28,545
How can I
bear the shame?

417
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,970
Then just get married with
your fiancé!

418
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,467
Who knows, he might turn out to be
Your soulmate in the future.

419
00:31:35,036 --> 00:31:36,756
- So this is none of your business, is it?
- Good grief.

420
00:31:37,098 --> 00:31:38,895
This is the reason I hate you!

421
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:41,698
Me too! I don't really like you.

422
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,083
Goodness!

423
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,810
I only spoke the truth.

424
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,153
You all knew too?

425
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,941
It was so obvious,
how could we not know?

426
00:32:08,268 --> 00:32:09,859
You have planned this, right?

427
00:32:10,347 --> 00:32:11,993
- Yes!
- Good grief!

428
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,053
ACADEMY HALL

429
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:19,030
Oh! Looks like they're done.

430
00:32:20,264 --> 00:32:21,904
He's coming!

431
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:28,143
- Calm down, you're ready, right?
- I'm so nervous.

432
00:32:28,168 --> 00:32:30,189
- He's getting closer.
- Come on! now!

433
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:35,012
What's this?

434
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:42,552
- They took it! They took it!
- They saw it!

435
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:43,797
Oh my goodness!

436
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:47,695
LOOK AT ME LIKE YOU LOOK AT A FLOWER.

437
00:32:50,475 --> 00:32:52,168
Isn't this a love letter?

438
00:32:53,182 --> 00:32:54,070
Yes

439
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,853
Look at me like you would a flower.

440
00:32:57,877 --> 00:32:59,642
When it grows in summer,

441
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:03,113
despite having to face a frosty Winter, if we
spend Fall together, I will have no regrets.

442
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,880
Is there no sender's name?

443
00:33:08,472 --> 00:33:09,352
No there isn't.

444
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:10,951
Geez.

445
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:11,740
Good grief.

446
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,012
How did this happen?

447
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:16,159
I already belong to someone else.

448
00:33:19,718 --> 00:33:21,798
I don't even come that often
to the academy hall,

449
00:33:22,648 --> 00:33:24,861
but how did this person
know I was here,

450
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:26,800
and give me a letter like this?

451
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,359
Is she following me?

452
00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:33,176
Therefore, you should
be more careful.

453
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:36,332
How will your fiancé about you
getting a love letter like this?

454
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:37,396
That isn't it.

455
00:33:38,213 --> 00:33:40,884
I only have Ji Won in my heart.
You know that too, right?

456
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,693
The tree remains standing in its place,

457
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:47,735
but the wind never
leaves it alone.

458
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:51,728
That's the truth.

459
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:54,541
He's coming, come quickly!

460
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:56,266
Get ready!

461
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,656
So it's you, huh?

462
00:34:28,336 --> 00:34:29,165
What?

463
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:32,469
It was you,

464
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,387
who sent this letter, right?

465
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,840
- Yes.
- Look at this.

466
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:39,244
I always behave properly!

467
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:41,399
Huh? What's going on?

468
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:43,266
I heard your future has been decided.

469
00:34:44,024 --> 00:34:45,744
Are you disappointed because
that changes things between us?

470
00:34:45,907 --> 00:34:47,574
- What?
- You are still my sister.

471
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:50,187
Even though we were not born
from the same womb,

472
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,396
I have never even once thought of
you as anything other than my sister.

473
00:34:56,202 --> 00:34:57,060
Okay...

474
00:34:57,783 --> 00:34:58,835
Don't worry.

475
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,126
Even when you marry and leave the Palace,
476
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:03,735
I will still love you like I
love my sister, Princess Hwa Ri.

476
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,839
Oh my gosh, the letter was
received by the wrong person.

477
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,647
Oh no...

478
00:35:19,794 --> 00:35:22,213
- Why did it end like this?
- Right?

479
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:26,390
So, you couldn't even confess
your feelings to Jang Won,

480
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,343
but, instead, ensured a loving relationship
with Brother Yeol as a brother?

481
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,673
The love letter flew
And fell in front of

482
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,698
Lee Jang Won outside the Academy Hall.

483
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,516
So, I thought it was obvious
That it was for him, and

484
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,268
that Jang Won will take it.

485
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:39,382
Good grief.

486
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:44,074
How would I have known that Brother Yeol,
the insensitive one is there too?

487
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:45,275
So,

488
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:47,354
now what will you do?

489
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,639
Good grief.

490
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:49,928
I don't know!

491
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:10,600
Geez.

492
00:36:11,257 --> 00:36:13,804
You look like
a completely different person!

493
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:17,428
Because you are already beautiful,

494
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:19,341
with just a touch of makeup,

495
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:20,811
the results are amazing.

496
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:25,382
That's true.

497
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:32,356
I will come here when I get married
too! Okay?

498
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,147
- I will too!
- Yes, me too!

499
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:36,340
Nope!

500
00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:40,025
I already made an appointment first.

501
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,665
What? That fast?

502
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,787
That is not fair!

503
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,669
Her Highness the Princess Concubine
already has experts in the palace.

504
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:47,237
They are too old fashioned,

505
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,045
How can they possibly know the latest trends?

506
00:36:51,122 --> 00:36:54,225
We definitely cannot have our weddings
collide with Her Highness Princess Concubine's.

507
00:36:54,506 --> 00:36:56,088
Approximately when will Her
Highness Princess Concubine marry?

508
00:36:56,112 --> 00:36:57,362
Oh, no...

509
00:36:57,387 --> 00:37:00,480
It's already the second half of the year.
There will only be a few good days left.

510
00:37:01,713 --> 00:37:03,138
So you're just going to get married like that?

511
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:28,344
Geez.

512
00:37:28,773 --> 00:37:30,112
Will he like me?

513
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:35,562
Seeing that you've already made a promise
with bridal makeup artist,

514
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,888
it means you have no intention at all
cancel the engagement, huh?

515
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:39,723
What else can I do?

516
00:37:40,785 --> 00:37:42,425
Mother is so stubborn.

517
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:46,463
Father also didn't say anything.

518
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:48,716
That's true.

519
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,350
Besides whoever you marry,
a make-up artist is still needed.

520
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:54,649
Only the groom needs to be changed.

521
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:56,606
Is it possible?

522
00:37:59,635 --> 00:38:01,578
Honestly, I don't know either.

523
00:38:03,025 --> 00:38:04,137
These days,

524
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,726
Finding someone who I like,
who likes me back

525
00:38:09,234 --> 00:38:10,620
feels like a fairytale.

526
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,290
But,

527
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:16,821
I don't like getting married
like I'm being sold away either.

528
00:38:19,017 --> 00:38:20,363
And I hate the fact that,

529
00:38:20,824 --> 00:38:24,560
I will have a lifelong regret
for not having tried my way even once.

530
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,547
In that case,

531
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:30,315
Isn't the answer obvious?

532
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:35,608
- Beautiful!
- I really want to wear this dress.

533
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,725
- When can we use this?
- Very beautiful!

534
00:39:01,127 --> 00:39:03,533
Oh my! You are not supposed
to drink all of it.

535
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:35,845
Exactly.

536
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:40,617
The one a woman wants
may already be out there.

537
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:45,620
To marry someone and live
lovingly and happily together,

538
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,819
of course, Princess Hwa Ri is
hoping for the same thing too.

539
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:53,756
Who will be the groom
is not yet certain,

540
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:56,338
but she really hopes to me

541
00:39:56,382 --> 00:40:00,130
the right person
and live happily with him.

542
00:40:04,322 --> 00:40:05,936
At least, until that time comes.

543
00:40:11,525 --> 00:40:13,543
What's this?

544
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,447
I should have taught this before.

545
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,305
Lately,

546
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:22,019
This is a conversation guide book
which is trending in the capital.

547
00:40:29,225 --> 00:40:31,725
CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY

548
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:39,903
Just study it first,

549
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,941
so as not to be nervous about anything
that happens tonight.

550
00:40:47,907 --> 00:40:50,046
I've already read it.

551
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:55,252
Oh.

552
00:40:57,317 --> 00:40:59,556
Oh my, is the room a bit hot?

553
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:17,980
CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY

554
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:19,153
CHUN HWA AND...

555
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:31,421
Please,

556
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:33,329
please accept one more glass from me.

557
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:38,048
Now I have become your son-in-law,
you can speak casually.

558
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,971
How could I act like that
with His Highness the Grand Prince?

559
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:44,834
It doesn't matter. Out there, there are also people
who curse the king behind his back.

560
00:41:45,491 --> 00:41:47,537
Son-in-law is the same
as one's child, right?

561
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:50,033
Speak comfortably
and just think of me as your child.

562
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:52,175
We're family now, aren't we?

563
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:01,217
In that case,

564
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:03,987
for the first and last time
tonight,

565
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:06,538
as your father-in-law,
I want to say one thing.

566
00:42:07,111 --> 00:42:08,024
Yes.

567
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:11,202
Only now do I say it,

568
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,798
actually Ji Won has been appointed
as the Crown Princess Consort.

569
00:42:17,195 --> 00:42:18,101
Yes

570
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:20,870
Because His Majesty the King is worried
about conflict between factions,

571
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:24,908
Also, Mr. Il Jae Sang's grandson was chosen
as the current Crown Princess Consort.

572
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:27,352
Not only that.

573
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:31,147
Her face, her education, her personality.

574
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,984
If she was born a boy,
it could have been possible

575
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,727
that I would not be the current leader
of the Academy Hall, but Ji Won.

576
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:40,642
Of course.

577
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:44,627
I know very well that Ji Won is
a woman who is too precious to me.

578
00:42:48,628 --> 00:42:49,748
So therefore,

579
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:52,348
I hope you live in harmony
and love each other.

580
00:42:52,976 --> 00:42:55,905
I won't be able to
see my daughter's tears again.

581
00:42:56,676 --> 00:42:57,722
I request you.

582
00:43:07,481 --> 00:43:08,621
Please don't worry.

583
00:43:09,425 --> 00:43:10,517
If it's about that,

584
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:12,700
I believe I am the person who
loves and cares for...

585
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:13,957
...your daughter the most in this world.

586
00:43:15,928 --> 00:43:17,121
Good then.

587
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:19,441
I trust you.

588
00:43:20,082 --> 00:43:21,141
I will be watching over you two.

589
00:43:26,525 --> 00:43:29,072
Oh, did I ever tell you this?

590
00:43:29,726 --> 00:43:31,647
Ji Won had finished the
Basic Lessons of Four Characters,

591
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:33,125
before the age of three.

592
00:43:34,764 --> 00:43:36,032
Why don't you tell him about when
Ji Won was seven years old,

593
00:43:36,056 --> 00:43:37,764
she discussed the teachings of Confucius and Mencius?

594
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:39,749
Wow, that's amazing.

595
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:41,855
Regardless of other things,

596
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:44,946
if we have a son, his
future will be very promising

597
00:43:45,283 --> 00:43:48,425
Wow, just imagining it
makes me proud!

598
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,144
Thank you, Father-in-law!

599
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,653
He's coming!

600
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:08,036
Gosh, this guy...

601
00:44:21,527 --> 00:44:22,607
His Highness the Grand Prince.

602
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:24,753
To the right.

603
00:44:27,906 --> 00:44:29,026
Ji-Won.

604
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:31,868
My wife.

605
00:44:35,817 --> 00:44:36,673
Come on.

606
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:52,941
Go home.

607
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:55,955
Go, hurry!

608
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:12,443
He was so drunk!

609
00:45:13,112 --> 00:45:16,951
Oh my gosh, he's making mistakes
on the first night as well?

610
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:19,249
Shut up a bit!
They will hear you!

611
00:45:33,793 --> 00:45:35,520
Why are you so drunk?

612
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:38,968
Because I'm happy.

613
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:42,413
Because of happiness.

614
00:46:01,818 --> 00:46:03,265
Oh my!

615
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:16,741
Oh my, the bride is so brave!

616
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,747
It is indeed our lady -
being brave like a real man!

617
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,546
He is lying down!

618
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:37,205
Oh my gosh, what a mess.

619
00:46:37,515 --> 00:46:38,882
Tonight was a total failure.

620
00:46:39,601 --> 00:46:42,534
That's why. Why would you
drink so much alcohol?

621
00:46:43,087 --> 00:46:44,500
Maybe he was too happy.

622
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,950
But still, he should've at least
taken off Miss' wedding crown.

623
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,490
Wait, what?

624
00:46:50,731 --> 00:46:51,757
What happened?

625
00:46:52,618 --> 00:46:53,637
Has it already finished?

626
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,487
There is nothing to see,
so go home and rest.

627
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:06,956
Everyone, let's go home.

628
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,919
Go home.

629
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:14,130
Have a comfortable night.

630
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,705
Good grief.

631
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:55,223
I am so hungry.

632
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:01,202
Geez.

633
00:49:09,812 --> 00:49:10,846
What's going on with them?

634
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:13,216
Did something happen at the palace?

635
00:49:13,805 --> 00:49:15,132
I will find out.

636
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:48,544
Your Honor,
The Princess will come in.

637
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:02,165
Mother, is this true?

638
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,801
How could Auntie have died?

639
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:10,630
That's how it is.

640
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,148
How could it be?

641
00:50:14,518 --> 00:50:17,018
She was still very healthy
a few days ago.

642
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:18,917
For no particular reason,

643
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:21,821
how could she leave
so suddenly like this?

644
00:50:23,128 --> 00:50:24,742
They said she had preeclampsia.

645
00:50:28,721 --> 00:50:29,740
How could it be?

646
00:50:31,447 --> 00:50:32,919
How could something like this...

647
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:36,811
She said that she was happy.

648
00:50:42,103 --> 00:50:44,273
She said that
with a smile.

649
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:53,616
Mother.

650
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:56,520
How could that be?

651
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,027
How could that be?

652
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:03,929
Your Honor.

653
00:51:05,696 --> 00:51:06,722
Your Honor.

654
00:51:08,016 --> 00:51:11,467
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

655
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,070
You are not allowed to step
past the Geumcheon Bridge.

656
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:16,939
Crossing this bridge
means leaving the palace.

657
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:22,940
Is that so?

658
00:51:25,515 --> 00:51:28,470
Even when my childhood friend
who has been my only support has died,

659
00:51:30,394 --> 00:51:32,255
I can't pay my respects.

660
00:51:35,026 --> 00:51:36,146
Can this body,

661
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:40,329
only cross this bridge
after death?

662
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:55,058
BURIAL

663
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:56,109
His Majesty the King.

664
00:51:56,203 --> 00:51:59,324
The Death of Her Highness Princess Consort Hyo Jin
is a painful tragedy.

665
00:52:00,553 --> 00:52:01,753
Her husband, Shim Hak Do,

666
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:05,187
knew that Her Highness Hyo Jin's symptoms
were getting worse, but

667
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:06,838
just ignored it,

668
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:09,025
and kept cheating
with Dayang Dan Geum.

669
00:52:10,246 --> 00:52:11,900
Even when His Majesty the King
felt worried,

670
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:14,297
and personally sent a
physician from the royal medical institution,

671
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:16,488
he argued and refused inspection
in the name of family tradition.

672
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,824
He brought death upon Her Majesty
Princess Consort Hyo.

673
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:20,952
I heard the situation is very critical.

674
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:23,673
I have brought the best medicines
to treat the symptoms.

675
00:52:23,698 --> 00:52:25,394
Let me at least
check her pulse!

676
00:52:25,418 --> 00:52:26,758
How could a man,

677
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:30,205
even if he's a healer, check
a noble lady like ours!

678
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,022
His Majesty the King himself sent me.
Isn't this a royal decree?

679
00:52:33,222 --> 00:52:35,935
Are you going to break the order of the
kingdom? Open the door immediately!

680
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:37,841
There is already a midwife inside,

681
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,589
who is well trained to take
care of a pregnant woman!

682
00:52:41,107 --> 00:52:42,358
Anyway, I said no!

683
00:52:42,814 --> 00:52:44,313
Did you not hear what I said?

684
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,020
Quickly open the door!

685
00:52:48,713 --> 00:52:49,839
How is it going?

686
00:52:50,346 --> 00:52:51,738
Can she still give birth?

687
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:54,318
Symptoms of preeclampsia are worsening rapidly

688
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:56,763
It might lead to a miscarriage

689
00:52:58,504 --> 00:53:00,337
This is making things very hard.

690
00:53:02,454 --> 00:53:05,236
How could her body be so fragile to
the point that she cannot even give birth?

691
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:08,184
In this case, how will the lifeline
of our family continue?

692
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:15,849
Isn't there

693
00:53:17,518 --> 00:53:19,151
another way?

694
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:27,303
If left unchecked,

695
00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:30,740
she probably won't
Make it through tonight.

696
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:39,795
In addition, even though the royal son-in-law
is not allowed to have concubines,

697
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,740
he openly
Had immoral relations...

698
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:43,861
...with Dayang Dan Geum.

699
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,343
This is related to
serious ethical violations,

700
00:53:46,398 --> 00:53:47,974
and so it is appropriate that
the court investigates, tries,

701
00:53:47,998 --> 00:53:50,179
and punishes him for it.
Please re-establish social etiquette.

702
00:53:50,203 --> 00:53:52,845
-Please re-establish social etiquette.
-Please re-establish social etiquette.

703
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:55,203
However, the position of Her Highness
Princess Consort Hyo Jin is high.

704
00:53:55,322 --> 00:53:57,188
He is a descendant of a
family of meritorious officials.

705
00:53:57,274 --> 00:53:59,501
It is a family of great merit
for this country,

706
00:53:59,629 --> 00:54:01,923
so you can't just punish him carelessly!

707
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:04,098
- Should not.
- Should not.

708
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,491
Bring Shim Hak Do in front of me.

709
00:54:33,575 --> 00:54:35,507
Even paying condolences at
]Aunt's funeral is prohibited.

710
00:54:36,216 --> 00:54:37,269
Why is that?

711
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:43,045
Your aunt,

712
00:54:46,097 --> 00:54:47,930
did not have a peaceful life.

713
00:54:49,818 --> 00:54:50,619
What?

714
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:54,037
The ministers...

715
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,331
...are working together to report...

716
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,320
...Shim Hak Do's lewd behavior.

717
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:15,303
His Majesty the King.

718
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:19,342
I feel that this is unfair!

719
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,010
Her Highness Princess Consort Hyo Jin passed away

720
00:55:22,035 --> 00:55:24,220
due to severe preeclampsia
when giving birth to a premature baby,

721
00:55:24,343 --> 00:55:26,863
because the palace physician is a
man, i didn't allow his entry

722
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:30,091
in order to maintain the honor of
Her Highness Princess Consort Hyo Jin.

723
00:55:30,182 --> 00:55:32,538
Therefore, it disn't true that
there was no healer at home at that time.

724
00:55:32,713 --> 00:55:34,019
The best healer in the capital,

725
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:36,474
a midwife, was at the side of
Her Highness Princess Consort Hyo Jin.

726
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,166
The king's son-in-law is not allowed
take a concubines!

727
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:40,310
Because of the lust to have a concubine,
you rejected the healer,

728
00:55:40,549 --> 00:55:42,549
and ler Her Highness Princess Concubine
die!

729
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:43,619
No, that's not true.

730
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:46,595
Since I heard the presence of a man nearby
brings bad luck to the woman giving birth,

731
00:55:46,627 --> 00:55:48,227
I moved away from the delivery room.

732
00:55:48,316 --> 00:55:50,446
However, I remained close to her.

733
00:55:51,919 --> 00:55:52,939
As a husband,

734
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:54,799
how can you ignore
your pregnant wife,

735
00:55:54,823 --> 00:55:57,316
and instead engage in disgraceful acts
with Dayang Dan Geum?

736
00:55:58,617 --> 00:56:00,747
Even when Her Highness Princess Concubine
breathed his last breath,

737
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:02,491
you said you were with Dayang Dan Geum?

738
00:56:03,716 --> 00:56:04,763
Because I am a man,

739
00:56:05,727 --> 00:56:07,563
I was forbidden to approach the delivery room.

740
00:56:08,704 --> 00:56:11,467
I had no way of knowing how long
the delivery would take.

741
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,335
Besides that,

742
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:16,446
Geum is not a maid from my house.

743
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:20,829
She was taken by
Her Highness Princess Consort at the wedding.

744
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,916
When she was pregnant,
she felt guilty...

745
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:25,978
...because she had to keep her distance from me until the delivery.

746
00:56:26,002 --> 00:56:28,748
Therefore, it was she who
offered to have Dan Geum take care of me.

747
00:56:28,772 --> 00:56:30,865
How does that make my acts despicable?

748
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,428
That is absolutely not true!

749
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,220
Please stop the rumors

750
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:39,762
which only tarnish the good name of...

751
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:41,959
...Her Highness Princess Consort Hyo Jin!

752
00:56:43,389 --> 00:56:45,183
Please protect her honor.

753
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:49,972
- Aunt.
- Yes?

754
00:56:50,814 --> 00:56:52,141
Auntie is happy, right?

755
00:56:53,824 --> 00:56:54,843
Yes

756
00:56:55,317 --> 00:56:56,437
I'm grateful.

757
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,726
After listening to his explanation,

758
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,113
there seems to be no lie
in his speech.

759
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,851
His family is an
honorable noble family,

760
00:57:23,095 --> 00:57:24,988
and so it is not right for us
to impose a sentence,

761
00:57:25,015 --> 00:57:26,875
based on only one side of the story.

762
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:29,635
Please maintain balance
in making decisions.

763
00:58:37,669 --> 00:58:40,616
Everyone, there's a new book!

764
00:58:41,035 --> 00:58:44,029
Chun Hwa's Love Story: The Tale of a Cruel Wife
just published!

765
00:58:44,913 --> 00:58:48,820
To punish the savage son-in-law,
Princess Chun Yeong of Dongbangguk!

766
00:58:49,219 --> 00:58:51,719
The princess who was thought to be dead
turns out to be alive again!

767
00:58:52,317 --> 00:58:54,028
A heartbreaking story of revenge
By Princess Chun Yeong,

768
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:55,812
who came back from the dead!

769
00:58:56,224 --> 00:58:59,804
Chun Hwa's Love Story: The Tale of a Cruel Wife!

770
00:58:59,876 --> 00:59:01,422
I want to buy it!

771
00:59:01,446 --> 00:59:02,772
Oh my gosh, thank you.

772
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:13,254
Isn't the story about a savage son-in-law

773
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:15,085
based on the story of Her Majesty Princess
Concubine Hyo Jin?

774
00:59:15,145 --> 00:59:15,984
Oh my Goodness!

775
00:59:16,808 --> 00:59:17,827
Good grief!

776
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:22,444
Shim Hak Do is not just barbaric.
He is worse than a dog.

777
00:59:27,186 --> 00:59:29,041
WHEN...
