2
00:00:07,337 --> 00:00:10,697
From now on, anyone
who coerces women in Dongbangguk,

3
00:00:10,722 --> 00:00:13,382
will be punished severely according to state law.

4
00:00:13,434 --> 00:00:15,598
Likewise, anyone who
reproaches a woman for her honor,

5
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:16,692
will receive the same punishment.

6
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:19,072
Human life is more valuable
than anything else.

7
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:21,212
There can be no more
lives lost...

8
00:00:21,237 --> 00:00:22,904
...due to the loss of one's honor.

9
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:27,447
At this point, I have become curious.

10
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,481
Who do you think is the real
author of Chun Hwa Love Story?

11
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:33,292
First,

12
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:36,473
They are someone who
understands these situations well.

13
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:38,453
They have extraordinary skills
in painting,

14
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:40,498
they are able to write so captivatingly,

15
00:00:40,523 --> 00:00:44,719
providing every detail
without hesitation.

16
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,474
Plus, they know secrets,

17
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:50,106
of the deepests part of the royal family.

18
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:53,998
In this peaceful and safe world,

19
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:55,959
who keep throwing...

20
00:00:58,096 --> 00:00:59,703
...Chun Hwa's Love Story...

21
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:01,971
...into our midst?

22
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,936
EPISODE 6

23
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:43,320
When I went to the capital,

24
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:46,041
There seemed to be a commotion.

25
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,937
Prince Hwa Ing has crossed the line,

26
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,437
so I can't
just leave it alone.

27
00:01:54,286 --> 00:01:56,192
Be careful,

28
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,062
Things can turn around,

29
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:00,042
and become dangerous at any time.

30
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:01,930
Okay, I understand.

31
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,211
If that is true,

32
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:20,829
I...

33
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,740
don't think I can forgive my brother.

34
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:33,722
- Come here.
- Yes, Your Master.

35
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:39,709
Go out and find the first and second volume
of Chun Hwa's Love Story.

36
00:02:40,176 --> 00:02:41,356
Okay, Your Honor.

37
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:13,020
If these illustrations truly depict
Prince Hwa Ing's actions,

38
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,439
his title can be revoked
and he will be exiled.

39
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,829
If you look at his behavior so far,

40
00:03:19,262 --> 00:03:20,935
it is not a baseless accusation.

41
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:24,004
I can only reveal this now,

42
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,167
but the woman who tried to
end her life after being abused by him,

43
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:29,163
was rescued by
Princess Hwa Ri and me.

44
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:31,130
Really?

45
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,630
Yes, Father.

46
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,410
Even though there is no evidence
regarding the incident,

47
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,347
but, from what
I just witnessed that day,

48
00:03:38,748 --> 00:03:41,641
he must have carried out countless
more of such crimes against people.

49
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:46,536
You must give a stern warning,

50
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:48,771
so that he will no longer commit injustice.

51
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,013
Okay.

52
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:54,936
I don't know who the author is,

53
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,753
but what is clear is that they know
the conditions inside the palace in great detail.

54
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:01,248
It seems so.

55
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:04,084
THEN PRINCE LEE...

56
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:10,110
How shameless!

57
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,763
So, all of this is really true?

58
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,546
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

59
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,037
However, Prince Hwa Ing's depraved behavior...

60
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:21,255
...is an open secret
among the people.

61
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:25,115
Even though it's just a story
in story books,

62
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:29,354
but Chun's Hwa Love Story
not only describes Prince Hwa Ing,

63
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:30,752
but also contains intimate stories
which seems to resemble,

64
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:33,328
Princess Hwa Ri and
Her Highness Princess Consort Hyo Jin,

65
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:36,063
and is now becoming a topic
of buzz among the people.

66
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:38,550
What did you just say? There are
stories about them too?

67
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:40,928
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Good grief.

68
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,910
If only considered
as a source of entertainment,

69
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,731
This book has definitely crossed the line.

70
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,734
Therefore, in order to maintain
order and morality,

71
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:49,483
I ask that the circulation of the book
be immediately stopped,

72
00:04:49,507 --> 00:04:51,240
and perpetrators punished firmly.

73
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,470
How impudent!

74
00:04:53,613 --> 00:04:55,297
How dare the author degrade the royal family!

75
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:56,321
CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY

76
00:04:56,355 --> 00:04:57,245
Guards!

77
00:04:57,269 --> 00:05:00,631
Arrest the author of
Chun Hwa's Love Story book immediately!

78
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,135
Who is the owner of this place?

79
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,027
Me. Do you need need anything?

80
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,435
- Arrest her.
- Yes, Master.

81
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:14,925
What?

82
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:18,578
SHOP

83
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:36,413
THEY SAW...

84
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,094
Her Majesty the Empress has arrived.

85
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,424
CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY

86
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,921
Mother, what brought you here
all of a sudden?

87
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:06,125
His Majesty the King,

88
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,229
has ordered that the author of
Chun Hwa's Love Story is captured.

89
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:12,486
Reportedly, the latest book,

90
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,850
depicts the story of Prince Hwa Ing.

91
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:18,387
The author will be arrested
and punished severely.

92
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:23,015
Not only does it contain stories
about Prince Hwa Ing alone,

93
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:25,751
the first and second volumes of
Chun Hwa's Love Story is said...

94
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,718
to have contained stories of Princess Hwa Ri
and your late aunt's story too.

95
00:06:29,593 --> 00:06:31,114
Did you know this?

96
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,539
Why do I care?
if none of it is true?

97
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,820
When the king is not present,
people often criticize their leaders.

98
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,944
This is just a book,

99
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,669
and has nothing to do with the truth
so I don't bother.

100
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:56,538
Okay.

101
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:14,052
Did you already know,

102
00:07:14,076 --> 00:07:17,156
that this kind of book is
currently popular among the people?

103
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,118
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:21,711
If you already knew,

105
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:26,591
why did you stay quiet until
things blew up like this?

106
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:29,540
I didn't report it
because I thought it was just,

107
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:32,064
a popular fictional story
among the people.

108
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,339
Even though it is said that
the first volume of the book,

109
00:07:34,363 --> 00:07:35,943
talks about Princess Hwa Ri,

110
00:07:35,982 --> 00:07:37,058
His Majesty the King himself,

111
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,988
must have known that the contents
it's not true after reading it.

112
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:46,531
If so, what about
Prince Hwa Ing?

113
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:49,220
How much of the story is true?

114
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,159
The story of Prince Hwa Ing
is also not true.

115
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:55,058
Even though he likes to travel
and have fun,

116
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:58,051
how could he possibly dare
harass the palace maids.

117
00:07:58,783 --> 00:08:00,123
All this is just,

118
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:02,742
a fabrication of lies from someone
named Lee Mong Heon.

119
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:04,430
Trust me, Your Majesty the King.

120
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,852
Whether the contents of this book are true or not,

121
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,832
everything will be revealed
once the author is caught.

122
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,547
Father, what should we do?

123
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:33,460
His Majesty the King has ordered,

124
00:08:33,484 --> 00:08:35,510
that the writer of Chun Hwa Love Story
is immediately arrested.

125
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:38,554
If the writer is caught,

126
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:40,255
and they
Prince Hwa Ing's actions...

127
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,846
That can't happen.

128
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,001
We have to find that bastard writer,

129
00:08:45,574 --> 00:08:47,354
before His Majesty the King does.

130
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,514
Then, what about the palace maids?

131
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:56,239
Is that really what you are going
to worry about at this point?

132
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,742
When I first read this book,

133
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:16,316
I was angry and wondered
who dared to write these stories.

134
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,678
that insulted the royal family.

135
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:20,142
How presumptuous and outrageous.

136
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,023
However, regarding the story of the evil husband,

137
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:26,023
which tells the story of
Princess Concubine Hyo Jin,

138
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:30,123
when I read it, I myself felt satisfied.

139
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:33,569
It seems, in my heart too,

140
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:35,746
I want the kingdom's
son-in-law punished.

141
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,138
If I am feeling this way right now,

142
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:44,102
imagine how much more satisfying it is...

143
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:47,059
...for the others who read this book.

144
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,032
Teacher.

145
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,463
Father,

146
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,129
is looking for the author of
Chun Hwa's Love Story,

147
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,148
on charges of
insulting the royal family.

148
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:38,797
Did you hear about this?

149
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,676
Yes, Princess.

150
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,536
Why do you think the author,

151
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:48,118
made a book like that?

152
00:10:54,893 --> 00:10:56,553
Every time I paint,

153
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:58,897
I always think,

154
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,455
"Why did I make this painting?"

155
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,288
Although the reasons vary,

156
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,008
There is one thing I always hope for.

157
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,168
What's that?

158
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:20,011
I hope my feelings when
making the painting...

159
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:24,165
...are also felt
by the people who see it.

160
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:28,126
In this world we live in,

161
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,523
it is difficult to punish those
who have wronged people

162
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,338
But when you read the book,

163
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:39,135
you feel happy because
of the satisfying payback,

164
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,334
even if the happiness lasts
momentarily.

165
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,929
Stop.

166
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:09,019
Who is the person named Lee Mong Heon,
the writer of the book Chun Hwa's Love Story?

167
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:11,315
We...

168
00:12:12,564 --> 00:12:13,737
...don't know, sir.

169
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,312
Yes.

170
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,934
We only sell books that we receive.

171
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:21,157
Well then, at least you know
who sent the book!

172
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:22,798
Tell me the truth, right now!

173
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:23,828
Don't know.

174
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,243
We really don't know anything, sir.

175
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,161
We don't know anything, sir.

176
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,544
It seems that this punishment is still not harsh enough.

177
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:33,453
- Guards!
- Good.

178
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,839
It seems they won't
easily open their mouth.

179
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:55,129
Let me persuade them
in a more subtle way.

180
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,439
Good.

181
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,029
I heard you were the one who supplied the rental books,

182
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:14,033
to shops in the capital.

183
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,247
Who is the person really?
named Lee Mong Heon,

184
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,933
Who wrote Chun Hwa's Love Story?

185
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,595
I don't know, sir.

186
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,335
I just distribute...

187
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:28,728
...the printed books for sale,

188
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,241
but I never saw,

189
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,911
or heard who the author is.

190
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:38,248
Impossible.

191
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,842
This book is not just one or two volumes,

192
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:45,010
and has spread widely
throughout the capital for a long time.

193
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,718
There must be someone who wrote it
and handed it over to you...

194
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:50,801
...before you print and distribute it.

195
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,338
At least, there must be someone,

196
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,551
who you suspect
as the author, right?

197
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,033
If any of you,

198
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:06,219
tell me who Lee Mong Heon is,

199
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,733
the person will be released soon.

200
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:15,236
I will give you one last chance,
so be honest.

201
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:17,623
Who is Lee Mong Heon?

202
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:29,725
Your Highness, Princess.

203
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:42,921
Previously, I had to
tell you something, right?

204
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:47,922
I feel like I shouldn't
make you wait too long,

205
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:49,994
so I requested
to meet you.

206
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,754
Yes.

207
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,246
Forgive me.

208
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,936
No, it's okay.

209
00:15:16,878 --> 00:15:18,624
I just wanted to tell Princess...

210
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,554
...how I feel.

211
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,752
Through this incident, I learned a lot

212
00:15:28,372 --> 00:15:30,040
and have begun preparing for
the Public Servant exam.

213
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:32,140
Is it true?

214
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,245
That was a really good decision.

215
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:40,437
I,

216
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:43,830
always think of you
as someone extraordinary.

217
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,827
You have a strong belief,

218
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:50,137
never fail to try,

219
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:53,221
and are always sincere in every aspect.

220
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:57,840
Your decision right now
really shines bright.

221
00:15:59,977 --> 00:16:02,452
I will try hard
to find my place again.

222
00:16:03,174 --> 00:16:04,427
And,

223
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,220
whatever the path
Your Highness the Princess chooses,

224
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,456
I will happily support it.

225
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:15,445
Thank You.

226
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:42,345
Her Highness Princess Hwa Ri has arrived.

227
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:04,334
Have you packed everything?

228
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:08,049
There are still somethings left.

229
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:09,880
But,

230
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:12,161
I guess it seems like
there isn't much in the first place.

231
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,643
Live well.

232
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:29,964
Of course!

233
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:31,863
Who do you think I am?

234
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:36,098
I am the Princess of Concubine Hwa Jin
of this country.

235
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:38,178
That's why you have to live
better.

236
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:41,582
After marriage, you have to
leave the palace and go far away.

237
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,030
You won't be able to meet me,

238
00:17:44,692 --> 00:17:46,371
and no one will be able to help you.

239
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,492
I'm the one who's worried.

240
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:52,041
who else in the world
can handle...

241
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:54,055
...your stubbornness,
beside me?

242
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,431
Please, control your temper a little,

243
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:00,364
live well, so that your brother
need not worry about you.

244
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,498
Geez.

245
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:05,098
I was the one born first!

246
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:07,922
But those who get married,
they become adults first.

247
00:18:09,193 --> 00:18:13,117
You are still far from being an adult!

248
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:14,312
Geez.

249
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:20,624
Actually,

250
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,859
a few days ago
I met Lee Jang Won...

251
00:18:24,883 --> 00:18:26,223
I already know that too.

252
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,446
You think I'm that clueless?

253
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,120
I have dealt with my heart,

254
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,880
so don't worry about me.

255
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,417
Follow your heart.

256
00:18:51,585 --> 00:18:53,447
Don't regret it again.

257
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:00,835
Hey!

258
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,475
Why?

259
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:21,524
His Majesty the King has arrived.

260
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:25,239
Father?

261
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,057
Father?

262
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,612
Did you pack everything well?

263
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:40,776
Yes, Father.

264
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:44,917
Live well without problems.

265
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,431
If life feels hard,
don't just hold back,

266
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:51,139
you can always come back
to the palace at any time.

267
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:55,496
This place will always be
your home.

268
00:20:00,984 --> 00:20:02,543
Don't worry.

269
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,828
I will live well.

270
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,115
Okay.

271
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:05,427
Now you have become a part of
the inner court,

272
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,134
So learn good manners,

273
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:10,721
and accompany the Crown Prince
with the right attitude.

274
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

275
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:44,041
Your Majesty the Empress.

276
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,320
You must be feeling very stressed, right?

277
00:21:48,482 --> 00:21:50,022
Earlier, even I...

278
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:53,349
...would come here if I started
to feel suffocated, and...

279
00:21:53,883 --> 00:21:56,450
would blankly stare outside the Palace.

280
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:59,932
Past that wall,
the outside world is wide open.

281
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,344
However, even though my brother
was unfairly exiled,

282
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:04,930
I can't go to meet him.

283
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:09,260
I wonder how I
survived all those years.

284
00:22:10,575 --> 00:22:11,921
But now,

285
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:18,111
I too have become part of the palace,
grown old with this place.

286
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:25,339
For me, the crown princess too
is like my own child.

287
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,577
However, for the sake of the Heir, I had to
ask him to meet another woman.

288
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:33,750
So, what's the difference between you and I,
and the previous leaders,

289
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,807
that I used to hate so much.

290
00:22:36,785 --> 00:22:38,245
I don't hold a grudge against you.

291
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:42,366
It definitely had to be done.

292
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,915
Even though the brain understands,

293
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:48,208
the heart still finds it hard to accept it, doesn't it?

294
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:54,777
Even though I try to comfort you
with wise words,

295
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,624
this is all just a trying time that will pass,

296
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:02,154
I can't fully
understand your feelings.

297
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:04,548
I'm not you,

298
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:07,358
and you're not me.

299
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:11,549
I,

300
00:23:12,564 --> 00:23:15,010
just hope you are happy.

301
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:19,468
Because the path to happiness,

302
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:22,241
is up to everyone
to find their own.

303
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:41,242
Your Honour.

304
00:23:44,294 --> 00:23:46,028
Excuse me,

305
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:50,232
if you rest at Kim's residence
tonight too,

306
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,119
won't it become an issue?

307
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:01,944
I don't want to be anxious
with vain hopes anymore.

308
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,890
It would be better to meet
other women who serve you right.

309
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,196
I should leave soon.

310
00:24:14,532 --> 00:24:15,407
Good grief.

311
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:18,804
Isn't Your Honor visiting
that place too often?

312
00:24:22,017 --> 00:24:24,057
Am I not doing what is being asked of me?

313
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:25,357
What are you worried about?

314
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:27,890
I'll be back before the meeting.

315
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,290
So, don't worry.

316
00:25:29,017 --> 00:25:30,017
Geez.

317
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:32,860
Are you flying a kite?

318
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,117
Yes.

319
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,426
When teaching children to read,

320
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,857
they look bored.

321
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,490
So I invited them to play for a while.

322
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:49,490
So much fun, huh?

323
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:52,373
With just a kite...

324
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:53,917
...those kids...

325
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,657
...look like they own the world.

326
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,613
They're still kids, so it's natural.

327
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,124
If only days like this
could last longer,

328
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:07,023
how nice would it be.

329
00:26:13,884 --> 00:26:17,790
The children must not know
who the Crown Prince is, right?

330
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:20,357
Of course it has to be that way.

331
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:22,724
Okay.

332
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,590
So, for them,
Your Majesty is...

333
00:26:26,352 --> 00:26:28,096
that...

334
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,790
rich person who has a lot of free time...

335
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,581
...and likes to have fun.

336
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:35,547
Is that how it will be?

337
00:26:40,217 --> 00:26:43,029
Ah, wanna try flying it once?

338
00:27:13,317 --> 00:27:15,195
Apparently you're not good at it either.

339
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,349
Doesn't this game bring back memories?

340
00:27:48,117 --> 00:27:49,430
By the way!

341
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:53,790
Is it okay if Your Majesty
leaves the Palace so often?

342
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,457
Don't you have a lot of work?

343
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:00,384
Yes, I do.

344
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,357
But even so,
I still have to go on living, right?

345
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,157
At least, after going out
and breathing fresh air like this...

346
00:28:09,584 --> 00:28:11,424
...I can survive
for the time being.

347
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:16,880
If you think about it,

348
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:21,157
things that determine happiness
or someone's misery...

349
00:28:22,484 --> 00:28:23,957
...are not extraordinary things.

350
00:28:26,217 --> 00:28:27,524
It's a sunny day, so it feels nice.

351
00:28:28,784 --> 00:28:31,757
Watching the children run
and laughing like that is also fun.

352
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:36,557
There is someone by my side
who wants to listen to my story...

353
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,490
...that is fun too.

354
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:47,930
Today is really
a fun day.

355
00:29:02,584 --> 00:29:06,124
Princess Hwa Jin was absent
in the meetings we usually hold.

356
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:07,624
It feels weird.

357
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:09,990
Did the wedding go smoothly?

358
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:12,284
Yes.

359
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,124
I have received the news
that she arrived at the Palace safely.

360
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,490
Once she is all settled in,
maybe she will contact us.

361
00:29:19,184 --> 00:29:20,060
Ah...

362
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:22,757
One by one we have started getting married.

363
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:26,157
I don't know howmuch longer we'll
be able to hold this calligraphy meeting.

364
00:29:26,717 --> 00:29:29,524
After marriage, it won't be possible
to go outside freely like before.

365
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,650
That's right.

366
00:29:33,117 --> 00:29:35,329
There's no one like
like His Highness Prince Hwa Seong.

367
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:36,857
Even though they are married,

368
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:39,457
He doesn't fuss about Ji Won
attending these meetings.

369
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,313
Hear that, honey?

370
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,157
Marrying me was the
right decision, right?

371
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:54,057
What brings Your Majesty Grand Place here?

372
00:29:54,697 --> 00:29:57,137
Isn't this the first calligraphy meeting
since we got married?

373
00:29:57,484 --> 00:29:59,907
So, I specially invited...

374
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:01,957
...Teacher Kim as today's painting teacher.

375
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,213
Aren't you leaving?

376
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:37,157
There are boundaries between men and women.

377
00:30:37,317 --> 00:30:39,757
How could I leave Painter Kim?
alone among women?

378
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:41,857
If you know there are limits
between men and women,

379
00:30:41,984 --> 00:30:43,990
Why did you bring a man here?

380
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,590
Isn't Painter Kim a man?

381
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,757
That's why I came
to keep an eye on him.

382
00:30:49,384 --> 00:30:50,384
My wife,

383
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:53,190
By the way, when will this
painting get done?

384
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:54,790
Still a long time.

385
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:56,284
(sighs)

386
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,190
How many seasons have passed
since we sat here?

387
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,733
What's fun about
painting this?

388
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:02,757
gosh.

389
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:05,284
Instead of that...

390
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:07,306
...there are many other things
that are more fun.

391
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,603
Ah, goodness, Brother!

392
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:12,957
Because of Brother,
I can't concentrate on painting!

393
00:31:13,484 --> 00:31:15,460
Can't you just shut up for a moment?

394
00:31:15,484 --> 00:31:17,983
Why don't you try getting married first?

395
00:31:18,717 --> 00:31:21,003
- You won't be able to keep quiet either!
- Good grief!

396
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
By the way,

397
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,747
on the way
to today's Calligraphy meeting,

398
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,891
I stopped by Changwoon for a bit,

399
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:32,524
I wonder if the shop was closed, because the doors were shut.

400
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:34,617
Oh, really?

401
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:39,090
His Majesty is looking for Lee Mong Heon,
the author of Chun Hwa Love Story.

402
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:42,324
Cheongwoon Gisaeng House usually
sells the book,

403
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:46,024
I'm worried that maybe
Mrs. Park was arrested for that.

404
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:48,590
It seems like the vibe is off.

405
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:50,260
My father too...

406
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:53,990
...has reminded us many times
to be careful with our actions.

407
00:31:54,017 --> 00:31:55,057
Likewise in our house.

408
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:56,752
I think Chun Hwa's Love Story...

409
00:31:56,776 --> 00:32:00,516
...is just a collection of romance stories
which is popular among women.

410
00:32:01,117 --> 00:32:03,090
But it looks like this will be
big problem.

411
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:06,557
Cheongwoon Gisaeng House
is like a gathering place for women.

412
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,657
Hopefully nothing happens.

413
00:32:51,217 --> 00:32:52,857
Did you come to order clothes?

414
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,557
Because there was a problem with Mrs. Park,

415
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,924
Cheongwoon Gisaeng House will not be opened
for the time being.

416
00:32:58,884 --> 00:32:59,957
What is the problem?

417
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,124
For now, please come in.

418
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,890
My father is looking for the writer of
Chun Hwa's Love Story.

419
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,490
Is it possible...

420
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:16,390
...Mrs. Park was arrested for that?

421
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:19,584
Yes.

422
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:22,857
We don't know who's
the original author ourselves,

423
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,150
so i think...

424
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:29,190
...they are just wholesalers,
so we should be safe.

425
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:32,824
But as the arrests continue
over the past few days,

426
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,690
I'm starting to get worried too.

427
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:42,084
It seems like...

428
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:43,924
...I have to step in.

429
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:49,024
How could you...

430
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:53,017
So far...

431
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:55,657
...I am the one who printed Chun Hwa's Love Story,

432
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,224
and spread it among the people.

433
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:00,657
I am the one.

434
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:03,590
No need to be surprised.

435
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,890
Across the country,

436
00:34:06,017 --> 00:34:07,924
if not someone
with an influence like mine,

437
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,357
how would it be possible to...

438
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,057
...print and distribute
popular writings so quickly?

439
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:17,157
Even if you're not the painter,

440
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,499
The Influence of Chun Hwa's Love Story...

441
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,813
...as spread widely in society.

442
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:27,224
The responsibility for such distribution will
not be underestimated either.

443
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,424
I am ready to face the consequences.

444
00:34:31,122 --> 00:34:32,454
People like Hwa Ing...

445
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,924
...relies only on power
to oppress people,

446
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:39,357
at least in the book, he should be punished.

447
00:34:40,184 --> 00:34:42,524
Only then,
people's anger can be relieved.

448
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:49,557
I'm sure the author of the book felt,

449
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:52,990
not much different from me.

450
00:34:55,517 --> 00:34:56,957
That is his hope and desire,

451
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:00,590
but there is no way
to set things right in reality.

452
00:35:02,053 --> 00:35:03,627
Maybe that's why
he wrote a book like that.

453
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,857
I just help spread it.

454
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:13,690
Don't worry.

455
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:15,990
Everything will be fine.

456
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,690
I will come back and see you again.

457
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:35,363
I heard you're looking for the publisher.

458
00:36:06,817 --> 00:36:08,857
The main person responsible for publishing
Chun Hwa's Love Story...

459
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,550
...is me,

460
00:36:11,017 --> 00:36:12,017
Choi Hwan.

461
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:26,157
So it is true.

462
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:31,657
They only sell books
in order to earn a living.

463
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:35,524
The responsibility for publishing lies with me,

464
00:36:36,084 --> 00:36:38,224
So just punish me.

465
00:36:45,684 --> 00:36:46,499
You don't even know
that it is a sin,

466
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:49,163
and boldly print books
that insulted the kingdom?

467
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:52,290
Are you really not afraid
of losing your life?

468
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,724
I did nothing wrong,

469
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,890
So what do I have to fear?

470
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:59,524
- What did you say?
- You said I don't know my place.

471
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,624
But I am the one who knows my place best.

472
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:04,890
Before becoming a nobleman,

473
00:37:05,784 --> 00:37:06,924
I am a trader.

474
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,690
As a trader, I only do
profitable things.

475
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,360
Why is that considered a problem?

476
00:37:12,384 --> 00:37:13,960
I really don't understand.

477
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,024
How dare you speak
such nonsense!

478
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:19,084
Surely...

479
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:22,992
...you aren't doing this because
the content of Chun Hwa's Love Story...

480
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:24,590
...is true, right?

481
00:37:26,817 --> 00:37:27,990
Is it really because of that?

482
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:31,624
Chun Hwa Love Story
has been circulating among the people for a long time,

483
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,424
and when volumes one and two came out,
there was no problem whatsoever.

484
00:37:36,117 --> 00:37:37,157
But once volume three came out,

485
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,526
suddenly you are looking for the author.

486
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,224
Isn't that quite suspicious?

487
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,323
Is the story of the prince
from the Dongbangguk Kingdom,

488
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,487
who committed adultery with
a palace maid...

489
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,379
...actually Prince Hwa Ing's story?

490
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:51,977
What is this nonsense?

491
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,350
It is, isn't it?

492
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:55,124
That's just complete nonsense.

493
00:37:55,684 --> 00:37:57,457
This book is purely a fictional story.

494
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:00,980
It has nothing to do at all
with reality.

495
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:03,024
However, because of this fictional story,
the people are restless,

496
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,290
and morality is disturbed.

497
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,596
Who is the author?

498
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,032
Tell the truth!

499
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,313
I don't know.

500
00:38:09,684 --> 00:38:12,812
The stamp with Lee Mong Heon's
name is in the book.

501
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:15,190
As a trader, I just print it
because I think it could be profitable.

502
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,460
I myself don't know who the author is.

503
00:38:17,484 --> 00:38:18,957
How dare you lie!

504
00:38:19,317 --> 00:38:21,590
So you really are
not working with that person?

505
00:38:21,617 --> 00:38:24,057
I've come this far,
So what's the point of me lying?

506
00:38:24,117 --> 00:38:25,657
If investigated,
everything will be revealed.

507
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:28,055
However,

508
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:29,857
what if we end this here?

509
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:35,583
That too would be an option
which is better for you.

510
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:36,441
What?

511
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:38,398
The longer the time spent
to seek...

512
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:40,278
...the original author of Chun Hwa's Love Story,

513
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,094
the greater the possibility that people...

514
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:44,345
...will start to question the
same thing as me.

515
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:47,384
"Could it be...

516
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,890
...that these stories are true?"

517
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,724
That's what they'll think.

518
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:57,490
Once the seeds of doubt are planted
among the people,

519
00:38:58,984 --> 00:39:00,190
even something that is not reality...

520
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,290
...will turn into reality.

521
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,384
Is it possible...

522
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,057
...His Majesty the King wants that?

523
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,390
If the responsibility for this publication
is imposed on me,

524
00:39:15,284 --> 00:39:16,626
I will take back all the
books that are already in circulation,

525
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,790
and return all profits
to the government.

526
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,824
So please give me
just one chance.

527
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:27,724
It's best to report all of this
to Your Majesty,

528
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:30,124
and wait for his decision.

529
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,090
If you are responsible
for this publication...

530
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:07,057
...surely you also know
who is the writer Lee Mong Heon.

531
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,950
So tell me!

532
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:13,790
Who really is the
author of Chun Hwa's Love Story?

533
00:40:14,984 --> 00:40:15,984
Who's he?

534
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,250
I don't know, Your Majesty.

535
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,490
Whoever Lee Mong Heon is,

536
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:22,584
he is just...

537
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:26,124
...one of the many voices of the people
led by His Majesty.

538
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:28,524
How is it fair
that a wise king...

539
00:40:29,317 --> 00:40:30,924
...chooses to hold back one voice of the little people...

540
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,757
...to the point of obscuring the voicees of the hearts
all over the country?

541
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,324
How could I possibly defeat
traders like you in debate?

542
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,484
However...

543
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,457
...no matter how small the people's voices are...

544
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,890
...insulting the royal family is
a sin that cannot be taken lightly.

545
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:52,826
If you really know
the identity of the author,

546
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,557
tell me the truth right now!

547
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,785
Really, I didn't know!

548
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,657
If not you, then who knows?

549
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:04,165
The author wrote the script
and gave it to you,

550
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:05,770
didn't you print it?

551
00:41:06,184 --> 00:41:07,357
Lee Mong Heon never once,

552
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:10,857
appeared directly in front of me.
Not even once.

553
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:12,924
Every time, he just leaves...

554
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:14,524
...the original script in a specific place.

555
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:16,724
without asking for payment.

556
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:19,624
So, we never met.

557
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:22,984
What?

558
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,913
So you mean, he wrote
dangerous books like this...

559
00:41:25,937 --> 00:41:27,743
...without asking for wages?

560
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:32,524
Doesn't that just make it even more suspicious?

561
00:41:36,117 --> 00:41:37,117
Your Honour,

562
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,490
perhaps Your Majesty still remembers,

563
00:41:42,217 --> 00:41:43,217
that before when I...

564
00:41:45,084 --> 00:41:46,490
...donated food aid,

565
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:50,190
His Majesty once promised me
one thing.

566
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:53,157
Whatever your request...

567
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,524
...one day I will definitely...

568
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,524
...will help you.

569
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,290
I will never forget
His Majesty's generosity.

570
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:05,873
Whatever I ask,

571
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:08,037
His Majesty promised to grant
me my wish without hesitation.

572
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,424
That promise.

573
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:15,590
May I request it now?

574
00:42:21,084 --> 00:42:23,469
- What? Now?
- Yes.

575
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:27,424
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

576
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,423
I will withdraw all copies
The circulating love story of Chun Hwa,

577
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,993
take all responsibility

578
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:33,057
and hand over all the profits
to the country.

579
00:42:35,684 --> 00:42:37,190
Don't ask who the author is,

580
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:39,257
and please set me free.

581
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:45,824
Please remember the promise that has been made
Your Majesty for that day,

582
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,957
and grant my request.

583
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:49,557
I beg you sincerely.

584
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:00,317
Ah.

585
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:03,284
Wait...

586
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,990
Why did you come so late at night?

587
00:44:07,517 --> 00:44:11,857
Is there something that is frustrating
you again?

588
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,590
Should there always be a problem?
to meet you?

589
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:17,290
I came because I wanted to meet you.

590
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,450
So...

591
00:44:38,184 --> 00:44:39,724
...how was your day today?

592
00:44:41,517 --> 00:44:42,517
I was only...

593
00:44:43,984 --> 00:44:45,957
...going through the same day
as usual.

594
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:50,584
Yes.

595
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:53,017
Oh, I see.

596
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:17,924
Why don't you ask...

597
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,124
...about my day?

598
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:33,917
From now on,

599
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:38,190
Don't come here again.

600
00:45:39,817 --> 00:45:41,690
Whydid you suddenly say that?

601
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:44,724
The arrival of His Majesty...

602
00:45:46,617 --> 00:45:47,617
...now...

603
00:45:49,284 --> 00:45:50,490
...makes me uncomfortable.

604
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:24,950
Did I...

605
00:46:25,584 --> 00:46:27,024
...make a mistake?

606
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,157
His Majesty did not
make a mistake.

607
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,650
It is just...

608
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,324
...my heart...

609
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:38,190
...which is the problem.

610
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,190
What kind of problem?

611
00:46:46,384 --> 00:46:47,624
Your Honour...

612
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,424
...come freely

613
00:46:52,484 --> 00:46:55,357
and jand goes freely.

614
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,224
But over time,

615
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,817
I...

616
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:05,357
...can't keep up the act
that I feel the...

617
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:08,157
same way as I did
when we met for the first time.

618
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:11,217
When you come,

619
00:47:11,884 --> 00:47:12,924
I feel happy,

620
00:47:14,484 --> 00:47:15,757
and when you don't

621
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:19,357
I wait for you.

622
00:47:24,017 --> 00:47:25,557
Just because of one simple sentence,

623
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,524
"I came because I wanted to see you,"

624
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:35,624
my heart starts pounding.

625
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,324
I hate this feeling.

626
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:45,024
I hate myself...

627
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:48,990
...for always giving meaning
to small things.

628
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:52,917
So,

629
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:56,657
Please, go away.

630
00:48:32,463 --> 00:48:34,751
I feel the same way too
the same as you.

631
00:48:57,223 --> 00:48:58,887
At first I...

632
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,341
...didn't know where to go and I thought
you would be here.

633
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,177
But I miss you more and more...

634
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:10,287
...after seeing you.

635
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,857
I'm happy when I see you.

636
00:49:16,397 --> 00:49:19,146
All I can think about is
how can I get out...

637
00:49:21,897 --> 00:49:23,959
...and meet you.

638
00:52:31,435 --> 00:52:33,896
You already greeted, Mother?

639
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
Yes.

640
00:52:46,939 --> 00:52:47,939
Your Honour.

641
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,808
Isn't there anything Your Majesty
would like to tell me?

642
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:03,136
There isn't anything.

643
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:10,534
If only...

644
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:13,292
...Your Majesty and I...

645
00:53:14,918 --> 00:53:17,800
...met in another world,
with a different appearance...

646
00:53:19,895 --> 00:53:22,308
...would we have lived
differently from now?

647
00:53:36,223 --> 00:53:38,511
Why are you saying such things right now?

648
00:53:47,277 --> 00:53:49,128
Right. I'll go and meet Mother now.

649
00:54:29,587 --> 00:54:30,766
Good grief!

650
00:54:43,603 --> 00:54:45,360
I heard you were arrested.

651
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:47,001
Is that all done with now?

652
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:48,025
Ah...

653
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:49,282
Of course!

654
00:54:50,017 --> 00:54:52,141
Is there something that
can't be done with money?

655
00:54:53,477 --> 00:54:55,133
My lord...

656
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,766
...has paid the ransom
on behalf of the bookstore owner...

657
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:02,094
...and returned all profits
to the government,

658
00:55:03,204 --> 00:55:05,586
so there is no more reason
to hold us back.

659
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:21,897
You're here.

660
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,585
Yes.

661
00:55:24,686 --> 00:55:27,295
Didn't I promise to come back
and see you again?

662
00:55:32,608 --> 00:55:35,584
Why did you let
Choi Hwan leave just like that?

663
00:55:35,772 --> 00:55:39,006
You should find
the author of Chun Hwa's Love Story!

664
00:55:39,447 --> 00:55:41,892
If released,
then he will step on his own tail.

665
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:46,134
There is no way that the person responsible
for publishing the book...

666
00:55:46,783 --> 00:55:49,423
doesn't know the original author,
Lee Mong Heon.

667
00:55:50,603 --> 00:55:52,657
After the King released him,

668
00:55:52,806 --> 00:55:55,532
Surely now he can run wild
without any worries.

669
00:55:56,774 --> 00:55:58,711
If we continue to follow him,

670
00:55:59,877 --> 00:56:02,431
we will naturally
be able to catch the original author.

671
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:17,411
The wind is good.

672
00:56:23,177 --> 00:56:25,567
But the person next to you
isn't good enough?

673
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:29,302
I like him too.

674
00:56:36,388 --> 00:56:38,786
I mean, I'm glad I got to see you
safe and sound.

675
00:56:47,191 --> 00:56:50,472
Apparently it's very difficult
to become a candidate for your fiancé.

676
00:56:52,947 --> 00:56:55,697
When are you actually going to...

677
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:59,400
...have that "faith" in me?

678
00:57:00,771 --> 00:57:01,771
That...

679
00:57:01,979 --> 00:57:03,517
depends on you.

680
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:09,251
I guess if the path is too easy, it isn't fun.

681
00:57:14,252 --> 00:57:16,455
I will try my best.

682
00:57:32,729 --> 00:57:35,056
How could this happen?

683
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,080
Yes?

684
00:57:36,273 --> 00:57:37,773
They can't even
catch the writer,

685
00:57:37,797 --> 00:57:39,342
who betrayed
innocent people like me!

686
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:41,611
I'm the only one at a loss here!

687
00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:43,618
We understand your feelings.

688
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,478
We all know...

689
00:57:46,565 --> 00:57:48,861
...how sad you feel.

690
00:57:48,986 --> 00:57:50,579
This is just a little test,

691
00:57:50,658 --> 00:57:51,869
so look at us,

692
00:57:51,893 --> 00:57:52,970
and calm your feelings.

693
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,080
Okay.

694
00:57:58,013 --> 00:57:59,255
Hey!

695
00:57:59,279 --> 00:58:01,505
What is this?

696
00:58:02,717 --> 00:58:06,185
Even if you bribe
and ask me for help,

697
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,370
I...

698
00:58:07,428 --> 00:58:08,429
...am powerless.

699
00:58:08,453 --> 00:58:09,453
Goodness!

700
00:58:09,506 --> 00:58:11,888
Do not say that!

701
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,685
Aren't you the sole grandson

702
00:58:15,912 --> 00:58:18,607
of the powerful Royal Court Minister?

703
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:21,404
Just think of this
as our sincere efforts.

704
00:58:21,485 --> 00:58:23,907
and please remember us
one day, later.

705
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:26,456
Won't the...

706
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:28,862
...college entrance exam
arrive soon?

707
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:31,088
Is it already time?

708
00:58:31,948 --> 00:58:34,135
I guess there's nothing I can do,

709
00:58:34,573 --> 00:58:37,534
but it will feel bad
if I reject your sincerity,

710
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:39,873
so for now I will accept it.

711
00:58:40,464 --> 00:58:41,878
Thank You.

712
00:58:43,378 --> 00:58:44,378
Okay.

713
00:58:45,142 --> 00:58:47,024
Let's see!

714
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:51,987
Why is there so much?

715
00:58:55,191 --> 00:58:56,510
What is all this?

716
00:59:01,439 --> 00:59:02,712
This is,

717
00:59:03,003 --> 00:59:05,135
the work of the best genius painter in this city,

718
00:59:05,396 --> 00:59:07,904
Kim Min Hong.

719
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:10,373
The price of one piece of calligraphy and painting,

720
00:59:10,397 --> 00:59:14,545
is equivalent to the price of a house
of a noble family.

721
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:19,686
Is Kim Min Hong's work that great?

722
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:23,654
He has not created
new works since taking office.

723
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:25,910
Since there are only few of his works
in circulation,

724
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:28,315
and most of them
already have an owner,

725
00:59:28,339 --> 00:59:30,323
we can't buy it
even if we want to.

726
00:59:30,424 --> 00:59:31,401
It's a really...

727
00:59:31,425 --> 00:59:33,033
...hard artwork to get your hands on.

728
00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:33,846
Is that true?

729
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:34,870
Yes.

730
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:50,774
Whoever wrote this book,

731
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:53,883
definitely knows
Hwa Ing personally!

732
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:56,797
Who on Earth is this man...

733
00:59:57,381 --> 00:59:58,763
Before the King finds out,

734
00:59:59,189 --> 01:00:01,290
we have to get him as soon as possible!

735
01:00:01,993 --> 01:00:02,993
Yes, Grandfather.

736
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,860
No...

737
01:00:10,995 --> 01:00:12,768
What's wrong, sir?

738
01:00:13,427 --> 01:00:15,806
Is there anything strange?

739
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:18,597
I guess,

740
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,917
I have to take my leave first.

741
01:00:20,499 --> 01:00:21,499
Good grief.

742
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:41,823
Okay, okay.

743
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:43,222
Oh my gosh where is it?

744
01:00:47,527 --> 01:00:48,527
It's not here!

745
01:00:57,141 --> 01:00:58,179
Good grief!

746
01:00:58,903 --> 01:01:00,160
CHUN HWA'S LOVE STORY

747
01:01:46,857 --> 01:01:48,146
This bastard...

748
01:02:18,455 --> 01:02:20,392
How dare you without fear,

749
01:02:20,861 --> 01:02:23,103
draw something like that
in the palace?

750
01:02:23,892 --> 01:02:25,446
Do you think you'll be able to get away,

751
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:27,486
after doing something like this?

752
01:02:32,806 --> 01:02:34,356
Catch him quickly!

753
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:35,380
-Yes, Your Honor!
-Yes, Your Honor!

754
01:02:48,886 --> 01:02:51,821
What brings you here, Brother?

755
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:54,725
Why did they arrest Master?

756
01:02:56,103 --> 01:02:57,689
Kim Min Hong is...

757
01:02:57,814 --> 01:02:59,243
...Lee Mong Heon.

758
01:03:00,517 --> 01:03:02,517
Author of Chun Hwa's Love Story...

759
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:04,564
...is Kim Min Hong!

760
01:03:07,541 --> 01:03:08,541
What?

761
01:03:09,142 --> 01:03:10,306
What do you mean?

762
01:03:13,205 --> 01:03:14,400
Look at this!

763
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:21,650
I found it!

764
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:26,400
There is also a picture of the Princess
that he drew secretly!

765
01:03:26,424 --> 01:03:27,141
Yes that!

766
01:03:27,165 --> 01:03:29,140
Quickly bring it here!

767
01:03:33,103 --> 01:03:35,142
I knew it would be like this!

768
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:38,665
How dare you!

769
01:03:38,885 --> 01:03:42,064
How dare you do this
under our supervision?

770
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:45,361
Hear,

771
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,094
get rid of this person right now!

772
01:03:49,674 --> 01:03:50,868
That is not true!

773
01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:56,728
How could a teacher be
an erotic story writer?

774
01:03:56,963 --> 01:03:58,415
That's not possible!

775
01:04:01,252 --> 01:04:04,509
Isn't all the evidence already in plain sight?

776
01:04:05,893 --> 01:04:07,853
He said he was a
famous gardener,

777
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,642
but apparently he is
a hypocrite.

778
01:04:10,377 --> 01:04:13,573
That person has been in secret all this time
spying on the kingdom inside the palace,

779
01:04:13,597 --> 01:04:15,409
and doing things like this!

780
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:17,680
Outside, he acts
like a great artist,

781
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:20,673
but behind it,
he spreads vulgar things!

782
01:04:20,697 --> 01:04:22,181
That's not possible!

783
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,837
That's not possible!

784
01:04:27,017 --> 01:04:28,720
That's not true, right?

785
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,078
Teacher,

786
01:04:30,775 --> 01:04:33,126
you are not the author of
Chun Hwa's Love Story, right?

787
01:04:52,002 --> 01:04:53,157
It's not...

788
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:55,728
...about The Princess.

789
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:03,736
We'd better go now.

790
01:05:03,892 --> 01:05:04,892
Yes.

791
01:05:44,726 --> 01:05:46,022
Your Honour.

792
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:39,217
It seems like,

793
01:06:40,117 --> 01:06:41,351
Lee Mong Heon has visited.

794
01:06:42,218 --> 01:06:43,218
Is that so?

795
01:07:06,944 --> 01:07:08,284
THIS TIME I WILL DELIVER
THE BOOK ITSELF

796
01:07:08,308 --> 01:07:09,587
LET'S MEET IN THE EMPTY LAND
TOMORROW MORNING

797
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:15,183
This time I will
deliver the book itself,

798
01:07:16,717 --> 01:07:17,717
let us...

799
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,600
...meet in an empty field
tomorrow morning.

800
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:26,272
Helloo, greatings to you.

801
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:30,678
I am the one responsible for publishing.
