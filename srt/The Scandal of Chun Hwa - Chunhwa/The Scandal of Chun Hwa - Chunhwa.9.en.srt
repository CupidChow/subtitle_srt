3
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:50,026
Your Majesty,
the Crown Princess is approaching.

4
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:54,397
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:02,338
Your Majesty, there is something I wish to say.

6
00:01:04,622 --> 00:01:05,942
Later.

7
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:11,147
This is a conversation
we need to have right now.

8
00:01:14,722 --> 00:01:16,352
What is it?

9
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,685
I intend to ask His Majesty...

10
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,230
...to end our marriage.

11
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,666
What do you mean,
all of a sudden?

12
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:32,735
End the marriage?

13
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:35,538
Is that even possible?

14
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:39,976
Our marriage did not begin
with our own will.

15
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:44,095
However, I have been happy...

16
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,318
...because you are my husband.

17
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:55,425
So at the very least, this once...

18
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,830
...I want to end it by my own choice.

19
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:03,532
Your Majesty, I humbly ask
for your permission.

20
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:06,396
What is it?

21
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,400
Please end my marriage...

22
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,137
...with the Crown Prince.

23
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:16,955
What?

24
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,540
I wish to resign...

25
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,267
...from my position...

26
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,315
...as Crown Princess.

27
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:31,176
How disrespectful.

28
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:34,823
How dare you say something so outrageous?

29
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:37,069
As the Crown Princess,
you are to lead ancestral rites.

30
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:40,530
I’ve lost that right
and have become a sinner.

31
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:51,897
Here, I confess all my sins.

32
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,543
Please allow me to resign
as Crown Princess.

33
00:03:56,567 --> 00:03:57,880
Silence!

34
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:01,438
You treat marriage so lightly—
what will the kingdom think?

35
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,871
Even commoners can’t end
their marriage so easily.

36
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:07,515
A Crown Princess must set
an example for the people.

37
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,621
How can you even speak
of ending the marriage?

38
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:14,483
I have committed seven great sins
and am no longer worthy of the title.

39
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:17,834
Whether you're worthy or
not is for me to decide.

40
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,816
There is no reason that can justify
canceling a royal marriage.

41
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,510
Do not speak of this again.

42
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:31,814
Then...

43
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:39,555
...can I not end this marriage
before I die?

44
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:47,196
I hope you don’t.

I came all the way here for it.

Geez...

50
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:31,808
Chun Hwa’s Love Story
was banned, so it’s no longer on sale.

51
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,222
Why is that? It was selling well until now.

52
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,128
Why did it suddenly become a banned book?

53
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,514
I don’t know.

54
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,918
If the state decided so,
we have to follow the rules.

There are many interesting books here
besides Chun Hwa’s Love Story.

You didn’t make a sound—
you really startled me.

Actually, there’s something
I want to show you.

63

It must be even more beautiful at night.

64
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,038
What a shame.

65
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,873
You're right.

66
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:48,210
The atmosphere in the palace isn't great,
so I can’t just go out whenever I want.

68
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,951

Yes.

183
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,954
That’s how determined she is.

184
00:21:52,997 --> 00:21:55,578
She no longer wants to be tied
to that title.

185
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:58,510
Why must she remain?

186
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,562
You ask because you don’t understand?

187
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:03,064
She is the Crown Princess.

188
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:07,569
You know how important
a royal marriage is, right?

189
00:22:08,655 --> 00:22:11,406
Even if it’s important—

190
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:16,011
is it more important
than someone’s life?

191
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:27,813
I hope the Crown Princess
can start over,

192
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:33,061
rather than wait until death
to be released from this marriage.

193
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:38,700
I don’t want to ignore the heart
of someone who asked me for help.

194
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,571
I truly want...

195
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,276
...the Crown Princess to live.

196
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:42,697
Have no children.

197
00:23:46,755 --> 00:23:47,788
Jealous.

198
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:53,408
Gossip.

199
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:07,791
Not filial to parents.

200
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,820
I've already informed His Majesty

201
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:37,636
Please go on in.

202
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:02,844
Your Majesty, the lady is here.

203
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:27,168
Alright. What is it?

204
00:25:29,468 --> 00:25:30,221
Your Majesty

205
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:35,014
I request an audience to present
an important matter.

206
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,053
Such audacity!

207
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,072
Even commoners cannot easily
end a marriage.

208
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,609
And yet you dare to speak
of ending a royal union?

209
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,946
This is out of the question.

210
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:05,413
You may leave now.

211
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,609
Your Majesty.

212
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:11,513
His Majesty is the king of this nation.

213
00:26:11,537 --> 00:26:12,310
So?

214
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:14,708
So, when governing the people,

215
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:18,777
shouldn’t we reconsider
things that lack logic?

216
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:24,810
Then, ending their marriage—
is that logical?

217
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:27,777
If you look at the reasons
listed under the major sins,

218
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:30,031
then yes, ending the marriage
is logical.

219
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,933
What?

220
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,421
First.

221
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:37,320
The Crown Princess disobeyed
both Your Majesty and the Empress.

222
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,063
She has committed
a sin against her elders—

223
00:26:39,088 --> 00:26:40,877
the gravest among the seven major sins.

224
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:41,861
That doesn't matter.

225
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,243
Even if she disobeyed
her parents’ will,

226
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:46,335
I don’t see it as a sin.

227
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,652
If it doesn’t bother me,
why should it be considered a sin?

228
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:53,009
Second.

229
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:56,424
She is unable to bear children
to continue the royal bloodline.

230
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,492
She has committed
the sin of infertility.

231
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,243
There’s no woman
who has ever been expelled from the palace...

232
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,597
...just because she couldn’t
bear children.

233
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,422
That is also not a valid reason.

234
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,935
That is unacceptable.

235
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,368
Third.

236
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:11,140
A wife must respect
her husband’s wishes.

237
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,274
Yet she became jealous
of another woman.

238
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,043
That is the sin of jealousy.

239
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:19,710
Being jealous of another woman
is a natural emotion.

240
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:23,751
It’s a human feeling,
not a sin.

241
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:25,142
Fourth.

242
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,176
As a role model to the people,

243
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,009
she should not have been featured
as the main character in Chun Hwa’s Love Story.

244
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:33,982
It sparked gossip
and damaged the royal family’s honor.

245
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:35,343
That is the sin of gossip.

246
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:38,566
Chun Hwa’s Love Story
is something that happens to commoners.

247
00:27:41,088 --> 00:27:46,007
In fact, she is the victim—
so how is that her sin?

248
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:48,643
Why do you say that, Your Majesty?

249
00:27:49,188 --> 00:27:52,537
The law of the land must be fair
to all its people.

250
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:58,052
But by worldly standards,
she has indeed committed a sin.

251
00:27:58,555 --> 00:28:02,591
She has violated four of the major sins.

252
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,844
She has lost her virtue
and is no longer worthy of her position.

253
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:08,908
Therefore,
she must step down from it.

254
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,866
You keep talking about
the seven deadly sins.

255
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:15,860
But the judgment of what is sinful or not
is mine to make—as king.

256
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:18,610
You can't decide that...

257
00:28:18,634 --> 00:28:20,910
...based only on
unreasonable reasons.

258
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,423
Your Majesty!

259
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:26,548
Many women from noble families
have been expelled...

260
00:28:26,572 --> 00:28:31,019
...for equally unreasonable reasons
like the ones you mentioned.

261
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:33,721
Isn’t that unjust?

262
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:37,873
But the Crown Princess is
not an ordinary woman.

263
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,028
She is the Crown Princess.

264
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,416
The state forbids divorce
to protect the people.

265
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,436
We cannot set an example of divorce
within the royal family.

266
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:51,863
This is pointless. Leave.

267
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:20,501
Your Honour.

268
00:29:21,214 --> 00:29:24,119
Ah, yes. You've arrived.

269
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:38,186
Forgive me.

270
00:29:39,155 --> 00:29:41,219
I know you're struggling...

271
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:44,443
...and I haven't been able to help at all.

272
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,294
No.

273
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:51,132
This is all my fault.

274
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:56,166
How could someone like me
deserve to be Crown Prince?

275
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,100
Just because I was the firstborn.

276
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,344
I am not worthy of the throne.

277
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,484
Now I don’t know
where I should go.

278
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:15,223
I don’t even know
if this is the right path.

279
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:27,935
When I was little, there was a heavy snowfall
in the capital.

280
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:33,341
All the roads were buried in snow.

281
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:41,066
Hwa Ing and I
were having fun having snowball fights.

282
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,802
But back then,

283
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:48,655
you were helping the servants
clear the snow and make a path.

284
00:30:51,722 --> 00:30:52,994
Is that true?

285
00:30:53,973 --> 00:30:55,006
Yes.

286
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:58,210
Even when the snow was piled high,
you always said:

287
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:02,003
“If we clear the way ahead,
the road will open.”

288
00:31:03,121 --> 00:31:05,673
Then and now—nothing has changed.

289
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:13,648
If the burden feels heavy, I’ll be with you.

290
00:31:15,422 --> 00:31:18,086
I will always be behind you.

291
00:31:18,948 --> 00:31:21,055
If you’re uncertain, look back.

292
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,991
If you’re afraid, look back.

293
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:29,664
We’ll walk forward together again.

294
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,076
How can you trust me that much?

295
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:37,056
I can’t even
trust myself.

296
00:31:39,322 --> 00:31:40,575
That’s because...

297
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,979
...I trust you.

298
00:31:58,489 --> 00:32:02,330
Are you on your way
to see Her Highness, the Crown Princess?

299
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,332
Yes.

300
00:32:05,088 --> 00:32:07,969
How is her condition?

301
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,741
These past few days,
she hasn’t even wanted to eat.

302
00:32:14,722 --> 00:32:17,211
Day by day, her condition is getting worse.

303
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:25,440
In truth, I even begged
His Majesty...

304
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:28,036
...to allow her marriage to end.

305
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:32,960
But His Majesty said it was impossible.

306
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:36,697
Her Highness seems to have
given up the will to live.

307
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:41,102
And Father has no intention
of changing his mind.

308
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:46,674
I don’t know what
I’m supposed to do now.

309
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:51,212
Is there truly no way
to save her?

310
00:32:58,088 --> 00:33:01,789
There is one idea that came to mind.

311
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:06,494
But I can’t do it alone.

312
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:10,798
Will you help me?

313
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:15,361
So now you want me

314
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:19,207
to sign a letter
consenting to the end of her marriage?

315
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:20,242
[APPROVAL LETTER]

316
00:33:20,288 --> 00:33:22,877
That’s absurd!

317
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:26,948
There is no other way
to save the Crown Princess.

318
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:31,276
If Mother, as the Queen,
joins us,

319
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,388
it will help us gather
support from the other women.

320
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:37,488
Although the palace life
may seem glamorous,

321
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:43,297
doesn’t Mother understand better than anyone
how difficult it truly is?

322
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,833
Would that really change anything?

323
00:33:46,655 --> 00:33:50,671
Women in the palace
have long accepted their fate.

324
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:03,099
But just because they’ve accepted it,
must we keep living that way?

325
00:34:03,949 --> 00:34:05,743
If change is possible, we must change it.

326
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:09,217
Even if it’s not,
at the very least, we must try!

327
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:13,844
No matter how hard you try,
it won’t work.

328
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:15,882
Enough. Leave now.

329
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:18,531
[APPROVAL LETTER]

330
00:34:35,848 --> 00:34:37,807
How long has she been out?

331
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:40,602
About three hours.

332
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:43,543
Princess Hwa Jin?

333
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:45,443
Princess Hwa Ri!

334
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:53,798
What’s this? You suddenly show up with no notice?

335
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,640
My husband said he had business in the capital,

336
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:58,070
so I came along.

337
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:01,464
Surprised?

338
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:02,684
Happy, right?

339
00:35:02,755 --> 00:35:03,544
Of course!

340
00:35:03,758 --> 00:35:05,436
Seeing how confident you are,

341
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:07,301
it seems like your married life is going well.

342
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:10,302
Of course. I am Hwa Jin, after all.

343
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:12,765
As your senior in marriage,

344
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:15,713
I have a lot to teach you.

345
00:35:16,104 --> 00:35:18,829
I’m just glad you’re doing okay.

346
00:35:21,774 --> 00:35:22,789
But still...

347
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,083
What exactly happened?

348
00:35:27,597 --> 00:35:30,743
I was so happy to finally come home
after so long...

349
00:35:31,786 --> 00:35:33,322
But with parents like that,

350
00:35:33,988 --> 00:35:35,003
and even you...

351
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:38,590
While I was away,

352
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:41,297
did something happen in the palace?

353
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,825
The reason I gathered you all here

354
00:36:18,038 --> 00:36:19,053
is because...

355
00:36:21,341 --> 00:36:24,086
...I want to ask for your help
regarding the Crown Princess.

356
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,723
How is Her Highness’ condition?

357
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:30,647
It’s not good.

358
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,506
She’s refusing to eat.

359
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:36,543
If this continues,

360
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,733
she may lose her life.

361
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:43,719
So...

362
00:36:44,425 --> 00:36:46,124
I thought it would be good for us women
to come together

363
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:48,653
and help the Crown Princess
end her marriage

364
00:36:49,688 --> 00:36:50,974
with the Crown Prince,

365
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,026
and leave the palace.

366
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,781
It’s a sad outcome,

367
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,481
but what choice do we have?

368
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:07,362
So Ji Won and I
have thought of a plan.

369
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,785
Using the method of public petition,

370
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,620
what if we collect
signatures in support?

371
00:37:13,588 --> 00:37:14,826
Signatures?

372
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:19,885
You mean a petition with names
and signatures?

373
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:23,330
We’re the ones who’ll collect them?

374
00:37:24,065 --> 00:37:25,080
Yes.

375
00:37:25,498 --> 00:37:28,028
There are cases in history
where scholars

376
00:37:28,389 --> 00:37:30,508
changed the king’s mind
through public petitions.

377
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:33,010
If we band together and try the same,

378
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,922
perhaps His Majesty

379
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:38,701
just once...

380
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:41,016
...might consider it again.

381
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:44,191
If our parents find out,
they won’t sit still.

382
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:48,149
Can we even do something
so reckless?

383
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:50,786
I know it’s a difficult request.

384
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,703
But the ones who can reach out

385
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,350
to someone standing at the edge of a cliff...

386
00:37:57,363 --> 00:37:58,480
...are only us.

387
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,115
So...

388
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:03,914
please help me.

389
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:15,793
There are many books that can sell
even without Chun Hwa’s Love Story.

390
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,974
It doesn’t affect the lives
of people around here.

391
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:21,247
I’m grateful.

392
00:38:22,273 --> 00:38:23,288
However...

393
00:38:23,725 --> 00:38:24,774
regarding the child’s request...

394
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:27,258
He left for Yeonggyeong by boat,

395
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:29,218
and departed safely.

396
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:12,677
Come in.

397
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:14,870
I’m heading home now.

398
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,615
Yes.

399
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:48,622
Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry!

400
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:53,105
No, it’s alright.

401
00:40:55,877 --> 00:40:56,892
Father.

402
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,205
This is Jang Won.

403
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:00,162
Come in.

404
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,275
Father.

405
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:10,652
There’s something I’d like to ask.

406
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:12,625
Yes?

407
00:41:13,395 --> 00:41:14,410
What is it?

408
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,069
About Park Si Heon,
Her Majesty the Queen’s older brother.

409
00:41:22,609 --> 00:41:24,035
What kind of person is he?

410
00:41:24,806 --> 00:41:25,994
Why do you ask?

411
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:29,542
I happened to run into him today.

412
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:34,707
He’s intelligent and highly curious.

413
00:41:35,854 --> 00:41:38,144
He passed the state exam
at a young age like you

414
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:40,194
and worked in the royal library for some time.

415
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:45,054
He came from a poor family
but rose through the ranks on merit.

416
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,666
Then his sister became Crown Princess...

417
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:52,040
I believe he expected to gain more power.

418
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:54,974
But perhaps he was too curious.

419
00:41:55,897 --> 00:41:59,343
He was dismissed and exiled
due to involvement in Western Learning.

420
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,365
Because of that,
Her Majesty the Queen must have suffered greatly.

421
00:42:04,346 --> 00:42:07,925
Her brother studied Western ideologies—
something banned by the state.

422
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,714
The consequences were significant.

423
00:42:15,973 --> 00:42:17,006
And now...

424
00:42:18,493 --> 00:42:20,934
Do you know what he’s up to these days?

425
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:24,400
He’s still a scholar at heart,
even during exile.

426
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:28,381
After his release,
he chose to live more freely.

427
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,535
So what is it?

428
00:42:33,452 --> 00:42:34,467
Are you saying...

429
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:36,484
...that something I ordered

430
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:40,033
might be connected to Park Si Heon?

431
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,718
I’m not sure yet.

432
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:47,287
Since the order came directly
from His Majesty,

433
00:42:47,995 --> 00:42:49,668
I’m monitoring the situation.

434
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,059
But if,

435
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:57,084
this Chun Hwa's Love Story issue
is somehow connected to Park Si Heon,

436
00:42:57,768 --> 00:42:59,861
it could cause a major political stir.

437
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:02,478
Observe carefully.

438
00:43:03,938 --> 00:43:04,953
Understood.

439
00:43:08,314 --> 00:43:11,453
Is this really all we accomplished
by coming together?

440
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:15,496
Do you think His Majesty
will change his mind

441
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,647
just because a few women
signed a petition?

442
00:43:19,659 --> 00:43:22,059
Honestly, I doubt this will work either.

443
00:43:22,965 --> 00:43:23,980
However...

444
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:26,168
maybe...

445
00:43:26,829 --> 00:43:28,715
Father might change his mind.

446
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:31,038
This is pointless.

447
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,572
What nonsense they’re doing.
Don’t get involved.

448
00:43:34,603 --> 00:43:35,803
It’s foolish.

449
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,466
How can a married woman
get involved in something so ridiculous?

450
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,855
Mother...

451
00:43:42,008 --> 00:43:44,248
Besides, there’s nothing
we can do anyway.

452
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:45,733
So it’s better

453
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,626
for you to stay quiet and do nothing.

454
00:43:49,115 --> 00:43:50,553
Go back home quickly.

455
00:43:56,711 --> 00:43:58,430
Why is it that Mother...

456
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:03,310
...always tells me to stay quiet?

457
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:07,010
I’m a person too.

458
00:44:07,703 --> 00:44:09,049
When stepped on, I move,

459
00:44:09,538 --> 00:44:11,417
I think, and I live.

460
00:44:12,971 --> 00:44:13,684
What?

461
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:16,787
Did you forget, Mother?
The words you once told me?

462
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:19,377
To throw away that doctrine.

463
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:23,316
To live with a man
who feels nothing

464
00:44:24,352 --> 00:44:26,786
is like building a prison in your heart.

465
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:30,429
Because you’ve lived like that,

466
00:44:31,945 --> 00:44:34,345
you didn’t want me
to live the same way.

467
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:37,494
She’s dying.

468
00:44:38,487 --> 00:44:41,119
What’s the value of being
Crown Princess?

469
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,371
Why, Mother...

470
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:47,075
...do you want to throw her
into that prison?

471
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,106
That’s not what I wanted.

472
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:56,555
From the moment I was born
into the Kim family,

473
00:44:56,916 --> 00:45:00,709
and was pushed to become Crown Princess—
did you ever ask what I wanted?

474
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:03,312
So please...

475
00:45:04,264 --> 00:45:06,443
don’t say it’s for my own good again.

476
00:45:06,985 --> 00:45:08,191
Just say it clearly—

477
00:45:08,663 --> 00:45:11,095
it’s for the glory of the family.

478
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:16,626
Mother...

479
00:45:17,138 --> 00:45:18,943
don’t say anything more.

480
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,749
All I ask is that you press your palm
over mine—with conviction.

481
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:23,792
I can’t.

482
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,731
What if Father finds out?

483
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:29,709
So if I face hardship in my marriage
and want to come home,

484
00:45:29,999 --> 00:45:32,045
you’ll tell me to endure it
and die there,

485
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:34,432
because a divorced woman
is a disgrace to the family?

486
00:45:34,796 --> 00:45:37,431
You child! Why are you
saying such things?

487
00:45:37,592 --> 00:45:38,836
Because it’s true!

488
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,353
Mother, you're too afraid of Father.

489
00:45:41,578 --> 00:45:45,610
So if I go through the same thing,
you’ll pretend I’m someone else.

490
00:45:45,635 --> 00:45:46,755
I’m sure of it.

491
00:45:46,992 --> 00:45:51,111
If I die as a "loyal" woman,
you’ll all be proud of me.

492
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,492
Because you gave birth to such a woman—
you’ll take pride in that.

493
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,272
Don’t speak nonsense!

494
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:58,349
How could I be proud of that?

495
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,287
If you die,

496
00:46:00,582 --> 00:46:01,616
then I die too!

497
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:02,827
So please...

498
00:46:03,291 --> 00:46:05,098
let’s save her.

499
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:08,728
Why keep forcing someone
who despises palace life to stay?

500
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,996
There’s a saying...

501
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,979
“They say, even if I have to roll in the dirt,
this world is still better.”

502
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,593
Geez...

503
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:16,526
– Mother!
– Mother!

504
00:46:16,584 --> 00:46:17,938
Good grief...

505
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:20,187
Wait, Mother!

506
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:23,404
Please think about it, ma’am.

507
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,835
How much pain have you endured

508
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:28,496
because of Grandmother and
Father’s terrifying concubine?

509
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:29,920
That’s right.

510
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:32,572
The life in the royal family
was the same.

511
00:46:32,657 --> 00:46:35,963
Can you imagine the suffering
they go through?

512
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:39,582
Why do you think
the Crown Princess made that decision?

513
00:46:40,035 --> 00:46:41,341
Mother!

514
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:42,318
Good grief...

515
00:46:42,397 --> 00:46:43,412
That’s right.

516
00:46:54,703 --> 00:46:57,819
Your Highness, Princess Hwa Ri has arrived.

517
00:46:58,583 --> 00:46:59,598
Send her in.

518
00:47:01,337 --> 00:47:02,664
Can you give us a moment?

519
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:05,168
[PETITION]

520
00:47:09,637 --> 00:47:13,647
Some people have decided
to join us.

521
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:16,009
Before it’s too late,

522
00:47:17,217 --> 00:47:19,103
please make your decision, Mother.

523
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:20,818
That won’t work.

524
00:47:23,331 --> 00:47:24,346
Mother...

525
00:47:30,038 --> 00:47:31,937
The one who wrote
Chun Hwa’s Love Story...

526
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,085
...is me.

527
00:47:36,496 --> 00:47:37,511
Hwa Ri...

528
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:44,793
I am Lee Mong Heon.

529
00:47:48,486 --> 00:47:50,039
How could that be...

530
00:47:51,372 --> 00:47:52,669
Why would you do that?

531
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,432
Do you...

532
00:47:57,026 --> 00:47:59,493
Do you know why I wrote it?

533
00:48:03,491 --> 00:48:06,283
The reality where even a princess
can’t change anything...

534
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:10,225
I wanted to change that,
even if only in writing.

535
00:48:13,605 --> 00:48:15,522
Behind the name Lee Mong Heon...

536
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:19,084
...I dreamed of another world.

537
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,625
But now...

538
00:48:26,244 --> 00:48:28,504
...I hope it doesn’t stay a dream.

539
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:33,444
Not under the name Lee Mong Heon,

540
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:35,357
but as Hwa Ri...

541
00:48:36,386 --> 00:48:37,985
I want to save the Crown Princess.

542
00:48:57,008 --> 00:48:58,023
Sir!

543
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:02,649
We have a problem.

544
00:49:03,282 --> 00:49:04,579
Minister Il Jae has reported

545
00:49:04,604 --> 00:49:07,985
that a group of scholars is behind
Chun Hwa’s Love Story

546
00:49:08,295 --> 00:49:10,988
and he has named Park Si Heon
as the mastermind.

547
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:26,226
Your Majesty.

548
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:31,696
Even though he is the Queen’s blood brother,
he cannot be shown mercy.

549
00:49:32,254 --> 00:49:35,921
He was previously exiled
for studying Western Learning,

550
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:37,991
and yet he has shown no remorse.

551
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,265
He distributed 'Chun Hwa’s Love Story',
disrupting the royal family

552
00:49:41,347 --> 00:49:43,366
and gravely damaging public morals.

553
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:46,054
Do not speak recklessly without proof.

554
00:49:46,638 --> 00:49:48,652
Could someone
who just returned from exile

555
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,658
really be the mastermind
behind *Chun Hwa’s Love Story*?

556
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:52,643
What a convenient excuse.

557
00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:57,265
Although the true identity of Lee Mong Heon
hasn’t been revealed,

558
00:49:57,326 --> 00:49:58,906
the person who published the book

559
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,055
was Choi Hwan,
owner of Cheongwoon Sangdan.

560
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,390
And Choi Hwan

561
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:04,703
is a hidden disciple of Park Si Heon.

562
00:50:05,782 --> 00:50:09,526
There must be many ways
they communicate with Park Si Heon

563
00:50:09,598 --> 00:50:11,195
from where he resides in Pyeonggyeong.

564
00:50:11,462 --> 00:50:13,957
Isn’t that just your speculation?

565
00:50:14,603 --> 00:50:17,213
Western Learning is a dangerous ideology.
It denies

566
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:18,947
the caste system on which this nation stands.

567
00:50:19,077 --> 00:50:20,416
Even 'Chun Hwa’s Love Story'

568
00:50:20,806 --> 00:50:24,186
denies the difference between man and woman
under the guise of fiction.

569
00:50:24,406 --> 00:50:26,819
Isn’t that a perverse and impure story?

570
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:29,780
Your Majesty,

571
00:50:30,087 --> 00:50:32,840
Heaven and earth are distinct.
Men and women cannot be equal.

572
00:50:33,306 --> 00:50:35,012
There are defined social classes—

573
00:50:35,063 --> 00:50:37,332
scholars, farmers, and merchants—
and they cannot be equal.

574
00:50:37,887 --> 00:50:41,455
We must be vigilant,
so these subversive ideas

575
00:50:41,502 --> 00:50:44,439
do not spread further in society.

576
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,022
– Please reconsider, Your Highness.
– Please reconsider, Your Highness.

577
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:04,956
[SHOP]

578
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:21,407
I need to meet Choi Hwan.

579
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:22,902
Where is he?

580
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:24,920
Follow me.

581
00:52:09,451 --> 00:52:10,511
He’s been expecting you.

582
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:25,968
What is it?

583
00:52:27,253 --> 00:52:28,933
The situation has become urgent.

584
00:52:29,671 --> 00:52:33,355
Minister Il Jae suspects Park Si Heon
as the orchestrator

585
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,537
and is trying to tie it
to Western Learning.

586
00:52:35,837 --> 00:52:37,358
'Chun Hwa’s Love Story'...

587
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,700
has nothing to do with that.

588
00:52:39,746 --> 00:52:40,832
Don’t you know?

589
00:52:40,898 --> 00:52:44,197
'Chun Hwa’s Love Story' is not related
to Western Learning at all.

590
00:52:45,076 --> 00:52:46,596
But what about you?

591
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,546
What do you mean?

592
00:53:00,374 --> 00:53:03,633
I saw you with Park Si Heon.

593
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,276
This, too, came from the very place where
'Chun Hwa’s Love Story' was created.

594
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:15,953
I merely opened the path for them.

595
00:53:15,979 --> 00:53:17,305
I’m not a Christian either.

596
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:21,712
I simply help those
who need help, when I can.

597
00:53:21,737 --> 00:53:22,997
Don’t be ridiculous.

598
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:25,464
No matter how much you deny it,

599
00:53:25,758 --> 00:53:28,288
you’re already involved—
no one escapes that now.

600
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:29,755
Let me ask you again.

601
00:53:30,747 --> 00:53:32,433
If there are starving people in front of us,

602
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:35,855
should we ignore them
just because they follow Western Learning?

603
00:53:36,738 --> 00:53:38,458
Aren’t they citizens of this country too?

604
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,826
Who is this country for?
Who was politics made for?

605
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,228
Watch your tongue!

606
00:53:46,425 --> 00:53:48,965
How can someone
with such thoughts

607
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:52,476
be a proper match for the Princess?

608
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,895
Does the Princess know
what kind of man you truly are?

609
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:02,149
And what kind is that?

610
00:54:05,983 --> 00:54:07,603
Do you truly know me?

611
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:13,939
Even though I...

612
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:17,185
...was born into a noble family,

613
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:19,457
I lost my mother at birth.

614
00:54:19,481 --> 00:54:22,967
Those who raised me with warmth
and kindness

615
00:54:24,418 --> 00:54:25,578
were slaves.

616
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:29,509
It wasn’t the laws of this country that raised me

617
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:32,267
but the compassion of people who pitied me.

618
00:54:34,106 --> 00:54:38,252
Why is repaying kindness
considered a crime?

619
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:45,074
Choi Hwan...

620
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,913
This isn’t about right or wrong.

621
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,796
You’re dealing with the Princess.

622
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,113
How can you

623
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,500
put someone you love
in danger?

624
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:07,638
If this were only your burden,

625
00:55:08,658 --> 00:55:10,540
I wouldn’t have come here.

626
00:55:14,065 --> 00:55:16,465
If your feelings for the Princess are sincere,

627
00:55:18,006 --> 00:55:20,076
leave—before things get worse.

628
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:24,953
If you want to protect her now,

629
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:27,963
that’s the only way.

639
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:23,636

00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:46,415
I want to see you.

I truly must tell you this today.

I’ll wait for you to come.

645
00:57:42,577 --> 00:57:43,617
This place...

646
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:47,814
...is where 'Chun Hwa’s Love Story'
was written and turned into a book.

647
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:53,096
To help...

648
00:57:54,912 --> 00:57:57,918
...those who lost
their means of livelihood,

649
00:57:59,023 --> 00:58:00,603
I gave them work.

650
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:05,170
Then Mr. Si Heon taught them
to read, write, and copy books.

651
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:09,416
Those who still struggled,
we had them grind ink,

652
00:58:09,916 --> 00:58:11,252
paste paper,

653
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:14,327

Yes.

657
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:32,794
In other words,

658
00:58:34,086 --> 00:58:36,484
they were able to survive
thanks to the popularity

659
00:58:37,954 --> 00:58:39,934
of 'Chun Hwa’s Love Story'—your work.

00:58:45,643 --> 00:58:46,790

Yes.

And the others...

665
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:55,895
are the ones rumored to be concubines
who fill...

666
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:59,114
...ninety-nine rooms

are Christians.

the person behind 'Chun Hwa’s Love Story'?

673
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:07,407
No.

674
01:01:09,925 --> 01:01:11,698
Then what about Western Learning?

675
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,009

There is no second chance.

679
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:52,310
The first time,

680
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:55,119
when I asked you to be my partner,

681
01:01:56,537 --> 01:01:58,881
you asked me, “Why me?”

682
01:02:01,065 --> 01:02:02,080
I was...

683
01:02:03,764 --> 01:02:05,716
happy to be the person you
dreamed of becoming.

684
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:09,696
If you’re with someone like that...

685
01:02:11,449 --> 01:02:13,514
maybe you can see another world.

686
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:18,975

are the one who imagined
the world of 'Chun Hwa’s Love Story',

688
01:02:22,734 --> 01:02:23,749
then I hope...

689
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:27,550
we can share that dream together.

690
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:33,317
Please, Princess...

691
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:37,394
Minister Il Jae is accusing Park Si Heon
of being the mastermind.

692
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:40,362
Those involved are now
in a dangerous position.

693
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:45,340
Most of them did this
just to survive.

694
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:49,124
They don’t even know
what Western Learning is.

695
01:02:52,618 --> 01:02:55,304
I’m sorry to ask
something like this of you, Princess...

696
01:02:55,964 --> 01:02:56,979
But—

697
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,006
the only one who can save them...

698
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:03,685
is you, Princess.

699
01:03:09,988 --> 01:03:12,220
Everyone is afraid
to be by my side.

700
01:03:12,868 --> 01:03:13,994
Why is it that you...

701
01:03:15,636 --> 01:03:17,796
...want to be my partner?

702
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:22,729
Didn’t I tell you—
I’m in love with you?

703
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:39,500
So that’s it...

704
01:03:41,766 --> 01:03:43,819
Did you plan to approach me
from the very beginning?

705
01:03:45,904 --> 01:03:47,077
Because I’m a princess?

706
01:03:48,305 --> 01:03:50,458
Because I could help you

707
01:03:51,058 --> 01:03:52,531
achieve your great dream?

708
01:03:53,321 --> 01:03:54,124
Princess—

709
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:56,387
How foolish I’ve been this whole time.

710
01:03:57,592 --> 01:03:59,824
I didn’t even realize
you were thinking this way.

711
01:04:00,682 --> 01:04:02,774
Writing and illustrating
'Chun Hwa’s Love Story',

712
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:06,067
dreaming of a new world
with conviction...

713
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,482
No.

714
01:04:07,567 --> 01:04:09,104
Even if it began like that...

715
01:04:10,186 --> 01:04:12,512
my feelings for you are genuine.

716
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,198
That’s just a coward’s excuse!

717
01:04:16,026 --> 01:04:19,712
You had so many chances
to tell me the truth!

718
01:04:20,902 --> 01:04:21,917
At the very least...

719
01:04:24,255 --> 01:04:26,648
when I revealed
that I was Lee Mong Heon—

720
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,335
When I...

721
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:42,586
decided...

722
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:45,611
...to face you without lies,

723
01:04:47,353 --> 01:04:48,368
then...

724
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:51,713
you should’ve told me the truth!

725
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:54,561
You should’ve...

726
01:04:56,047 --> 01:04:58,227
...answered me honestly!

727
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,162
I will take responsibility

728
01:05:16,296 --> 01:05:17,817
for everything I’ve done.

729
01:05:21,814 --> 01:05:23,047
I’ll do everything I can

730
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:27,155
to save the innocent.

731
01:05:27,286 --> 01:05:28,301
But—

732
01:05:32,122 --> 01:05:33,162
You and I...

733
01:05:35,524 --> 01:05:36,576
We’re over now.
