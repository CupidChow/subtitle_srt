1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Master's orders:

2
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
Anyone who appears in the forest today

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,880
shall be eliminated.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,000
Don't be afraid.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,530
I'm here.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,640
Wei Shixu is injured.

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,680
Take him away first.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,760
What about you?

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,400
These men,

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,520
I can handle them.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,000
All right.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,600
Go.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:48,880
Hurry!

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,680
Xiao Yangyang,

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,320
run!

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,960
Quick!

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Stop!

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,640
Don't run!

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,600
Over there!

20
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,600
Stop!

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,680
Don't run!

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,240
Stop!

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,560
It shouldn't be deep.

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
There are hunters down there.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,479
Let's jump.

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Don't run!

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,400
Stop!

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
No time.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,000
They're coming.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,960
Jump now!

31
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,520
Mu Yunfan!

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,900
I'll take you away.

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,040
Where are you hurt?

34
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm fine.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
By the way.

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,960
Weren't you playing chess at the Chancellor's mansion?

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,690
How did you end up in this grove?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,240
Your chess skills,

39
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,000
who taught you?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,040
Self-taught.

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,560
Good.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,400
Very good.

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Congratulations on clearing the Lanfeng Pavilion dungeon.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
This is your reward from the system.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,960
What is this?

46
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,380
I don't want it.

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,810
This is a Space-Time Travel Pouch.

48
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,800
Space-time travel...

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,640
Can it take me back to reality from the game?

50
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,040
No.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,880
The male lead is in trouble now.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,960
You can use it to travel to his side.

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,690
To help him resolve the crisis.

54
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,840
I'm not helping him.

55
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,040
The princess is also by his side.

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
What a hypocrite.

57
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
I see.

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,560
You've liked me all along.

59
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,090
You just realized that?

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
It's my fault for keeping

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,080
my love too hidden.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,650
I'm not good at expressing myself.

63
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,620
I always thought you understood.

64
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,180
But we actually need to communicate.

65
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,340
You still owe me an answer.

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,360
Su Jinli.

67
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,280
Let's get back together,

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,720
shall we?

69
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Yes.

70
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,520
Since coming here, I've reflected on myself.

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,360
All these years, I've misunderstood you.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,120
And

73
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
I never listened to your explanations.

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,160
We have mouths and ears for communication,

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,490
but I refused to listen.

76
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,560
I'm sorry.

77
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,120
I haven't eaten

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,440
and I'm a bit hungry.

79
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,560
It's okay.

80
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,730
I'll ask Manager Li to make you something.

81
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,800
Never mind.

82
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,159
Our princess's mansion is out of money now.

83
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,159
Nange and Manager Li

84
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,040
are following me without taking salaries.

85
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,440
From now on, we'll have to live poorly.

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,500
We can't afford delicacies anymore.

87
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,770
That's fine.

88
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,930
I'll make you something

89
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,360
that's delicious and inexpensive.

90
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,520
What's both delicious and cheap?

91
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,280
Just wait.

92
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
It smells so good.

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,280
Of course.

94
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,040
This hotpot base is made with Yugan chili peppers.

95
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,100
I had Butler Li prepare it specially.

96
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,120
Do you like it?

97
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
Hotpot!

98
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,400
Mu Yunfan, you're so clever.

99
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,560
Why didn't I think of that?

100
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,490
Go ahead and eat.

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,720
Don't just stand there watching.

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,520
Join us!

103
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,960
Your Highness.

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Then I won't hold back.

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,120
No need to be formal with me.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,850
When have you ever been polite?

107
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,440
It's so hot!

108
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,080
Her Highness says

109
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,520
we should focus when eating

110
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,120
or we might burn our tongues.

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,159
You silly girl!

112
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,820
How dare you make up stories about the princess?

113
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,600
What's wrong?

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,840
Did you burn yourself?

115
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,970
Let me fan it for you.

116
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,040
Feeling better?

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,840
It's fine.

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,720
I can eat now.

119
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Eat slowly.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,330
It's really delicious.

121
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,600
This is my ideal life.

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,720
Two people with a small house,

123
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
a little courtyard.

124
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,560
It doesn't need to be this big,

125
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,040
but it should be cozy.

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,960
Every day,

127
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,160
we'd stroll in the park together.

128
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
And after our walk,

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,400
we'd go home and cook a hearty dinner together.

130
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,040
The life you want

131
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,600
will surely come true soon.

132
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,040
We still don't know when we can go back.

133
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
It should be soon.

134
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,840
Look.

135
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,320
My thread has already receded to here.

136
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,600
It means those two at the bottom of the cliff

137
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,130
must be getting along well.

138
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,880
Eat more.

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,840
This shrimp is delicious.

140
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,300
Let me get you some shrimp.

141
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,659
Here, let me serve you.

142
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
You've given me all of it.

143
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,159
I made this well.

144
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,960
Do you like it?

145
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,020
I'll make it for you again.

146
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,610
It's delicious.

147
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,000
You're hurt.

148
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,480
Your foot

149
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,520
seems sprained.

150
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,520
How are you?

151
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Are you okay?

152
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,600
I'm fine.

153
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
How are your other injuries?

154
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
Fortunately the cliff wasn't high.

155
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,500
And branches cushioned our fall.

156
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,560
Let's go.

157
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll take you to see a doctor.

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,760
Minister,

159
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
our men

160
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,200
have failed.

161
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,520
We almost succeeded,

162
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
but unexpectedly,

163
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,360
that Yunlang suddenly showed up,

164
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,320
allowing the thief to escape.

165
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,240
A mere plaything

166
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,480
who knows how to please others is nothing special,

167
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
yet he dares to associate with my Yang'er.

168
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,120
Investigate

169
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
who this Yunlang really is.

170
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,130
There's one more thing.

171
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,060
The young lady suddenly appeared

172
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,800
and then went missing.

173
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,840
The men we sent after Wei Shixu,

174
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,370
none of them have returned.

175
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,520
Send out everyone we have.

176
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,440
If there's no news of Yang'er within ten days,

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
I'll 'take care' of your entire family.

178
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,320
Hello?

179
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,610
Is anyone there?

180
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,800
Hello, elder.

181
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,320
May I ask,

182
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,850
could we stay for the night?

183
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,320
We're a married couple traveling

184
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,920
and were injured by wolves.

185
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,080
There are many wolves around here.

186
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Come in quickly.

187
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,920
I was going to ask Mrs. Zhang to apply medicine for you,

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,060
but she's already asleep.

189
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,600
So,

190
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,920
if you don't mind,

191
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,520
I can help you apply it.

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,640
Does it hurt?

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,920
Try
