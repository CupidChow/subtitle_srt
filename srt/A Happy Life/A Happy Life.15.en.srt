1
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,600
Work with me.

2
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,580
We can't stay here.

3
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
Let's go quickly.

4
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,539
What about you?

5
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,200
I'll take him back to the mansion.

6
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,800
Don't worry.

7
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,259
I'll take good care of him.

8
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,090
Then please be careful.

9
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,000
If we don't leave soon,

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,720
Nanny Qian will be back.

11
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,680
Let's go!

12
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,500
Be careful, Minister.

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,840
She really

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,120
brought that courtesan back to her residence.

15
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,800
Yes,

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,840
Yunlang is already resting in the young lady's chamber.

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,480
Hurry!

18
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,400
Yang'er!

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,800
Yang'er!

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,850
Yang'er!

21
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,090
Open the door for me!

22
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,480
My husband and I have already gone to bed.

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,540
Whatever it is, let's talk tomorrow.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,560
Nonsense!

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,840
The polyandry system has just been abolished.

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,240
You've bought him back,

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,079
do you plan to spend your life with him?

28
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,079
He and the princess saved my life.

29
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,680
I couldn't just watch him

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,079
suffer in that brothel.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,200
Yang'er,

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,360
this is not how you repay kindness!

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,100
Father, I need to rest now.

34
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,079
Minister!

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,720
Minister!

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,329
Let me break down the door, sir.

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,200
No!

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,840
Minister!

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,800
Minister!

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,050
Are you alright?

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Go back.

42
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,480
Go back.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,880
Thank you for saving me, Miss Jiang.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Don't mention it.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,100
It's getting late.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,079
Miss Jiang,

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,500
you should rest early.

48
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll keep watch outside your door.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,130
I won't disturb you.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,880
All right.

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,200
Miss,

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,000
the Minister has invited Master Yun to play chess with him.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,860
He doesn't know how to play chess.

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,100
It doesn't matter.

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,040
We can go.

56
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,880
Young master,

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,200
there's a letter for you.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,520
If you want to know

59
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,000
the truth about the Wei Army case,

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,600
come alone to the southern forest for a meeting.

61
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
Young master,

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,010
who is this letter from?

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,860
Take a look.

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
So this means

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,760
there are still survivors from that incident.

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,820
We've made no progress with the will.

67
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
Heaven is on our side.

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,200
It has sent us such a gift.

69
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,560
This letter seems suspicious.

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,080
Why?

71
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,520
When I asked you to make soup, someone poisoned it.

72
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Then someone died when we were treating Miss Jiang.

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,200
Leading to my imprisonment with the Second Master.

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Thinking carefully,

75
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,760
whoever is behind this is targeting me.

76
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,680
After several failed attempts,

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,040
now they want to lure me to the outskirts.

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,200
You mean

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,280
this is a trap?

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
Then we shouldn't go.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,120
We must expose the mastermind

82
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,850
and clear His Highness's name.

83
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
I'll go find Nange now

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,100
to gather more men.

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,760
No.

86
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,640
This time,

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,570
we cannot involve His Highness again.

88
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,540
Your Highness.

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,240
There's movement from the Chancellor.

90
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,600
They've deployed many elite troops,

91
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,680
split into two groups.

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
Most heading north,

93
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,480
a smaller group heading south.

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
Go find the First Master.

95
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,080
He left half an hour ago.

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,360
Where did he go?

97
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,520
I asked,

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,360
but the First Master didn't wish to say.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,840
Your Highness,

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
are we heading south or north now?

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,640
South.

102
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,800
The Chancellor has deployed two teams.

103
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,520
Your spy in the Chancellor's residence

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,050
must have been discovered.

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,260
They're trying to lure us into a trap.

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
Then let's turn their plan against them

107
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,840
by pretending to fall for it.

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,720
You take men to the north,

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,920
I'll go south.

110
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,880
How did it go?

111
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,800
The Princess's spies

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
have all been lured away.

113
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,400
Two teams of assassins are already hiding in the southern forest.

114
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,800
This time, Wei Shixu will

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,930
never return alive.

116
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Oh no!

117
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,810
Father wants to harm Shixu.

118
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,210
You invited me here,

119
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,890
so why don't you show yourself?

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
What is the meaning of this?

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
To take your life.

122
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,480
So you're Minister Jiang's dog.

123
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,340
Your life was spared once before.

124
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
If you had stayed hidden,

125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
my master might have let you live.

126
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,600
But you insisted on investigating the truth,

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,920
and even tried to seduce the young lady.

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,400
You're simply asking for death.

129
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
My Wei family were all loyal subjects

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,600
who suffered grave injustice.

131
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,760
How could I live in hiding?

132
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,490
Then I'll send you to the underworld to join them.

133
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,320
Yanyang!

134
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,730
Why are you here?

135
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,240
They were sent by my father.

136
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,440
I'll ask them to stop.

137
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,280
No.

138
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,920
Stopping them now will only make him angrier.

139
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,180
What should we do then?

140
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,520
Do as I say.

141
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,380
Hide first.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,210
Alright.

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,400
Wait.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If you're in danger,

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
release a sky lantern,

146
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,240
and I'll come rescue you.

147
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,360
Go now.

148
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,160
This sleeping powder

149
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,160
the more inner strength you use,

150
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,419
the faster it absorbs.

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,000
It's enough to keep you all knocked out for a while.

152
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,600
That treacherous minister,

153
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
how many men did he send?

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Enough to take your life.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,800
Stop!

156
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,820
Princess Jinli

157
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,900
orders you to cease fighting.

158
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,250
Our master commands

159
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,920
that anyone found in these woods today

160
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
shall be killed without exception.

161
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,600
Don't be afraid.

162
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm here.
