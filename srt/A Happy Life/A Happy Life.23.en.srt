1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,640
Maybe

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,130
my sincerity touched your father.

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,560
So can we go back now?

4
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,360
We should

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,360
be able to go back soon.

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,900
Suddenly I feel a bit reluctant to leave.

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,960
Reluctant?

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,740
Then let's not go back.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,690
Are we still going back?

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,120
You're so annoying.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,600
Is this person also

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,060
arranged by the city lord?

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,240
Your Highness,

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,400
do you remember me?

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,160
Who are you?

16
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,650
Your Highness truly doesn't remember me.

17
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,080
I've been waiting for you at Lanfeng Pavilion all this time.

18
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,600
Since you wouldn't come,

19
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,080
I had to come find you myself.

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,320
Your Highness,

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,850
look out!

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,160
Jinli!

23
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,440
Your Highness!

24
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,280
Jinli.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,660
Your Highness.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,760
Call a doctor.

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,600
Jinli.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,360
Your Highness.

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,920
The system was right.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,520
How are you feeling?

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,760
I will die from my indulgent lifestyle.

32
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
You'll be fine.

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,200
This is just an accident.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,320
You'll be alright.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,080
Call a doctor!

36
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Listen to me.

37
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,640
The mission is complete now.

38
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,720
You need to go back.

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,960
Don't worry about me.

40
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
No.

41
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,120
I won't go back alone.

42
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
I'll go back with you.

43
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,520
You'll be fine.

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,680
I'll take you back with me.

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,720
You'll be alright.

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,480
Wake up.

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,320
Say something.

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Wake up!

49
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,720
I need to go back with you.

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,200
Su Jinli.

51
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,120
System.

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,000
Jinli.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,240
System.

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,720
Royal doctor.

55
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,280
System.

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,600
Hurry and call the royal doctor!

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,680
System.

58
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,720
The Wei army under my command

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,880
has guarded the frontier all our lives

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,840
with unwavering loyalty to our country

61
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
only to be betrayed by a treacherous minister

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,160
accused of treason and collusion with the enemy.

63
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,040
My soldiers

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,720
did not fall by enemy blades

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,520
but perished under that minister's slaughter.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Xu

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,280
Was it my father

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,810
who destroyed your entire Wei family?

69
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,690
Then why does he now approve of us being together?

70
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,800
Father

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Weiyang doesn't have a mother anymore.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,880
Minister

73
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,770
Your household cannot go without a mistress.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,080
I have many young ladies here.

75
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,120
If you could choose one,

76
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,780
she could be your second wife.

77
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,120
How dare you!

78
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,290
You must be tired of living.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,520
Minister

80
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,000
Your daughter is still young.

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,480
Without a mother by her side...

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,440
Father

83
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,320
Weiyang doesn't want a stepmother.

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Having you is enough for me.

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,880
All right.

86
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,000
All right.

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,520
Weiyang

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
only has one mother.

89
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,760
I'm making this clear today.

90
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
In this lifetime,

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,360
I will never remarry.

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,040
Why does my little one look unhappy?

93
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Father

94
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,200
They all have dolls sewn by their mothers.

95
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,920
Weiyang doesn't have one.

96
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
What shall we do then?

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,040
Everyone else has one,

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,280
how could my little one not have one?

99
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,320
So I made one for you,

100
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,600
a very beautiful doll.

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,680
Weiyang has a doll now!

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,560
Yes, indeed.

103
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,560
Father, your hands are all cut.

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,760
Does it hurt?

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,930
It doesn't hurt.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,330
Weiyang will blow on it and make it better.

107
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Father,

108
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,730
how could you possibly be a bad person?

109
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,160
Miss,

110
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,690
this is the letter the master left for you.

111
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,840
Yanger,

112
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,520
by the time you read this letter,

113
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,480
I will no longer be in this world.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,300
Please forgive me for keeping secrets all these years.

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,720
The grudges of the previous generation

116
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,120
should end here.

117
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,960
My greatest wish

118
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,320
is for you to be safe and happy,

119
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,960
and to live a blessed life.

120
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,880
I know well your feelings for the Wei family's descendant.

121
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,640
Whatever choice you make,

122
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,440
I won't blame you.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,520
Life is still long.

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,360
Please,

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,600
take good care of yourself.

126
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,000
Second Young Master.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Her Highness has already stopped breathing.

128
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,240
Let her be prepared for burial in peace.

129
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,000
She is not dead.

130
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,760
She is not dead.

131
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
She can be revived.

132
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,600
No one is allowed to touch her.

133
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,360
No one.

134
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,040
Young Master.

135
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,840
The dead cannot come back to life.

136
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,560
Your Highness.

137
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,880
Nange.

138
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
I'm going out for a while.

139
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Before I return,

140
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,160
no one is allowed to touch His Highness.

141
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm looking for Weiyang.

142
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,650
You dare to come to the Chancellor's mansion?

143
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,680
Stop!

144
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
My late father said

145
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,480
that no one in this household

146
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,560
should seek revenge against the Wei family.

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,290
Have you forgotten so quickly?

148
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,520
Weiyang.

149
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,050
Are you alright?

150
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,020
My father has passed away.

151
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,770
But my father made grave mistakes.

152
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
This outcome

153
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
was his own choice.

154
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,160
Though I'm grieving,

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,520
I won't blame you.

156
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,800
Nor will I turn our feelings

157
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,960
into hatred.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,000
My father said before he died

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,600
that I should decide our relationship myself.

160
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,080
Her Highness also said

161
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,210
that since I am the female lead,

162
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,180
I should control my own emotions.

163
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,980
But I've thought carefully about it.

164
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,880
In our relationship,

165
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
I've always been the one chasing after you.

166
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,200
Now I'm tired.

167
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,740
I don't want to chase anymore.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
I need some space

169
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,880
to clear my head.

170
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
If

171
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,920
you're willing to wait,

172
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,980
I'm willing to try.

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,960
But I can't promise

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,860
that I'll definitely choose you.

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,920
Miss

176
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
What does it mean to be a female lead?

177
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,090
I don't know either.

178
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,720
I guess it's like

179
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
what you just saw.

180
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,880
So, what do you think?

181
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,010
Pretty cool, right?

182
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,480
Weiyang.

183
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
I understand what the lady means.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
You're not related to her in any way yet,

185
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,060
so you can't enter our residence freely.

186
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
You're here.

187
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,040
It really is you,

188
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,960
Zhou Mo.

189
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,450
What are you smiling at?

190
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
Seeing you so angry,

191
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,320
she must be dead.

192
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,000
She's finally dead.

193
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,200
Mu Yunfan.

194
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
Are you really going to kill me

195
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,840
for that dead woman?

196
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
I've sacrificed so much for you,

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
yet you're so heartless.

198
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
You created all of this.

199
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,960
Once you're dead,

200
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,040
this world will return to normal,

201
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,520
and she'll come back to life.

202
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,960
She's already dead.

203
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,360
She's never coming back.

204
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,200
You can't kill me either,

205
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,640
because only I know the way out.

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
Marry me,

207
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
and I'll take you out of here.

208
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,560
After you appeared,

209
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,600
the system disappeared.

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,520
So if you die,

211
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,460
the system will reappear.

212
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,800
Everything

213
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,000
will return to normal.
