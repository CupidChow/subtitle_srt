1
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,640
Terrible news! Someone's dead!

2
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,000
Dead.

3
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,800
Does she look familiar?

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,040
We just traced the source of the official silver in the Li siblings' possession

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,360
and she was silenced.

6
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,400
Mother,

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
he did it.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,320
Indeed.

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,320
This silver

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,560
was given by me to Miss Li.

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,320
This serial number

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,160
seems to belong to Father's friend,

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,400
Vice Minister Hu.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,290
Vice Minister Hu, are you aware

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,440
that Her Highness recently offered a large reward

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,360
to save those two gentlemen?

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,840
How could I not know?

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,200
This princess, for the sake of those two men,

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,080
shows complete disregard for human life.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,760
I've submitted so many reports,

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,690
yet the City Lord turns a blind eye.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,240
The City Lord has only this one daughter.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,240
He's caught between us officials

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,800
and His Highness.

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,039
The affairs of common people

26
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,570
should be resolved by the people themselves.

27
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,520
But this princess spent three taels of gold

28
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,280
for each volunteer who helped,

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,160
as payment.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,160
I saw those people

31
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,759
were quite pleased about it.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,880
Not entirely.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
I heard

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,759
there was a pair of siblings.

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,680
The brother, after this incident,

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,560
died shortly afterward.

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,450
His sister wanted to file a complaint,

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
but lacked the courage.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,120
I wanted to seek justice for her.

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,650
What crime is there in that?

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you really want justice for her,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
or are you trying to frame me?

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,090
I don't understand Your Highness's meaning.

44
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,880
Dr. Xu said

45
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,240
when we needed to find helpers,

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,000
the Seven-Day Intoxicant had already been diluted.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
He said

48
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,079
those who participated would face no danger,

49
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,720
at most feeling weak for a few days.

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,560
Moreover,

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,200
if he was truly poisoned at my residence,

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,520
the poison would take effect after seven days,

53
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,480
but they came five days ago.

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,620
How could someone die so quickly?

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,560
It seems Vice Minister Hu

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
is not informed about this matter.

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,640
Or perhaps

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,320
you truly believe

59
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,960
you've done something righteous,

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,220
when you've actually been used as a pawn.

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,560
Someone incited

62
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Miss Li to kill her brother.

63
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,480
No one incited anything.

64
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,760
It was I

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,680
who couldn't stand Your Highness's behavior,

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,610
so I took matters into my own hands.

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Why are you so stubborn?

68
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,120
Mother.

69
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Enough.

70
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,200
Both sides are sticking to your own stories.

71
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,600
Although there's no evidence

72
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,880
to prove that Li's brother

73
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,940
truly died because of this incident,

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,640
but since it originated from your princess's residence,

75
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,040
you must provide an explanation to the court officials

76
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,160
and the citizens of the city.

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,079
Mother.

78
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,920
I am willing to forfeit all my property

79
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,240
as compensation to everyone involved in this incident

80
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,720
in exchange for the safety of my two husbands.

81
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,520
No!

82
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
You must not!

83
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,440
I

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
pay my respects to you, Lord.

85
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Minister Jiang,

86
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,079
why are you here?

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,160
I

88
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,400
have come without summons

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,520
because

90
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
this matter concerns my household.

91
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,880
I

92
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,079
must seek justice

93
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,120
for my old friend.

94
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,079
What does this have to do with your household?

95
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,520
That day,

96
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,520
the Princess suddenly came to my residence

97
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,100
and forcibly took away Doctor Xu from my household.

98
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,800
She said she needed him to save someone.

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
I

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,160
could not refuse

101
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
due to her status.

102
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,960
But

103
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,880
he ended up dead at the Princess's residence.

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,279
What are you implying?

105
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,339
Are you framing me?

106
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,120
Mother,

107
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,250
if Doctor Xu hadn't been murdered,

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,720
I would have found his medical records

109
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
and presented the evidence already.

110
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,720
What a coincidence indeed.

111
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Perhaps Doctor Xu

112
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,400
had obtained

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,880
evidence against the Princess's household

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,120
and was silenced for it.

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,200
I've heard

116
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,720
that those two gentlemen in prison

117
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
were also nearly poisoned to death.

118
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,530
You're spouting vicious lies!

119
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,280
Though Doctor Xu was a humble man,

120
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,440
However,

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,330
the princess is the future ruler of Hong City.

122
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,480
She harmed innocent people

123
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,080
for the sake of her husbands.

124
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,560
I am concerned

125
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,920
about Hong City's future.

126
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,980
According to the Prime Minister,

127
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,600
what should be done?

128
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,400
Execute both husbands

129
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,120
to teach Her Highness a lesson

130
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,440
she won't forget.

131
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,360
In the future,

132
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,560
she must behave properly,

133
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,040
giving confidence to Hong City

134
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,440
and its people.

135
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,880
City Lord,

136
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,890
I have something to say.

137
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,320
Quite lively today.

138
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,520
Weiyang,

139
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
what do you wish to say?

140
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,040
City Lord,

141
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,820
I was the one who was poisoned,

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,280
not the two husbands.

143
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,159
The true reason for this matter

144
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,480
is that Her Highness wanted to save my life,

145
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,560
not because of extravagance

146
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,620
or lust for beauty.

147
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,159
The First Husband was poisoned

148
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,880
while trying to cure me.

149
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,880
Yanger,

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
don't speak nonsense

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
before the City Lord.

152
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,800
Father,

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
if I hadn't been poisoned,

154
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,840
would Her Highness

155
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,280
have gone to the Prime Minister's house for a doctor?

156
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,880
This...

157
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,780
The princess's household

158
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,159
saved my life.

159
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,640
I beg the City Lord

160
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,860
to spare everyone in the princess's household.

161
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
Even if this matter

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,160
lacks evidence,

163
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,440
we still cannot allow the two husbands

164
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,640
to return to the princess's residence.

165
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,680
The princess is known for her extravagance

166
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
and has a bad reputation.

167
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
In the future,

168
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,800
how could she bear the burden of Hong City?

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,360
Enough.

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,080
The princess's household

171
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,940
will have all assets confiscated

172
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,680
to appease those affected by this matter.

173
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,360
As for the two husbands,

174
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,240
they deserve credit for saving Miss Jiang.

175
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,170
They will reflect in prison first,

176
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,400
and their fate will be decided later.

177
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,840
Thank you, City Lord.

178
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,600
Thank you, City Lord.

179
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,890
Prime Minister,

180
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,560
I see Jinli and Weiyang get along well.

181
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,560
I only have this one daughter,

182
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,680
and so do you.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,659
Why don't we

184
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
let them become sworn sisters

185
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
and form a bond?

186
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,360
What do you think?

187
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,450
My daughter is mischievous

188
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
and may not meet your approval.

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,200
I can understand.

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,280
I wouldn't dare.

191
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,560
What I mean is

192
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
that young people's affairs

193
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,080
should depend on their own wishes.

194
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
I am willing.

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Weiyang,

196
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,440
what do you think?

197
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,760
Thank you for your favor, Lord.

198
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,720
I am willing.

199
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,400
Rise.

200
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,600
My son.

201
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,520
Xiao Yangyang.

202
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,210
Come greet your mother.

203
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,740
Your Highness.

204
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,010
Quickly, get the royal physician!

205
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
Congratulations, City Lord.

206
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,800
Her Highness is with child.

207
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Are you certain?

208
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,060
I am absolutely sure, my lord.

209
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,730
Now that Her Highness is pregnant,

210
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,160
and both husbands are still in prison,

211
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,840
with no one to care for her,

212
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,040
this situation is most inappropriate.

213
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Her Highness is carrying the Second Master's child.

214
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,330
The Second Master can be saved now.

215
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,200
But what about A Xu?

216
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,840
According to our spy's intelligence,

217
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,159
the Princess is also with child,

218
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,820
presumably Yun Lang's child.

219
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,480
Why not do them a favor?

220
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,440
Congratulations, City Lord,

221
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,170
congratulations on having an heir for Hong City.

222
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,920
City Lord.

223
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,400
The princess and the second lord have deep affection for each other.

224
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
This old servant begs the city lord

225
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,840
to release the second lord to return home

226
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,440
to accompany the princess during childbirth.

227
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,760
Otherwise,

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
just release them all.

229
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,240
The princess carries the future of Hong City.

230
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
She must not be tarnished by outside slander

231
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
and have her reputation ruined.

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,360
I believe

233
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,160
Hong City should abolish the polyandry system.

234
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,040
One wife, one husband,

235
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,680
in harmony like zither and se,

236
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,480
is the only way to ensure stability and longevity.

237
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
Her Highness is with child,

238
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,520
which is a blessing for Hong City.

239
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,240
I request that the city lord...

240
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,760
No.

241
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,280
Mother,

242
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
grant amnesty for my sister's sake.

243
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,360
Very well.

244
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,560
Jinli,

245
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
go to the prison yourself

246
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,600
and bring the father of your child

247
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,730
back to the mansion.

248
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,760
Yes.

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,220
What about the senior gentleman?

250
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,360
I'll follow your decision.

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,960
Grant amnesty to all.

252
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,400
Nanny Qian will accompany them.

253
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,240
There's still one gentleman left.

254
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,770
Give him a release document

255
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,940
and send him back to his hometown.

256
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,820
By the City Lord's decree:

257
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,520
Confiscate all of the Princess's property

258
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,400
to compensate those affected by this matter.

259
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,780
But since Your Highness is pregnant,

260
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,440
the city lord has specially permitted the child's father

261
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,360
to return home to take care of the princess.

262
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,220
Your Highness,

263
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,200
you may now take one husband

264
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,960
and leave.

265
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,520
Congratulations, brother,

266
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,650
on your newborn son.

267
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,120
Master Wei.

268
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,610
Take good care of yourself.

269
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,770
We'll come back to rescue you soon.

270
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Please, brother,

271
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,200
take care of His Highness and Jiang for me.

272
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
No need for words.

273
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,720
We understand.

274
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,000
We do.

275
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
The air in prison is bad.

276
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,880
Don't delay anymore.

277
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,810
Please, Your Highness, take everyone and go.

278
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,920
Go now.

279
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,280
Come, First Young Master.

280
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,810
Let's go.

281
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm the Second Young Master.

282
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,600
Shut up.

283
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,200
The child in my womb belongs to the First Young Master.

284
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,800
Second Young Master, please take good care of yourself.

285
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,520
Hurry up!

286
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,560
No, no, no.

287
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,050
What does this mean?

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,520
How could it possibly be his?

289
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,580
How could it be him?

290
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,920
Second Young Master,

291
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,650
take him back to Lanfeng House.

292
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,560
Whose child is this?

293
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,360
Say that again.

294
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,080
Whose child is this?

295
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,840
How could the child possibly be his?

296
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,560
What's going on?

297
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,200
Su Jinli.

298
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,640
Who does this child really belong to?

299
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Tell me clearly.

300
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,700
Explain yourself.

301
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,680
Congratulations, player.

302
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,340
Your imprisonment has ended.

303
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,720
Get out of here.

304
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,200
You.

305
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
You're yelling at me?

306
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,560
You dare yell at me?

307
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,440
So what if I yell at you?

308
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,920
Come out here right now.

309
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,200
You.

310
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,440
Come out and see if I don't beat you to death.

311
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:08,970
Come out.

312
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,640
The game enters the Lanfeng Pavilion instance.

313
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,300
There are rewards for completing the instance.

314
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,970
What Lanfeng Pavilion?

315
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,080
What instance?
