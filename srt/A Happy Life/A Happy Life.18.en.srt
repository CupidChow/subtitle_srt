1
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,640
Change position.

2
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
There's an assassin!

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,760
It's nothing.

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,440
I'm sleepy.

5
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm not tired.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,520
It's so late and still no sign of her.

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,640
She probably won't come.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,760
Let's go back to sleep.

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,760
No way.

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,640
I have a feeling

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,500
that she will definitely show up.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,640
Could it be that what you said

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,760
earlier today was too obvious

14
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,039
and she caught on?

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,440
She figured it out.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I caught on,

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,930
so I think she probably did too.

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,600
That must be because she is Zhou Mo.

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,720
Zhou Mo knows this plot point hasn't arrived yet,

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,039
the blood letter won't appear,

21
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,500
so she's not coming today.

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,800
If April is actually Zhou Mo,

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,360
why doesn't she come and reveal herself to us?

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,600
We could all work together to find a way out.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
Because she doesn't want me to get out.

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
She wants to trap me in the game

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,840
and get me killed.

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,880
Get you killed?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,530
If she controls the system,

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,060
isn't that dangerous?

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,720
So you realize that too.

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,850
Who let the system fall into her hands?

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,280
We just made up.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,600
I don't want to argue with you.

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,460
You think I want to argue with you?

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,620
I'm just playing along with her plan.

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,890
Fine, let's argue then.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,280
Enter.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,600
Mr. Mu,

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,640
your assistant prepared lunch for you.

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,900
I'll heat it up for you.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,880
Mr. Mu.

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm so sorry!

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,920
I didn't mean to.

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,520
Should I

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,760
clean this up for you?

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,120
Alright,

48
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,880
go ahead.

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,210
Thank you for your help.

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
Where did you get that food?

51
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,100
Mr. Mu gave it to me.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,320
Mr. Mu

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,400
Mu Yunfan

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,920
What's wrong?

55
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
What do you mean?

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
You asked me to make you lunch,

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,120
just to feed your pet?

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,560
You've got some nerve.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,240
No, what are you talking about?

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,840
She just...

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,100
I don't want to hear it.

62
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,440
Su Jinli.

63
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,640
Why won't you listen to my explanation?

64
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,480
Mr. Mu.

65
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,560
I just think

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,320
throwing away this food

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,280
is a bit wasteful.

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,440
Every time.

69
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,560
Every time he takes Zhou Mo's side,

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,079
that green tea bitch.

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,060
Your Highness.

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,079
Is this Zhou Mo

73
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:49,400
some kind of delicious green tea?

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,920
The outsider really knows how to preach.

75
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,600
Telling me that

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,280
she's a high-level talent who studied abroad

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
and should be valued.

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
Bullshit!

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,200
She's just turning our company

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,640
into complete chaos.

81
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,800
They say I can't tell when someone's being fake,

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
but can she?

83
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,880
Even if...

84
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,040
Even if there's nothing between her and Zhou Chen,

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,200
Zhou Chen is clearly trying to drive a wedge

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,560
between us.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,079
How could she not see that?

88
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Sorry about that.

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
Where's the lunch box?

90
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,840
Due to a small incident today,

91
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,960
you won't be able to eat it.

92
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,820
What incident?

93
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Have you eaten?

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,000
Are you hungry?

95
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,320
What would you like?

96
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
I'll go buy it for you.

97
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,320
I want

98
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,600
yogurt and muffins.

99
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,800
So specific.

100
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,080
Wait here.

101
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,409
I'll go get them for you.

102
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,210
It's Su Jinli's.

103
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,640
For you.

104
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,240
Yes.

105
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,240
Eat it.

106
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,440
Go ahead.

107
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
Is it good?

108
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,360
Mu Yunfan, what are you doing?

109
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,320
Is it good?

110
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,090
So this is the incident you mentioned.

111
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
The incident you mentioned

112
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
really surprised me.

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,840
Mu Yunfan,

114
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,880
how did you get this lunch box?

115
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
I'm fine.

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,040
Just thought it would be a waste.

117
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,880
I've decided to drop out.

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,840
That's not acceptable.

119
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,360
You're my friend.

120
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,800
Should you be forced to drop out just for giving me a gift?

121
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,440
Because

122
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

123
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,280
Did he threaten you?

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,320
No.

125
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,880
Su Jinli,

126
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,560
before you go,

127
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,440
can I have a hug?

128
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't worry.

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,250
I'll take care of it.

130
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,020
Who does Zhou Chen think he is?

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,240
He's nobody.

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,720
Do you know what kind of person he is?

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,320
Right?

134
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,840
Alright, enough of that.

135
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,440
I believe you understand me.

136
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,560
Zhou Mo, that fake girl.

137
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,640
She's always been

138
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,880
setting traps between me and Mu Yunfan,

139
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,280
trying to drive us apart.

140
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
Can't he see that?

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Three years ago,

142
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,040
he fought with me because of Zhou Chen.

143
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,960
Three years later,

144
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,520
it's because of Zhou Mo.

145
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,080
We're fighting again.

146
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,960
We can never make things right

147
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,120
and can't have any peace.

148
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,040
This Zhou Chen and Zhou Mo,

149
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,320
their names sound quite similar.

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,560
Since you both know

151
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,840
you broke up because of others' instigation,

152
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,280
why don't you reconcile?

153
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,120
Why?

154
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know why either.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,920
Ask her for me,

156
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,720
why

157
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,120
won't she make up with me?

158
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,840
It's been three years.

159
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,800
He hasn't changed at all.

160
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,640
Still as arrogant as before,

161
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,120
so conceited

162
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
and so self-centered.

163
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,140
It's because she doesn't love me enough.

164
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,160
If she loved me enough,

165
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,680
she would have dropped everything and come to me.

166
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,240
We would have reconciled long ago.

167
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
Isn't that right?

168
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,200
What's the point?

169
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,240
He doesn't care about me at all.

170
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,290
He has Zhou Mo, that fake girl, at work.

171
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
And now we're here,

172
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,040
and there's also this April showing up.

173
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,680
I don't want to make the same mistake again.

174
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,280
Absolutely not.

175
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,340
I can keep it to myself when I miss her.

176
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,360
If I say it out loud, I'll lose face.

177
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,880
Isn't that what I care about?

178
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
Can you give me this face-saving way out?

179
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,080
Can you?

180
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,600
Can you or not?

181
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,080
Come on.

182
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,520
Should I give him a

183
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,800
chance to explain?

184
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,000
You...

185
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,600
You...

186
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,440
If I love her enough,

187
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
I should also drop everything and go to her.

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,080
Actually,

189
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,880
I...

190
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,240
Nanqe told me

191
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,240
you were drinking all night yesterday too.

192
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,280
Worried about me?

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Not at all.

194
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,080
You're taking this act quite seriously.

195
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,480
It's acting.

196
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,000
If you want to fool others,

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,660
you must first fool yourself.

198
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,920
This hangover soup...

199
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,040
Did you make it?

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,920
When I was making it for myself,

201
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,850
I accidentally made an extra bowl.

202
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,900
Your Highness.

203
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,960
Luo Fan,

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,520
where have you been lately?

205
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,600
These past few days,

206
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,880
I got separated from you all.

207
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
I couldn't find the young master,

208
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,800
so I went to keep watch on the Prime Minister's residence.

209
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,640
The Prime Minister is also looking for the young master.

210
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm afraid he'll find him first.

211
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,580
Do you know where he is?

212
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,760
Can you take me to him?

213
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,360
I know his approximate location.

214
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,400
Let's go together.

215
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,280
The Prime Minister's men are everywhere now.

216
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,080
Acting rashly might not be wise.

217
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,080
What do you mean?

218
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,920
If the Prime Minister finds Wei Shixu first,

219
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,120
he'll be in even greater danger.

220
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Your Highness, that day for the young master...

221
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,280
When you sent me back to Lanfeng Pavilion,

222
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,210
did you ever worry about my safety?

223
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,320
Why should I always be the one

224
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,580
risking my life to save him over and over?

225
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,280
Mu Yunfan.

226
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,360
No.

227
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,440
How childish can you be?

228
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,500
Is this really the time to be jealous?

229
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,480
Fine.

230
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,740
If you won't go, I'll go by myself.

231
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,840
Your Highness.

232
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,760
Allow me

233
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
to accompany you to find Master Wei.

234
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,460
You were eavesdropping on us.

235
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
I was just on my way here

236
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,660
and happened to overhear.

237
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,160
If only the two of you go,

238
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm worried you might encounter danger.

239
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,880
If something were to happen,

240
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,010
how would I explain it to the City Lord?

241
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,560
How dare you use the City Lord to pressure me.

242
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
Fine.

243
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,560
Then I'll go with April.

244
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,660
Your Highness,

245
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,620
are you sure this is the place?

246
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,400
Why

247
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,930
isn't there anyone around?

248
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,040
I only remember the general location.

249
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,240
It should be somewhere around here.

250
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,570
Let's split up and look.

251
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,860
Your Highness.

252
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,640
All the roads around here look similar.

253
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,200
Why don't we go back first

254
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
and bring the Second Young Master

255
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,660
to help us identify the place?

256
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,920
You can't go three sentences without mentioning the Second Young Master.

257
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,160
Are you here to protect me

258
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,680
or to protect him?

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,860
Your Highness.

260
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,360
We should return to the mansion first.

261
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,480
What are you doing?

262
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,560
Your Highness, be careful!

263
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,760
I heard before

264
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,800
that you wanted a divorce because of Miss Jiang.

265
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,000
The First Young Master's people

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,840
must be terrified of you finding out

267
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,640
about him being with Miss Jiang.

268
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,840
And this Luo Fan

269
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,720
mentioned looking for Young Master Wei and Miss Jiang as soon as he arrived.

270
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,200
If he were really Luo Fan,

271
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,000
why would he so easily

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,060
reveal the affair between Young Master Wei and Miss Jiang in front of you?

273
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,000
In the Princess's mansion,

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,920
clever people

275
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,640
are becoming more and more common.

276
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
You're not Luo Fan.

277
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,540
Who are you really?

278
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,640
Princess, you've only just realized

279
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
isn't that a bit too late?

280
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,640
What are you doing?

281
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,080
You've repeatedly ruined the Chancellor's plans.

282
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,600
What do you think I'm going to do?
