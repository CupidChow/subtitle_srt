1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,120
Minister,

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,220
that Wei fellow has been thrown into prison.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
I've sent men to watch him secretly.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,120
Once we find an opportunity,

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,280
we'll strike immediately.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,520
That Wei Shixu

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,200
this time

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,460
won't escape for sure.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,040
Did you send someone to poison Shixu?

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,120
Well,

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,280
'Shixu'?

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,080
You're quite familiar with him.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,400
Wake up and face reality.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
He is the Princess's husband.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,400
Father, do you know

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,000
the one who really drank the Seven-Day Drunk poison

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,720
is me?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,800
What?

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,000
You?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,720
Miss,

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,680
wasn't it the Princess's husband who was poisoned?

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,320
Never mind the details now.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,680
Get a doctor!

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,920
Let me see.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,720
Are you feeling unwell anywhere else?

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,840
I'm fine.

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,200
You haven't answered my question.

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,130
Did you send someone to poison Axu?

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,880
As a dignified Prime Minister,

30
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,440
I have no grudge against him.

31
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,080
How could I possibly go to the Princess's residence to poison him?

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,960
Besides,

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,960
if the Princess was accidentally poisoned,

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,520
then

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,920
how would I explain myself to the City Lord?

36
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,080
Xiaocui,

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,640
Miss.

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,479
go prepare the medicine.

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,640
I need to take medicine to Axu in prison.

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,560
Miss,

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,640
but your father forbade you from leaving the mansion.

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,680
Axu hasn't fully recovered yet.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,600
I can't just stand by

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,120
and watch him die in prison.

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,880
Hurry up.

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,320
Your Highness.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Your Highness,

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,320
someone is stopping your carriage.

49
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,080
It's Miss Jiang.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,140
Let her in quickly.

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,600
Your Highness,

52
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,060
aren't you going to visit the two gentlemen?

53
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
Don't worry.

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,960
I will definitely get them out.

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Is this matter

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
related to my father?

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,079
You're overthinking.

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,300
This is the medicinal soup I prepared for Xu.

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Could you please take it to him?

60
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,520
No problem.

61
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,440
This is what I had

62
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,040
Xiaocui prepare at home.

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,440
But now someone has poisoned me at home.

64
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,170
Do you still want to keep hiding the truth from me?

65
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
Actually,

66
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,680
I've suspected your father too.

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,080
But there's no evidence.

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
And the Prime Minister

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
has no reason to do this.

70
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,080
Because he thinks Xu

71
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
comes from a merchant family

72
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,100
and isn't worthy of me.

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,920
I see now.

74
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,120
Your Highness,

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,440
the most urgent matter now

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,770
is to ensure the safety of both gentlemen.

77
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,540
Your Highness,

78
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
the mastermind behind this

79
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,640
must be targeting me.

80
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
You should sacrifice me.

81
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,800
That way,

82
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,460
both gentlemen and your household will be safe.

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,680
What nonsense are you talking?

84
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,040
You both belong to my household.

85
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,320
I won't let either of you go.

86
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,400
As long as I'm here,

87
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,520
you'll be safe.

88
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
Miss Jiang has prepared medicine for you.

89
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,600
Go drink it.

90
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,440
All right.

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,760
Make sure he doesn't find out

92
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,000
that we've already discovered his identity.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,529
Things will get very complicated otherwise.

94
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,840
Also,

95
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,400
the Prime Minister

96
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,660
is extremely cunning.

97
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,520
Don't deal with him directly.

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,580
He must have destroyed all evidence.

99
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,720
Definitely.

100
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,080
You must be careful.

101
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
Don't worry,

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,560
I know what to do.

103
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,000
Just do as I said.

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,600
Let's go.

105
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,400
Take care.

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
What did Her Highness just tell you?

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,680
She said

108
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,130
your medicine is poisoned.

109
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,520
What?

110
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,520
Hang in there.

111
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,960
Someone!

112
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
Help! Someone's been poisoned!

113
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,840
Get a doctor!

114
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,840
What happened?

115
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,920
It's like this.

116
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Her Highness brought a bowl of medicine earlier.

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,800
After drinking it,

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
the young master became like this.

119
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,040
Her Highness is trying to silence him!

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,500
I need to see the City Lord!

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,810
Quickly, get a doctor here!

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,920
It's alright now.

123
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,320
I've called for a doctor.

124
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,159
Doctor.

125
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,760
This young man has indeed been poisoned.

126
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,120
I'll prepare the medicine right away.

127
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,840
Good.

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
I'll personally report

129
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,320
this matter to the City Lord.

130
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,410
Are you feeling better?

131
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Why did you just falsely accuse Her Highness

132
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,480
and Miss Jiang?

133
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,760
This was her own idea.

134
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,280
You'll report to my mother

135
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
that I tried to poison both young masters

136
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
so the prison guard duty

137
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,800
can be given to your father.

138
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,920
Wouldn't that be walking into a trap?

139
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,080
The Minister has reached his current position

140
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,409
and would never shoot himself in the foot.

141
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,600
To kill Wei Shixu,

142
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,920
he has plenty of opportunities.

143
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,600
He wouldn't let someone die by his own hand.

144
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,400
Then how will Your Highness prove your innocence?

145
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,040
I am the City Lord's daughter.

146
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,700
My mother would never kill me.

147
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,800
Besides,

148
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,340
within three days,

149
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,940
I will definitely uncover the truth.

150
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,360
The Seven-Day Intoxication poison should take seven days to take effect.

151
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,420
The person died after only five days.

152
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,600
It must be the Prime Minister

153
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,960
who poisoned him before the medicine trial.

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,440
He used his own death

155
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,040
to frame us.

156
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,770
He might not have been willing either.

157
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,159
Do you have any impression of this brother and sister?

158
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
This Lady Li

159
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,680
keeps claiming she wants justice for her brother,

160
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,560
but in the end,

161
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
she just pushed him on a cart.

162
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,290
This hardly seems like deep sibling love.

163
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,480
Did he come for the medicine trial?

164
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,159
No.

165
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,920
I remember clearly.

166
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,960
Those who test the medicine will be rewarded with 3 taels of gold.

167
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,920
- Let's go test the medicine.
- Let's go test the medicine.

168
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
I don't want to test the medicine.

169
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,360
It's fine.

170
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,920
Her brother was indeed reluctant.

171
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,280
Your Highness,

172
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
are you suspecting

173
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,010
that she poisoned her brother?

174
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,720
She might not have done it herself,

175
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,520
but she's definitely not innocent in this matter.

176
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
Nange.

177
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Follow her.

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
Track her every move.

179
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,330
And report everything to me in detail.

180
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,620
Sister, you're finally here.

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,520
She went to Lanfeng Pavilion.

182
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,000
But Lanfeng Pavilion should be quite expensive.

183
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not expensive for you.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,760
But for ordinary people,

185
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,020
they can't even get in.

186
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,560
Nange.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
I remember you told me.

188
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,520
The 3 taels of gold she got from me

189
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,280
have been completely squandered.

190
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,320
Then where did she get money to visit Lanfeng House?

191
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,560
I'll investigate her financial transactions immediately.

192
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,240
Go ahead.

193
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,560
Your Highness,

194
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,290
it's exactly as you suspected.

195
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,000
I've checked her financial records

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
and found someone gave her a large sum of money.

197
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,640
According to this person,

198
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,960
someone ordered him to bribe Sister Li

199
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,320
to falsely accuse Your Highness.

200
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,800
This is the money I recovered

201
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,040
from the gambling house and Lanfeng House.

202
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,800
Among these,

203
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,290
there's actually government silver.

204
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,000
But what's the difference between

205
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,520
official silver and regular silver?

206
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Official silver is more skillfully crafted

207
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,250
than privately minted silver.

208
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,700
The ore quality is better too.

209
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,320
That's why official silver

210
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,380
has more luster than regular silver.

211
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,920
Xiao Yangyang,

212
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,520
why did you come so suddenly?

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,960
Your Highness,

214
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,160
you caused such a big disaster

215
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,800
just to save me.

216
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
And I've dragged Xu and Young Master Yun into this too.

217
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,480
I must help Your Highness find out

218
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
who exactly is trying to harm you.

219
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,840
No.

220
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,880
Why not?

221
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,680
Because the one who framed me is your father.

222
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,920
Because you've just recovered from a serious illness.

223
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,720
You need to rest.

224
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,840
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

225
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,000
Identifying silver coins

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,360
isn't strenuous at all.

227
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,120
When I was little, my father taught me that

228
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,520
our Hongcheng official silver,

229
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
when distributed as salary to officials,

230
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,920
each official

231
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,650
gets coins with unique identification numbers.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
This number...

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
It seems to be my father's.
