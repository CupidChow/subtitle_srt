1
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,570
What's going on?

2
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,560
No way.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,040
I actually got together with Mu Yunfan,

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,840
and I made the first move.

5
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,160
How embarrassing.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,160
No.

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,690
I'll never acknowledge it even if it kills me.

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,360
Good morning, Your Highness.

9
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,020
Good morning, Your Highness.

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,480
What are you all doing?

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,520
Waiting for Your Highness to wake up

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,850
to serve you, of course.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
Why is Your Highness up so early today?

14
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,520
You usually sleep until midday.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,800
A working person's body clock.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,800
What clock?

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
They're all mine.

18
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,920
Is this

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,480
Xiangyunsha fabric?

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,160
And these pearls are so big.

21
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,640
Could these be

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,800
the legendary South Sea pearls?

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,650
Yes, they are South Sea pearls.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,820
Your Highness.

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,680
You have pearls by the handful.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,479
I've never seen you

27
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,140
so interested in them before.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,960
By the handful.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,520
I'm so rich.

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,160
Of course.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,039
Your Highness is the city lord's only daughter

32
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,240
with immense wealth.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,860
Specifically,

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,860
how much money did it cost?

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,450
I'll have Manager Li report to you right away.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,199
All of these

37
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,520
belong to me.

38
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
This is just a portion.

39
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
Your Highness has been granted 300 households,

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,880
10,000 taels of gold,

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,480
and 100,000 taels of silver.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
According to your salary and estate profits,

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,940
you'll receive hundreds of thousands more each month.

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,440
Getting rich overnight

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,079
feels exactly like this.

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,360
My goodness!

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,050
Could this be porcelain from Jingdezhen?

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,360
These are antiques!

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,160
If I could take these back with me,

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,200
I'd be rich beyond measure.

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,680
20 million.

52
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
40 million.

53
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
60 million.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Second Master served well in my chambers last night.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,060
Reward him with ten taels of gold.

56
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,380
Your Highness.

57
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,260
You truly care for Second Master.

58
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,280
Keep him confined in the Princess's mansion.

59
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,400
Without my permission,

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,000
he is not allowed to take even one step outside.

61
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,660
Let's go shopping.

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,160
I'll take this one,

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,220
wrap it up, please.

64
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,079
This one too.

65
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,680
This one,

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,480
I'll take one.

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,660
I want this as well.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,100
I'll have this one.

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,940
This entire shelf,

70
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,210
wrap everything up.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,600
Okay.

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,720
Come take a look!

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,780
Please have a look.

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,340
There's more here.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
More over here.

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,940
Take another look.

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,720
Men who are soaking wet

78
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,080
are the most attractive.

79
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,620
She really is Su Jinli.

80
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,080
Congratulations, player, for completing the wedding night

81
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,140
and winning Princess Jinli's favor.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,680
This is the reward issued by the system.

83
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,370
Where's my gold?

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,240
What

85
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,280
is this thing?

86
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,960
Poison.

87
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,440
Poison?

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
Why are you giving me poison?

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,440
You don't expect me

90
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,360
to use this poison

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
to kill Su Jinli, do you?

92
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,920
The rewards are random.

93
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,200
I don't know how to use it either.

94
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
Figure it out yourself.

95
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,900
You don't know either?

96
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,890
Can't you be more reliable?

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,570
What do you want me to do?

98
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,000
What is this?

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
Please continue your efforts

100
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,720
to make the Princess despise

101
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,040
and divorce Wei Shixu

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,970
to complete the ultimate mission.

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,720
I refuse

104
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
unless you tell me

105
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,680
if she really is Su Jinli.

106
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,900
Say something!

107
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
Answer me!

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,280
The player has three months

109
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,320
to complete the happy ending mission for the main couple.

110
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,400
Failure or premature breakup of the couple

111
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,260
will cause the blood line to extend to your heart, resulting in death.

112
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,000
Wait,

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
what do you mean by 'resulting in death'?

114
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,980
Explain this clearly!

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,010
Is anyone there?

116
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,800
Hello?

117
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,570
What does this mean?

118
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,680
Come back

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,400
and explain this!

120
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
Where are you?

121
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,580
Your Highness,

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm Wei Lang.

123
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,400
I've brought you

124
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,200
your favorite sour jujube cake.

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,540
She's not here.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
Then I'll just put these snacks inside and leave.

127
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,800
Wait.

128
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,600
She's not even here.

129
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
Barging in

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,460
wouldn't be appropriate.

131
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
Then I'll go find her.

132
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
You know where she is?

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,880
I went to great lengths

134
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,960
to win Her Highness's favor at the pleasure house.

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,880
How could you just enter the residence

136
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,140
and forget Her Highness's preferences?

137
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,860
Lanfeng Pavilion.

138
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,580
Your Highness.

139
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Now this is living!

140
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
Your Highness,

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,659
you've finally come to see me.

142
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,680
Today,

143
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,360
are you here to take me to the Princess's mansion?

144
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,360
You have no idea

145
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
how much I think about you every day.

146
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
I'm going crazy missing you.

147
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,440
Who are you?

148
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,900
Your Highness,

149
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,480
have you forgotten?

150
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,400
This is the love token you gave me.

151
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,080
You promised to come to me.

152
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,490
So she's a dancer the original owner often flirted with.

153
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I remember.

154
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,460
I've been thinking about you.

155
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,480
Oh no.

156
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
System settings:

157
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,600
my fate

158
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,660
is to die from excessive indulgence.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,460
I don't have a mission now.

160
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,210
If I die, I can't get out of here.

161
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,120
Come.

162
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,919
No, no.

163
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,799
I absolutely cannot indulge in excess.

164
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,400
I can't take any more lovers.

165
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,740
Do you put chili in your desserts?

166
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,560
Get your cook here.

167
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,880
Quickly. Call them over.

168
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
Why is it you?

169
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,520
Not just the Second Young Master.

170
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,250
I'm here too.

171
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,460
Your Highness.

172
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,240
The candied peach blossoms aren't good.

173
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,170
Try my mung bean pastries instead.

174
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,080
Who told you to come here?

175
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,660
Lanfeng Pavilion.

176
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,040
This awful woman.

177
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,120
Lanfeng Pavilion is my brother's territory.

178
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,580
Too bad you can't go today.

179
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,290
Because Manager Li said

180
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,970
you've been grounded by His Highness.

181
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,400
Whoa.

182
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,880
I'll go ahead first.

183
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,810
Let's go together then.

184
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,400
Get down.

185
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,120
Let me go.
