1
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,840
So cute.

2
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,240
Miss me?

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,360
I did.

4
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,160
Do you want to come over?

5
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,040
Why is it her again?

6
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,079
April.

7
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,040
It's so late.

8
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,720
What business do you have with Her Highness?

9
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,980
She's already asleep.

10
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,520
Is she asleep?

11
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
But I can see

12
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,160
the light is still on in Her Highness's room.

13
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,680
Look.

14
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,920
I told you.

15
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,120
She's already asleep.

16
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,160
If you have anything to discuss,

17
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,290
come back tomorrow.

18
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,240
It's me.

19
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,160
She's gone now.

20
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,330
Come in quickly.

21
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,079
Miss.

22
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:26,960
I beg you, miss,

23
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,490
please take your medicine.

24
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,320
She still refuses to eat.

25
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,810
Has she taken the medicine prescribed by the doctor?

26
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,440
No.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,079
The doctor instructed

28
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,079
that she must take this medicine every day without fail.

29
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,540
But I simply cannot persuade the young miss.

30
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Yang'er,

31
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,720
be good

32
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,650
and take your medicine.

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Father,

34
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,600
where is Axu?

35
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,680
Father,

36
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,840
please allow me to be with Axu.

37
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,399
He will divorce the princess.

38
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
What does a divorce matter?

39
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,440
You are the legitimate daughter of the Prime Minister's family.

40
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
Even the city lord's son would be a suitable match for you.

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,840
Wei Shixu is just a divorced merchant.

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,770
What qualifications does he have?

43
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
If Father doesn't agree,

44
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,970
I will neither eat nor drink

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,560
until you approve.

46
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,400
You're relying on your father's love for you

47
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
to be this willful?

48
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,360
Let me tell you,

49
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,170
this matter is different from before.

50
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,520
If you don't want to eat,

51
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,250
then starve.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,530
When you faint from hunger,

53
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,330
I'll have someone feed you.

54
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,720
In this life,

55
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,900
I will marry no one but Axu.

56
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,040
If Father insists on stopping me

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,440
then I have no choice but to die.

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,080
Miss!

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,480
Yang'er, how could you do this

60
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,520
to yourself in front of your father?

61
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,120
Xiaoyi,

62
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,320
quickly get a doctor!

63
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,680
You must go to Miss's room

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,320
and hide anything

65
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,980
that could be used as a weapon.

66
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,120
If anything happens to her,

67
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,480
you'll follow her to the grave.

68
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,560
Minister.

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
Father, why won't you allow

70
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,159
Axu and me to be together?

71
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,920
If it were just about social status,

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,890
you wouldn't be so determined against it.

73
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
Now Axu is in Father's hands.

74
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,240
Xiaocui,

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,520
send a signal to His Highness.

76
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,640
Yes, Miss.

77
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,290
How many of your Wei family remnants are left?

78
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Did you get the secret letter or not?

79
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
Won't talk?

80
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Keep beating him!

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,720
Enough.

82
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
If you tell me the truth,

83
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
I'll spare your life.

84
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,890
What about for Yang's sake?

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,400
This bottle contains the Water of Forgetfulness.

86
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,680
It makes people forget their hatred.

87
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,800
I know

88
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,160
you and Yang have deep feelings for each other.

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,960
If you reveal your accomplices,

90
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,800
this Water of Forgetfulness

91
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,640
will be yours.

92
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,640
You can forget the past

93
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,840
and live happily with Yang.

94
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,040
How about it?

95
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,200
I'll talk.

96
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Good.

97
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,680
Come closer.

98
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,520
I'll tell you.

99
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,320
They...

100
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,920
They are

101
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,840
in the suburbs at...

102
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,120
Traitor Jiang!

103
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
I'll die before I tell you anything!

104
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,560
You.

105
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,560
April has been watching me so closely.

106
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,640
You can't deny she's interested in you.

107
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
That's possible.

108
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,520
Why are you on my bed?

109
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,480
Get off now.

110
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,640
Didn't you say she likes me?

111
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm your man.

112
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,860
You need to protect me.

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,240
If you sleep here, where do I sleep?

114
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,720
You haven't even taken off your shoes.

115
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,640
Together.

116
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,840
Help me take them off.

117
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,800
Get off.

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,840
Hurry up.

119
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,799
Alright.

120
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,460
If we keep making noise, Manager Li will hear us.

121
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,679
Fine.

122
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,010
Then sleep by yourself.

123
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,360
Dream on.

124
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,490
You really think you can sleep with me?

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,040
Oh no.

126
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Something's happened to Yangyang.

127
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,240
Who are you?

128
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,520
I am a tutor from the City Lord's mansion.

129
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,480
The City Lord has urgent matters to discuss with the Prime Minister.

130
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Please come to the mansion tonight.

131
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,560
If you don't believe me,

132
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,300
here is the City Lord's token.

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
You recognize it, don't you?

134
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Since this is the City Lord's order,

135
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,560
I,

136
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
will go with you.

137
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,560
Xiaocui,

138
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
have you taken care of the doorman?

139
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,200
It's all taken care of.

140
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
But, Miss,

141
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,000
we've only put out one lamp.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,330
Will His Highness come?

143
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,680
He will definitely come.

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,000
Yanyang.

145
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,840
Your Highness,

146
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,570
you're here.

147
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,800
What's going on?

148
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,040
Father locked Xu in the dark room

149
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,570
and I heard he was tortured.

150
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,080
What should we do now?

151
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
Hurry, take us there.

152
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,620
But there are guards in the dark room.

153
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,420
How do you plan to rescue him, Your Highness?

154
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,920
Well,

155
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,050
I need you to cooperate with me.

156
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,280
How

157
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,970
should I cooperate?

158
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,880
How did you break in here?

159
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,560
Miss!

160
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,160
Release Wei Shixu right now

161
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
or I'll kill her.

162
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,640
Do as I say

163
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,880
or else.

164
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,280
Are you trying to get me killed?

165
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Hurry up and do what she says.

166
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,560
Release Wei Shixu!

167
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,320
But the minister instructed us

168
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,800
to keep Wei Shixu under strict supervision.

169
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,040
Is my life more important

170
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,200
or my father's orders?

171
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,130
Release him now.

172
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,240
You won't comply?

173
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
I'll count to three.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,280
If you don't release him,

175
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,240
I'll kill her.

176
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,760
Your Highness,

177
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,690
stab me quickly.

178
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,690
Otherwise he won't believe you'd really kill me.

179
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,760
Hurry!

180
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,200
Fine.

181
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,210
Don't hurt the lady.

182
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,280
We'll release him right now.

183
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,160
Hurry up!

184
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,640
Slow down.

185
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,300
Tie yourselves up.

186
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,920
Minister!

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,640
Minister!

188
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,840
It's terrible!

189
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,480
The Chancellor has returned.

190
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,360
Let's go through the back door.

191
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,820
Someone is waiting for us.

192
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,320
Minister!

193
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
