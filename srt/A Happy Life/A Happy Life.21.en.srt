1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,320
Go! Go! Go!

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,720
Get him! Get him! Get him!

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,760
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,680
Your Highness! Your Highness!

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,520
Yang'er

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,040
Where are you taking this thief?

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,900
Wei Shi Hoon is my prime minister.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,490
How could the Prime Minister call him a thief?

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,000
Your Highness, you don't know.

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,800
This man took Yang'er and escaped.

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,920
I've been looking for him for days to get him back.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm teaching him a lesson for His Highness.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,720
If my Prime Minister really did something wrong,

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,240
it's also my matter.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,320
I’ll take it back and deal with it.

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,920
Don’t bother.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,480
Let’s go.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,560
Your Highness is a smart man.

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
Why would you fight with me

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,320
for a sinner?

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,620
What if I must take him away today?

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,800
Then...

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,880
Let's go. Let's go.

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,280
Father.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,080
Let Mr. Wei go.

26
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,120
Give it to me.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,800
Protect His Highness and Yang'er.

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Do it!

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

30
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,960
Master Yun.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,920
You are a dog servant bought by my Prime Minister.

32
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,400
How dare you?

33
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,360
Of course not only me.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,960
All the troops of Princess’s Mansion are here.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,520
The princess is in danger.

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,200
Surround the Prime Minister's mansion.

37
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,040
Hurry!

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,770
Come on. Come on.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,560
It seems that someone is up to no good.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,520
Prime Minister,

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,040
Are you really going against us?

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,360
I

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,079
want to be your enemy.

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,720
If you want to take your husband away,

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
I have no reason to interfere.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,560
It's just that...

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Yang'er.

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,800
Leave.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,079
I'll stay with Father.

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,280
But...

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,480
Prime Minister loves his daughter so much.

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,540
I won't punish her.

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,440
Let's go.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
You...

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,800
You...

56
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,079
How could you kill someone in my mansion?

57
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,410
He killed His Highness.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,300
He should have died last time.

59
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,440
If you don't believe me,

60
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,120
you can go to the City Governor's mansion and ask Miss Sawol.

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,079
What?

62
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,280
He murdered His Highness.

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
How dare you!

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,480
You should be cut into pieces.

65
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,280
You deserve to die.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,890
Prime Minister.

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,880
Take care.

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,880
Our family is so poor.

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,480
Why are there so many people?

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,760
Hurry up.

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,960
Order more.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,120
Second husband said

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
the more torches you light,

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,440
the more people.

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,920
Butler Li.

76
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,800
Are you kidding me?

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,200
Do you think you can be with him

78
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,920
you can be with him?

79
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,680
I dare not expect to be with him.

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,680
As long as he's alive.

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,840
You...

82
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,480
Father.

83
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
What happened between you and Wei Shi-wook?

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,200
between you and Wei Shi Xu?

85
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Why did you insist on detaining him?

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,480
You don't need to know.

87
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
Father.

88
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,480
Just tell me.

89
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,250
[My mother died early.]

90
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,920
My daughter

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,280
was brought up by you.

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,680
Between my father and Wei Shi Xu,

93
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,240
I will choose my father.

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,600
Just tell me.

95
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,280
Yang'er.

96
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,920
I brought you up.

97
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,160
So I love you so much.

98
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,400
As long as you like it,

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,240
I

100
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,600
try my best to satisfy you.

101
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,280
But this time,

102
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,920
I won't allow you

103
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,640
with him anymore.

104
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,880
If you care about me,

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,400
don't ask anything.

106
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,880
If Wei Shi-wook joins hands with the princess,

107
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,280
it will be my biggest threat.

108
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
Huh?

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
It should go well today.

110
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,080
Why did the Prime Minister come back suddenly?

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,660
Your Highness.

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,040
What's going on? She's here.

113
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,680
She...

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,440
She lied to us.

115
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,760
and almost killed us.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,890
She's a spy sent by the Prime Minister.

117
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,920
Nange.

118
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
Catch her!

119
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,880
Wait! Wait!

120
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,040
She's hurt.

121
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,400
At least give her time

122
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
to explain.

123
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,920
According to what Second Minister said,

124
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,960
according to the Second Prime Minister's order.

125
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,480
to send the Prime Minister away.

126
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
I don't know why

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,159
suspected me.

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,920
He even detained me and tied me up.

129
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,159
I want to tell Your Highness.

130
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,080
I tried my best

131
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,520
to escape.

132
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,160
Another trick.

133
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,290
Can you change another move next time?

134
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,200
I'm telling the truth.

135
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,010
If you don't believe me,

136
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
I'll leave.

137
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
Come back!

138
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
Master Rong has said

139
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,560
April can be trusted.

140
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,290
Why do you keep suspecting her?

141
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,200
Then why do you always protect her?

142
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,600
I'm not protecting her.

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,240
You...

144
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,960
Can you stop being so childish?

145
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
I’m childish?

146
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,480
Haven’t you heard that Princess Jinli is arrogant and domineering?

147
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,210
How dare you protect another woman in front of me?

148
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,360
Nange!

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
Drive my second husband out.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,240
From now on,

151
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,440
he is no longer a member of my mansion.

152
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,000
No.

153
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,360
Su Jin Li.

154
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,320
Are you serious?

155
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,360
Yes.

156
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,240
Second husband.

157
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,280
Please.

158
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,080
Okay.

159
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,520
I promise.

160
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,600
Your Highness.

161
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,880
Second husband.

162
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,800
really loves you.

163
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,760
Of course.

164
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,000
So,

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,920
you drove away

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,840
who can protect you.

167
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,200
You're really stupid.

168
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,480
What did you sprinkle on me?

169
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,740
This is heart-wrestling powder.

170
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,640
You really work for the Prime Minister.

171
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,480
Master Rong went to Longhu Mountain to burn incense.

172
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,840
How could he have time to look for me?

173
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,320
That's a hasty excuse.

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,760
You're smart.

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,290
You used a blood letter to lure me to give myself away.

176
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,320
Unfortunately,

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,280
I’m more cautious than you think.

178
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,080
That day, the fake Luo Fan wanted to kill me.

179
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,840
Why did you protect me?

180
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,400
Your Highness.

181
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,480
If he hadn't been with you,

182
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,840
if he hadn't been with you,

183
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,240
I've succeeded long ago.

184
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,600
Now,

185
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
he's gone.

186
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,480
no one can save you.

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,440
Tell me.

188
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,900
where is General Wei's blood letter hidden?

189
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,320
It's in Wei Shi Xu's shop.

190
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,080
Tomorrow,

191
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,000
take me to find the letter.

192
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Okay?

193
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,920
Kill yourself.

194
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,720
She was poisoned by my heart-holding Powder.

195
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
She can't lie.

196
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,280
Cut the crap.

197
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,960
Hand over the letter.

198
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,340
Your Highness.

199
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,960
Why is that?

200
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,880
His Highness was poisoned by my heart-wrenching Powder.

201
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
You only listen to me now.

202
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,160
Who are you?

203
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,690
You don't need to know that.

204
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,320
Mr. Wei.

205
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,080
The guard beside you

206
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,760
hasn't shown up for a long time.

207
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,320
This sword...

208
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,400
looks familiar?

209
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,610
Luo Fan is in your hands.

210
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,280
If you want him alive,

211
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,940
hand over the letter of blood.

212
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,240
You're smart.

213
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,560
Sure.

214
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,120
Sure.

215
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,560
It's you.

216
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,880
Ji Wook.

217
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,120
Are you surprised?

218
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,400
After all,

219
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,200
I should thank Her Highness for saving you.

220
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,760
She broke the trap

221
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,400
that I could come up with this idea.

222
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,960
to get this letter.

223
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,640
So,

224
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,000
this is all your plan.

225
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,200
No one will come after us.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,960
Really?

227
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,890
As long as I can solve your problem,

228
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,480
the Wei family's case

229
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,720
will be settled.

230
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,320
Many people

231
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,600
have nothing to worry about.

232
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,840
So,

233
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,680
it was you

234
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,140
who sowed discord between us.

235
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,880
and got our Wei Troop killed?

236
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
No.

237
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
Not only me.

238
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,120
All civil officials joined forces to embezzle military pay.

239
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,280
has something on Wei Troop.

240
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,800
If

241
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,840
I didn't go ahead,

242
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,560
Do you think those people

243
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
will let you go?
