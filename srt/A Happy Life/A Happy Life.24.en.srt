1
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,420
Your Highness.

2
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,960
Your Highness, you're awake.

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,840
Your Highness.

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,900
Someone come here!

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,680
His Highness is awake!

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,760
Your Highness.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,880
Your Highness, you've really woken up.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,940
You scared this old servant to death.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,440
Where is the Second Minister?

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,480
The Second Minister only instructed us to watch over you.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
He said

12
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,140
he would find a way to save you.

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,800
Thank heavens.

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,000
The Second Minister is truly amazing.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,130
He brought Your Highness back to life.

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,820
Your Highness.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,640
I guessed right.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,280
You scared me to death.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,400
I thought you abandoned me

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
and left by yourself.

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,160
How could that be possible?

22
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,820
We agreed to go back together.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
Please tell Miss Jiang

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,260
Wei Shixu is here to visit.

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,560
Weiyang.

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,479
I brought your favorite snacks.

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't ask to see her.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Just let me deliver these things.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,880
Stop yelling.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,520
You don't care about your reputation,

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,680
but my young lady does.

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,480
Young man,

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,410
please help me deliver this to her.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,290
Please help.

35
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,840
Sir,

36
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,520
my young master is a bit simple-minded.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,050
Please don't take offense.

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,920
Here,

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,240
take this.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,600
Thank you for your understanding.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,730
That's more like it.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,290
Give it to me.

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,320
You're not dead.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,930
Where have you been?

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,440
I'm alive.

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,320
Where did you go?

47
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,450
I don't know either.

48
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,960
You...

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,880
why did you call me a fool?

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
I was just telling the truth.

51
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,960
Then how can I win Miss Jiang back?

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,720
Well...

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,850
I don't know either.

54
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,500
But that servant just said

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,810
his mistress cares about her dignity.

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,760
Dignity?

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,400
Look.

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,920
Kneeling for a day and night.

59
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,290
You wanted to see me?

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,880
What is it?

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,329
This is the jade pendant my mother left me.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,460
She told me to give it to the woman I love most.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
This pendant...

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Wasn't it left at Lanfeng House?

65
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,120
My master

66
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,250
sold everything he owned to redeem it.

67
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,480
If you don't accept him,

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,160
he'll end up homeless.

69
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,840
Shut up.

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,800
It's the truth.

71
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,120
Then I'll keep

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,440
this thing for now.

73
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,920
You're homeless now.

74
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,579
How can you give me happiness?

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,060
Money is just a material possession.

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,540
I will earn it back.

77
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,400
Then come back

78
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
when you're capable.

79
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,770
Will you wait for me?

80
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,840
My lady isn't greedy for money.

81
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,840
She's just testing your sincerity.

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
I am sincere!

83
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
I think you

84
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,460
need to try harder.

85
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,320
Cui,

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,580
please give me some guidance.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
Luo Fan,

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,530
what are you doing here?

89
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,200
He's been here all along.

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,440
Congratulations, player,

91
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,920
you've completed the game.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,600
So the system was with you all along.

93
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,570
You're back.

95
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,920
You're awake.

96
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,920
You scared me to death.

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,960
I thought I'd never see you again.

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,560
You're the one who scared me.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
You're the one who scared me.

100
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,720
No way.

101
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,720
Outside,

102
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
people are watching.

103
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,920
Zhou Chen

104
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,160
Zhou Chen

105
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,280
has already gone abroad for work

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,540
and is doing very well.

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,730
You're looking for him too?

108
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,960
And I've made up my mind.

109
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,920
From now on,

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,080
I won't let anyone

111
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,320
come between us.

112
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,320
What about Zhou Mo?

113
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,480
Zhou Mo has already left the company.

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,240
I fired her.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,130
That's more like it.

116
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,320
Tanghulu!

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,960
Sweet and sour candied hawthorns!

118
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,640
Tanghulu.

119
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:03,920
There's tanghulu over there.

120
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Want one?

121
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,770
They're delicious.

122
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,040
Sure.

123
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
Young man,

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
Her Highness has taken a liking to you.

125
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,290
Come with me to the mansion.

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,720
Please tell the princess

127
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,600
I am Jiang Weiyang from the Prime Minister's residence.

128
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,659
A-Xu belongs to me,

129
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,080
and he can't go with her.

130
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
You dare to defy Her Highness's orders?

131
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,360
Hong City has laws.

132
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,200
If today

133
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,920
you forcibly take Master Wei away,

134
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,880
I will file a complaint at the City Lord's mansion.

135
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,440
Miss,

136
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,730
do as you please.

137
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,040
Enough.

138
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Consider that I,

139
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,160
the princess, have made a friend today.

140
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,220
Let him go with her.

141
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,520
Let's go.

142
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,980
Jiang Weiyang.

143
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,740
Thank you, Your Highness.

144
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,559
That shop looks nice.

145
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,620
Let's check it out.

146
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,160
This young man is quite handsome.

147
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,640
We've broken one million!

148
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,120
Look!

149
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
That's amazing!

150
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
I'm so excited!

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,720
One hundred!

152
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,040
Great!

153
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,570
Our reservations have exceeded one million.

154
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,520
Congratulations, everyone.

155
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,000
We've exceeded our target.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,720
Mr. Mu is treating everyone to afternoon tea.

157
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,050
Everyone come get some!

158
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

159
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,360
What's going on?

160
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
Nothing for me?

161
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,490
You have a special gift.

162
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,120
Jinli.

163
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,180
Congratulations.

164
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Congratulations.

165
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,020
Congratulations.

166
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,920
Congratulations.

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,980
Congratulations.

168
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,360
Jinli.

169
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,650
I'm really grateful for this game.

170
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
It allowed us

171
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,160
to meet again,

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,020
fall in love again,

173
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,060
and cleared up our past misunderstandings.

174
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
Every day I spend with you

175
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
makes me incredibly happy.

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,520
I hope

177
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,920
that in the future, we can continue

178
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,380
on this journey together.

179
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,740
I want to share your happiness

180
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,840
and your sorrows.

181
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
So...

182
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,680
Su Jinli,

183
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,080
will you marry me?

184
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,240
Marry him.

185
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,120
I do.
