1
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,680
What are you doing?

2
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,040
You've repeatedly ruined the Chancellor's plans.

3
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,840
What do you think I'm going to do?

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,000
Watch out!

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,060
What are you doing?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,960
April!

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,000
April!

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,640
Are you all right?

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,440
Dr. Liu,

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,700
the patient is inside.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,820
Your Highness,

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
why are you here?

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,280
Dr. Liu,

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,740
please prescribe medicine for her quickly.

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Come, miss.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,060
Please have a seat.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
If the knife had been half an inch off

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,410
it would have damaged the tendons.

19
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,240
Doctor,

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,680
can she be treated?

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,480
Yes, she can.

22
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,240
I

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,100
will go prepare the medicine now.

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,140
That was too close.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,800
Don't you find this suspicious?

26
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,759
With her skills,

27
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,690
she couldn't defeat a fake Luo Fan?

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,200
What are you implying?

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you saying

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,300
she deliberately let him escape?

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,880
Exactly.

32
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,200
Stop overthinking.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,440
You can't be prejudiced against her

34
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,440
just because she looks like Zhou Mo.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm prejudiced against her?

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,440
What do you mean?

37
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,800
Didn't the doctor just say

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,260
that knife was dangerous?

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,240
But she's fine, isn't she?

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,120
She almost wasn't, was she?

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,600
Doesn't this prove her martial arts are superior?

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Am I wrong?

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,800
I saw everything.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,880
Before I appeared,

45
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,680
she jumped out to save you first.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
Stop targeting her.

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
I'm not.

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,460
Your Highness.

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
A secret message from the city lord.

50
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,320
Jinli,

51
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,880
I have made arrangements regarding the Prime Minister.

52
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,520
Be careful

53
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,079
and don't act rashly.

54
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,120
Miss April can be trusted.

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,880
If there's an emergency,

56
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,520
you may consult with her.

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,720
It seems

58
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,560
I misunderstood her.

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,720
Now you can rest easy.

60
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,800
Alright,

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
let's go to sleep.

62
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,880
Minister,

63
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,920
we've located the young lady's approximate whereabouts.

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,120
In just a few days,

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,760
we'll be able to bring her back.

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,680
What have you found out about Yunlang?

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,320
Yunlang's background is clean.

68
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,760
He was originally a young beggar

69
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,840
who ended up in the pleasure quarters due to his good looks.

70
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,240
He has no one backing him.

71
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,760
His biggest supporters

72
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,020
are only the Princess and your daughter.

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,520
Minister,

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,660
I've discovered another piece of information.

75
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,160
Why are you hesitating?

76
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Before General Wei died,

77
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,560
he wrote a letter in his own blood

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,520
and sealed it inside the Wushuang sword.

79
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,320
He intended for his confidant to deliver the sword to the City Lord.

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,440
But his confidant was also gravely injured

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,560
and before reaching the capital,

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
died from his wounds.

83
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,200
Later, the Wushuang sword found its way to the marketplace

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,000
and eventually came into the Princess's possession.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,320
Wei Shixu entered the Princess's household

86
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,180
just to obtain that blood letter.

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,960
This matter implicates half of the civil officials in court.

88
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,480
We cannot let him get the blood letter,

89
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,000
nor can we let Yang'er know about this matter.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
I understand.

91
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,170
We will bring the young lady back as soon as possible.

92
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,970
How are you feeling?

93
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,409
At least this counts as some exercise.

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
If only

95
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,720
we could stay like this forever.

96
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,960
Don't talk nonsense.

97
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,900
Your wound will heal soon,

98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,520
and we can go back.

99
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,720
Axu,

100
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,840
do you think

101
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
life here

102
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
isn't good?

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,930
I'll get your medicine.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I can do it myself.

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Why don't you help Mrs. Zhang with cooking?

106
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,360
Okay.

107
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,159
I'll go then.

108
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,320
Weiyang

109
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,450
Watch out, it's hot.

110
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,180
What are you doing?

111
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,820
Why did you pour out the medicine?

112
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,480
Xu, let me explain.

113
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,980
Don't you want your wound to heal?

114
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,080
I just feel that...

115
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,680
The time we've spent here

116
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,740
has been so wonderful,

117
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
like a dream.

118
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,040
I just want to stay with you a little longer.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,600
But Your Highness...

120
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,840
They risked their lives for me.

121
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,600
And Luo Fan...

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,360
He stayed behind to cover for me.

123
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,780
I don't even know how he is now.

124
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,880
Weiyang.

125
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,280
We can't be this selfish.

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,280
Xu.

127
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
If His Highness and the others

128
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,600
weren't in danger,

129
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,170
would you be willing to stay here with me forever?

130
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,880
Where are you going?

131
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
Dinner's ready.

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,040
My wife went out and hasn't returned yet.

133
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,240
I'm worried something happened to her.

134
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
Then let's go find her quickly.

135
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,560
Around here, once night falls,

136
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
wild animals come out.

137
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,040
It's very dangerous.

138
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,400
I'll go with you.

139
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,160
It's so late.

140
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,360
Where are you going?

141
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,160
Miss Jiang hasn't returned yet.

142
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm going with Mr. Wei to find her.

143
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,760
On my way back,

144
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,960
I saw a shoe.

145
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,520
It looks like Miss Jiang's.

146
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,600
Weiyang!

147
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,800
Mr. Wei.

148
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
It's now

149
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,520
when wild animals are active.

150
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,600
You can't go out.

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,660
There are wild animals out there.

152
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,560
What if she's in danger?

153
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,970
If she gets killed by wild animals,

154
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,520
what will I do?

155
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,720
How can I not save her?

156
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,840
Mr. Wei.

157
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,880
I know you two are deeply in love.

158
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,480
But...

159
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,400
If you can't save her

160
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,000
and lose your life too,

161
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
it wouldn't be worth it.

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,300
Then I'll go to be with her.

163
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,170
I will never leave her alone again.

164
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,320
Mr. Wei!

165
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,120
Xu!

166
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,720
She's back!

167
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,520
Yes.

168
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,480
It's good that you're back.

169
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,200
Yes.

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,960
Are you alright?

171
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm fine.

172
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Really, I'm fine.

173
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,360
I'm truly fine.

174
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Where did you go?

175
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,850
I heard animal noises earlier.

176
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,400
I got scared,

177
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,840
so I ran away

178
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,560
and lost my shoe.

179
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,480
Look.

180
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,080
I just picked some wild vegetables over there.

181
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,600
They're so fresh.

182
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,040
I'm glad you're safe.

183
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,080
Really, I'm fine.

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,610
Are you feeling better?

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,880
Xu.

186
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,840
What you said earlier,

187
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,080
was it all true?

188
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,520
If I'm gone.

189
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,600
You,

190
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,560
Weiyang.

191
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,960
Actually, you mean more to me

192
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,320
than you could imagine.

193
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,240
Let's go.

194
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,330
By the Chancellor's order,

195
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
take the young lady back.

196
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
Wei Shixu,

197
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,580
capture him alive.

198
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,920
I dare any of you to touch him.

199
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,560
Miss,

200
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,000
forgive me.

201
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,880
Shixu,

202
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
take the young lady back.
