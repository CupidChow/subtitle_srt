1
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,360
So sweet!

2
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,760
I want some more.

3
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,200
No way.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm not...

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,160
Su Jinli, you must be starving.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,020
You're eating anything in sight.

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,680
Nange.

8
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,560
Why is it you?

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
Yes, it's me, Your Highness.

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,050
I was here all night taking care of you.

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,240
You bastard!

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,039
Letting me lie on the floor for so long.

13
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,760
Nange.

14
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,960
Arrest the Second Young Master.

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,560
Make him scrub all the toilets

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,039
in our princess's mansion.

17
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:29,920
Well...

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,080
What's wrong?

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,080
Your Highness,

20
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,680
the Second Young Master ran away this morning.

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,960
Ran away?

22
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,640
Didn't I order him confined?

23
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,320
Can't our mansion even keep watch over one person?

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,160
Please calm down, Your Highness.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,090
Manager Li has already sent people to search for him.

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
Why did he leave?

27
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,160
We don't know why he left,

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,479
but the Second Young Master said

29
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,680
he'll return if you copy the Women's Code ten times.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,880
Then he'll come back.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
Copy the Women's Code?

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,000
Ridiculous!

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Does he think I'll do whatever he says?

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,920
Who does he think he is?

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,650
I've been too lenient with him.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,700
Your Highness,

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,120
I think this Second Young Master is getting too arrogant.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,760
Yesterday he even offended Manager Li,

39
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,640
calling him some kind of 'NPC'.

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,280
Once we catch him,

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,720
we must discipline him severely.

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,560
We can't let him be so insolent anymore.

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,560
So he called Manager Li

44
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,960
a non-player character.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,200
No, wait.

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
I can't anger him yet.

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't have any missions.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,160
I need him to get me out of here first.

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,120
I can't stay here

50
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,360
being an NPC forever.

51
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,120
Let's go to the study.

52
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,800
Your Highness, are you writing a divorce letter?

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,460
I'm copying the Women's Code.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Your Highness must have been bewitched by that courtesan's second master

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
and lost your senses,

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,640
to do something so absurd.

57
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,840
Don't be angry.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
When Manager Li returns to inform the city lord,

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
you can have this Yunlang

60
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,360
beaten to death.

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,200
That's right.

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,880
I'm now the princess,

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,320
and before he completes his mission,

64
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,360
I have control over his life and death.

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
If he doesn't make it back,

66
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
I can have him skinned alive.

67
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,720
Nange,

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,860
bring the second master back.

69
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,020
I haven't finished speaking yet.

70
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,400
Get in.

71
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
Let me go.

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,680
That was quick.

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,000
You

74
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
were peeping just now, weren't you?

75
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,960
Second Master,

76
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,840
do you admit your guilt?

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,120
No need to ask if he's guilty.

78
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,400
This man

79
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
is as stubborn as a mule.

80
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
But this is the princess's residence.

81
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
If I say you're wrong,

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,740
then you're wrong.

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,480
Now you've made me copy the Women's Code ten times.

84
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,480
So,

85
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,620
you go copy the Men's Code.

86
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,280
Your Highness,

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,810
you've only copied it once.

88
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,920
Is that so?

89
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,160
Fine,

90
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,600
then you go copy it once too.

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,520
I'll copy it.

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,570
It's not like I can't write.

93
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,240
You fool.

94
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,680
You probably don't know

95
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
that in this world, the Men's Code

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,210
is 10,000 times longer than the Women's Code.

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Are these all of them?

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,880
The weather is so nice today.

99
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,320
I'm going to take a stroll in the garden.

100
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,440
Second Young Master.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,680
Copy it.

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,920
Your Highness is awake.

103
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,800
About yesterday's competition.

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
You won, sir.

105
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,200
You can ask His Highness to fulfill his promise.

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,160
To give you the sword as promised.

107
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,000
Weiyang found Lanfeng Pavilion yesterday.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Your Highness doesn't suspect me.

109
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,330
That's already a blessing.

110
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,020
How could I possibly ask her for a reward?

111
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,580
What should we do then?

112
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,920
The things I asked you to prepare,

113
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
are they ready?

114
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Sir.

115
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,440
But that's...

116
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,760
How could you

117
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,760
give it to that dissolute princess?

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,610
Hand it over.

119
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Sir

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,040
Why are you here?

121
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,440
Yesterday at Lanfeng House, your brother

122
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
was talking about Miss Jiang and me.

123
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
So you're here to explain yourself.

124
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,000
I drank too much yesterday.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,530
I don't remember anything.

126
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,520
This is...

127
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,280
Miss.

128
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
This jade pendant

129
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
wasn't it the token of love that Young Master Wei

130
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,320
wanted to give you before?

131
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,060
Why has it been given to the Princess now?

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,980
What exactly does Young Master Wei mean by this?

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,610
This couldn't have been given willingly by A-Xu.

134
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,490
It must be Her Highness.

135
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,040
She must have discovered it was a keepsake from A-Xu's mother

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,770
and forced him to give it to her.

137
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,050
This is what my mother got for me

138
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,280
to pray for my safety and blessing when she was alive.

139
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,880
Now I'd like to give it to you.

140
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,840
This jerk!

141
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,700
Giving the same gift to two women.

142
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,560
Sir.

143
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
I think

144
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,880
when your mother got this jade pendant for you,

145
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
she surely wanted it to keep you safe and sound.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,480
This gift is too precious.

147
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,680
I can't accept it.

148
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,040
Well,

149
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
I'll head back now.

150
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,280
The princess seems like a completely different person.

151
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,010
When did she become so genuine?

152
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,760
Miss.

153
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,000
Why does it seem to me

154
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,600
that it doesn't look like the jade pendant

155
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,060
that the princess forced Master Wei to give?

156
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,920
I'll ask Axu about it later.

157
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,080
Miss.

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,440
Axu.

159
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,370
Why are you here?

160
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm here to rescue you.

161
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,280
That day when you got into the Princess's carriage,

162
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,440
you must have had no choice,

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
isn't that right?

164
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,500
I did it willingly.

165
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,760
Willingly.

166
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,690
But we were doing so well together.

167
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,760
Why did you suddenly join the Princess's household?

168
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,600
And even in front of Her Highness,

169
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,200
you pretended not to know me.

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,090
Do you have some hidden reason?

171
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,570
I've fallen in love with Her Highness.

172
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,520
I can't live without her.

173
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,919
You should leave.

174
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,120
This is not a place you should be.

175
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,600
Even if

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Her Highness has a new favorite now,

177
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,860
even if she treats you like a servant,

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,060
will you still remain devoted to her?

179
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,200
Yes.

180
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,160
Miss.

181
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,400
Excuse me,

182
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
who are these refreshments

183
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,840
for?

184
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,200
Where should they be delivered?

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,080
They're for His Highness.

186
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,410
Take them to the garden.

187
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm just about to report to His Highness.

188
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,840
Why don't

189
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,240
I deliver them for you?

190
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,370
That would be great.

191
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,080
Thanks.

192
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,900
Your Highness.

193
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,000
Xu chose you.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
Are you better than me?

195
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,640
You and I

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,860
must settle this once and for all.

197
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,620
Your Highness,

198
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,960
please have some tea.

199
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,520
Your Highness,

200
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,920
these pastries

201
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,450
taste best when paired with this special tea.

202
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,440
Please try it.

203
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,800
It's a bit hot.

204
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,360
Too hot!

205
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
This tea

206
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,800
is poisoned!

207
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,380
Your Highness!

208
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,720
Your Highness!

209
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,240
That's not right.

210
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,960
I only put itching powder in it.

211
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,820
Your Highness,

212
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,220
Your Highness,

213
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,320
don't scare me like that!

214
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,720
I don't want you to die, Your Highness.

215
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,050
Wake up, Your Highness.

216
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,360
Your Highness, please wake up.

217
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,220
Your Highness.

218
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,940
Since Xiangyangyang doesn't want me to die,

219
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
I guess I'll live a few more days.

220
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,240
You tricked me.

221
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,930
Then what's this blood?

222
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,440
I got these from Dr. Liu,

223
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,240
specially made blood capsules.

224
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,080
Bite them and they burst with blood.

225
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,960
Want to try one?

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,000
They come in many flavors.

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll give you one.

228
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,040
You...

229
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
When did you figure out my identity?

230
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,760
And that I drugged you?

231
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,660
Your Highness.

232
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,720
Axu chose you.

233
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,530
Are you a better person than me?

234
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,600
You and I

235
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,530
must determine a winner and loser.

236
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,400
This Miss Jiang

237
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,520
In front of others

238
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,800
she acts so pitiful

239
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,120
yet her heart is so vicious

240
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,400
that she even tried to poison Your Highness.

241
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
What do you know?

242
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Such a delicate woman

243
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,880
willing to eliminate a rival for love

244
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
and brave the tiger's den

245
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,560
isn't that moving and heroic?

246
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,000
Your Highness

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,160
who would admit to being the third wheel?

248
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,760
But that's exactly what I am.

249
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,480
You and Miss Jiang are rivals in love

250
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
so why are you speaking in her favor?

251
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,640
And the way you look at Miss Jiang

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,680
is like a mother looking at her daughter.

253
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,240
Of course!

254
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,080
I stayed up countless nights

255
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
to create

256
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,080
this brave,

257
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,920
bright

258
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
and strong-willed female protagonist.

259
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
Isn't she just like my own daughter?

260
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,140
Your Highness,

261
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,960
though I don't understand what you're saying,

262
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
but

263
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,000
I know you two

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
definitely cannot become friends.

265
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,960
She sees you as her rival.

266
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,160
She really hates you.

267
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,280
Then I'll dissolve her hatred.

268
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,520
She's planning to poison me,

269
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,760
so I need to get ready

270
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,090
and not disappoint her.

271
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,880
You knew all along

272
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
and pretended to be poisoned

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,960
just to mock me.

274
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,560
Don't say that about me.

275
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,520
I didn't.

276
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,520
It's because you unilaterally dislike me,

277
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,360
so whatever I do,

278
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,920
you think I'm mocking you.

279
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,560
That's right.

280
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,820
I just can't stand you.

281
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,720
Do whatever

282
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,560
you want.

283
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
I'm not afraid of you anyway.

284
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,640
I don't intend to do anything to you.

285
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,560
On the contrary,

286
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,000
I really like you

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,720
because

288
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
you're very cute.

289
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,080
It's one thing to mock me,

290
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,940
but you're also being sarcastic.

291
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,300
Think about it.

292
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,280
If you truly hated me that much

293
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,240
and wanted me dead,

294
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,960
I'd have met the King of Hell by now.

295
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,040
On the contrary,

296
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,280
you hate me so much,

297
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,000
yet the most vicious method you could think of

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,720
was to use itching powder on me.

299
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,980
Isn't someone like you

300
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,480
just adorable?

301
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,280
Why has this princess suddenly become so kind?

302
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,520
She must be plotting something.

303
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,320
No matter what happened before,

304
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,400
but now

305
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,280
I truly like you very much.

306
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,200
Why don't you

307
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,400
come stay at my residence for a few days?

308
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,840
Just as I thought,

309
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,040
she wants to keep me under house arrest.

310
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,620
Would that be okay?

311
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,200
Look out!

312
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,460
Your Highness!

313
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,980
Your Highness!

314
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,200
Help!

315
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,260
The Prince has fallen into the water!

316
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,420
Your Highness.

317
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,640
Mu Yunfan.

318
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,400
Wasn't he copying books?

319
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,800
Why is he here?

320
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
A soaking wet man

321
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,600
is the most attractive.

322
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,720
I can't drive.

323
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Mr. Mu, you should call for a designated driver.

324
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,040
What did you say?

325
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Am I usually asleep at this time?

326
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm not sleeping.

327
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,400
I'm being your assistant.

328
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm at least the creative team leader.

329
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,160
Yet I'm serving you tea and water every day.

330
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't I need some dignity?

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,960
It's just a kiss.

332
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,160
It's not like we haven't kissed before.

333
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,880
So...

334
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,720
He knew all along.
