1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
Your Highness, why don't you try

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,300
which dessert you prefer?

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,560
For the winner,

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,560
Your Highness,

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,880
we'll grant one wish.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,980
How about that?

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,880
These two

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,759
are playing games again.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,200
What kind of wish?

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600
If I win,

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,240
Your Highness will give me the sword in your chamber.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,100
What do you say?

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,160
If I win,

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,840
Princess,

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,770
you'll divorce your first husband

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,800
and

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,000
copy the Women's Code 100 times.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,480
How about that?

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,640
You're insane!

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,800
I'm a royal princess.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,760
Why would I copy the Women's Code?

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,000
Your Highness should learn

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,280
how women should be faithful,

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,760
instead of having one

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,200
while eyeing another.

26
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,680
How dare you speak to Her Highness like that!

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,010
Do you have a death wish?

28
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,000
Mu Yunfan!

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Today,

30
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,480
I'll make you feel what it's like to be a subordinate.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,240
Fine!

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,440
I choose the mung bean pastry.

33
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,300
But you haven't

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,920
even tasted it yet.

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,080
No need to taste.

36
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,360
Just by looking at it,

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,820
I can tell the mung bean pastry is delicious.

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,560
Nange,

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
my second husband left without my permission.

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,080
How should he be punished?

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Beat him to death.

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,000
That's too harsh.

43
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,440
How about this:

44
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,479
I'm in a good mood today,

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,880
so I'll give you a chance.

46
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,120
If you can make

47
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,320
a dessert tastier than this mung bean pastry...

48
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,650
I'll let you off the hook

49
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,580
What do you say?

50
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,039
It's a deal.

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
Mu Yunfan,

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,960
how the mighty have fallen.

53
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,880
Try this.

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,370
It tastes awful.

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,079
Fine.

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,680
It smells terrible.

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,600
Take it away.

58
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,760
Just take one bite.

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Get it out of here!

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,880
Alright.

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,400
Are you

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,040
losing your hair?

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,970
Are you just trying to pick a fight?

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,120
Forget it.

65
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,800
You

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,930
can't make any good desserts anymore.

67
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,250
Bring me the previous one to taste.

68
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,680
No need.

69
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll make you a new one.

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,000
Just wait.

71
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,120
I'll go make you a new one.

72
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,740
Three Cup Chicken.

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
Eat up.

74
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,040
It looks delicious.

75
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,160
Is it good?

76
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,000
It's not good.

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,180
It's terrible.

78
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,000
But this is what you

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,560
used to beg for every day.

80
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,360
You must be mistaken.

81
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,040
I

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,920
never eat the same food twice.

83
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,120
Your Highness,

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,579
are you deliberately making things difficult for Master Yun?

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,820
At least some people are reasonable.

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
Female lead

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,600
Jiang Weiyang

88
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,120
So beautiful.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Little Weiyang

90
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,520
Come here.

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,640
Come on.

92
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,040
You be the judge.

93
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Between what they made,

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
whose tastes better?

95
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,490
Young Master Wei

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,440
No.

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,040
Wait.

98
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,360
Weren't you just defending me?

99
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
Him giving you a hard time

100
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
and Wei's pastries being delicious

101
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,640
aren't mutually exclusive.

102
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,680
His Highness's private affairs

103
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,560
are not for you to comment on.

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
Nange.

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Your Highness,

106
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,120
it's been a long time.

107
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,160
The female lead is holding my arm.

108
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Let me treat you all

109
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,920
to dinner in my private room.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,120
Yes, of course.

111
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm getting hungry anyway.

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,570
Neither of their cooking tastes good.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,060
You two gentlemen should join us too.

114
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,280
Go.

115
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,800
How am I going to tell Xu

116
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,040
that I came here to take him away?

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,960
I can't let His Highness discover

118
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,690
my relationship with Weiyang.

119
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,120
Miss Jiang and the eldest young master

120
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,200
are old lovers.

121
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,159
How does he know?

122
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,120
What do you mean 'old lovers'?

123
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,650
I never agreed to separate.

124
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,810
The second young master is joking.

125
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,760
Miss Jiang and I

126
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,160
are complete strangers.

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
Xu,

128
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,100
how can you pretend not to know me?

129
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,000
What does Mu Yunfan mean by this?

130
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,160
He exposed the relationship between Jiang Weiyang and Wei Shixu.

131
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
He was on a mission

132
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,280
to make me divorce my husband.

133
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,840
He clearly has an old flame

134
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,240
yet still insisted on becoming the Princess's husband.

135
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,080
This behavior that damages male virtue,

136
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,840
Princess,

137
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,360
how do you think it should be dealt with?

138
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
According to the plot,

139
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,480
I die after divorcing Wei Shixu.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,640
Mu Yunfan,

141
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,160
you're really ruthless.

142
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,360
With the original owner's temperament,

143
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,000
she would definitely divorce her husband.

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,120
Otherwise, my judgment yesterday was correct.

145
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,600
You are Su Jinli.

146
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,300
Your Highness,

147
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,760
this is Lidu liquor.

148
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,200
It's very strong.

149
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,290
That's exactly what I want.

150
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,159
I have never met Miss Jiang before.

151
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,840
You and the prince

152
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,280
are in love with each other.

153
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,200
That's really not necessary.

154
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
At most, what I did to you was

155
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
stealing your love.

156
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,970
It's really strong indeed.

157
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,610
I can't take it anymore.

158
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,200
I'm feeling dizzy.

159
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,400
I need to stop eating.

160
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,200
I can't drive now.

161
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,680
Mr. Mu, you should call for a designated driver.

162
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,610
What did you say?

163
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,640
You know who I am,

164
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,980
but you refuse to acknowledge me.

165
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,080
Axu,

166
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,480
I'm here to take you away.

167
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,120
Weiyang.

168
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,159
I can't turn back now.

169
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,640
I hope

170
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,159
you won't waste

171
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,490
your time on me anymore.

172
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
It's not worth it.

173
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,880
Miss,

174
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,810
are you alright?

175
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,360
Axu.

176
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,720
Why did this happen?

177
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,080
Sir.

178
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,290
It seems this Yun fellow

179
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,280
will be my biggest obstacle in obtaining the will.

180
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,840
Should I take care of him?

181
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Before we find out more about him,

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
don't act rashly.

183
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,730
You're quite heavy.

184
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,320
How dare you say I'm heavy!

185
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,440
It's all your fault.

186
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,040
I almost died here.

187
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
After all these years,

188
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,840
you still haven't broken your biting habit.

189
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,000
It's none of your business.

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,860
Leave me alone.

191
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,370
Where are you going?

192
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,680
You're drunk.

193
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,240
I'll take you home.

194
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
Don't pull me.

195
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
I'm not drunk.

196
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,880
Am I usually asleep at this hour?

197
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,120
No, I'm not.

198
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,850
I'm working as your assistant.

199
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,920
I want to eat peach blossom pastries

200
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,250
and peach blossom soup.

201
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,650
I'll pay you.

202
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,560
I have plenty of money.

203
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,490
Make them for me.

204
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,080
Right now.

205
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,360
I want peach blossom pastries,

206
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,120
lamp wick cakes,

207
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
and sour jujube cakes.

208
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,580
You're being ridiculous.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Am I more ridiculous than you?

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,480
I'm at least a creative team leader.

211
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,640
I manage two people.

212
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,440
Yet I'm serving you tea and water every day.

213
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,640
Don't I have any dignity?

214
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
Do you think it's easy for me?

215
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
Alright.

216
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,720
Stop crying.

217
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,080
Don't cry.

218
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,680
Get up.

219
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,960
Stand up.

220
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,560
So beautiful.

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,580
Do you realize what you're doing?

222
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,040
Of course I do.

223
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,240
It's just a kiss.

224
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,840
It's not like we haven't kissed before.

225
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,850
Did you know who I was all along?

226
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,600
Yes, I did.

227
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,280
You're the one who peeled grapes for me.

228
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,000
You even fed me.

229
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,720
Who did you mistake me for?
