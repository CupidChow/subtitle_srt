1
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,440
I have a good idea.

2
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,010
What terrible idea do you have now?

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,760
You should

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,000
seduce Yangyang.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,920
That's right.

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,560
You go seduce Yangyang

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,440
to create

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,360
the illusion that you want to take her away.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,720
Men, as creatures,

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,640
once they feel threatened,

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,840
they can't help but express their love.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,600
Are you kidding?

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,200
I was pointing a sword at Jiang Weiyang just days ago.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,840
Now she runs away as soon as she sees me,

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,080
and you want me to seduce her?

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,340
Well, who told you to point a sword at her?

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,360
I was just trying to-

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,920
Right!

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,240
You're Yunlang, remember?

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,400
You came here to repay the kindness

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,600
of that meal years ago by coming to the princess's mansion

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,640
to break up the princess and Wei Shixu

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,720
and restore Jiang Weiyang's happiness.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,160
Think about it, if Yunlang came here

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,440
and saw little Yangyang,

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,560
what would he do?

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,480
Reunite with her.

28
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,200
Exactly.

29
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,240
Want to give it a try?

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,640
Don't worry,

31
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,800
I'll help you create

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
the perfect romantic atmosphere.

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,480
Miss Jiang.

34
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,280
Please stop crying.

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
If you keep crying,

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,810
your eyes will get swollen.

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,840
Continue.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,600
Miss Jiang.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
Do you remember me?

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,400
You are...?

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
I am...

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,000
Miss Jiang,

43
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,820
I was nearly starving to death back then.

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,840
It was you

45
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,000
who gave me two

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,600
steaming hot buns,

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
saving me from starvation.

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,640
So ever since then,

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,160
I have been

50
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,810
in love with you at first sight.

51
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,680
Stop!

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,320
What are you saying?

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
There's no emotion at all.

54
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,280
You sound like a robot.

55
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,200
You need to be passionate,

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,720
show your charm!

57
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,440
How do I show charm?

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
Like this.

59
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Suddenly pin her against the wall,

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,760
move in close,

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,200
give her that intense gaze.

62
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm sorry,

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,520
I've helped so many people

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,320
over the years

65
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,640
that I don't remember

66
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,560
saving you.

67
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Miss Jiang.

68
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,810
That's not what I meant.

69
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Stop, stop, stop.

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,760
You call that showing charm?

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
That's called causing trouble.

72
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,770
They might call the police.

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,280
Is that so?

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
Pretty much.

75
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,120
What's next?

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,560
And then...

77
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,200
Just...

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,100
Why are you closing your eyes?

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,440
Didn't you want to...

80
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,160
I want to...

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,520
You need to seduce Xiao Yangyang.

82
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,080
Miss Jiang.

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,080
If you hadn't given me those two buns,

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,400
I would have starved to death.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
Thankfully, I had you.

86
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,080
So from that moment on,

87
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
I've been extremely grateful to you,

88
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,480
and fell in love with you at first sight.

89
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,600
Please accept me.

90
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,200
I'm sorry,

91
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,920
but I've helped so many people

92
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,850
that I don't remember helping you.

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,940
Then please think about it again.

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,440
Where's that flirtatious energy from before?

95
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,200
If you continue like this,

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,320
you won't provoke Wei Shixu's possessiveness,

97
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,760
and he'll just think you're an idiot.

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Falling for this so easily.

99
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,360
It must be true love.

100
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,960
Master.

101
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,520
I see Xiao Yangyang is so close with the Second Master,

102
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,450
they seem like old acquaintances.

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
I feel like

104
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,360
the Second Master has feelings for Xiao Yangyang.

105
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,080
Look,

106
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,410
Xiao Yangyang even accepted his flowers.

107
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
The Second Master is pointing outside,

108
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
what does that mean?

109
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,840
He's pointing outside,

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,170
does he want to show her the world outside?

111
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,720
It seems

112
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,440
Xiao Yangyang also has special feelings for the Second Master.

113
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
You'd better hurry up.

114
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,760
If you don't act quickly,

115
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,200
those two will...

116
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,640
Wait, something's not right.

117
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,520
His Highness has repeatedly tried to divorce me,

118
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,000
even tried to frame me for having an affair with Weiyang,

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,640
and now he suddenly brings me to Weiyang's courtyard

120
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,840
to watch this scene.

121
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,920
Could it be that he suspects my relationship with Weiyang

122
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,960
and is deliberately testing me here?

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,560
The Second Master has repeatedly targeted me.

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
I don't think it's for His Highness,

125
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,080
but for Miss Jiang.

126
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,680
That makes sense too.

127
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,840
I think Miss Jiang is working with the Second Master

128
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,040
to persuade His Highness to divorce me.

129
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,040
To avoid my suspicion,

130
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,440
the Second Master

131
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,200
pretends to dislike Miss Jiang.

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,080
Such behavior

133
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
is too despicable.

134
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,240
Please, Your Highness, don't be blinded.

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,260
I will never leave Your Highness.

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,920
Don't worry.

137
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,600
I'll return to the mansion now.

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,280
I am, after all, the Prime Minister's daughter,

139
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,940
and I still have some dignity.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,280
It's ruined! I've messed everything up!

141
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,280
Warning!

142
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,880
Due to player's improper operation,

143
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,540
the tragedy of the main characters will happen ahead of schedule.

144
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Mu Yunfan.

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,360
Minister

146
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,490
I've found out where the young lady is.

147
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,560
Where is she?

148
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,640
At the Princess's mansion.

149
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,380
Why did she go to the Princess's mansion?

150
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,960
It seems it's because of the Princess's husband,

151
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,880
Wei Shixu.

152
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,960
Nonsense!

153
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,080
A respectable young lady

154
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,840
chasing after a man,

155
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,680
and the Princess's man at that.

156
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,280
Go quickly

157
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:03,760
and

158
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,890
bring her back to me.

159
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,900
What if the young lady refuses to return with me?

160
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,920
The young lady seems quite fond of that Wei fellow.

161
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,120
Her Highness is our ruler,

162
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,450
and we are her subjects.

163
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,200
No matter how much she likes him,

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,930
if it creates discord between ruler and subject,

165
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,200
it cannot be tolerated.

166
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,120
I understand,

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,860
I will protect our family's reputation.

168
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,760
Go now.

169
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Go.

170
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,440
Nange

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What exactly does the Chief Minister want from me?

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Being all mysterious.

173
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,130
And insisting I come in person.

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
I don't know, sir.

175
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,160
The Chief Minister only instructed

176
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,360
that you come alone.

177
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,680
Fine.

178
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,160
What is he up to in the middle of the night?

179
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,440
Ghost stories?

180
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,680
I've been waiting for you for a long time, Your Highness.

181
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,200
What's wrong with you?

182
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,960
Why are you acting so strange?

183
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,600
Your Highness is so infatuated with the Second Consort

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,320
isn't it because you like

185
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,040
his worldly charms?

186
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,120
How is it?

187
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,880
How does Your Highness feel?

188
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,800
Wait.

189
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,920
Could it be that because I wanted to dismiss him before,

190
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,640
he's now trying to please me?

191
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,200
First Consort,

192
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
I won't dismiss you anymore.

193
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,480
Just act normal.

194
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,540
Don't be like this.

195
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
I understand.

196
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,200
I've realized my mistakes.

197
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,520
As Your Highness's consort,

198
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,730
I should be devoted to serving you,

199
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,420
instead of pretending to be aloof

200
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,240
and thinking too highly of myself.

201
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,840
I truly deserve punishment.

202
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,120
Your Highness,

203
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,920
from now on,

204
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,860
I will certainly consider

205
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,940
your preferences in everything.

206
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,120
Wait a moment.

207
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
There's someone behind you.

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,020
Your Highness,

209
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,000
at this moment,

210
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,280
please don't joke around.

211
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,600
There really are people.
