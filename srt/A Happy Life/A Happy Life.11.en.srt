1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,340
Please don't flatter yourself, Miss Jiang.

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,960
It was His Highness who wanted to test the medicine on Miss Jiang.

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,760
And I

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,580
couldn't bear to see her hurt,

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,920
so I took her place.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,800
Axu.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,840
Weiyang,

8
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,840
what's wrong?

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,520
I...

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,080
I'm in so much pain.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,320
Wasn't the poison neutralized?

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,020
Why is this happening?

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,060
I'll go get the doctor.

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,319
Axu.

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,170
I thought you didn't care about me.

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,890
Why are you still worried about me?

17
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:19,920
I admit it.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,730
I have feelings for you.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
But there's no future for us.

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,000
That's enough for me.

21
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,250
You're okay now.

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,479
This is from His Highness,

23
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,759
the blood-vomiting pill he gave me.

24
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,560
Just kidding.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
So silly.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,880
His Highness is always fooling around,

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,960
but gradually,

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,210
I've found myself enjoying his playfulness too.

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,720
That's wonderful!

30
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,980
It's getting shorter.

31
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Great!

32
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,760
This crisis

33
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,690
has brought them closer together,

34
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,520
at least little Yanyang won't leave heartbroken.

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,780
Let's make a bet, shall we?

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,320
What?

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,000
If they get together,

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
we'll reconcile too.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,820
How about that?

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,400
Congratulations, player!

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,280
Your conquest mission has made new progress.

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,160
No,

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,520
can't you read the room?

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,200
Is this really the time for you to appear?

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Get back in there.

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,560
Friendly reminder:

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,880
according to veteran players,

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
disrespecting the system

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,440
will result in imprisonment.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,480
This game isn't even released yet,

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,560
where are these veteran players coming from?

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,960
Don't bother me.

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,600
Go back.

54
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,720
Your Highness.

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,080
Your Highness.

56
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,960
It's terrible!

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
There's an angry mob gathered outside.

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,320
What?

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,570
Let's go.

60
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,760
Princess Jinli

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,920
is extravagant and immoral

62
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,280
and disregards human lives!

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,880
Princess Jinli

64
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,320
is extravagant and immoral

65
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,920
and disregards human lives!

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,400
Princess Jinli

67
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,800
is extravagant and immoral

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,320
and disregards human lives!

69
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,240
What's happening?

70
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,480
Didn't Dr. Xu say there would be no danger?

71
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,800
Give me back my brother's life!

72
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,160
He was my only family,

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,320
only 16 years old.

74
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,400
Only 16 years old.

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,640
If he hadn't helped you save people,

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,240
how could he have died so innocently?

77
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,120
Give me back my brother's life!

78
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:52,200
Return her brother's life!

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,040
Everyone, please calm down and listen to me.

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,680
Recently, all those who came to help rescue people

81
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,079
when they left the Princess's mansion,

82
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,560
were not in any life-threatening condition.

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,320
There must be some misunderstanding.

84
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,520
Don't listen to her excuses.

85
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,840
Just arrest her and take her to the authorities.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,240
That's right. Arrest her and take her to the authorities.

87
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,100
Close the door.

88
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
How could this happen?

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
Quickly, find Dr. Xu!

90
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,800
Dr. Xu...

91
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,400
Where are his recent medical records?

92
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,360
Let's find them.

93
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,340
No need to look.

94
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,080
Silencing witnesses.

95
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,000
This matter has nothing to do with anyone else.

96
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,130
Could it be the Prime Minister?

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,280
Nange.

98
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,600
Give Dr. Xu a proper burial

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
and provide his family with enough money to live without worry.

100
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,120
Yes.

101
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,460
Your Highness,

102
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,760
are you there?

103
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,800
Oh no,

104
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,880
it's Xiao Yangyang.

105
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,840
If she finds out the truth,

106
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,600
she'll definitely break up with Wei Shixu.

107
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,160
The whole storyline will be messed up.

108
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,840
I'll take someone to examine the body.

109
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,640
Let's see if we can find clues

110
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,360
from the poison that killed the victim.

111
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,200
You go and stall her.

112
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Okay.

113
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,840
Xiao Yangyang!

114
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,220
Your Highness,

115
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,330
I've brought trouble upon you.

116
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,240
It has nothing to do with you.

117
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,560
This matter still needs investigation.

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,520
Besides,

119
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,960
I already have a bad reputation

120
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,120
and am disliked by the people.

121
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,520
Perhaps they're just looking for an excuse to cause trouble.

122
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Highness,

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
you're not disliked at all.

124
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,680
Yanyang,

125
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,140
are you complimenting me?

126
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,960
Could it be

127
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,360
you've found the answer?

128
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,120
Thank you for the blood-purging pills.

129
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,000
I actually made some snacks

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
and wanted to invite you over,

131
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,120
but unexpectedly,

132
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
this situation suddenly happened.

133
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,640
How do you plan to handle this, Your Highness?

134
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,370
Should I ask my father for help?

135
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,160
No need.

136
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,280
The Second Minister has already found a solution.

137
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,920
How about

138
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,570
we go to your room to have those snacks?

139
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,120
Delicious.

140
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,940
Your Highness,

141
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,320
we were once rivals in love,

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
yet while I was unconscious,

143
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,840
you not only volunteered to test medicine for me,

144
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,200
but also told me about Axu testing medicine for me.

145
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
It seems

146
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,760
like you're trying to match me with Axu.

147
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,560
Why is that?

148
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,159
Because I've told you before,

149
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,120
I like you.

150
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,280
There have always been rumors in Hongcheng

151
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,960
that Your Highness is quite the flirt,

152
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
interested in both men and women.

153
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,640
I always thought

154
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,680
Your Highness wanted to break up Axu and me

155
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,940
with Axu as the target.

156
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,360
I never expected

157
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,159
it would be me.

158
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,080
No, no, no.

159
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,440
You've misunderstood.

160
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,770
It's not what you think.

161
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,920
I only see you as

162
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,400
a close sister.

163
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,480
Look at this.

164
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,520
This was given to me by the Second Minister.

165
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,800
Everyone knows

166
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,080
the Second Minister and I

167
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,880
are inseparable.

168
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,640
How could I possibly have feelings for you?

169
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,200
I can see

170
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,440
the Second Minister has

171
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,770
deep affection for you.

172
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Congratulations, Your Highness.

173
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,880
True lovers are finally united.

174
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
You will be too.

175
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
Your Highness,

176
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,400
there's something else I want to ask.

177
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,760
Does my father

178
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,160
know about my poisoning?

179
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,960
He

180
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,000
doesn't know.

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
I haven't had time to tell him yet.

182
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,960
Then who

183
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,159
administered this poison?

184
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,480
Who was the intended victim?

185
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,800
I really don't know.

186
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,360
I've been busy taking care of you

187
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,320
and haven't had time to investigate.

188
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,960
Then Your Highness must quickly find the culprit.

189
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,159
This villain failed this time,

190
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,880
but might try again.

191
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,840
I think

192
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
we should start by investigating who made the soup.

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,840
Who

194
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,240
made this soup?

195
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,640
You're just recovering from a serious illness.

196
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,700
Don't worry about so many things now.

197
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,000
Eat more.

198
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,400
When I was unconscious,

199
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,930
I clearly heard Doctor Xu from our household.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,200
If my father doesn't know I was poisoned,

201
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
then why

202
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,580
was Doctor Xu at the Princess's mansion?

203
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,640
Your Highness

204
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,160
must be hiding something from me.

205
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,840
Everything that goes into my mouth

206
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,560
must be tested with a silver needle first.

207
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,160
Also,

208
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
the kitchen is restricted.

209
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
Except for a few trusted people,

210
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,840
no one is allowed in there.

211
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
We can't let what happened last time happen again.

212
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,600
Last time, the young master wanted to make soup,

213
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,440
so we lent him the kitchen.

214
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,919
Who knew someone would take advantage of that opportunity.

215
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,799
That soup

216
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,800
was even drunk by Miss Jiang.

217
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,480
How dare you argue!

218
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,560
The soup last time

219
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,040
was made by the young master.

220
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
To answer Miss Jiang,

221
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,280
it was indeed cooked by the young master.

222
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:53,920
Such a blabbermouth.

223
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,560
If the soup was made by Axu,

224
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,920
it was meant for himself to drink.

225
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Then the culprit was targeting Axu.

226
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,600
Axu is just a merchant,

227
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,880
he doesn't have any enemies.

228
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,740
The only one who might dislike him

229
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,960
is Father.

230
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Manager Li.

231
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,320
I have urgent business at the minister's residence.

232
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,250
Please inform His Highness for me.

233
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,440
Miss, wait for me!

234
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,200
Miss Jiang,

235
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
you've just recovered from poisoning.

236
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,360
Please slow down.

237
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,240
I almost gave everything away just now.

238
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
If Yanyang finds out

239
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,920
that Wei Shixu made this soup

240
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,240
and was going to drink it himself,

241
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,800
she could easily figure out

242
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,840
that the Chancellor wanted to harm Wei Shixu.

243
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,000
I just took the coroner to examine the body.

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,460
The victim, Li's brother,

245
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,400
did indeed die from Seven Days Drunk poison.

246
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,960
That's impossible!

247
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,920
Dr. Xu said

248
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,640
this dosage wasn't dangerous.

249
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,840
It seems this time the Chancellor

250
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,300
was truly well-prepared.

251
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,360
Currently, we have no evidence to prove

252
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,960
that the Chancellor administered the poison.

253
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,700
Rumors are spreading outside

254
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,280
that you disregarded human life

255
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,560
for your husband's sake.

256
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
Deliver the City Lord's order.

257
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,080
The City Lord's people arrived so quickly.

258
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,560
By order of the City Lord,

259
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,960
the Princess's residence

260
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,320
and its two gentlemen

261
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,760
have seduced the Princess,

262
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,000
manipulated her,

263
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
and disregarded human life.

264
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,140
Take these two to prison immediately for questioning.

265
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,010
After the truth comes to light,

266
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,820
further action will be taken.

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,520
No!

268
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:19,880
Your Highness,

269
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,840
there's been a misunderstanding.

270
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,100
I need to see my mother.

271
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,180
Your Highness.

272
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,240
Your Highness,

273
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,880
please go back.

274
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
Mother,

275
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,920
there's more to the story about the medicine testing.

276
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,200
Please forgive the two gentlemen.

277
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,840
Mother,

278
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,290
she still refuses to leave.

279
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,800
It seems

280
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,600
she has no intention of leaving.

281
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,490
She has the nerve to come and plead with me.

282
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,080
Look at all the complaints against her this year,

283
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,340
more than all the city affairs combined.

284
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,160
This old servant has noticed

285
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,480
the Princess has become more loyal and caring,

286
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,810
unlike her previous troublemaking ways.

287
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,920
Before,

288
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,840
she truly never cared about anyone.

289
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,640
Since

290
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
we've found her weakness this time,

291
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,400
let's take the opportunity

292
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,000
to teach her a lesson.

293
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,800
Let her know

294
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,930
that people's hearts are treacherous

295
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,080
and not so easy to deal with.

296
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,880
Nanny,

297
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,770
has Mother calmed down?

298
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,360
The city lord says

299
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,290
she can't give you an explanation.

300
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,280
If you feel it's unfair,

301
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,680
find the evidence yourself

302
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
to prove your innocence.

303
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,610
The safety of those two gentlemen.

304
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,500
Your Highness,

305
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,440
you only have three days.

306
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,280
The longer you delay,

307
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,520
the two gentlemen

308
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,980
will be in greater danger.

309
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,840
I understand.

310
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,160
Thank Mother for me.

311
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,560
Yes.

312
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,520
Let's go.
