1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,730
Someone's really here.

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,420
Who goes there?

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,280
That's what you get for being romantic late at night.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,119
Now look what happened.

5
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,250
We'll have to see Great-grandmother.

6
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,360
Mu Yunfan.

7
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
My lord.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,930
The Princess

9
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,120
belongs to me.

10
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,560
Let me give you some advice.

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,759
Don't harbor inappropriate thoughts.

12
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,690
Let's go.

13
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
My legs are weak.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,079
Since when did you get so close with Wei Shixu?

15
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,000
He calls you in the middle of the night and you just go?

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,130
I had no idea he was trying to seduce me.

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,640
A man and woman alone late at night.

18
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Anyone can guess what might happen.

19
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,800
Are you saying I knew he wanted to seduce me

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
and I deliberately went along with it?

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
That's not what I meant.

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,480
Yes, it is.

23
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,410
Can't you tell I'm jealous?

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,240
You're only my husband in name.

25
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
What right do you have to be jealous?

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,579
Are you sure it's just in name?

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,690
However,

28
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,480
fortunately you arrived in time.

29
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,400
Wei Shixu is not

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,520
in any life-threatening danger.

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,650
The Prime Minister acted too quickly.

32
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,840
You're more familiar with the plot than I am.

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,200
According to how the story develops,

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,730
does the Prime Minister now

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,560
know Wei Shixu's true identity?

36
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,570
At this point, they probably didn't know yet.

37
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,440
The Prime Minister just couldn't stand his daughter

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
staying at the Princess's mansion for a man.

39
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,500
He wanted to kill this man.

40
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,200
But during this assassination attempt,

41
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,320
the assassin saw the Wei family military tattoo on Luo Fan's back

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,579
and reported back to the Prime Minister.

43
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,579
We can't let the assassin go back!

44
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,250
Don't worry.

45
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
I've already sent Nange after him.

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,440
You know the plot.

47
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,200
I don't know.

48
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,800
Then how did you?

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,600
I guessed.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,200
Is our plot that predictable?

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,960
Pretty predictable.

52
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,800
When I saw Luo Fan's

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,480
tattoo on his back, I thought

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,080
this must be when the Prime Minister

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
discovers Wei Shixu's true identity.

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,800
No.

57
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
It must be because you're too smart.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,860
Your Highness.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,090
How did it go?

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,520
We caught one,

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but another escaped with injuries.

62
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,399
Escaped?

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
I have failed you.

64
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,140
Never mind.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
From now on,

66
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,280
keep a close watch on the Prime Minister's residence.

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,480
If anything happens,

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,880
just report to us.

69
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
From now on, matters regarding the Prime Minister's residence

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,320
should be reported directly to the Second Master.

71
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,760
Besides monitoring the Prime Minister's residence,

72
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,600
what else can we do now?

73
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,960
For Wei Shixu's safety,

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,220
you cannot abandon him again.

75
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,570
That won't work either.

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
Then how can we make Wei Shixu

77
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,050
admit his feelings for Xiao Yangyang?

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,520
This is medicine the system gave me before.

79
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,440
Your Highness has prepared a family dinner for Miss Jiang.

80
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,640
When the ginseng soup is ready,

81
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
take it to her.

82
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,640
Your Highness likes to drink it.

83
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,080
Sir.

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,880
Isn't this ginseng soup Miss Jiang's favorite?

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,010
Did you get it wrong?

86
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,520
What else do you know?

87
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,100
I don't know anything.

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,930
Hurry up.

89
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,770
I'll make more of this soup.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,240
Would you like some too, sir?

91
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Alright.

92
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,640
Let's just forget about it.

93
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,320
She's leaving today.

94
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,530
If we don't do it now, we'll run out of time.

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,610
I just don't think it's a good idea.

96
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,520
No way.

97
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,520
I'll have nightmares if you do this.

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,600
I've confirmed with the system.

99
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,400
This medicine

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,000
will just make her sleep a little longer.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
There won't be any problems.

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,400
We need to create time and opportunity for him.

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,530
I still don't think it's right.

104
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,300
Your Highness.

105
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Xiao Yangyang

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
you're here.

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,960
Sorry to keep you waiting.

108
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,890
Please sit down.

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,680
You'll have a long journey ahead,

110
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
which will be tiring.

111
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,200
Have some ginseng soup first

112
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,330
to warm yourself up.

113
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

114
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,159
This soup

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,920
is poisoned.

116
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,980
Xiao Yangyang.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,640
Miss.

118
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,680
It's not raining yet.

119
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,540
How could this happen?

120
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,400
Princess,

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,000
Miss Jiang has been poisoned with a rare toxin.

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,640
I

123
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,370
can do nothing more for her.

124
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
What should we do now?

125
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,880
Doctor, this way please.

126
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,560
All right.

127
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,680
About this soup...

128
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
It was Wei Shixu

129
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,440
who specially made it for Jiang Weiyang.

130
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,240
That's right.

131
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,920
But Wei Shixu would never poison Yangyang.

132
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,880
Who could be so ruthless?

133
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,290
Do you think this poison

134
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,840
might actually have been meant for Wei Shixu?

135
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,360
You mean the Prime Minister?

136
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
That assassin from before

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,280
must have returned to the Prime Minister's residence.

138
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
Which means the Prime Minister must already know

139
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,330
Wei Shixu's true identity.

140
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,180
If that's the case,

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,840
he wouldn't stay quiet without taking action.

142
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Then he moved too quickly.

143
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,720
Isn't this going too far?

144
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,480
No.

145
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,360
I'm going to find the Prime Minister now.

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,220
I don't believe

147
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,180
he would ignore his own daughter.

148
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,730
Prime Minister,

149
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,280
you startled me.

150
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
I have important matters to report.

151
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,039
Lower your voice.

152
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,159
Can't you see Ahua is eating here?

153
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,780
If it gets frightened,

154
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
it will get indigestion.

155
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
Prime Minister,

156
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,760
after failing to assassinate Wei Shixu that night,

157
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,280
I accidentally discovered

158
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
he is a descendant of the Wei family.

159
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,200
So I disguised myself as a servant

160
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,520
and hid in the Princess's residence

161
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,980
to administer the Seven-Day Stupor poison.

162
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,880
What?

163
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,060
I know nothing about this.

164
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,080
Hurry up!

165
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,920
Young master, please have some too.

166
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,450
Alright.

167
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,780
Is the ginseng soup ready?

168
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,360
This is too lazy,

169
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,850
falling asleep while making soup.

170
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,920
No, you...

171
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,420
You actually killed someone!

172
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,640
I...

173
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,160
I was only trying to protect the Prime Minister's reputation.

174
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,200
The Wei family

175
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,890
someone is still alive.

176
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,500
By my calculation,

177
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,440
Wei Shixu should be dead from the poison by now.

178
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Why didn't you report back to the mansion

179
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,480
before taking matters into your own hands?

180
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,410
Prime Minister,

181
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,860
His Highness has arrived.

182
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,880
Quickly!

183
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,240
Come with me to receive him.
