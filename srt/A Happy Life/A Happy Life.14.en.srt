1
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,840
At your age,

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,640
why are you still going along with her nonsense?

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,840
Do you think I can't see what's going on?

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,960
I wouldn't dare, sir.

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,520
It's just that

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,880
the princess and the second young master

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,360
truly have deep feelings for each other.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,760
I couldn't bear to break her heart.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,400
The imperial doctor

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,000
was instructed by me to say so.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
If you're angry, my lord,

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,720
please punish me instead.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,760
The Second Young Master

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,490
and his wife are deeply in love.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,680
Why

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,880
did she choose that merchant Wei again?

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,080
Well,

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,320
I didn't know beforehand.

19
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,600
But

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,720
judging from today's situation,

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
the First Young Master

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,120
seems to have a grudge with the Chancellor.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,880
The Princess was protecting his life

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,800
and had to give up the one she loved.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Whose child is it?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,880
Say that again.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,200
I have no marital relations with Your Highness.

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
Why did Your Highness lie to save me?

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,920
The City Lord granted amnesty,

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,520
but do you think the Chancellor will spare you?

31
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,010
The Chancellor.

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,000
The Second Young Master will at least be safe at Lanfeng House.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
We'll make further plans later.

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,160
So be it.

35
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,800
At least she's still a person who values relationships.

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,840
But that Yun Lang,

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,600
don't let him suffer too much.

38
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,440
I have already sent word to Lanfeng House.

39
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,770
I believe they won't dare to mistreat him.

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,120
Hand.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,520
Buttocks.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,520
Chest.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
Chest.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,639
That's right.

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,699
Lift your head.

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,920
Come.

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,080
Everyone stop for a moment.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,640
Let me introduce someone to you all.

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,480
This person

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,360
is our former top performer at Lanfeng House, Yun Lang.

51
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
He was before,

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,000
and will be again.

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,160
All of you

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,360
need to get along well.

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,160
Understood?

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,880
He was returned by the Princess's mansion.

57
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,160
You talk too much.

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Ignore him.

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,000
You

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
should rehearse well with them.

61
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,960
Go on.

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,600
Go on.

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,020
Start dancing from this part.

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,400
Five, six, seven, eight.

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,560
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

66
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,720
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,320
Remember that?

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Just this section.

69
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
Let's begin.

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Five, six, seven, eight.

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,080
One, two, three, four, five,

72
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,160
hands up,

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,000
seven, eight.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,560
Two, two, three,

75
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,800
come over,

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,160
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

77
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,880
go back.

78
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
What's this?

79
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,440
Acting like a spoiled Second Young Master with me?

80
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,160
I won't tolerate this behavior.

81
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,280
If you want to make a living entertaining guests at Lanfeng House,

82
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,720
then you must listen to me.

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,040
If you're so capable, have Her Highness redeem you again.

84
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,640
I heard the City Lord made Her Highness choose between the two of you,

85
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,760
and she chose the First Young Master.

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,100
Her Highness really understands the principle of first come, first served.

87
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,079
Are you crazy?

88
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,480
How dare you hit someone!

89
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,800
Gossiping about Her Highness's private affairs.

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,680
Do you know what crime that is?

91
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,900
Your Highness.

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,079
Why don't you go beg the city lord

93
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,520
to exchange me for the Second Master?

94
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,640
Impossible.

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,680
If you go to prison,

96
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,540
you won't survive till tomorrow.

97
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,220
So you knew about me all along.

98
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,600
I did.

99
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,840
But I can't give you what you want right now.

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
If you're willing to leave this residence...

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,610
I'm not willing.

102
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,780
Your Highness.

103
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,730
I will definitely help you rescue the Second Master.

104
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,900
Your Highness,

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,450
the Second Young Master has been sent back to Lanfeng House.

106
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,560
Isn't this Yunlang, the former top courtesan of Lanfeng House?

107
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,200
Still as beautiful as ever.

108
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,240
Isn't this the Princess?

109
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,560
Ladies, please show some restraint.

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,640
What an honored guest!

111
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
So handsome indeed.

112
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
You dare stop me?

113
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
Is this how Lanfeng House treats its distinguished guests?

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Your Highness,

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
please don't take offense.

116
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
The City Lord has ordered

117
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,280
that all entertainment houses

118
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,760
are forbidden to let you enter.

119
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,080
Our Lanfeng House...

120
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,800
Mu Yunfan!

121
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,600
I'm here.

122
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm already a discarded pawn to Your Highness.

123
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
Don't worry about me.

124
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,720
What do you mean by that?

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
You should know why I'm doing this.

126
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,320
Your Highness's feelings run deep,

127
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,840
I understand that,

128
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
but our Lanfeng House

129
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
isn't a place you can visit just because of feelings.

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
Besides, even if our Yunlang were willing,

131
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,960
given the Princess's current situation,

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,280
I'm afraid you can't afford our top courtesan anymore.

133
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,880
Take my advice,

134
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,920
please leave.

135
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,960
Go now.

136
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,840
Go.

137
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,220
Your Highness,

138
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,130
please eat something at least.

139
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,600
If all else fails, I'll just abduct him back.

140
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll go with you.

141
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
Calm down.

142
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,200
Lanfeng House is an official music establishment.

143
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,640
Are you trying to accuse His Highness

144
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,080
of treason?

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Wait.

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,200
Can we buy someone's contract from Lanfeng House?

147
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,460
Let's buy his freedom.

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,330
With our household's current situation,

149
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,840
we can hardly afford

150
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,880
even a meal at Lanfeng House.

151
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,360
I have money.

152
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
Yangyang,

153
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
what brings you here?

154
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,530
Please sit down.

155
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,600
I've sent someone to inquire.

156
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,920
Today is Yunlang's first performance.

157
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Many noble ladies from Hongcheng

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,520
will be attending to show their support.

159
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,640
This Lanfeng Pavilion

160
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,300
is too influential to offend.

161
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,640
They've finally decided

162
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,600
to auction off Yunlang's first performance,

163
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,880
to the highest bidder.

164
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,080
You need to go bid.

165
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,940
I've already reserved our seats.

166
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
Here it is.

167
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Your Highness,

168
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,920
put on these servant's clothes

169
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,000
and come in with me.

170
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,120
Looking at today's turnout,

171
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,680
Lanfeng Pavilion

172
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,010
will likely fetch an astronomical price.

173
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,120
I secretly...

174
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,920
You brought money from home.

175
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,560
Are you still the Yangyang I know?

176
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,290
You even stole money from home.

177
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,800
Your Highness,

178
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
you once told me

179
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,600
I am you

180
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,840
and you are me.

181
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,760
Even though I don't quite understand,

182
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
as long as it's something you want to do,

183
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,220
I'll definitely help you.

184
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
Yangyang,

185
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,000
you're so kind.

186
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,570
I'll go change my clothes then.

187
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,120
Yangyang,

188
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,880
thank you.

189
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,960
Cheers.

190
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,840
Everyone, quiet down please.

191
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,520
Distinguished guests,

192
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,560
please welcome tonight's

193
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,160
main attraction.

194
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Allow me to formally introduce

195
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,680
this gentleman,

196
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,280
who was once the legendary

197
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,679
top courtesan Yun Lang of our Lanfeng House.

198
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,080
As everyone knows,

199
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,080
our Princess Jinli

200
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,000
once paid a fortune to buy Yun Lang's freedom

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and took him into her residence as her second consort.

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,960
Our Yun Lang

203
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,440
excels in emotional intelligence, talent, and beauty,

204
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,640
all in equal measure.

205
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,760
Tonight,

206
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,120
he goes to the highest bidder.

207
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,040
Starting bid:

208
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,080
500 taels.

209
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,560
Someone rejected by the Princess's household

210
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,160
isn't worth much.

211
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,400
I'll add one tael.

212
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,480
501 taels.

213
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,280
That's not entirely true.

214
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,160
I've heard that

215
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,840
just to see this Yun Lang,

216
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
Princess Jinli

217
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,560
was waiting outside Lanfeng House in the middle of the night,

218
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
desperately hoping for a glimpse of him.

219
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,840
I bid 600 taels.

220
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,560
This young lady is right!

221
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,520
600 taels.

222
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,160
800 taels.

223
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
Miss Jiang bids 800 taels.

224
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,280
850 taels.

225
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,440
1,000 taels.

226
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,840
Miss Jiang bids 1,000 taels.

227
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,040
1,500 taels.

228
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,000
2,000 taels.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,240
A gold bracelet.

230
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,760
A jade hairpin.

231
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,960
A priceless luminous pearl.

232
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
Miss Jiang,

233
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,680
a luminous pearl!

234
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
Miss Jiang has offered a priceless jade pendant.

235
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,820
Going once for Miss Jiang.

236
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,480
Going twice for Miss Jiang.

237
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,800
Congratulations to Miss Jiang,

238
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,560
you've won.

239
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,200
Miss Jiang,

240
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
please come upstairs.

241
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,720
Thank you, miss,

242
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,090
for paying such a high price for me.

243
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,090
I'd like to toast to you.

244
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,000
Wait.

245
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
We should drink like this

246
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,680
to set the mood.

247
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,120
You've spent a fortune.

248
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,000
From today on,

249
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,080
I belong to you.

250
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,000
I have many talents

251
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,040
that will surely please you.

252
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
Why don't

253
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,800
we get started right now?

254
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,240
Mu Yunfan, that's enough!

255
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,800
Are you getting carried away with your act?

256
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,730
You're the one who's carried away.

257
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,560
You abandoned me for a game character

258
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,380
and let my child call another man father.

259
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,840
Child?

260
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,480
Are you stupid?

261
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,760
I made that up in a desperate moment.

262
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,820
Couldn't you tell?

263
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,760
You lied to me.

264
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,960
No, I didn't.

265
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,320
I was trying to save someone.

266
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,920
Then why didn't you save me first?

267
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,640
I was saving you!

268
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,880
You knew very well at that time

269
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,680
I had to save Wei Shixu first.

270
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,080
Once he was out of prison,

271
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,520
the Chancellor had ten thousand ways to kill him.

272
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,840
What would happen to you if he died?

273
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Do you still want to complete your mission and go back?

274
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,200
I know.

275
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,260
I know everything.

276
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,960
You know?

277
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,490
You knew and still pulled that stunt just now?

278
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
Even though I know,

279
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,040
it still hurts.

280
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,480
Why is there always some random man

281
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,400
chosen over me?

282
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,920
By what right?

283
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,600
can you abandon me

284
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,130
time and time again without a second thought?

285
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,400
Don't think like that.

286
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,680
I just thought

287
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,040
staying at Lanfeng House would be better than prison.

288
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,640
Besides,

289
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,760
you get good food and drink here,

290
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,720
and don't have to suffer.

291
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,360
Right?

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,320
Not suffering?

293
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,050
Who told you I'm not suffering?

294
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,040
Really?

295
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,720
That madam...

296
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,520
I even gave her money

297
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,040
to take good care of you.

298
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,280
This won't do.

299
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,140
I'm going to settle this with her.

300
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,320
By order of the City Lord,

301
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
we're inspecting Lanfeng House.

302
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,640
No one is allowed to leave.

303
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,160
Nange.

304
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Madam,

305
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,760
may I ask what you're searching for this time?

306
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,320
We'll fully cooperate with you.

307
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,360
Obviously, Lanfeng House

308
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,240
has some unwelcome visitors.

309
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,200
This is bad.

310
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,600
The City Lord's people are here to arrest me.

311
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,840
I'll take you to Miss Jiang's private room.

312
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,440
Follow me.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Axu,

314
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,160
Nange,

315
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,120
go to the back door and wait.

316
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
I'll notify His Highness.

317
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,120
Alright.

318
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,640
It's that Princess Jinli causing trouble again.

319
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,600
It must be her.

320
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,210
Who else could it be?

321
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,760
Can't even have a drink in peace.

322
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,960
She's truly arrogant and domineering.

323
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,920
Work with me.
