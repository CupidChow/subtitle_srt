1
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,360
If

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,200
I hadn't acted first,

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,880
do you think those people

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,480
would have spared you?

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,970
Jiang, you traitor!

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,560
I'll kill you to avenge my father!

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,480
Stop!

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,280
City Lord!

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,600
Prime Minister, you're so calculating.

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,080
Do you even consider me

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,340
as the City Lord at all?

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
Mother.

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
Did you hear all that?

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,080
This Prime Minister

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,480
not only framed the Wei family,

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,539
but also wants to silence witnesses.

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,440
Weren't you under the effect of my Qianxin powder?

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,960
How are you lucid again?

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,539
I was just teasing you.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,800
You!

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,400
Jinli!

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,080
I have already made arrangements regarding the Prime Minister.

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,680
Be careful.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,039
How is it?

25
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,560
I'm right, aren't I?

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,280
So you were

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,520
deliberately making her lower her guard.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,120
Yes.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,600
I thought we should turn the tables on them and put on a show.

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,920
Pretend to fall into their trap

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,320
and lure out the Prime Minister behind him.

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,640
This

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,160
is the Baiqing Pill I got from the doctor.

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,120
After taking it,

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,600
you'll be immune to all poisons.

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,440
Although we don't know yet

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,720
what their plan is,

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,639
but

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,500
it's better to be safe than sorry.

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,960
This place has been sealed off.

41
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,290
No one dares to break in.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,240
Yunlang.

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
You knew from the beginning

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,400
about my entanglement with the Prime Minister.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,329
Now is not the time to discuss this.

46
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,540
Don't you find it strange?

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
Although we left the Prime Minister's residence,

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
given his usual way of handling things,

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,220
he would never let us go so easily.

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
But all along the way,

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
there have been no pursuers.

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,850
You suspect there's a trap?

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,800
April has been lurking around us

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,930
for such a long time,

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,820
all for that blood letter.

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
So Jinli and I turned the tables on them.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
We forged a blood letter.

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,240
Only by using the blood letter to lure out the Prime Minister

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
can our crisis

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,840
truly be resolved.

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,560
These are your father's belongings.

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,820
The princess asked me to give them to you.

63
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,120
So,

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,640
your arguments,

65
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,680
your falling out,

66
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,760
it was all an act for my benefit?

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,800
That's right.

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,560
How could we possibly fall out?

69
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,520
What a brilliant strategy!

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,000
Prime Minister, haven't you heard of the saying

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
the mantis stalks the cicada,

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,800
unaware of the oriole behind?

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,440
You thought you were the oriole,

74
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,560
but in fact,

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,600
you're just a little mantis.

76
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,370
Prime Minister,

77
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,800
do you plead guilty to framing General Wei?

78
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
Confess now.

79
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,280
I plead guilty.

80
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,640
Guilty.

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,800
This old servant is guilty.

82
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,720
I have

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,640
one request.

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,360
Speak.

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,560
Everything was done by me alone,

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,890
my daughter Weiyang had nothing to do with it.

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,240
Please, City Lord,

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,520
spare her life.

89
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,240
Your crimes

90
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,080
warrant execution of your entire family.

91
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
However,

92
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,050
Weiyang and Jinli have become sworn sisters,

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,940
so she is also my daughter now.

94
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,520
Naturally,

95
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,720
she won't be implicated in your crimes.

96
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,680
Thank you for your mercy, City Lord.

97
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,000
Jinli knew about your crimes early on,

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,680
and because of her friendship with Weiyang,

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,920
she begged me

100
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,850
to take her as my adopted daughter.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,320
If you want to thank someone,

102
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,400
thank her.

103
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,560
What are you up to now?

104
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,320
Before,

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,960
you made a scene over some men,

106
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,620
causing all sorts of trouble.

107
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,080
Now for this girl,

108
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,540
you come here and kneel before me endlessly.

109
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,200
You're really giving me a headache.

110
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,640
Mother,

111
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,600
Minister Jiang has committed a grave mistake.

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,160
But I don't have evidence yet.

113
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
I fear Yangyang will be implicated.

114
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,560
So I beg you

115
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,080
to take Yangyang as your adopted daughter.

116
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,920
How dare you!

117
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,760
Jiang Weiyang is well-educated and reasonable.

118
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,620
Taking her as my adopted daughter is a small matter.

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,159
But you're baselessly implicating the Minister.

120
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,400
Be careful.

121
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,600
Misfortune comes from careless words.

122
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
So you mean

123
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,840
you agree?

124
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
Listen carefully

125
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,960
to what I say.

126
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll remember.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,540
Thank you, Mother.

128
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,480
If Xiao Yangyang dies because of you,

129
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,360
Mu Yunfan won't be able to complete his mission,

130
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
and I won't be able to return.

131
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,600
Father,

132
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
you called for me?

133
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,720
Come.

134
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,440
I prepared this for you.

135
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
It's your favorite.

136
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,680
Try it.

137
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,220
Delicious.

138
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
Yang'er,

139
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,240
I've thought it through.

140
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,159
You care so much for Wei Shixu.

141
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,680
I won't stand in your way anymore.

142
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,800
If you want to be together,

143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,159
then be together.

144
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:54,920
Really?

145
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,120
But Father,

146
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
haven't you always

147
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,240
disliked him?

148
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,370
Why did you change your mind suddenly?

149
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,240
I felt that

150
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,900
he wasn't good enough for you.

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,360
But after these past few days

152
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,040
of testing him,

153
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,160
his character and morals are decent.

154
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,200
He's someone worth trusting.

155
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Yang'er,

156
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,120
I just want

157
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,120
to see you happy and content.

158
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,920
Nothing else matters.

159
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,440
Father,

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,720
do you and Wei Shixu

161
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,480
truly have no other conflicts?

162
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,159
No.

163
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,960
None at all.

164
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,600
Really?

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,480
No.

166
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,280
What's wrong?

167
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,400
Don't you trust me?

168
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,120
Have I ever lied to you

169
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,760
since you were little?

170
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,800
Father,

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,040
you're so wonderful!

172
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,760
Axu and I

173
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,220
will take good care of you.

174
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,480
Good.

175
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Father is so good!

176
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,120
By the way,

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,880
just now,

178
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,640
when I returned home,

179
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,880
I saw the City Lord.

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,800
She said today is the Lantern Festival

181
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,760
and invited you to her residence.

182
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,560
I won't go.

183
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,820
I'll stay home with you for the festival.

184
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,120
Though you're the City Lord's adopted daughter,

185
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,480
business is business.

186
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,120
There's a line between ruler and subject.

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,880
Understand?

188
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,960
How could you refuse the City Lord's invitation?

189
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,880
But...

190
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Go ahead.

191
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,039
Put on something nice.

192
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,679
Then, Father, I'll be going.

193
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,280
Yang'er.

194
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,720
Father,

195
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,780
I have things to do.

196
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,280
Have fun.

197
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,720
I'll go now.

198
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
Wait for me to come back,

199
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,920
I'll bring you some malt candy.

200
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,240
Good.

201
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,640
I'm leaving.

202
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,400
All right.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Okay.

204
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,040
Fine.

205
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,360
Ladies and gentlemen,

206
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,120
today our city lord is in high spirits.

207
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,560
All previous matters have been settled,

208
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,480
and this banquet has been specially arranged

209
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,480
to invite you all to join in the celebration.

210
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Everyone,

211
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,720
please enjoy yourselves.

212
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you, Mother.

213
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,960
Let me first toast to everyone.

214
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,980
Since everyone is here today,

215
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
I would like to announce something.

216
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,720
I have decided

217
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,480
to formally divorce

218
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
Wei Shixu.

219
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,540
Thank you, Your Highness, for your consent.

220
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,560
When did you ask His Highness?

221
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,690
I haven't asked yet.

222
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,520
I've had this idea for a long time.

223
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,600
From now on,

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
you two can be together openly.

225
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

226
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,570
I'd like to toast everyone.

227
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,640
Thank you all for coming to my rescue.

228
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,770
I will always remember your kindness.

229
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,480
If you ever need anything from me in the future,

230
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,880
please don't hesitate to ask.

231
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,810
I'll certainly do all I can to help.

232
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,280
I especially want to thank the Princess.

233
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,480
If it weren't for you,

234
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,720
Weiyang and I wouldn't be together now.

235
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,680
Don't be so formal with me.

236
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,440
You'd better treat our Yangyang well in the future.

237
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,280
Do you hear me?

238
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,440
They're truly happy together.

239
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Seeing them so perfect together,

240
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,060
does this mean we've accomplished our mission?

241
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,080
Here.

242
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,160
I wish you and Miss Jiang

243
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,420
happiness and prosperity in the future.

244
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,800
Master.

245
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
After I'm gone,

246
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,000
serve the young lady well.

247
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,400
No one is allowed to seek revenge.

248
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,880
No one is to tell the young lady

249
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,280
about the hatred between the Jiang and Wei families.

250
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,480
The grudges of the previous generation

251
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,200
shall end with me.

252
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,760
This old servant

253
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
has one more request.

254
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,080
What else?

255
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,320
I

256
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,400
I don't want her to know

257
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,600
about the feud between the Wei and Jiang families.

258
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,000
I beg you, my lord,

259
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,280
to execute me in secret.

260
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,800
Mother.

261
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,560
Jiang Weiyang and Wei Shixu are in love.

262
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,160
The previous generation of the Jiang and Wei families already ended in tragedy.

263
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,360
If Xiao Yangyang learns about all this,

264
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,400
their generation

265
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,860
will suffer an even greater tragedy.

266
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
Yang.

267
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,360
Happy Lantern Festival.

268
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,200
Yang'er

269
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Master

270
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,090
Why are you so careless?

271
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,760
Is it because

272
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,920
your previous injury hasn't healed yet?

273
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,600
No.

274
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,040
Perhaps the music is too loud.

275
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Someone come!

276
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Change the music.

277
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,090
Are you feeling better?

278
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,880
How did you convince my father

279
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,340
to allow us to be together?

280
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,400
A descendant of the Wei family.

281
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
What do you think?

282
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,880
Governor

283
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,560
The grudges of the previous generation

284
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,020
should remain in the past.

285
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,080
As long as the Wei family can be vindicated,

286
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,780
I will no longer hold the Jiang family accountable.

287
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,880
And I'll give up

288
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,780
reclaiming my identity as a Wei descendant.

289
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,480
Why give up reclaiming your identity?

290
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,040
Because

291
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,640
like the Chancellor,

292
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,880
I only want Weiyang to be happy.
