1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,880
Your Highness has arrived.

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,240
Forgive me for not greeting you properly.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,320
May I ask what brings

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,920
Your Highness here today?

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,720
Minister Jiang,

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,480
Miss Jiang has been poisoned at my residence.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,920
I've heard you have a skilled physician here

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
who specializes in antidotes.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,760
Would it be possible

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,000
to let this princess borrow this person?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,240
Yang'er is poisoned?

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,400
It seems Wei Shixu's poison has taken effect.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,600
Your Highness suspects I'm involved in the poisoning

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,240
and is lying about Yang'er being poisoned.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,000
Then I will

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,560
quickly send someone to bring her back,

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,400
so as not to trouble Your Highness.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,960
If little Yang returns,

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,680
we'll lose our chance

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,880
to make Wei Shixu reveal his true feelings.

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,600
It's not convenient at the moment.

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,240
I see.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,800
Please lend me your physician first.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,600
I'll explain everything later.

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,400
What terrible timing.

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,360
Well...

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
Doctor Xu is elderly.

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,560
I gave him some money a few days ago

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,840
so he could retire to the countryside.

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,970
What shall we do now?

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,480
Perhaps I should go to the city lord's mansion

32
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,440
to see if any imperial physicians are on duty.

33
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,200
Minister Jiang,

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,960
your daughter has truly been poisoned.

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,920
If you don't believe me, come to my residence and see for yourself.

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,800
Your Highness,

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,960
Doctor Xu has indeed retired to his hometown.

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,620
I knew you stubborn old man wouldn't believe me.

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,800
Good thing I had a backup plan.

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,440
Fine then.

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,289
Since Minister Jiang is unavailable,

42
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,840
I won't insist anymore.

43
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,740
Then Your Highness...

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,400
The tea at Minister Jiang's residence is quite good.

45
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,040
Well...

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,720
If Your Highness enjoys this tea,

47
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,600
I can have someone package it

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,460
and deliver it to your residence.

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
That won't be necessary.

50
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,680
I'll just have a few more cups while I'm here.

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Please, sit down.

52
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,760
All right.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,020
If you don't want to die, come with me.

54
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,250
Thank you for your hospitality, Minister Jiang.

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
I'm full.

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,520
Minister Jiang,

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,780
I'll take my leave now.

58
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:51,680
Get out.

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,920
Yanyang.

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,800
Miss.

61
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
Where's the antidote?

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,760
Hand it over.

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
What antidote?

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
Stop pretending.

65
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,440
The poison Minister Jiang used at my residence,

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,570
did it come from you?

67
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,440
I didn't provide it.

68
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,120
Then check the pulse

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,380
and treat it properly.

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,040
This is

71
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Seven Days Drunk.

72
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,880
This poison is the most

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,480
vicious poison in the world.

74
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,280
It's made by randomly selecting

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,210
seven ingredients from 49 poisons

76
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
and mixing them together.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,640
One could say

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,200
no two batches of Seven Days Drunk

79
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,320
are exactly the same,

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,320
so naturally there's no universal antidote for it.

81
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,250
What do you mean?

82
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,820
Seven Days Drunk has no antidote?

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
If someone could tell me

84
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,640
the symptoms after poisoning,

85
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,360
I could then

86
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,520
determine which seven poisons were used

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,880
and in what quantities.

88
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,400
However,

89
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
who would be willing

90
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
to risk their life

91
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,200
for the young lady?

92
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,080
Let me try.

93
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,120
Sir.

94
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
If Lady Jiang dies in the Princess's manor,

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,920
the Prime Minister will certainly not let this matter go.

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,480
For the sake of His Highness's reputation,

97
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,080
I...

98
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,240
I must take responsibility.

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,680
Good.

100
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,880
What else?

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,760
Do you feel anything else?

102
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,840
Very cold.

103
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,200
But my internal organs feel

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
a burning sensation.

105
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,760
Young Master.

106
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm fine.

107
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,360
Doctor.

108
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,760
I only drank a little of her

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,840
poisoned blood,

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,760
yet it's unbearably painful.

111
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
Then she must be...

112
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,200
Young Master.

113
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Doctor.

114
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
You must

115
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,960
save her life.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,720
Sir.

117
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
Young Master.

118
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,760
Young Master.

119
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,520
Sir.

120
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
Young Master.

121
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,240
Doctor.

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,100
What exactly is happening to him?

123
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,560
Your Highness,

124
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,080
with only the master physician alone,

125
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,840
I'm afraid we can't prepare the antidote,

126
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,680
we need more people.

127
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
How many people do we need?

128
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,600
At least a hundred.

129
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,880
Based on our current information,

130
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,740
I'll prepare various antidotes.

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,080
We'll divide them into seven groups,

132
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,800
each person testing different formulas

133
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,680
and different dosages of antidotes.

134
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,280
This way,

135
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,000
we can find the true cure.

136
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,000
As long as we control the dosage properly,

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,320
there won't be any life-threatening risks.

138
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,380
But Your Highness,

139
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,440
where can we find so many people?

140
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
Offer a generous reward

141
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,880
to find volunteers.

142
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Nange.

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
Announce it immediately,

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
offering generous payment for volunteers.

145
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,240
But be careful,

146
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,720
don't let anyone from the Prime Minister's residence know about this.

147
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,000
Tell everyone

148
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,490
that both masters have been poisoned.

149
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,640
Due to the Princess's husband's serious illness,

150
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,120
we're seeking people to test medicines for her husband.

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,360
Three taels of gold!

152
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,880
Everyone who participates will be rewarded.

153
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,810
This must be an extremely difficult disease to cure.

154
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,240
Nange.

155
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,160
What's wrong?

156
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,040
What happened?

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,120
Your Highness,

158
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,040
you were right.

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,640
There are indeed assassins targeting the master.

160
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,480
The Prime Minister wants Wei Shixu dead!

161
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,440
Guard the Princess's residence well.

162
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,240
Don't let even a fly get through.

163
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,040
Are you sure

164
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,980
the Wei family descendant was poisoned?

165
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
I saw it with my own eyes.

166
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,080
The princess posted notices at the gate seeking help for her husband.

167
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,600
Wei Shixu's lips turned purple-black.

168
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,659
He's unconscious.

169
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,720
This matter

170
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,480
shouldn't have affected so many people.

171
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,400
What a sin.

172
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Such a pity.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
It's ready.

174
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
It's done.

175
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,040
It's complete.

176
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,160
She's awake.

177
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,880
Little Yanyang, you're finally awake.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,680
Nange.

179
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,560
Pass down my orders.

180
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,080
Everyone who helped

181
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,240
will receive, in addition to the promised payment,

182
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,840
one gold bar each as a reward.

183
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
I was poisoned.

184
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,680
Miss.

185
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,160
Did Your Highness save me?

186
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,440
It wasn't me.

187
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,800
This time we're indebted to the help of our neighbors.

188
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,440
Of course.

189
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,900
And the senior master too.

190
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,080
You have no idea.

191
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,160
You were so weak then,

192
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,640
in such danger.

193
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,960
The senior master didn't hesitate

194
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,690
and drank your poisoned blood.

195
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,360
He's in terrible condition now.

196
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,560
He's vomited several basins of blood.

197
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
You're still angry with him

198
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,940
and want to leave the princess's residence.

199
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,520
I'm getting a bit tired.

200
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll go back to sleep now.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,040
You get some rest.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,040
Was I being a bit dramatic just now?

203
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,560
Your Highness.

204
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,690
You've always been a dramatic person.

205
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,560
Miss.

206
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
Miss.

207
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,640
Miss, you haven't recovered yet.

208
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,360
Miss.

209
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,720
Axu.

210
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Axu.

211
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Axu.

212
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,610
How are you feeling?

213
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Much better.

214
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,860
No need for your concern, Miss Jiang.

215
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,040
Weren't you planning to return to the Xiang residence?

216
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,120
You may leave now.

217
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,040
Xu.

218
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,760
Miss Jiang.

219
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,620
What exactly are you trying to do?

220
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,080
You risked your life to save me.

221
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,540
You clearly care about me.

222
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
Why are you pushing me away now?

223
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,860
Please don't flatter yourself, Miss Jiang.

224
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,480
It was His Highness who wanted to test the medicine on you.

225
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,240
As for me,

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,000
I couldn't bear to see her hurt.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,530
That's why I took her place.

228
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,320
Xu.

229
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,200
Weiyang,

230
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,240
what's wrong?
