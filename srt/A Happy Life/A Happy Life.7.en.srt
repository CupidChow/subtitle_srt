1
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,940
Your Highness,

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,000
what crime have I committed?

3
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,280
I've been in your household less than a month.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,740
Yet you want to divorce me.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,400
You've committed no crime.

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,480
I'm simply tired of you.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,920
Now I have my second husband,

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,120
so I'm divorcing you.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,620
Your Highness,

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,640
if you truly divorce your first husband

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,360
for the sake of your second husband today,

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,560
your reputation will be ruined.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,440
Reputation?

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,360
Hasn't my reputation been ruined already?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Your Highness...

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,160
Your Highness.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,080
According to Hongcheng's rules,

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,680
a wife cannot divorce her husband within the first year of marriage.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,880
Unless...

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,890
Unless what?

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,240
All these rules

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,760
have additional clauses.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,200
Otherwise, how could someone like me,

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,560
a spoiled brat, find any loopholes?

25
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,160
Tell me.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,880
Unless

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
one commits one of the six offenses.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,130
Which six offenses?

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,400
Disrespect to parents-in-law,

30
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,480
quarrelsomeness,

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,800
theft, infidelity, childlessness,

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,280
and having a serious illness.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,039
Childlessness?

34
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,170
We have no children.

35
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,480
You've been married for less than a month.

36
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,960
How could you have children yet?

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,280
This reason won't work.

38
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,039
Then...

39
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
What about theft?

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,920
I lost something.

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,600
He stole it.

42
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,720
Your Highness,

43
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,160
please don't be ridiculous.

44
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,560
If you disregard the law

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,880
and force a divorce,

46
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,759
both husband and wife

47
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,560
will be subjected to the nail board punishment.

48
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,800
When royalty breaks the law,

49
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,120
the punishment is even more severe.

50
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,880
Those who survive such cruel punishment

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,340
are less than ten percent.

52
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,120
Your Highness,

53
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,280
please reconsider!

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,700
Your Highness.

55
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
If you prefer the Second Master,

56
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,400
I won't compete with him.

57
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,040
Why must you abandon me?

58
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

59
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,160
Anyway,

60
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,479
I just can't stand you now.

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,680
I want to divorce you.

62
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,180
Your Highness.

63
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,080
I was wrong.

64
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,760
As long as you don't abandon me,

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,820
you can do whatever you want with him.

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,920
I can't stand the way you're acting.

67
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
I'm going to divorce you.

68
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,360
Your Highness.

69
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Please reconsider, Your Highness!

70
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,100
Her Highness is determined to divorce her husband.

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,280
I need to get that sword as soon as possible.

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,600
Your Highness was fine.

73
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Why do you want a divorce?

74
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,010
It must be that Second Minister stirring up trouble.

75
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Not necessarily.

76
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,079
I asked you to investigate Yunlang's background.

77
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,340
Did you find anything?

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,760
His background is clean.

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,930
Just an orphan with no parents.

80
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,380
Struggling to survive in this world.

81
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,880
The cleaner his background,

82
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,340
the more suspicious it is.

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,570
Go investigate.

84
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,440
Find out who he's really working for.

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,360
I already did.

86
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
There's no one behind him.

87
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,960
Master.

88
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
Can't you see it?

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,560
See what?

90
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,960
The Second Minister truly likes Her Highness.

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,360
Last time when Her Highness fell into the water,

92
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,760
he was desperate to help.

93
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,760
A man should prioritize his career.

94
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,620
Losing composure over a woman

95
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,680
is pathetic.

96
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,260
Master, aren't you the same with Miss Jiang?

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,880
Meet me at Moon Lake

98
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,010
in fifteen minutes.

99
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,880
Yang'er.

100
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,520
Master,

101
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,600
do you plan to meet her?

102
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,440
Yes.

103
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,660
Now I carry a blood debt of vengeance.

104
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,570
I'm destined not to have a future with her.

105
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,690
I must make her give up any hope.

106
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,960
Your Highness.

107
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,520
You summoned this old servant here.

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,580
What is the matter?

109
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,200
I fell into the water last time.

110
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,320
I'm still shaken by it.

111
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,760
I was thinking of raising

112
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,220
the garden railings a bit.

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,040
I wonder,

114
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,440
why you invited me here late at night.

115
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,500
What's the purpose

116
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,640
of all this arrangement?

117
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,720
Weren't you the one who invited me?

118
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,000
I invited you?

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,520
Yes.

120
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,440
Look!

121
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,040
Look,

122
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,680
this letter.

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Isn't that the First Young Master and Miss Jiang?

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,010
How do you explain this?

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,400
Meet me by Moon Lake in 15 minutes.

126
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,080
I'll be waiting.

127
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
This nickname

128
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,520
is only known between us.

129
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,840
If not you,

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,970
who else could it be?

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,520
This is bad.

132
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
We've been set up.

133
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
I don't know what I've done

134
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,400
to make Miss Jiang misunderstand

135
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,920
and speak such nonsense.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And to have Your Highness and Manager Li witness this.

137
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,159
Miss Jiang,

138
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,580
what exactly are you trying to do?

139
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,520
Xu.

140
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,810
What are you talking about?

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,440
We used to...

142
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,120
We...

143
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,800
We have no past together.

144
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,160
The First Young Master meeting another woman late at night.

145
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,920
This is unfaithful.

146
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,180
He's having an affair.

147
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,880
This hardly counts as a secret meeting.

148
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
Look,

149
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,540
isn't the Second Young Master there too?

150
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Why are you here?

151
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,250
Just a coincidence.

152
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,600
I don't believe you.

153
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,000
How could it be such a coincidence?

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Didn't we agree to work together?

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,730
Why are you working against me?

156
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,120
As long as I'm here,

157
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,560
don't think you can easily divorce Wei Shixu.

158
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,400
You're getting carried away, aren't you?

159
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,720
Get this straight.

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
I am the Princess now.

161
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
This entire mansion must follow my orders.

162
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,980
Your Highness,

163
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Your Highness,

164
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
the First Young Master is making a move.

165
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,480
If all goes as expected,

166
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,280
he will steal the sword tonight.

167
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,720
Forget it.

168
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm in a good mood today.

169
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,620
I won't argue with you.

170
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,800
I'm a bit hungry.

171
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,320
I want some peach blossom pastries.

172
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,520
Make some for me,

173
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,720
and I'll forgive you.

174
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,560
Wait.

175
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,640
The kitchen seems to be out of ingredients.

176
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,520
How about this?

177
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,440
Go to Lanfeng Restaurant

178
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,760
and get me a takeout.

179
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,000
Theirs suits my taste better.

180
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,520
Let's see who dares stop me from divorcing my husband now.

181
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,760
By the way, Nange,

182
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,960
is the sword hung up?

183
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,820
It's been hung as you instructed.

184
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
But,

185
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,400
why would the First Young Master want to steal the sword?

186
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,800
Who cares why?

187
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Manager Li, come quickly!

188
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,040
The Princess's mansion has been robbed!

189
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,600
Coming!

190
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,720
Hurry up!

191
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,880
We've been robbed!

192
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,200
What's wrong?

193
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Come with me quickly.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,840
Hurry up!

195
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,240
Manager Li.

196
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
The First Husband is a thief.

197
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,000
He stole my sword.

198
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,679
First Husband.

199
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
Why would you,

200
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
of all people, steal a sword?

201
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,960
Well,

202
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
now we've caught you red-handed.

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
He has committed one of the seven grounds for divorce.

204
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,860
I'm divorcing you.

205
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,300
I wasn't stealing.

206
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,700
Your Highness.

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
You're doing this on purpose today.

208
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,120
You steal from me

209
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,440
and then accuse me of setting you up.

210
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,040
Nange,

211
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,880
tie him up and throw him out of the Princess's mansion.

212
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,080
You dare!

213
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,920
Greetings, City Lord.

214
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,800
Mother,

215
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,040
why are you here?

216
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,800
Greetings, City Lord.

217
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,920
Everyone rise.

218
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,600
Second Husband,

219
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
I asked you to buy me desserts,

220
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,640
but you invited my mother instead.

221
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,080
If he hadn't invited me here,

222
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,360
I'm afraid

223
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,520
I would have missed this spectacle.

224
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,080
Jinli,

225
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,220
how dare you act so willfully.

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,260
Aren't there enough complaints about you filed every day?

227
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
City Lord,

228
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,450
the Princess

229
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,370
was just acting on impulse.

230
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,680
She doesn't really want to divorce the First Husband.

231
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,280
Is that so?

232
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,960
I don't really want to divorce the First Husband.

233
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,040
Your Highness once vowed to me

234
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,440
that we would never part.

235
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,930
Your Highness values her promises

236
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,730
and would never break her word.

237
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
That would be best.

238
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,840
From this day forward,

239
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,240
Jinli is forbidden to take any new husbands

240
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,680
nor may she divorce at will.

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,880
Jinli,

242
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,960
it's time for you to grow up.

243
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
If you continue with this nonsense,

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,730
the people will grow resentful

245
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,480
and ministers will keep filing complaints.

246
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,520
Even though you are my daughter,

247
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm afraid

248
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,730
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

249
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
Yes,

250
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,040
I will remember, Father.

251
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,000
What's wrong with you?

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
You know very well I'm the type of person

253
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
who must accomplish

254
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,600
whatever I set my mind to.

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
You know I want to divorce Wei Shixu.

256
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,960
Why are you stopping me?

257
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,040
Divorcing Wei Shixu

258
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,770
will trigger your death point.

259
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,770
I just don't want anything to happen to you, okay?

260
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
But the black lines on your hand...

261
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,360
If you want them to be together,

262
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,440
couldn't we

263
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,700
avoid divorcing Wei Shixu first?

264
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,480
We could.

265
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,520
First get Wei Shixu to admit his love for Jiang Weiyang

266
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,680
and clear up the misunderstanding between them.

267
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,010
Wouldn't that work too?

268
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,200
What you say makes sense.

269
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,400
But how

270
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
can we get Wei Shixu

271
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,480
to admit his feelings for Yanyan?

272
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,160
People only

273
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,840
when they're about to lose something

274
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,900
will they speak their true thoughts.

275
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,320
I have a good idea.

276
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,890
What terrible idea do you have now?

277
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,840
You should

278
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,920
seduce Yanyan.
