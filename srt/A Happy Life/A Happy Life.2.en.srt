1
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,000
The princess wasn't killed by Yunlang, was she?

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,840
If I killed her like this,

3
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,160
she wouldn't die anyway.

4
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,090
Her getting hurt

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,180
what benefit would that bring me?

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
No benefit at all.

7
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,900
There's no advantage.

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,880
Yunlang's mission

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,600
is to reconcile Wei Shixu and Jiang Weiyang.

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,560
The prerequisite to complete this mission

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,600
is to make the princess divorce Wei Shixu.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,520
So the fastest way

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,080
is to make the princess fall in love with me,

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
that is, with Yunlang,

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,960
so she'll divorce Wei Shixu for me.

16
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,600
So now you want me to hurt the princess,

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,320
which would only make her hate me

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,180
and increase my game difficulty?

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Isn't that so?

20
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,640
That's why I hate

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,840
you players who know the plot the most.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,380
At least you have some brains.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,360
After the princess divorces Wei Shixu...

24
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,560
Died a violent death due to extravagance and debauchery.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,840
This was her destiny.

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,160
Since you know how to pass this level,

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,400
complete your mission as soon as possible

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,200
and leave.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,000
You have the same face as Su Jinli,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,479
a face of a heartless woman.

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,210
I can't do it.

32
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,440
Who are you calling heartless?

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,420
Let's try another way.

34
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh no.

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
The system can only bind one player at a time.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,039
Now it's bound to him.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
This Mu Yunfan.

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,320
If I want to go back,

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,650
I'll have to follow him.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
This Princess Jinli

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,800
really moves on quickly.

42
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,400
The young master has only been here for a few days,

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,930
yet she's brought in another male companion.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,640
What does she take you for?

45
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,480
The Princess's affairs are none of my concern.

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,600
It's just that years ago,

47
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
the treacherous minister forged letters

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,480
claiming my father was a traitor,

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,080
causing the Wei family army to be slaughtered.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,160
The letter that could clear my father's name

51
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,240
is also missing.

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,020
I've been negotiating with this Princess for days,

53
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,040
but haven't found a single clue.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
Could it be

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,660
that our intelligence was wrong?

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,400
The letter isn't in the Princess's mansion?

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,280
When has our intelligence network

58
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,210
ever been wrong?

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,900
The letter is in the scabbard of the Wushuang sword.

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,040
Young master,

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,000
this handwriting,

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,130
do you recognize it?

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,480
No, I don't.

64
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
Then who would...

65
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,610
I don't know.

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,920
But better to believe it exists.

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Wei Shixu came for the letter.

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,279
Once he gets it,

69
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,340
he'll naturally leave the Princess.

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,810
It is indeed father's Wushuang sword.

71
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,300
How can it not be there?

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,360
The system isn't stupid.

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,090
How could it let players exploit such loopholes?

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,640
Did I get it wrong?

75
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,680
Do I have to seduce the Princess?

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,210
What are you doing here?

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
You sneaky system,

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,360
preventing us from recognizing each other.

79
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,490
What are you saying?

80
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,280
Speak up.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
Good thing I came prepared.

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,760
I am Su Jinli.

83
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,400
Second Master,

84
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,560
I'm looking forward to tonight.

85
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,540
What's with that expression?

86
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,080
Extravagant and lustful,

87
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
forcing others against their will.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,320
You damn system.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,280
This kind of trashy character

90
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,000
is exactly what she would write.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,480
You dare call my character trash?

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,960
Look at the situation you're in now.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,200
Guards!

94
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,880
Tie up the Second Master for me.

95
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,640
Tonight,

96
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,600
I will consummate our marriage.

97
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,140
Who dares touch me?

98
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,760
I'd like to see who dares to touch me.

99
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Who dares...

100
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,200
Let me go!

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,000
Nange.

102
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,370
The feeling of dominating my boss and ex-boyfriend.

103
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,960
That feels great.

104
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,460
Your Highness,

105
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,840
everything is ready.

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,640
Then let's proceed with the wedding ceremony.

107
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,400
Sir,

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,720
do you think that note

109
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,780
might be Princess Jinli testing you?

110
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,570
She doesn't have that kind of cunning.

111
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,320
My father once said

112
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
this Wushuang sword

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,880
separates into swords

114
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,340
and combines into a spear.

115
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,800
Are you saying

116
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,130
there's another sword?

117
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,040
Yes.

118
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,680
Take it off.

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,800
What's wrong?

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,760
You don't want to?

121
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,520
No.

122
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,060
I'm more than willing.

123
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,520
Smile.

124
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,480
Your smile always looks worse than your crying face.

125
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,680
What a killjoy.

126
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,170
In the Princess's chamber.

127
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,480
But right now,

128
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,160
the Princess is having a wedding ceremony with Yunlang.

129
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,720
Young master,

130
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,960
you've fallen out of favor.

131
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm afraid you can't enter the Princess's bedroom anymore.

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
It's the Princess's wedding day.

133
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,820
I am her first husband.

134
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I should be there.

135
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,200
Such a cliché plot.

136
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,120
I won't go.

137
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,120
Bow to each other.

138
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,140
The ceremony is complete.

139
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,880
Escort them to the bridal chamber.

140
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,560
Let's go.

141
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,060
Your Highness.

142
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,960
Such good looks.

143
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,520
No wonder he's the male lead, Wei Shixu.

144
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,840
Your Highness, on your wedding day,

145
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
as your first husband,

146
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,000
according to custom,

147
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,840
my younger brother should offer me a cup of tea.

148
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,720
Offer tea?

149
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,730
The kind where I kneel down?

150
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,760
That's right.

151
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
After all, there's a difference between legitimate and secondary husbands.

152
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
First husband, please.

153
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,140
First husband, please have some tea.

154
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,250
What did you say?

155
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,480
First husband, please have some tea.

156
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,920
Brother.

157
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,960
When offering tea,

158
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,300
your arms should be straight,

159
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,320
and your hands shouldn't shake.

160
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,160
So there's this scene too.

161
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,040
The teacup

162
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,610
must be held steady.

163
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,960
What are you doing?

164
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,720
Why are you burning me?

165
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,520
Are you crazy?

166
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,600
Brother, how did you get burned?

167
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,460
Your Highness.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Tonight, your second husband

169
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,460
won't be able to serve you.

170
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
Why don't

171
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,880
I

172
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
accompany you tonight instead?

173
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
No wonder Su Jinli

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,920
likes this subplot so much.

175
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,360
It's truly indecent.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,080
Why is it suddenly so hot?

177
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
And I'm so thirsty.

178
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,640
What's this smell

179
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,000
on my body?

180
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,240
Nange.

181
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
Is this enough?

182
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Add some more.

183
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,760
Her Highness said

184
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,400
she enjoys this kind of play.

185
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,800
Could it be

186
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,440
someone drugged me?

187
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,320
Is she really not Su Jinli?

188
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,720
It's just a small injury.

189
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,380
No need to trouble Master Wei.

190
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,880
Since

191
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,400
Your Highness has redeemed this slave,

192
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,240
I should take good care of you.

193
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,280
Well said.

194
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,160
Sir,

195
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,920
today is my wedding night

196
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,520
with the Second Master.

197
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,800
I'd rather spend it with him.

198
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,120
Come with me quickly.

199
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,920
Hurry.

200
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,360
It seems

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,450
we won't get the sword tonight.

202
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,920
Your Highness, be careful.

203
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,640
Second Master,

204
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,000
a moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold.

205
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,300
Your Highness,

206
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,340
please control yourself.

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
Come back.

208
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Your hands are cool,

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,480
it feels so nice.

210
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,520
Love potion.

211
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,040
You're going too far.

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
No way.

213
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
Caught you, didn't I?

214
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,360
Don't go.

215
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,240
Sit down.

216
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,200
A soaking wet man

217
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
is the most attractive.

218
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,760
Su Jinli,

219
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,960
it's really you.

220
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,000
You forced me to do this.
