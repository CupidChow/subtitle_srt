1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,560
Fortunately, the treatment was timely

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,400
and Your Highness is out of danger now.

3
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,280
However, the lake water was very cold

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,440
and the cold has entered Your Highness's body.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,520
You must take good care of yourself from now on

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,650
to avoid any lasting health problems.

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,170
Miss Jiang has truly gone mad with love

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,160
and acted so ruthlessly.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,280
It wasn't me.

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,610
Still trying to deny it?

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,760
Axu.

12
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,840
I was nearby just now and saw everything clearly.

13
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,960
Your Highness fell into the water accidentally

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,920
and it had nothing to do with Miss Jiang.

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,120
Second Young Master.

16
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
No matter how concerned you are about Your Highness's safety,

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,480
you shouldn't trouble an innocent person.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,280
Jiang Weiyang pushed Your Highness into the water.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,610
I saw it with my own eyes.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,320
First Young Master, you defend her so much,

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,120
could it be that...

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,360
Miss Jiang is the Prime Minister's daughter after all.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
She would never harm the Princess in her own residence.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,759
Fine.

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,200
What exactly are you trying to do?

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,720
You only care about Miss Jiang

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,920
but don't care if the princess lives or dies.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,180
Don't you know she's terrified of water?

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,800
Stop!

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,980
If you kill him, how will you complete your mission and return?

31
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,480
You recognized me all along.

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,180
Then why didn't you

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,520
why didn't you

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,680
approach me?

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Now you know, right?

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,480
That's how it is.

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,200
Every time I try to tell you something,

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,840
the system won't let me speak.

39
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,800
Even if I write it down,

40
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,560
the words change into something else.

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Fine, fine.

42
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,480
Since you've figured it out,

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,340
I won't stand in your way anymore.

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,400
So this is why

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,260
you didn't reveal yourself to me?

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,160
I had no choice.

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,490
Now the system and mission are both on you.

48
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,680
I was thinking

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,000
if I could work on the mission with you,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,840
maybe we'd have a chance to go back together.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,760
I plan to

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,160
divorce Wei Shixu first.

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,220
But Princess Jinli's death point

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,760
comes right after divorcing Wei Shixu.

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,600
Yes.

56
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,560
I don't even dare let him into my room now.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm afraid if he goes in

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,840
and discovers the sword is empty inside,

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,570
he'll ask for divorce himself.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,840
That's pretty clever.

61
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,570
Took you long enough to notice.

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,600
This is the only thing I can do now.

63
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
It's better than

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,960
Wei Shixu being killed by you

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,090
and neither of us being able to return.

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,440
No.

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,960
Why not?

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,280
Because...

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,200
Think about it.

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,480
If we work on the mission together,

71
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,600
if something happens to me,

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,480
you can save me,

73
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,760
like you just did.

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,280
You'll save me, right?

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,810
I can't save you every time.

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,760
I don't care.

77
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,720
It's decided.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,960
You...

79
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,120
Why are you looking at me?

80
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
That first night...

81
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
We...

82
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,680
That day...

83
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
That day we were affected by the original owner's aphrodisiac powder.

84
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,960
It was nothing.

85
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,850
What I meant was,

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,640
that first night when we...

87
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,640
after we go back,

88
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
Zhou Chen...

89
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,080
what will happen with

90
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,680
the two of you?

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,440
Zhou Chen?

92
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,320
Have you two been together all these years?

93
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,800
You've been my assistant for so long,

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
but I don't think I've ever seen him.

95
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,520
Are you crazy?

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,240
When was I ever with Zhou Chen?

97
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,140
After you forced him to drop out, we never saw each other again.

98
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,400
What do you mean I forced him to drop out?

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
Wasn't it you who forced him?

100
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,560
And after he left,

101
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,360
he disappeared without a trace.

102
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,700
You mean you two haven't been in contact?

103
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,200
Thanks to you,

104
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,240
I lost my best friend.

105
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

106
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Have you ever listened to me?

107
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,480
Like with that project,

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,400
You replaced me.

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,130
Did you ever ask for my opinion?

110
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,640
Besides,

111
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,480
The situation between you and Zhou Mo,

112
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,840
Did you ever tell me about it?

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,280
What situation do I have with Zhou Mo?

114
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,360
Fine.

115
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,120
At this point,

116
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,720
I don't want to talk about your business anymore.

117
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,250
I'm going to find Yangyang.

118
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,960
It's all my fault.

119
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,080
I wonder how His Highness is doing now.

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,000
Miss,

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,400
she stole Master Wei from you.

122
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,060
Why are you worried about her?

123
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,560
Xu came to the estate willingly.

124
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,080
Am I being

125
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,970
too unfair to the Princess?

126
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,960
I've lost my mind.

127
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,680
No matter what,

128
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,720
I shouldn't have hurt someone because of Xu.

129
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,400
Miss,

130
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
you're just too kind-hearted.

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,860
The itching powder

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,400
won't kill anyone.

133
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,480
Nange.

134
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,320
Why is this door still locked?

135
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,120
Don't lock her up.

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,720
What if she runs off to harm Your Highness again?

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,640
She didn't harm me.

138
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,120
I fell in by myself.

139
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,440
But the Second Minister clearly saw

140
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,520
that she pushed you in.

141
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,480
No, she was trying to pull me up.

142
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Open the door.

143
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Hurry up.

144
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,960
Although I didn't push you into the water,

145
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
I did drug you. That's a fact.

146
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,940
Your Highness,

147
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,440
why are you covering for me?

148
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,200
Because I understand you.

149
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,520
You have a kind heart

150
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,580
and you're a bright and brave person.

151
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,850
Your Highness seems like a different person.

152
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,840
I know what you're thinking.

153
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
Are you thinking

154
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,360
that no matter what,

155
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,440
you shouldn't harm someone for a man?

156
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,160
Right?

157
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
How do you know?

158
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
I also know

159
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,410
that you've always suspected Wei Shixu had his reasons,

160
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,760
but the moment I fell into the water,

161
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,880
you were thinking:

162
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,600
what if Wei Shixu had no excuse?

163
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
What if he was willing?

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,240
Wouldn't that be unfair to me?

165
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
Isn't that right?

166
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,720
Why do you know

167
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,640
my thoughts so clearly?

168
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,080
Because you're the female lead I wrote.

169
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,320
I understand you better than anyone.

170
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,240
Because

171
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,240
you are me,

172
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,600
and I am you.

173
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,610
I've been meaning to ask you

174
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,080
what rouge you're using.

175
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
Even wearing servant's clothes,

176
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,740
you still look so radiant.

177
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,440
And that time

178
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,000
at Lanfeng Pavilion,

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,920
what fabric was that outfit

180
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,200
you were wearing?

181
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,530
It looked so beautiful.

182
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,560
And also,

183
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,080
how did you dye your nails?

184
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,560
The color is so vibrant.

185
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,840
Look at mine,

186
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,440
they're all so dull.

187
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,170
Do you have any secret formula?

188
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,300
Fengzi flower.

189
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,960
Fengzi flower?

190
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,520
What's that?

191
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,560
Nails dyed with Fengzi flower

192
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,680
are brighter.

193
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,840
I see.

194
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
Little Yangyang,

195
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,200
why don't you

196
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
stay at the Princess's mansion?

197
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,480
You can slowly search for

198
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
the answers you seek.

199
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Me, stay at the Princess's mansion?

200
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,720
What about you?

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Me?

202
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,280
Between the First Master and Second Master,

203
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,680
who is your answer?

204
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,120
Can you tolerate a woman

205
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,559
in your own household

206
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,890
coveting your husband?

207
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,280
Neither of them

208
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,360
is my answer.

209
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,080
But I've seen you and the Second Master...

210
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,039
He and I

211
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,840
could never be together.

212
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,640
Why not?

213
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,560
Actually,

214
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,080
I can't explain why.

215
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,640
But sometimes

216
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,500
when misunderstandings pile up,

217
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,440
they make two people drift apart.

218
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,480
Could I have wrongly blamed her?

219
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,160
Su Jinli.

220
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Can we

221
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,680
get back together?

222
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,560
Mr. Mu, are you kidding?

223
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,120
Don't worry.

224
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,840
No matter what,

225
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,320
I'll help you complete the mission and return.

226
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,240
You don't have to do this.

227
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,770
You think I'm just doing this for the mission?

228
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,800
I actually am...

229
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Stop pretending.

230
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,280
Still acting.

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Mu Yunfan,

232
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,600
what's wrong with you?

233
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
What's that black mark on your hand?

234
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,320
It's nothing.

235
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,000
Mu Yunfan.

236
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,160
Miss Jiang,

237
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,120
Axu,

238
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,520
you came to find me.

239
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,650
Don't open the door.

240
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
We are alone, a man and a woman.

241
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,300
We shouldn't meet.

242
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,690
I'll just say a few words and leave.

243
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,240
Alright,

244
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,680
go ahead.

245
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,560
The Princess's mansion is full of dangers.

246
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,360
Please leave as soon as possible, Miss Jiang.

247
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,020
Otherwise,

248
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,880
incidents like today will happen again.

249
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Why did you

250
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,320
get into her sedan chair

251
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,560
and return to the Princess's mansion with her?

252
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,600
This question

253
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,440
I've already answered.

254
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
You're lying.

255
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,660
I don't believe you've really fallen for the Princess.

256
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,520
Axu,

257
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
in your heart,

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,860
is there truly nothing left of me?

259
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,840
Xu.

260
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,450
Are you still there, Xu?

261
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Xu.

262
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,920
What's with those black lines on your hand?

263
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,580
It's part of my character design.

264
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,400
That's such a vague answer.

265
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,490
It's the system's restriction and punishment for players.

266
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
When this blood line

267
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,760
reaches my heart,

268
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,680
I'll die.

269
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,490
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

270
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,280
I haven't failed yet, have I?

271
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,680
You're worried about me.

272
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,320
No, I'm not!

273
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,640
Nange.

274
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,160
Go tell the chief steward to pack up.

275
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,020
Leave the Princess's mansion by tomorrow morning.

276
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,320
Yes.
