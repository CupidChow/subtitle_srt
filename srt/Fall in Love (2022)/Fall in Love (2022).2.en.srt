[Episode 2]

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,999
So regarding the follow-up, I hope you can keep up the good work, General Manager Chen.

17
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:50,639
Please don't worry about that. Miss Jing is constantly looking for her ex, who has abandoned her.

18
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,279
She isn't in the mood to manage the hotel.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,099
She'll make an appointment with me after reading the documents.

20
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,640
Miss Jing is quite pitiful.

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,939
- She just returned to the country a year ago...
- All right. Then I'll wait for your good news.

22
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,620
I'm uninterested in anything else.

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,039
Then I'll leave first. No need to see me out.

24
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,430
Come, Subei.

25
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,880
Hello.

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,280
- Yay!
- How did you do that?

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
Drink it!

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,080
Drink it properly. Can you even do it?

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,740
It's your turn.

30
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,860
Another two rounds.

31
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,579
Boss, get me another glass of whiskey!

32
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,040
I didn't order this.

33
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,960
It's a gift from the gentleman over there.

34
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,159
He said this drink matches your temperament perfectly.

35
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,999
What beverage is this?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,940
It's a refreshing sparkling cocktail.

37
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,019
It's called "Raspberry."

38
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,059
Billy?

39
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,879
Hey, Miss!

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,819
I don't like Billy.

41
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:24,279
All guys named Billy are scum.

42
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,099
Give me another glass of whiskey. Hurry up.

43
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,780
Say, that girl has quite a strong personality.

44
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,379
Maybe you'll return empty-handed tonight.

45
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,220
She doesn't look like she can hold her liquor well.

46
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,459
Just watch and learn.

47
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,539
The drinks here are very good, right?

48
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:52,980
If you want more, I can buy you a drink.

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,899
I'm not drunk.

50
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:59,779
You'd better not try anything funny.

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,439
Since you're apologizing, you should drink this to show your sincerity.

52
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,839
Fine.

53
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,659
Who are you?

54
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,299
I'm her friend. She can no longer drink. I'll drink on her behalf.

55
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,849
Fu Zeyi?

56
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:41,590
What are you doing here?

57
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,999
I think I'm drunk for real this time.

58
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:48,059
You're indeed drunk. Come on, I'll send you back.

59
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,599
Let's go.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,239
We can sit over there.

61
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,159
Are you sure you can walk?

62
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,139
Sit quietly.

63
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,749
Fu Zeyi...

64
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,905
I'm sure I'm still drunk.

65
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,260
Huh?

66
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:46,186
Is he actually real?

67
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,719
Why did you bring me to a hotel? You pervert!

68
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,739
Fu Zeyi?

69
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,559
Fu Zeyi?

70
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,699
It feels terrible, right?

71
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,939
Who told you to drink when you can't even hold your liquor?

72
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,899
Whose blood is this?

73
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,216
I'm not wounded.

74
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,939
You must be Lin, right?

75
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,399
That's why you saved me.

76
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,539
You should hurry and wake up.

77
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:09,819
I have plenty of questions for you.

78
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,339
Can you get me a first-aid kit?

79
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:20,619
- Miss, here's your first-aid kit.
- Thank you.

80
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,819
Do you need assistance?

81
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,959
It's fine. Thank you.

82
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,059
This might hurt a little.

83
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,039
Bear with it, okay?

84
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,039
You're a man! Can't you even endure the pain?

85
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,699
If you keep screaming like this, people in other rooms might think that I'm doing something to you.

86
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,639
Not bad at all.

87
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,860
It'll be too obvious when he leaves the hotel.

88
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,639
No. I should change it.

89
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,639
Isn't this too feminine?

90
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,899
I think a simple bandage works best for you.

91
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,959
So you said you didn't know me this morning at the Aizhe Hotel

92
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,379
because you didn't want to make things difficult for me, right?

93
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,899
How much did he drink to get this drunk?

94
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,419
You!

95
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,420
Don't mess around.

96
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,979
Don't take off your shirt!

97
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:53,979
Hey! You can't take it off below!

98
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,479
Hey, don't misunderstand my intention.

99
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:16,060
It's because you saved me before. That's why I...

100
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,860
I-I'm taking care of you.

101
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,499
What are you trying to do?

102
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,620
You...

103
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,140
What are you doing? You're crushing me.

104
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,179
Something is off.

105
00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,299
How much did you drink to get this drunk?

106
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,979
You don't smell like alcohol.

107
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:07,759
Since you're apologizing, you should drink this to show your sincerity.

108
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,579
Could it be that it was fake alcohol?

109
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,959
S-Since

110
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,339
you saved me, I won't hit you this time.

111
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,419
I'll count to three. You should get up by then.

112
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:28,333
Three,

113
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:32,302
two,

114
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:36,083
one.

115
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,039
Listen, you're the one who's lying on my arm and preventing me from leaving.

116
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,479
You better don't try anything funny.

117
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,699
If not, I'll show you no mercy.

118
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,179
Are you already awake?

119
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,680
Take a look at this paragraph.

120
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,039
- Morning, Director Fu.
- Morning, Director Fu.

121
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,379
Morning, Director Fu.

122
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,679
- Morning, Director. Fu.
- Morning, Director Fu.

123
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,639
- Morning, Director. Fu.
- Morning, Director Fu.

124
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,019
Why did I get myself involved with that woman again?

125
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,159
Director Fu has never been late to work. We couldn't get in touch with him for the entire night.

126
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,290
I'm sure he was kidnapped.

127
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,220
Look.

128
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,999
What are you guys doing?

129
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,119
The kidnappers will call us anytime.

130
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:03,119
- Kidnappers?
- We told you to be quiet.

131
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:07,559
Director Fu has been kidnapped. Later, the kidnappers might call us to demand a ransom.

132
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,900
- Go, go!
- You pick it.

133
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,720
I can't.

134
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,239
Hello?

135
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,399
You dialed the wrong number.

136
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,119
- Director Fu.
- Director Fu.

137
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,819
- Whose signature do you need?
- Junior Director Fu's.

138
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,339
- Come here.
- What's wrong, Senior?

139
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,019
Be careful.

140
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:43,480
Junior Director Fu has already returned safely. What are you worried about?

141
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,600
You're new to Fu Group. I've been working here for eight years.

142
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,059
He has never skipped our weekly Monday meeting before.

143
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:50,579
I'm sure something happened to him.

144
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:52,479
Anyway, we should be cautious.

145
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Senior, can you accompany me?

146
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,059
Just go alone.

147
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,899
Senior...

148
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,259
Junior Director Fu.

149
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,338
I need your signature for this document.

150
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:11,899
Please sign here.

151
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,499
What are you doing? You're crushing me.

152
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,139
I'll head out if there's nothing else.

153
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:38,459
That was scary. Senior was right.

154
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,659
Fu Zeyi?

155
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,139
Fu Zeyi?

156
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,340
Why did he pay me?

157
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,299
Is he doing it again?

158
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,839
- Hello?
- Fu Zeyi,

159
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,679
what do you mean by leaving your card behind?

160
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,519
I don't mean anything in particular.

161
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,879
You can see it... as your compensation.

162
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:56,599
Compensation? Why are you compensating me?

163
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,179
Nothing happened between us.

164
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,379
That's right.

165
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:06,219
Nothing happened between us.

166
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,059
So you're deliberately trying to humiliate me again?

167
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,899
You can think whatever you like. This is how I treat strangers.

168
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,230
[Jian Bufan]

169
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,099
Hello?

170
00:19:33,099 --> 00:19:36,459
Older Sister, hurry and come back! Dad is going to kneel and apologize to Fu Zeyi!

171
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,260
What?

172
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,419
Director Jing, you're finally back! Your cousin can't take it anymore.

173
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:43,220
- Where are they?
- Upstairs. Let's hurry.

174
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,759
All right.

175
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,339
Jian Bufan! Open the door for me!

176
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,140
Dad, just wait a little longer!

177
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,719
Older sister will be here soon!

178
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:54,679
- Open the door!
- Older sister will be here soon!

179
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,559
I don't believe that I can't make him cancel the debt.

180
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,459
- Older Sister, you're finally back.
- You brat!

181
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:06,939
How dare you sell me out?

182
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,559
- I-I'll teach you a lesson today!
- Uncle!

183
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:12,199
- I...
- Uncle!

184
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,660
Uncle, please calm down.

185
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,899
There is no secret between us in our family.

186
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:21,559
Let's talk inside.

187
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,259
Let's go. Let's talk inside. Let's talk inside.

188
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,919
Come.

189
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,979
Have a seat.

190
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,639
Uncle. Say, should we use

191
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:43,139
Simmental cow leather from the high plateaus in Europe or Shinki-Hikaku shell cordovan from Japan

192
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:46,039
for the boss's new chair?

193
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,859
I think Shinki-Hikaku shell cordovan from Japan.

194
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:51,359
Cow leather is too ordinary.

195
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,140
This Shell cordovan is special.

196
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,579
As the saying goes, we lick one's boots.

197
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,459
Boots made from shell cordovan are superior and easy to lick.

198
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,779
Have you guys ever heard that licking one's boots is a bad thing?

199
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,559
Uncle, you see,

200
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,360
when you sit on this chair,

201
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,199
you do look and behave like a president.

202
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,599
Even if I were to leave the hotel

203
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,539
and leave it to you one day,

204
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,559
I could be at ease.

205
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,339
Really?

206
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,660
That's enough. I already answered your question.

207
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,979
I'll look for Fu Zeyi right now.

208
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:34,779
Fu Zeyi?

209
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,239
Uncle, didn't you say that you wouldn't compensate him?

210
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,660
I did a background check on this Fu Zeyi.

211
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,739
He is totally ruthless.

212
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:50,679
He's a true profiteer.

213
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:53,199
I do think he's devious enough to send me to prison.

214
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,179
However, during the investigation process,

215
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,639
I discovered... a shocking secret.

216
00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,879
- A secret?
- What is it?

217
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,259
He was missing for three months

218
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,939
from August to October last year.

219
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,459
- I intend to use this fact...
- Three months?

220
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:15,139
to blackmail him and ask him to let me off.

221
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,059
What have you found then?

222
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,059
Nothing.

223
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,139
Why were you so excited if you found nothing?

224
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:29,959
It's precisely because of that fact that I know he's hiding something.

225
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,739
Think about it.

226
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:34,559
What was he doing and who was he with

227
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,399
during those three months?

228
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,879
Fu Zeyi went missing for three months

229
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:48,819
during the time he got to know me.

230
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,900
When did you get an Amex Centurion Card?

231
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,819
Don't tell me Fu Zeyi gave you that?

232
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
Wait,

233
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,800
you didn't even change your clothes.

234
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,999
This means you didn't return home last night.

235
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,300
And Fu Zeyi gave you an Amex Centurion Card this morning.

236
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,100
What did you two do last night?

237
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,300
You shouldn't meddle with an adult's affair.

238
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,800
He just seems like a troublesome character.

239
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,719
I just don't want you to be bullied.

240
00:23:18,719 --> 00:23:20,200
Tell me.

241
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,600
How can a person change so drastically in just one year?

242
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,100
Maybe...

243
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,839
he was possessed?

244
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,500
Come on, be serious.

245
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,200
Maybe he lost his memories?

246
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,500
Right?

247
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,599
That's what I thought, too.

248
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,700
I must get to the bottom of this.

249
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,600
No problem. Just leave this to me.

250
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Do you know how to solve this?

251
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
I'll interrogate him by force.

252
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,700
You mustn't hit him.

253
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,400
It's wrong to resort to violence.

254
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,900
Don't worry. I'll vent out your anger on your behalf.

255
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,859
Just wait here, Older Sister.

256
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,100
Fu Zeyi.

257
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Fu Zeyi, come out. I know you're inside.

258
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,200
Fu Zeyi.

259
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,400
Were you looking for me?

260
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,259
Stop!

261
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,379
Ai Xin, happy graduation.

262
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:31,680
♫  I have confessed to you twice  ♫

263
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,280
♫  Keeping my bottom line intact  ♫

264
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,700
Thank you.

265
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,799
- Ai Xin! Come here!
- Ai Xin! Come here!

266
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,000
- Coming!

267
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Senior Sister!

268
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,338
I...

269
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,019
I like you.

270
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,700
♫  Were you expecting it to be like a scene in a movie?  ♫

271
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,200
I'm sorry.

272
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't date a boy who's 150 cm (59 inches) tall.

273
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,800
Senior Sister, I've been playing basketball.

274
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,100
I'll grow to 180 cm (71 inch) soon.

275
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,100
Will you then go out with me?

276
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,100
We can talk about it once you're 180 cm tall.

277
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,159
Senior Sister, I will do my best! You must wait for me!

278
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,100
I'm 185 cm (73 inch) tall now.

279
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,179
Who are you?

280
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,000
She actually forgot about me!

281
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,900
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

282
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,200
I won't drink.

283
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,899
Adulterated liquor is really dangerous.

284
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:43,659
I swore that I'd never drink again.

285
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,359
So did something happen between you two

286
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,700
because you got drunk last night?

287
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,499
What could happen between us?

288
00:25:52,499 --> 00:25:55,499
He said he didn't know me.

289
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,000
You're right.

290
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,500
What could happen between you two?

291
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,800
He already said he didn't know you.

292
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,879
Don't tell me you still want to embarrass yourself in public?

293
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,539
Was it that embarrassing?

294
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,200
It was so embarrassing!

295
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,859
If only I could dig a hole and hide in it.

296
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,300
No matter what, we're considered old flames.

297
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,019
How could he forget about me?

298
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
Could it be

299
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,200
that his brain was damaged because of an accident?

300
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,200
That's right. I'm sure his brain was damaged.
