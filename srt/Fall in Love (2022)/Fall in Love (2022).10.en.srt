163
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,909
That's right. I wish to ask

164
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:46,609
if I'm mentally ill because I have such conflicted feelings?

165
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,789
Actually, what I wanted to say

166
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:54,649
was that we usually don't meddle with cases like this where you date two boyfriends at once.

167
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:58,110
I suggest you talk to your bosom friends.

168
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,689
Maybe she can ease your guilty conscience.

169
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:06,181
You're so unprofessional!

170
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,900
Two boyfriends?

[Aizhe Hotel]

172
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,269
Director Fu? Why are you still here?

173
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:24,049
What's the matter?

174
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:26,609
Director Sheng is on his way here after changing his schedule.

175
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,969
We'll have the meeting inside the presidential suite. You have to get prepared.

176
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,489
What should I prepare?

177
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:36,229
Didn't you say that you found a way to persuade Director Sheng?

178
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:39,809
You must be kidding me, right?

179
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,289
Director Fu, this is bad.

180
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:44,900
The painting we bought was stolen by someone else who offered a higher price.

181
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,560
- Painting?
- That seller is so unreliable.

182
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,079
What should we do now?

183
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,099
Your meeting with Director Sheng will decide if you get to return to the Fu Group.

184
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,459
This is such an important meeting. Why didn't Fu Zeyi tell me about it?

185
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:00,479
What should I do? I'm done for this time.

186
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,334
Director Sheng, why did you come to see Fu Zeyi in advance?

187
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:06,594
Although I did promise him that I would give him a chance,

188
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,659
I still need to test him.

189
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,639
A surprise visit is a good idea.

190
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,800
Oh, I got it now.

191
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,739
Companies that are qualified to cooperate with us must always be prepared.

192
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,589
Hello, Director Sheng. Please have a seat.

193
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,969
The sudden change in my schedule didn't affect you, right?

194
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,389
Director Sheng, I heard that you're fond of paintings?

195
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,209
Could it be that you're not prepared for our meeting yet?

196
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,229
How could that be, Director Sheng?

197
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,349
Director Fu,

198
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:58,609
this is the gift you told me to prepare for Director Sheng.

199
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,829
Because you're the person I trust the most.

200
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:04,889
After this, if something happens during the negotiation with Yiju Home Furnishing,

201
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,689
this box will be the key for us to turn the tide.

202
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,149
Fanmu Home Furnishing Brand Transfer Contract?

203
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:23,964
Isn't Fanmu a brand under Director Fu? Do you wish to give Fanmu to Yiju?

204
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,669
Junior President Fu,

205
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:31,409
are you sure about this?

206
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,330
Yes.

207
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,809
Did someone actually sat yes to a business deal that would result in a loss?

208
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,629
It's because I think Fanmu Home Furnishing has great compatibility with your company.

209
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:53,349
If your company can take over Fanmu Home Furnishing, you'll definitely get an edge

210
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,981
in the industry as a high-end brand.

211
00:13:55,981 --> 00:13:56,889
That's right.

212
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,149
Why are you helping us to get an edge in the industry in this case?

213
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,550
He has so many questions. Since you're asking me questions,

214
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,180
I'll ask you back.

215
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:11,809
Director Sheng, why do you think I'm offering the brand to you?

216
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,150
When Yiju Home Furnishing becomes more popular,

217
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,350
the Fu Group will establish the new business district around Yiju Home Furnishing.

218
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:25,269
If we work together, no matter where Yiju Home Furnishing is, it'll be the new central business district.

219
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,849
That's right.

220
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,869
That's what I was thinking, too.

221
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:40,089
It would be terrifying to become Fu Zeyi's enemy.

222
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,440
I've calculated it. If we cooperate with Fanmu Home Furnishing,

223
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,260
the profit within the next three to five years will be significant.

224
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:51,589
Junior President Fu, you're very creative.

225
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,030
However, according to my knowledge, the right to development

226
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,090
has always been in the hands of Fu Shengrong.

227
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,829
How do you plan to execute it?

228
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:04,590
The way you do things is vastly different

229
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,139
from a traditional furniture store like ours.

230
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,879
What would Fu Zeyi say if he was here?

231
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,289
Although Director Fu may look cunning,

232
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,569
cruel, and selfish usually...

233
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,970
That's not what I mean.

234
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,889
But that isn't the real him.

235
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,449
The real him is cold on the outside, but passionate on the inside.

236
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:28,900
He's considerate,

237
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,469
wise, introverted,

238
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,165
and capable.

239
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,949
Miss, we met before, right?

240
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:42,350
My name is Jing Zhixia. I'm from Aizhe Hotel.

241
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,130
Do you mean the hotel that the Fu Group purchased recently?

242
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,889
That's right. Therefore, I also have the right to voice my opinion.

243
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:52,449
Ever since Director Fu joined us, not only did he solve our financial crisis for us,

244
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:54,629
he also offered practical assistance.

245
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:59,770
That's why I believe that a win-win situation can be achieved if you work together with him.

246
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,349
Since you're already saying that,

247
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,289
shall we sign the contract now?

248
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,569
Looking forward to working with you, Director Sheng.

249
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:17,849
Likewise.

250
00:16:17,849 --> 00:16:19,929

00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:29,180
You're really bold.

253
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,239
If Director Sheng rejected us, they would have taken Fanmu Home Furnishing for free.

254
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,911
I already predicted that he would cooperate with us.

255
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,231
- Are you that amazing?
- But of course.

256
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,674
Fu Zeyi is the amazing one here.

257
00:16:41,674 --> 00:16:44,494
I almost ruined his plan.

258
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,479
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

259
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,740
You don't look too good.

260
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,299
Let me send you back.

261
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:58,779
Director Fu, the president is still waiting for your contract in the office.

262
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:01,699
You need to attend tonight's celebratory banquet too.

263
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:06,629
It's fine. You can report to your father first.

264
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,929
If not, he would think that you were goofing around again.

265
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,409
I can return by myself. Don't worry.

266
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:13,909
Miss Jing, I'll see you out.

267
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,810
- Goodbye.
- Be careful, okay?

268
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,769
I can see myself out. You can resume your work.

269
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:25,849
Miss Jing, please take care.

Likewise.

274
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:04,289
After this phase, everything else will be a piece of cake.

275
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:05,770
I think so, too.

Xiao Yang, why are you only here by now?

277
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,269
- I rushed here, but I still couldn't make it in time.
- Come on. Let's go inside.

Xiao Yang found a bracelet just now. I think it belonged to Miss Jing. Take a look.

- Doctor!
- Calm down.

307
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:36,389
She just fainted due to hypoglycemia.

308
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:38,249
Hypoglycemia?

309
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:40,739
Why did it end up like this then?

310
00:21:40,739 --> 00:21:45,559
When she fainted, her head hit the floor first and caused a concussion.

311
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,979
That's why she fell unconscious. Although hypoglycemia isn't anything serious,

312
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:51,539
accidents will occur if there's no one beside her when she faints.

Are you sure it's only hypoglycemia?

It's not her first time experiencing heart palpitations.

Heart palpitations and shaky hands are all symptoms of hypoglycemia.

She'll regain consciousness soon.

320
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,509
Thank you, Doctor.

321
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,329
Sister!

322
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,329
Quiet down.

323
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,129
Is she okay?

324
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:48,969
She'll be fine.

325
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,309
She just fainted due to hypoglycemia.

326
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:54,149
That's good to hear.

327
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,789
Director Fu, I've completed the hospitalization procedure for her.

328
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:07,549
Thank you.

329
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,110
- You should return and rest.
- All right.

330
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,549
Jian Bufan,

331
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:17,019
you should return and rest, too. Director Fu will keep her company.

332
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,319
In this case, I'll leave my sister to you now.

333
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,279
I'll come back tomorrow morning.

334
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,679
Director Fu, I will leave as well.

335
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,379
Thank you.

336
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,999
Zeyi, it's all my fault.

337
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,700
Back then, I only thought of sending the contract to your father to accomplish your mission.

338
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,079
If I had sent her home back then, this wouldn't have happened.

339
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,839
Shut up.

340
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:07,294
I don't want to listen to your explanations.

341
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,799
I can forgive you for ruining my career.

342
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,399
I can also forgive you for ruining my chances to return to the Fu Group.

343
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:16,679
I can even forgive you for making my father despise me all my life,

344
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,439
but I cannot forgive you for letting Zhixia get hurt.

345
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,679
Lin, don't blame me for being ruthless.

346
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,339
No one shall hurt Zhixia, not even me.

347
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,059
Hello, Old Mo.

348
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,019
Are you free right now?

349
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,479
Let's meet up.

350
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,879
Jian Bufan.

351
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,780
Why do I feel like you've been avoiding me lately?

352
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,819
Did I do something wrong?

353
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,919
Of course not. Not at all.

354
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,759
Are you sure?

355
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,019
I'll be honest with you then.

356
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:27,379
You see, I have a friend, and her partner is cheating on her.

357
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:28,879
Should I tell her about it?

358
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,799
Is your friend married?

359
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,019
If she's married, that means her partner has already violated the marriage law.

360
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,719
I suggest you tell her as soon as possible.

361
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:38,959
That way, she can gather evidence and protect her assets.

362
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:41,179
She's not married yet,

363
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:42,679
but she'll be soon.

364
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,739
If so, all the more you should tell her about it before she sinks deeper into the pit.

365
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,979
So the friend you were referring to

366
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,839
is me, right?

367
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,399
Look.

368
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,879
She and I have already been together for three years. It's not like I can break up with her on a whim.

369
00:26:21,879 --> 00:26:23,800
So you don't want to break up with her?

370
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,910
Break up with her?

371
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,790
Of course not. You're the person I like.

372
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,379
Thank you for notifying me.

373
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,479
However, I hope you can do me another favor.

374
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,999
No problem.

375
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,239
Please don't tell anyone about this.

376
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,059
Don't create trouble for Ma Shixian either.

377
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,999
Is that it?

378
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,119
My taxi is here. I'll make a move first.

379
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,559
Are you sure you're okay?

380
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,419
I'm fine.

381
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:37,950
[Shixian]

382
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,899
Hi, Senior Sister.

383
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,240
Jian Bufan? What are you doing here at this hour?

384
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,539
I knew you couldn't sleep tonight.

385
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,739
That's why I came here to keep you company.

386
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,599
Why don't you watch while I play basketball?

387
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,219
Maybe you can sleep from the dribbling sound.

388
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,599
You're playing it inside my house? Stop it. It's late now.

389
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:25,699
Look. Are you trying to steal the ball?

390
00:28:25,699 --> 00:28:27,319
Don't move! Just listen.

391
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,739
What are you doing?

392
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,559
Steal it if you can.

393
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,259
Just stop!

394
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,579
No way.

395
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,339
Who the heck is that? Who's playing basketball in the middle of the night?

396
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,299
Don't you know that the soundproofing here is terrible?

397
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,279
Are you trying to get a scolding again? Why are you being so loud?

398
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,359
Who are you trying to scare?

399
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,979
Miss Ai, was there a child playing basketball at your place just now?

400
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:08,399
No. I've always been staying alone.

401
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,659
You're right. Sorry for the interruption.

402
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,459
It's okay. Your hair looks great.

403
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,039
Thank you.

404
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,459
Jian Bufan,

405
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,599
I didn't expect you to be as silly as always.

406
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,699
Don't worry. I've already gotten used to the insomnia.

407
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:39,959
I'll be fine after taking my medicine.

408
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:45,719
No. I have a better idea.

409
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,439
By watching basketball matches?

410
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,779
Fine. I can't win against you. I'll join you today.

411
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:02,359
♫  I'm used to staying awake all night to wait for your text  ♫

412
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:09,899
♫  But this means nothing to you ♫

413
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:17,340
♫  Why am I the only one devoting to this relationship ♫

414
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:24,619
♫  Without any effort, you've made me tie my own hands ♫

415
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:34,079
♫  What should I do to get over you? ♫

416
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,790
♫  I still can't help missing you ♫

417
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,359
♫  When you sleep soundly at night ♫

418
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,699
♫  I'm staying awake alone, I'm suffering from endless nightmares ♫

419
00:30:48,699 --> 00:30:52,410
What do you think? My idea is pretty effective, right?

420
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,299
I'm not sleepy at all.

421
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:00,180
♫  When I open the window to see a night sky without any stars ♫

422
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,159
♫  I always remember your face ♫

423
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:10,859
♫  But I won't expect to see you again ♫

424
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,659
♫  When you sleep soundly at night ♫

425
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,359
♫  I'm staying awake alone, I'm suffering from endless nightmares ♫

426
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:36,159
♫  Perhaps once I stop resisting the feelings, I will fall helplessly for you ♫

427
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,439
♫  When I open the window to see a night sky without any stars ♫

428
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:44,379
♫  I always remember your face ♫

429

♫  But I won't expect to see you again ♫

430
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:18,060
So when you detect that Jing Zhixia is in trouble,

431
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,550
your main personality emerges immediately?

432
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,299
That's right.

433
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,620
Your current condition has already surpassed the range of my medical knowledge.

434
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,700
I think you should come to the hospital again for another checkup...

435
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,919
I don't have time for this!

436
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,399
I want you to treat my condition as soon as possible!

437
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,210
Today's the best proof. I should be the one staying by Zhixia's side.

438
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,790
And it can only be me!

439
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,899
Calm down for now.

440
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,940
The treatment is pretty risky.

441
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,519
Come and see me after you've thought everything through.

442
00:33:16,425 --> 00:33:23,425
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid of being alone  ♫

443
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:30,715
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

444
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:38,675
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

445
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:45,535
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

446
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:53,305
♫  If I decide to be brave this time  ♫

447
00:33:53,305 --> 00:33:59,895
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

448
00:34:00,865 --> 00:34:07,855
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

449
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:14,385
♫  we will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

450
00:34:18,355 --> 00:34:21,870
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:43,390

456
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:49,995
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
