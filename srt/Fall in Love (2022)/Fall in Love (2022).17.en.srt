I heard you came back. I thought I should pay you a visit.

By the way, is there any progress with the equity interest transfer agreement?

Even now, you are still trying to defend him.

If I hand this record to the shareholders,

Go wherever you want without ever leaving again.

166
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,330
And most importantly,

167
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,450
you will no longer be in the shadow.

168
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,493
General Manager Fu, is everything all right?

169
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:56,286
He is just a shadow. Do not be soft-hearted.

170
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,810
I am well aware of that.

171
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,930
He is just a shadow.

172
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,190
After everything is done, even he

173
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,483
will perish.

174
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,419
Fu Zeyi! When will you stop being a coward?

175
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:34,550
You're not the Fu Zeyi I know!

176
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,970
Do you even know

177
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,679
that someone is going after your career, your loved one, and your life?

178
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,737
Why are you here?

179
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,146
Am I not welcome here?

180
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:54,822
Didn't the doctor tell you? I need about three days to recover from surgery.

181
00:21:54,822 --> 00:21:56,252
I'm still Lin.

182
00:21:56,252 --> 00:21:58,070
I know.

183
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,119
With some help, I got the vinyl record of the concert in Vienna last month.

184
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,510
This is for you.

185
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,828
Consider this a parting gift.

186
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,227
Thank you.

187
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:11,279
I thought Martha Argerich was your favorite. You don't seem excited at all.

188
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,530
- Are you under a lot of stress?
- No.

189
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,056
- I want to give it a go right now.
- Let's listen to it together.

190
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:21,363
I'm curious as to why you like Martha Argerich.

191
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:24,399
Sure. Let's go downstairs.

192
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,299
Well? Is this the style you like?

193
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,019
Of course. I love it.

194
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,020
♫  I don't want you to be indifferent  ♫

195
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,329
Fu Zeyi...

196
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,650
So the parting gift and music listening were just a front.

197
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,579
She wants to see if Fu Zeyi is back.

198
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:01,080
♫  I just didn't expect the situation to change suddenly  ♫

199

218
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,030
Fu Zeyi?

219
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,869
When will you be back?

220
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:24,400
♫  You think it's just a pastime  ♫

230
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,850
Be careful.

231
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,180
It's getting late.

232
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,070
I should go home.

233
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,170
Where is my phone?

234
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,450
Did he go out?

235
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,299
Why... Why are you back?

236
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:07,199
I was just about to ask what took you so long?

237
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,310
Were you doing something bad?

238
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,670
What could I possibly do?

239
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,479
All right, jokes aside.

240
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,610
I'm here for my phone.

241
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:23,057
I found it.

242
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,135
Good.

243
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,485
But it's dead.

244
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:28,149
I should go.

245
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:29,699
I'll see you off.

246
00:27:29,699 --> 00:27:31,370
Let's go.

247
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,959
- Stay safe.
- Sure.

248
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,990
Bye.

249
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,120
Why is she here?

250
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,791
She left her phone here.

251
00:27:57,791 --> 00:27:59,661
Her phone?

252
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,690
What are the odds?

253
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,110
That was quite a long recording.

254
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,690
You're here.

255
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:42,762
Who is Lin talking to?

256
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:48,780
You asked to see me. Have you made up your mind?

257
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,530
Isn't he Fu Zeyi's second uncle?

258
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,000
Do you really have a way to wipe out Fu Zeyi?

259
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,483
I can hire the best doctor.

260
00:28:57,483 --> 00:29:01,057
Fu Zeyi's original personality will be wiped away.

261
00:29:01,057 --> 00:29:03,250
What are they talking about?

262
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:07,399
Lin wants Fu Zeyi to perish.

263
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,461
I scratched your back, so you should scratch mine.

264
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:13,799
What do you need from me?

265
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,230
I need your equity interest transfer agreement.

266
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,970
Very well.

267
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,359
How dare you harm Fu Zeyi!

268
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,019
I have the recording as proof! I'll make both of you pay!

269
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:54,150
We have the evidence now.

270
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,710
In that case, we can let her go.

271
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:07,828
It seems your love for her is too deep.

272
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:09,919
Fine. Keep your eyes on her before the annual general meeting.

273
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,410
Don't let her get away.

274
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,340
Two days from now, you'll be the new Fu Zeyi.

275
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,150
The whole Fu Group will be yours.

276
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,530
She will be of no value to you.

277
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,270
Don't let her get away.

278
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,310
I can untie your legs so you can feel better.

279
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,570
This room is the safest place where you can be.

280
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,639
Trust me.

281
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,659
Let me go! Let me go!

282
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,250
Trust me!

283
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,380
Let me go!

284
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,839
I hate you. I hate you!
