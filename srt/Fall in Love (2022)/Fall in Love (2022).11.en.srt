165
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,427
I need to find a way to stay here.

166
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,409
But it's already so late. Perhaps...

167
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:29,069
Are you alright?

168
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,409
I think I sprained my ankle.

169
00:15:31,409 --> 00:15:33,929
Don't chase me away.

170
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:38,069
Even if you wanted to go now,

171
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:40,469
I'd be too worried to let you go.

172
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,880
Zhixia is acting weird today.

173
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,769
What is she up to?

174
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,729
- Be gentle.
- Over here?

175
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,589
Press it. I'll go check it out.

176
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,749
Hello. I just moved in next door.

177
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:37,629
My pipes are leaking.

178
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,029
Could you help me out?

179
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:42,589
I don't know anything about plumbing.

180
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:44,229
It's all right.

181
00:16:44,229 --> 00:16:47,549
Give me a call after you've learned it.

182
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,189
I have a way to stay here.

183
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,069
Jian Bufan, why aren't you leaving?

184
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,289
So I'll watch TV with you for a while.

185
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,720
- Here.
- Thanks.

What did that woman want from you?

222
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,349
Her pipes were leaking. She wanted me to fix them.

223
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:57,589
Leaking pipes in the middle of the night? And she was wearing sexy clothes.

224
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:00,969
- Are you that close?
- No, I had never seen her before.

225
00:20:00,969 --> 00:20:05,029
You talked for so long at your first meeting?

226
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,589
Was it that long?

227
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,690
It was only about one minute.

228
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:14,549
You counted the time. Maybe you want to see her more often.

229
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,069
Sorry, I was wrong.

230
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:25,469
You have my word that from now on, I won't have any contact with her.

231
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:28,469
I'll stay away from her. Okay?

232
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,789
Your word means nothing to me.

233
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:35,609
She lives next door. You see her all the time.

234
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,889
I should stay here in case that woman comes bothering you again.

235
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:43,209
But I feel sleepy already.

236
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:46,749
Go to bed then. I'll leave after you fall asleep.

237
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:50,889
I won't let you go home by yourself, no matter how tired I am.

238
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,149
Forget it. If you want to stay,

239
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:57,709
I'll keep you company for a while.

240
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:06,789
Let's do something to refresh our minds?

241
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,189
That won't be necessary.

242
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:17,189
That won't be necessary.

243
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,249
What can the two of us do now that we are alone?

244
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,389
What do you want?

245
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,229
Maybe we could try something meant for two people.

246
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,189
The two of us?

247
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,930
What poker game do you know?

248
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,589
I only know "Fight the Landlord".
(T/N: Card Game)

249
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:15,490
I'm terrible at that game.

250
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,289
It's all right.

251
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:19,889
What game do you know? We'll play that game.

252
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,669
That's not necessary.

253
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:24,169
Just don't go too hard on me.

254
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:25,680
Sure.

255
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:30,269
I've never lost a game of "Fight the Landlord".

256
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,129
Why don't we play with stakes?

257
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:35,689
Will you use your life's savings as the wager?

258
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,929
In your dreams!

259
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:40,309
The wager shall be...

260
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:43,100
"Truth or Dare."

261
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,409
Sure.

262
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,369
Bring it on.

263
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,960
You lost again.

264
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:58,729
Haven't you made a mistake?

265
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:01,250
You're really not good at the game.

266
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:05,790
This spot has bad feng shui! Let's change it up.

267
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,309
Fine.

268
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,369
Enough! I've had enough of this!

269
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,929
Why are you quitting? You won't know the outcome unless you play.

270
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,909
This is a lousy hand; how can I play with it?

271
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,509
I won't look.

272
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:01,969
You go first. You might win this time.

273
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,209
A number four.

274
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,169
A number seven.

275
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,449
Number eight.

276
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,349
Pass.

277
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,689
Five.

280
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:33,910
Pass.

281
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,560
Six.

282
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,069
Go on.

283
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,229
See? You won.

284
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:48,400
What is your hand? How can you possibly lose?

285
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,000
- Anyway─
- Let me have a look.

286
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,789
Anyway, it was bad.

287
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:56,469
What do you want?

288
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,170

I need you here. Well...

301
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,749
I want to tell you I already have a girlfriend.

- She's smart and sexy!

307
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,949

308
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:46,489
You heard everything.

309
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,349
Since you let me win the last round and got scolded because of me,

310
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,249
I'll give you a reward.

312
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,729

00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:19,589
It's getting late. We'll save this question for another day.

327
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:26,250
♫  When I open the window to see a night sky without any stars ♫

328
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,649
♫  I always remember your face ♫

329
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:34,160
Is there a future for us after tomorrow?

330
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,119
♫  I'm used to staying awake all night to wait for your text ♫

331
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:54,679
♫  But this means nothing to you ♫

332
00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:02,169
♫  Why am I the only one devoting to this relationship ♫

333
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:09,469
♫  Without any effort you've made me tie my own hands ♫

334
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:18,919
♫  What should I do to get over you? ♫

335
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:21,289
♫  I still can't help missing you ♫

336
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:23,089
Sorry.

337
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,149
♫  When you sleep soundly at night ♫

338
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:32,899
♫  I'm staying awake alone, I'm suffering from endless nightmares ♫

339
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:39,619
♫  Perhaps once I stop resisting the feelings, I will fall helplessly for you ♫

340
00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:45,019
♫  When I open the window to see a night sky without any stars ♫

341
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,899
♫  I always remember your face ♫

342
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:50,969
♫  But I won't expect to see you again ♫

343
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:53,569
What's wrong?

344
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,669
It's nothing.

345
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,459
♫  When you sleep soundly at night ♫

346
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:14,099
♫  I'm staying awake alone, I'm suffering from endless nightmares ♫

347
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:20,999
♫  Perhaps once I stop resisting the feelings, I will fall helplessly for you ♫

348
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:26,300
♫  When I open the window to see a night sky without any stars ♫

349
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,169
♫  I always remember your face ♫

350
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:36,929
♫  But I won't expect to see you again ♫

351
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,509
Fu Zeyi, get off of my hair!

352
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:14,220
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid to be alone  ♫

353
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:21,510
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

354
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:29,469
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

355
00:31:29,469 --> 00:31:36,330
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

356
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:44,100
♫  If I decide to be brave this time,  ♫

357
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:50,797
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

358
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:58,649
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

359
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:04,980
♫  it will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

360
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,670
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

361
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:17,370
♫  no matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

362
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:20,629
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

363
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:24,179
♫  Just to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

364
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,590
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

365
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:34,190
♫  all my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

366
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:40,690
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
