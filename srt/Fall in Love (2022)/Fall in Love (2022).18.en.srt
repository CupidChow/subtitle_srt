No!

I can hire the best doctor.

33
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,960
Fu Zeyi's original personality will be wiped away.

34

That's the end of our deal.

35

Stay away from Jing Zhixia from now on.

Next, I have a job for you.

37
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:46,839
You are clearly in love with Jing Zhixia.

38
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,250
You must really want to live a peaceful life with her.

Then everything that belongs to Fu Zeyi will be yours.

You should eat.

You haven't had anything the whole day.

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,660
You're wasting your time.

45
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,859
I'd rather die of starvation than eat anything you make.

46
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:53,280
Just eat a little bit.

47

No!

48
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,880
After what I did, you still aren't angry at me?

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,150
I won't be angry at you.

50
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,360
That's because I like you.

51

I like Fu Zeyi, and you will never have my heart.

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,880
Are you mocking me?

Tell me,

57
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,170
Fu Zeyi is such an arrogant and selfish person,

58
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,870
why does he deserve your love?

59
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,910
No one deserves it more than him.

60
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,339
He just doesn't know how to express it.

61
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:51,070
He bought the bag I wanted, but he gave it to me in the silliest way possible.

62
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,859
He doesn't like kids, animals, or cooking, and he hates playing the piano.

63
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:02,370
But for me, he'd make one exception after another.

64
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,079
He'd even risk his career on a bet to spite me.

65
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,419
That side of Fu Zeyi is great.

66
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:14,199

I object.

133

Senior Director Fu had just retired and ill fate struck him and his son right before this annual general meeting.

That can't be a mere coincidence.

Are you implying something?

136
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,340
Junior Director Fu's death was too peculiar.

137
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,330
It's normal for me to suspect this.

138
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,810
Indeed.

139
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,440
I think it's very suspicious.

140
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,840
Very well.

141
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,840
I'll address that.

142
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,979
It's perfectly reasonable for Old Li to have suspicions.

143
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:26,359
After all, Zeyi was young and had a promising future.

144
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:28,830
As his second uncle,

145
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,919
I had responsibilities.

146
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,100
If I had noticed his health was deteriorating,

147
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,250
perhaps he could have...

148
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,179
What sickness was it?

149
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,750
You may read this document.

150
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,980
What in the world is this?

151
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,020
What kind of sickness?

152
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,990
We didn't know this.

153
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,650
- What's going on? Junior Director Fu had a depression?
- What's your opinion on this?

154
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,380
This is a big deal.

155
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,980
I didn't want to reveal it.

156
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,479
After all, that's Zeyi's personal matter.

157
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,950
But then I realized why he wanted me to have the shares so suddenly.

158
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,210
The boy was already putting his affairs in order.

159
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,239
Such sickness at such a young age?

160
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,310
What a pity.

161
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,800
It's all the more reason for all of us to stay united.

162
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,719
We will now elect Shengrong as our new president.

163
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,220
Is there any objection?

164
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,359
I hereby announce that...

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,260
I object!

166
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,740
Who is that? Who exactly is that?

167
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,300
Director Fu?

168
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,450
- I thought he is sick.
- He's in bad health.

169
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,500
What is he doing here?

170
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,750
What's going on?

171
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,220
Didn't he just say he was sick?

172
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,280
He looks quite healthy.

173
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,680
What is happening?

174
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,390
Is this real?

175
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,179
- Didn't you...
- Should I have taken my life because of depression?

176
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,920
Second Uncle, weren't you the one who wanted me dead?

177
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,119
Nonsense!

178
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,530
Your medical record is right here!

179
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Nonsense?

180
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,000
Who's spewing nonsense here?

181
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,399
Get the doctor ready.

182
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,890
I want Fu Zeyi to be silenced after the treatment.

183
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,250
So that's what happened?

184
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,340
Oh my.

185
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,130
How can he do that?

186
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,140
This is fabricated.

187
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,830
That is a fabrication!

188
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,190
This recording was the conversation between you and your secretary.

189
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,570
Ai Xin recorded this.

190
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,870
A token of my appreciation.

191
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,420
Thanks.

192
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,870
I doubt you'd admit it unless I arrived in person.

193
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,360
Lin?

194
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,759
Do you really have a way to wipe out Fu Zeyi?

195
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,859
In that case, we can let her go.

196
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,940
Don't let her get away.

197
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,479
That's the end of our deal.

198
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,050
Stay away from Jing Zhixia from now on.

199
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,120
Wait.

200
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,090
You're Fu Zeyi.

201
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,450
Second Uncle, don't be silly.

202
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,319
I've always been myself.

203
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,150
You set me up.

204
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,090
Haven't you heard?

205
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,510
The wages of sin is death.

206
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,250
When my father had an episode, why didn't you save him?

207
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,699
It was too sudden, what more could I have done? I'm not a doctor.

208
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,240
Do you recognize this button?

209
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,660
My father tore this off your clothes when he had the episode.

210
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,370
Are you questioning me because you found this button?

211
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,290
I'm questioning your conscience!

212
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,810
Do you have nothing more to say?

213
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,250
This is slander!

214
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,539
Shengrong, what is this about? You owe us an explanation.

215
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,859
- Indeed.
- He's right!

216
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:11,800
Second Uncle, how do you explain

217
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,670
this footage then?

218
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,560
Oh my God.

219
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,719
- That's the proof!
- It's him! It's him!

220
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:25,340
So it was you who threw away Senior Director Fu's medicine!

221
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,599
Come on. Explain yourself.

222
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,959
Shengrong! You owe the board an explanation!

223
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,919
Would you even harm your own nephew?

224
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,399
Did he do the same to Senior Director Fu?

225
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,480
How could he!

226
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,759
Shengrong! You don't deserve to inherit the Fu Group!

227
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,159
Fu Zeyi, are you really gone for good after the treatment?

228
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:58,150
I wonder if Meng Po Soup was just as awful as that bowl of soup?
(T/N: The soup that can wipe away people's memory)

229
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,979
It's burned.

230
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,690
He mistook sugar for salt.

231
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,700
I love Fu Zeyi.

232
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,760
I will only love Fu Zeyi for the rest of my life.

233
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,980
What's so funny?

234
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,179
I dare you to say what you said one more time.

235
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,500
What's wrong?

236
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,530
Are you feeling hurt?

237
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,179
Just stay there and wait for me. I'll be back.

238
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,130
He didn't know how to cook.

239
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,350
He's Fu Zeyi!

240
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,989
- Sister?
- Jian Bufan! What are you doing here?

241
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:24,100
Fu Zeyi asked me to come here.

242
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,199
Hang in there. The police will be here soon.

243
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,420
Fu Zeyi?

244
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,750
I knew it was him.

245
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,420
I must go now.

246
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,180
Sis...

247
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,280
All right. We all know the truth now.

248
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,299
Are you going to leave, or should I have you removed?

249
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,970
I have the equity interest transfer agreement.

250
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,759
You don't have the power.

251
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,010
I don't have the power.

252
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
But they do.

253
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,459
Mr. Fu Shengrong. You're now the suspect of a murder.

254
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,119
We need you for the investigation.

255
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,120
Fine.

256
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,720
I'll cooperate.

257
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,790
I'll gladly cooperate.

258
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,380
Run quickly, Director Fu!

259
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,830
- Stop!
- Stop right there!

260
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,560
Fu Shengrong! Stop right there!

261
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,439
Stop! Stop!

262
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,319
Stop! Stop right there!

263
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,400
Stop!

264
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,070
Fu Zeyi knew it all along.

265
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,150
[Fu Zeyi]

266
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,340
Fu Zeyi, answer the phone!

267
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,310
The number you dialed is not available.

268
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,420
Stop right there!

269
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,950
Seal off every exit.

270
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,700
Are you out of your mind?

271
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,360
Watch where you're going!

272
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,140
What do you want?

273
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,470
Stop the car! What are you doing?

274
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,520
What are you doing?

275
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,339
Fu Shengrong! You won't get away with this!

276
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,970
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

277
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,580
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,840

281
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,790
Fu Zeyi!

♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫

286
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Watch out!

287
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,300
Watch out!

288
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,160
Fu Zeyi!

289
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,200
Wake up!

290
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,860
Open your eyes!

291
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,910
Fu Zeyi, wake up!

292
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,570
I'm right here for you.

293
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,839
Fu Zeyi, don't die!

294
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,780
Fu Zeyi!

295
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,790
Wake up!

296
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,090
Wake up!

297
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,459
Wake up! Fu Zeyi!

298
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,090
Fu Zeyi!

299
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,230
Open your eyes!

300
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,270
Don't die!

301
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,730
Watch out!

302
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,170
Fu Zeyi!

303
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,930
Open your eyes!

304
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:10,119
Lin? Did you come and let me save Zhixia?

305
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:13,170
Open your eyes!

306
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,650
Open your eyes! Fu Zeyi!

307
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,520
Don't die!

308
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,170
A'Yi!

309
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,570
Brother, save me!

310
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,290
Help!

311
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:51,550
A'Yi!

312
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,970
A'Yi! Let go of my cousin!

313
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,740
Get away!

314
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,770
- Let go of my cousin!
- Let go!

315
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,070
Pull him away!

316
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:03,770
Go away! Are you dumb?

317
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,079
Brother. Brother? Wake up.

318
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,730
Brother. Wake up. Brother!

319
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,900
Brother.

320
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,910
We agreed to kidnap one kid.

321
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,330
Now we have two of them!

322
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,220
The Fu family is loaded with money.

323
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,239
These two will get us double the money.

324
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,720
Let go of me.

325
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,139
Come on, have a meat skewer.

326
00:24:42,139 --> 00:24:44,100
Are we going to die here?

327
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,910
Someone will come to our rescue. Don't be afraid.

328
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,459
But I'm so scared, Brother.

329
00:24:48,459 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm cold and hungry.

330
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,210
Let me sing you a song.

She is very kind.

It's all right, he has a mild concussion.

There are no other issues.

Thank you, Doctor.

Zhixia, help me up. I want to visit my father.

Stay still.

384
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,699
He's having surgery.

385
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:55,940
You are still a patient.

386
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,359
You heard the doctor. It's a small injury. I'm fine.

387
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,300
Be careful.

388
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,720
Take it easy.

389
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,650

The two surgeries were successful. Mr. Fu is no longer in critical condition.

Everything is all right.

I told you so. You two are overreacting.

397

Of course, he's not your father.

398

If you didn't report my second uncle for his wrongdoing,

he'd still be at large.

403

You shouldn't resign.

Thank you, Director Fu.

405

For many years, I've lived just to repay your uncle's kindness.

00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,839
Then you should have water instead of wine.

497
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,879
Zhixia, why are you...

498
00:39:24,879 --> 00:39:27,570
This makes the food tastier.

499
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,679
Come on, I'll do it for you.

500
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,360
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

501
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,920
Could you serve the dessert?

502
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,360
Is there something wrong with the steak?

503
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,879
No, you misunderstood.

504
00:39:58,879 --> 00:40:01,090
I just have this sudden craving for dessert.

505
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,020
So soon?

506
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,579
Excuse me, could you change this for us?

507
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:08,119
Sure. One moment.

508
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,160
Zhixia,

509
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,170
are you looking

510
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,140
for the engagement ring?

511
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,379
- No.
- No?

512
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,840
Do you want to marry me so badly?

513
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,170
No.

514
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,580
Menglin!

515
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,720
Will you marry me?

516
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,310
Say yes!

517
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:03,720

518
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,300

Jing Zhixia, marry him!

521
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,770
Jing Zhixia, marry him!

522
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,710

523
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,319

Jing Zhixia, marry him! Jing Zhixia, marry him!

525
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,390
Jing Zhixia, marry him!

526
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,220
Zhixia,

527
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,250
will you marry me?

528
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,980
- Say yes!
- Say yes!

529
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,070

531
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,910

542
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,970
Excuse me, Director Fu.

543
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,419
I was told you prepared a special song for the reception.

544
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:04,099
Yes. It's on the desk in my office.

545
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:07,179
- There's a thumb drive. Please get it for me.
- Yes, Sir.

546
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,660
Sir, you raised a wonderful son. He's an outstanding young man.

547
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,690
To witness this wonderful moment, I feel happy for them.

548
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,800
They've gone through a lot.

549
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,840
We should be business partners.

550
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,019
I specialize in the hotel business. I've been running the hotel for over 20 years.

551
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,339
If you ever need it, contact me.

552
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,580
Are you Zhixia's friend?

553
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,179
- I am her uncle.
- Nice to meet you.

554
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:44,820
Nice to meet you.

555
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,719
I run a hotel. Aizhe Hotel is mine.

556
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:50,979
I'm the boss. I'm also the host.

557
00:43:50,979 --> 00:43:54,239
I am hosting this wedding. I have many talents.

558
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,070
Can I add you on WeChat?

559
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,770

Take good care of Zhixia.

571

My daughter will always be cherished.

572
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:00,819
If you don't treat her well, I'm getting her back.

Don't worry.

574
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,000
Don't forget our family precept.

575
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,559
"Do the chores, but wreck the house if I must,"

576
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:11,610
"mess up the laundry if I must."

577
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,030
"Then I won't have to do the chores again."

578
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,339
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and families,

579
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:30,319
the groom Mr. Fu Zeyi has prepared a special song for the bride, Miss Jing Zhixia.

580
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,539
This is the song of their fateful meeting.

581
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:38,399
Let's enjoy the song of their love.

582
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,470
I will repeat every word of it.

583
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,500
I'll make it clear to you

584
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,130
that I love Fu Zeyi.

585
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:50,820

588
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:58,680
I'll make it clear to you...

589
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,190
Turn it off!

590
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,410
They played the wrong file.

591
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:09,980
That's so sweet.

592
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,190
I will repeat every word of it.

593
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,850

I love Fu Zeyi.

601
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,210
I will only love Fu Zeyi for the rest of my life.

602
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,350
You two are fired.

603
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:44,740
I agree.

604
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,999
- I'm fired!
- I just lost my job!

605
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:51,370
Now, please exchange your rings.
