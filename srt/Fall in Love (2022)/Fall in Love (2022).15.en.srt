Thanks.

17
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,199
Miss Jing, do you know why I wanted to see you today?

18
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,889
Please tell me. What is it?

19
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,389
Then I'll get to the point.

20
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,769
You saw the trouble Fu Zeyi was in before, so

21
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,069
I want you to leave Fu Zeyi.

22
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,170
What a coincidence. I was thinking of the same thing.

23
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,590
So I came here to talk about money.

24
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,359
As I expected.

25
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,590
It's about money. Now that's easy to solve.

26
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,350
Tell me. How much do you want?

27
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,179
I want you to take this money.

28
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:51,079
Miss Jing, can you be clearer?

29
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,679
I don't understand.

30
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:56,899
I think the Fu Group isn't interested in running a hotel.

31
00:02:56,899 --> 00:03:01,719
How about we compromise? I want to buy back Aizhe's shares with this money.

32
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,910
Are you saying this money is for me?

33
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,270
Then you'll leave Fu Zeyi. Is that it?

34
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,479
Yes.

35
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,820
Miss Jing, you'd better keep your promise.

36
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,050
It's a deal then.

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,619
A deal?

38
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,919

Is it Fu Zeyi?

43

With this money? I wouldn't agree to it even if she wanted to.

Before I allow you to leave, this money doesn't belong to you.

You got it wrong! That's my money!

Is this small amount of money worth it?

This is my money!

I mean, be careful with my money.

What do you mean by that? Why did you tell my son to pick up your money?

Why don't you give it to him yourself?

Move over.

I'll help you out and make a new one for you.

Besides, your dad doesn't like to lose face. We'll exchange the cover for a book cover.

00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:32,207
As long as you answer my questions, I'll let you go.

321
00:27:32,207 --> 00:27:33,772
What do you want to know?

322
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:36,339
I want to know who Fu Zilin is.

323
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:38,608
Is he related to Fu Zeyi's illness?

324
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:42,940
This concerns my professional ethics.

325
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,985
But!

326
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:47,969
But... how about I tell you a story?

327
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:49,988
It's a nice story.

328
00:27:49,988 --> 00:27:53,648
This story happened twenty years ago.

329
00:27:53,648 --> 00:27:58,292
During the summer solstice twenty years ago, there was a pair of Fu brothers.

330
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:02,010
The kidnapper was the employee of the younger cousin's father.

331
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,609
To take revenge on the younger cousin's father, he kidnapped the younger cousin.

332
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,709
But unexpectedly, they also kidnapped the older cousin.

333
00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:10,784
The older cousin was smart.

334
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:13,603
He broke the window and escaped.

335
00:28:13,603 --> 00:28:18,420
But no one expected him to die after being hit by a car while escaping.

336
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:24,339
This poor older cousin's name was Fu Zilin.

337
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:28,118
The news said he was a pianist prodigy.

338
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:30,541
It turns out

339
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,909
Lin is Fu Zilin.

340
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:38,572
Both of them went through such a traumatic experience.

341
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:42,083
Yeah.

342
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,069
It's only a simple contract.

343
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:52,809
There are three obvious mistakes.

344
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,750
These two are even worse.

345
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,329
I can't believe there are spelling errors.

346
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,689
Tell me. If we send these to our clients, what would they think of our company?

347
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,730
Junior Director Fu's temper is getting worse.

348
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:07,810
That's right.

349
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,329
I'll take these back and review them right away.

350
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,789
Stop right there.

351
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,729
I'll say this one last time.

352
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:22,489
From today on, I never want to see such basic mistakes again.

353
00:29:22,489 --> 00:29:24,009
I'm sorry, Director Fu.

354
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,969
Luckily, Ai Xin is not here.

355
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,829
Fortunately, nothing went wrong.

356
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,345
Fu Zeyi,

357
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,329
you haven't shown up for days now.

358
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:09,033
Zhixia wants me to pretend to be you.

359
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:10,557
I can't continue with this act anymore.

360
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:12,876
The press conference will begin soon.

361
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:14,390
You didn't tell me what to do about it.

362
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,849
What if I make a mistake? Our secrets will be...

363
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,869
Fu Zeyi?

364
00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:22,609
Why are you talking to the mirror?

365
00:30:22,609 --> 00:30:25,369
The press conference will start soon.

366
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:28,729
So I'm practicing... I was practicing my speech.

367
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,590
Here. Let's have some tea.

368
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,430
Let me do it. You can leave.

369
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:49,289
Bei'er, what can I do to help you?

370
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:50,790
My request is simple.

371
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,889
I want Fu Zeyi to kneel and ask for forgiveness.

372
00:30:56,090 --> 00:31:00,869
The day our families announced the strategic cooperation, Fu Zeyi disappeared in the middle of it.

373
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:03,890
My brother may have signed the contract with you,

374
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,829
but the most important jewelry design license agreement hasn't been signed yet.

375
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:10,629
So the contract hasn't come into force yet.

376
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:14,809
I think having Zeyi take care of this is the most important thing to do.

377
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:19,069
Or else, we can't proceed after the press conference.

378
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:24,076
Then he has to kneel and apologize to me.

379
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,759
Stop messing around.

380
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,277
Zeyi is the face of the Fu Group. Kneeling would be outrageous.

381
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:31,019
He doesn't have to apologize,

382
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,250
but I'll sue the Fu Group for copyright infringement.

383
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,252
Let's see how much money he has to compensate.

384
00:31:36,252 --> 00:31:38,651
Are you serious about us compensating for it?

385
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,590
Our families still need to continue to work together.

386
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,549
As long you work with me, I'll only target Fu Zeyi alone.

387
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,329
In that case, we can only do it this way.

388
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:22,420
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid of being alone  ♫

389
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,800
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

390
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,710
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

391
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:44,500
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

392
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:52,340
♫  If I decide to be brave this time  ♫

393
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,740
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

394
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:06,850
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

395
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:13,180
♫  It will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

396
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,840
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

397
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,580
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

398
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,850
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

399
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,340
♫  in order to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

400
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,830
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

401
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:42,390
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

402
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:48,920
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
