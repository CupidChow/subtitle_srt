if I decide to go with this treatment.

that he'll never show himself again,

00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,121
Jing Zhixia.

165
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:50,341
- I...
- I had a crush on you a year ago.

166
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:55,001
After we reunited, your action proved

167
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,721
that our relationship ended a year ago.

168
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:05,642
Thank you for not demolishing the hotel.

169
00:13:05,642 --> 00:13:08,061
I helped you yesterday too.

170
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,621
I guess we're even now.

171
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,579
I had a crush on you a year ago.

172
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,242
After we reunited, your action proved

173
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:23,141
that our relationship has ended a year ago.

174
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:24,862
Lin is a very important person to her.

175
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:26,781
Do you think you can win her heart?

176
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:30,161
Sorry, Director Fu. I'm sorry.

177
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:37,361
Sorry, but the one she likes is me.

178
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:40,041
Shut up. I'm not going to listen to you.

179
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,461
Sorry. Sorry.

181

♫  But I won't expect to see you again  ♫

187
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:20,081
Sorry, Director Fu. Are you all right?

188
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:24,142
How can he be all right? She likes me.

189
00:14:24,142 --> 00:14:26,161
I'm sure you're very jealous now, right?

190
00:14:28,062 --> 00:14:30,741
I'm fine.

194
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:52,941
Yi, why are you here?

195
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,081
I have a very important matter to discuss with you.

196
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:57,681
It's raining heavily out there.

197
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,161
Your shoes are all wet.

198
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:01,562
Don't sit on my sofa when you're all drenched. Stand right there.

199
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,842
He's back.

200
00:15:03,842 --> 00:15:07,022
- When?
- When?

201
00:15:07,722 --> 00:15:09,881
He's always here.

202
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:15,661
This shouldn't happen.

203
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,201
It's only been two days. How could it deteriorate so quickly?

204
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,981
I've no idea.

205
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:23,032
Whatever I'm doing, he is always there.

206
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:25,251
He even tried to provoke me.

207
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:27,931
He told me that Jing Zhixia loves him, not me.

208
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:32,071
Why doesn't it sound like your usual symptoms?

209
00:15:32,071 --> 00:15:34,058
It doesn't sound like you're sick.

210
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,087
It's more like you're heartbroken.

211
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:40,483
Could it be that Lin is your imaginary love rival?

212
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,252
Did Jing Zhixia admit that she likes Lin?

213
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:44,911
That's impossible.

214
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,151
Their relationship ended a year ago.

215
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:52,631
But for Jing Zhixia, you're Lin.

216
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:56,231
She turned you down. Am I right?

217
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:02,291
Not exactly. I haven't confessed my feelings to her.

218
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,911
She never gave me a chance to explain myself.

219
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:06,271
She didn't even allow you to explain yourself.

220
00:16:06,271 --> 00:16:07,571
This is not going to work.

221
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:10,651
I'm talking to you about Lin. What are you talking about?

222
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:14,611
The symptoms you're showing are beyond my area of expertise.

223
00:16:14,611 --> 00:16:18,511
I think you should make a real confession.

224
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:22,391
That's the only way to cure your lovesickness.

225
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,871
Lovesickness?

226
00:16:24,871 --> 00:16:26,511
That's rubbish.

227
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,472
It's definitely lovesickness.

228
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:31,851
Look. You're always thinking about her. How is this not lovesickness?

229
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:34,251
I told you so.

230
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:39,091
Sister, let's have a meal together after work.

231
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,931
I heard that there's a new restaurant near the hotel. It has received pretty good reviews.

232
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,632
I don't think I can make it today.

233
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:47,731
My mom is back. She told me that she's getting married next month.

234
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:50,751
She kept asking me to pick a wedding gown with Ye Ming.

235
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:52,072
What?

236
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:54,472
Are you going to pick a wedding gown with Ye Ming?

237
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:58,751
You can't do that. A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Sister.

238
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,698
I know. It's giving me a headache.

239
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:04,031
Do you know any bridal boutiques? I want a famous one.

240
00:17:04,031 --> 00:17:06,591
I think I have a friend who runs a high-class bridal boutique.

241
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,371
If I remember it correctly, it's called "Dear Wedding Boutique."

242
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:11,911
It's located at Central Square.

243
00:17:14,332 --> 00:17:17,431
Director Fu. This is the timber supplier we're going to meet later at the meal.

244
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:20,551
Jian Bufan. Are you there?

245
00:17:20,551 --> 00:17:22,291
I'll send you the location later.

246
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,432
We're almost done with the provisional contract.

247
00:17:24,432 --> 00:17:26,712
You might need to confirm it for one final time.

248
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,231
I'll get it delivered to you later.

249
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:32,531
Director Fu.

250
00:17:35,832 --> 00:17:39,811
She didn't tell you that she was going for a wedding dress fitting with another man.

251
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:41,911
I think

252
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:45,191
she doesn't care about you at all.

253
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:47,931
Director Fu.

254
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:54,592
The supplier is arriving soon. Can you get the car from the basement?

255
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:57,492
- I'll be waiting for you at the front door.
- Sure.

256
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:02,771
Are you going to pick a wedding gown with Ye Ming?

257
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:07,151
You can't do that. A wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, Sister.

258
00:18:09,272 --> 00:18:11,571
Ai Xin. Pull over.

259
00:18:13,752 --> 00:18:17,131
I need to run some errands. Can you meet the supplier on my behalf?

260
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:21,951
Hi, Sir. How can I help you?

261
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:25,571
Sorry, Sir. You can't enter unless you've made an appointment.

262
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,712
Why don't you wait in the waiting area?

263
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,911
Our customer service manager will attend to you shortly.

264
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:31,651
Sure.

265
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:40,051
Hello, this is "Dear Wedding Boutique."

266
00:18:40,051 --> 00:18:41,811
Hello?

267
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:45,291
Hello?

268
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:09,631
Can you pull this ribbon for me?

269
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:37,451
Thanks.

270
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,331
Why are you here?

271
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:46,811
I should be the one asking this question.

272
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,191
Isn't this during office hours? Why are you here?

273
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,071
- I took a day off.
- Did I approve your request for leave?

274
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,971
Sir. Sir. Sorry.

275
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,571
I'm the fiancé of Zhixia's mother.

276
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:58,251
I asked Zhixia here to try the wedding gown on her mother's behalf.

277
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:00,831
I didn't mean to disturb her work. I'm so sorry.

278
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:03,671
- What?
- Zhixia's mother.

279
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:10,691
Remember to submit your request for leave when you get back to the office.

280
00:20:10,691 --> 00:20:12,791
Don't you have anything else to do?

281
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,651
Can't you just give me a call?

282
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,772
What a coincidence. I see you everywhere I go.

283
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:20,451
Why are you here?

284
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:23,091
My wife and I are checking out the wedding gowns.

285
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:25,431
Are you getting married?

286
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:27,411
Congratulations.

287
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:29,611
- We're not!
- We're not!

288
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:33,131
Did you just have a fight?

289
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,512
It's going to be fine. My wife and I have been together for seven years.

290
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:39,971
We always have petty arguments, too, but it doesn't affect our relationship at all.

291
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,691
It's fine. Enjoy yourselves.

292
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,811
I'll get back to my wife. Don't stay angry at him.

293
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:52,172
- What do you think about this gown?
- It's nice.

294
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:55,091
I'm sure Jingjing will look beautiful in this.

295
00:20:56,212 --> 00:21:00,551
I saw this gown a year ago, and I fell in love with it.

296
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,151
I thought I would have a chance to put it on very soon.

297
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,171
What a beautiful wedding gown.

298
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:10,131
Do you want to try it?

299
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,491
I'm sure you'll look good in it.

300
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,171
It's so ugly.

301
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:21,992
A year ago? A year ago... Can you stop dwelling on the past?

302
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:23,891
What's wrong with me dwelling on the past?

303
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:26,631
I don't know why you refuse to face our past,

304
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:28,712
but it's a very precious memory for me.

305
00:21:28,712 --> 00:21:31,151
I don't care about the memory.

306
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,231
The only thing I care about is the present.

307
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,871
Jing Zhixia, I'm telling you.

308
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:41,831
I like you.

309
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:47,851
You're finally saying this out loud.

310
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:52,231
However, do you think I'll believe a capricious person like you?

311
00:21:52,231 --> 00:21:55,371
You might say you like me today

312
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:57,752
and put a stack of cash by the head of my bed tomorrow.

313
00:21:57,752 --> 00:21:59,691
I have my reasons.

314
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:03,891
Fine, I'm all ears. What are the reasons?

315
00:22:06,112 --> 00:22:07,871
Now you don't know what to say, right?

316
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:10,491
I won't fall for you ever again.

317
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:13,711
I was a fool, and I'm done being one.

318
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:17,331
Madam. Can you please ask the stranger to leave?

319
00:22:17,331 --> 00:22:19,591
He's disturbing me.

320
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:21,271
Sir...

321
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:25,031
I'll book the entire place.

322
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:26,111
All of you, get out.

323
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,371
Do you think you're the only rich person here?

324
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,752
I'll double the offer.

325
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,571
I'll triple it.

326
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,291
You can have this place all to yourself.

327
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:39,011
Zhixia. Zhixia.

328
00:22:39,552 --> 00:22:42,311
Zhixia. Zhixia...

329
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:44,392
Listen to me.

330
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:46,611
Let me go!

331
00:22:46,611 --> 00:22:49,551
Listen to what I have to say. Please.

332
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:57,491
I've never intended to be capricious.

333
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,972
I don't enjoy fooling you, either. It happens because...

334
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:06,911
Because... I lost my memory.

335
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:10,292
- Do you think that's funny?
- I'm not joking.

336
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:12,851
I ran into a car accident a year ago.

337
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:15,271
I lost all my memories after I regained my consciousness.

338
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:18,671
Do you think I'll believe the story you made up?

339
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:21,751
Let's go to the hospital if you don't believe me. We can check the admission records.

340
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:23,831
That's not possible.

341
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:27,451
If you've lost your memory, then who you are now

342
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:28,991
and who you were a year ago...

343
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,551
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

344
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:37,151
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

345
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:40,490
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

346
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,951
♫  Just to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

347
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:47,411
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

348
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:53,951
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

349
00:23:53,951 --> 00:23:56,451
♫  I only want you to be with me  ♫

350
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,831
Sorry. I lied again,

351
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:02,511
because I don't want to lose you.

352
00:24:07,992 --> 00:24:11,431
Oh, no. Why is my heart fluttering?

353
00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:14,010
Am I having heart palpitations again?

354
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:17,330
The old me is dead.

355
00:24:18,852 --> 00:24:21,172
This is the new me.

356
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:26,271
From today on, you have to accept the new me.

357
00:24:27,012 --> 00:24:33,991
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

358
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:40,651
♫  It will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

359
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:45,350
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

360
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:51,411
Fu Zeyi.

361
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,351
Fu Zeyi.

362
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,251
Are you all right?

363
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,491
Is this a consequence of the car crash?

364
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:00,911
Let me send you to the hospital.

365
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,511
I can't go to the hospital. I just need to take a seat.

366
00:25:04,511 --> 00:25:06,732
I'm fine.

367
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:10,350
All right. You take a seat. I'll get you some water.

368
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:41,866
Fu Zeyi. Fu Zeyi.

369
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:49,431
Where are you?

370
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:52,211
Fu Zeyi.

371
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:07,647
Fu Zeyi.

372
00:26:07,647 --> 00:26:12,271
Fu Zeyi. Where are you?

373
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:14,731
Where are you?

374
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,031
Long time no see, Zhixia.

375
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,270
You gave me a scare. I'm so glad that you're fine.

376
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,086
Fu Zeyi,

377
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:54,893
are you all right?

378
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:00,193
I'm fine. It's been a while since I last played the piano.

379
00:28:00,193 --> 00:28:02,350
My wrists aren't feeling too well.

380
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,273
It's nice that you can remember this.

381
00:28:09,414 --> 00:28:12,453
Continue what you're doing. I was trying the clothes next door.

382
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:15,433
You played the piano really well. A thumbs-up for you.

383
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,293
You...

384
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:19,373
Do you know me?

385
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:23,113
Don't you remember who I am?

386
00:28:23,113 --> 00:28:24,713
Who is he?

387
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:28,373
I guess he's still a little light-headed.

388
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,493
That's why he seems a little confused.

389
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:32,633
Have you been suffering from vertigo?

390
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:34,528
- He...
- Yes.

391
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:37,533
Have you done your premarital screening?

392
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:41,053
W-We haven't.

393
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,513
Young lady, let's have a talk. I'll borrow her

394
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:46,513
just for a short while.

395
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:48,053
Go ahead.

396
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,473
Officer.

397
00:29:00,473 --> 00:29:05,593
Did you catch him committing a misdemeanor?

398
00:29:05,593 --> 00:29:07,314
Yes

399
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:09,073
but not really.

400
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:10,953
I didn't exactly catch him doing that,

401
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:12,733
but your boyfriend...

402
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:15,410
He wasn't my boyfriend,

403
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,950
but I guess

404
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,634
now he is.

405
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:24,193
Look. That's why I was asking you if you've done the premarital screening.

406
00:29:24,193 --> 00:29:26,193
I worried about him a lot previously.

407
00:29:26,193 --> 00:29:27,853
What happened?

408
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,913
When I was on duty, I witnessed him being involved in a car crash.

409
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:33,194
- A car crash?
- Yes.

410
00:29:33,194 --> 00:29:36,433
After the crash, he was laying on the road.

411
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,733
He told me he was feeling dizzy.

412
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:42,473
But I suspected that he had suicidal thoughts during that period.

413
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:44,353
What?

414
00:29:44,353 --> 00:29:46,733
When was that?

415
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,634
Lin. Why are you here?

416
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,553
You shouldn't be here.

417
00:30:08,428 --> 00:30:10,387
What are you trying to do?

418
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:15,876
What are you going to do to Jing Zhixia?

419
00:30:15,876 --> 00:30:17,916
I'm talking to you.

420
00:30:22,194 --> 00:30:24,994
Long time no see, Fu Zeyi.

421
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:28,113
That's not what I want to hear right now!

422
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,613
Zeyi,

423
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:39,913
I have a question.

424
00:30:39,913 --> 00:30:42,593
You have to answer me truthfully.

425
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,393
Sure.

426
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,567
I'll answer everything Jing Zhixia wants to know.

427
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:53,667
The police officer told me that he witnessed your accident on the road.

428
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,031
He said that you were suicidal.

429
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:59,026
The officer said that I was suicidal?

430
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,706
What actually happened on the day of the accident?

431
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,600
Get out!

432
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,298
The day I dismissed Zhixia from the hotel,

433
00:31:09,298 --> 00:31:11,413
you were throwing a tantrum and driving dangerously.

434
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,133
You were planning to send both of us to an early grave.

435
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:22,691
Stay away from her!

436
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:26,111
It's a misunderstanding. Why would I try to kill myself?

437
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:29,111
Believe me. There are a lot of things and people in this world

438
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:33,531
that I care for.

439
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:38,511
I drove out to look for you.

440
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:40,592
You know that I'm a bad driver.

441
00:31:40,592 --> 00:31:42,531
Besides, I was in a hurry to find you.

442
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:44,371
That's how the car crash happened.

443
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:47,152
Are you saying that you didn't try to kill yourself?

444
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:49,871
I didn't try to kill myself.

445
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,831
I was trying to find you.

446
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:01,430
- Was that really what was on your mind?
- Was that really what was on your mind?

447
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,991
I will never lie to you.

448
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,851
Now I can rest assured.

449
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:27,871
- I thought you were hiding something from me again.
- I wasn't.

450
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:30,424
I'm glad that we've made things clear.

451
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:32,043
I'll go get changed.

452
00:32:32,043 --> 00:32:33,923
Then let's leave together.

453
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:36,444
Sure. I'll wait for you here.

454
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,148
Hurry up.

455
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,162
Why did you decide to show up now?

456
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,223
Return my body.

457
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,962
Don't worry.

458
00:32:57,962 --> 00:32:59,552
Why?

459
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:03,798
Are you trying to repeat the same trick and break the rules again, just like what you did a year ago?

460
00:33:03,798 --> 00:33:07,509
You refused to go into hibernation and trapped me in here.

461
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,309
Why do you lose your mind every time you see Jing Zhixia?

462
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:16,049
Aren't you trying to do the same thing by receiving Mo Ziqi's treatment

463
00:33:16,049 --> 00:33:18,529
to eliminate me once and for all?

464
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,909
Am I not the brother you care about the most?

465
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:27,329
The calm and collected Fu Zeyi lost his head because of Jing Zhixia too.

466
00:33:27,329 --> 00:33:32,789
In fact, we can discuss this and go back to following the rules we set a year ago.

467
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:35,269
Dr. Mo said this before.

468
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:37,969
This is the best thing about dissociative identity disorder.

469
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,249
Would you have given up on Jing Zhixia if we had talked things over?

470
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:47,029
Do you think you can give up on Jing Zhixia now?

471
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,509
Now that I'm back,

472
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:52,189
I want to find out

473
00:33:52,189 --> 00:33:56,469
what you did with my personality during this time.

474
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,109
I can tell you what I did.

475
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:01,169
Now, Jing Zhixia is my girlfriend.

476
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:03,469
It's time for you to quit.

477
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:32,030
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid of being alone  ♫

478
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:39,420
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

479
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:47,379
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

480
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:54,240
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

481
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:02,010
♫  If I decide to be brave this time  ♫

482
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:08,600
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

483
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:16,559
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

484
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:22,790
♫  we will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

485
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,590
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

486
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:35,290
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

487
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,539
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

488
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:41,990
♫  in order to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

489
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,480
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

490
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,100
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

491
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:58,800
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
