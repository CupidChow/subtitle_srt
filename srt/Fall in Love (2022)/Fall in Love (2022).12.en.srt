When you passed the details of the Fu Group to me,

Hello, Junior Director Fu.

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,599
So it was you.

274
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,279
Junior Director Fu, it seems like you already know who I am.

275
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,159
In that case, please take care of me in the future.

276
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,839
The Fu Group always does business based on one's capability,

277
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,119
not based on ties and relationships.

278
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,119
I've told you before.

279
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:32,479
The Fu Group and Helai Jewelry will form a strategic partnership in the future.

280
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:37,539
I just didn't expect Bei'er to personally promote our cooperation this time.

281
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:39,480
The younger generation is terrific indeed.

282
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,679
Uncle Fu, you flatter me.

283
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,380
I just wanted to test the waters.

284
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,540
I didn't expect it to become the headline.

285
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,239
It seems like everyone is pretty concerned about our lives.

286
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,659
So it was you who hired people to take pictures of me in secret?

287
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:55,080
You should get used to that.

288
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,419
After all, Helai Jewelry never kept a low profile.

289
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:03,760
No matter what, from today onward, we're one family.

290
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,659
You two should go out more often and

291
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:09,059
bond with each other.

292
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,699
Meeting in person leaves a better impression.

293
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,499
I'm looking forward to working with you.

294

Doesn't that mean they need to hold a grand wedding in that case?

299

I won't need to worry about our profits for the next six months.

What does he mean by this?

305
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,459
Was he with your sister before this?

306
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:14,259
Right under my eyes?

What a pity.

309
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:22,499
Dad, whose side are you on?

310
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,339
I'm on the side of logic. It seems like the bird has flown.

311
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:28,499
Who is the bird?

312
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,199
- Sister.

This is the true inheritor of the Jian family's excellent genes.

323
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,179
I'm sure she is heartbroken right now.

324
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,539
What are you saying? Listen up, Jian Bufan,

325
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,859
you cannot judge your sister with your superficial thinking.

326
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,160
Your sister is going all out right now.

327
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,919
She's going through a transformation and doing her best at work.

328
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,559
Look at me.

329
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,740
Under my excellent management,

330
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,959
the hotel's performance has been improving steadily. You're the only one who's dragging us down.

331
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:28,259
You're not allowed to interrupt Zhixia when she's working. If not, I'll teach you a lesson.

332
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,239
This kid is getting better and better.

333
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,059
I guess I need to keep her company more often.

334
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,299
Look.

335
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,290
She blocked me.
[Jing Zhixia]

336
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,479
You weren't willing to admit it when you were in the hospital.

337
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,779
I knew you were still deeply in love with Miss Jing.

338
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:06,959
Am I right? Blocking you isn't a huge deal.

339
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:09,979
That means she still cares about you.

340
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:12,199
- Really?
- Yes.

341
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:13,519
Look at you.

342
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,999
Our Director Fu, who's always composed and calm,

343
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,419
is actually not confident in himself right now.

344
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:21,299
Look at your scandals. It's all over the news.

345
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,639
Of course, Miss Jing will be angry.

346
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:25,839
That means

347
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,699
it's better for her to be angry than to ignore me.

348
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,159
Then I know what to do now.

349
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,459
Uncle Fu always wanted us to see each other.

350
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:51,039
However, it's really difficult to see you.

351
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,459
Tell me then.

352
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,759
What kind of cooperation do you want?

353
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,159
I wish to turn our cooperation into a marriage alliance.

354
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,379
A marriage alliance?

355
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:04,960
A marriage alliance for the two enterprises.

356
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,619
Actually, it's just like a wedding. We're excluding the others,

357
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:11,459
but it's between two enterprises.

358
00:25:11,459 --> 00:25:14,259
Do you wish to use me to create more scandals again?

359
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,259
Junior Director Fu, is it inconvenient for you?

360
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,619
Do you have a girlfriend?

361
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,979
I thought you recently broke up with her.

362
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,559
Did you do a background check on me?

363
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,439
This is due diligence for business cooperation.

364
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,399
It's written in the contract.

365
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:48,380
I even know that you don't have any bad habits.

366
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,599
However, no one is perfect.

367
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,739
Maybe our due diligence isn't complete enough.

368
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:58,259
I still need time to get to know you better.

369
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,079
I even prepared some PR scripts for the marriage alliance.

370
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,960
We'll create a publicity stunt with rumors about our wedding.

371
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,959
By then, I think it will be on the headline of every news there is.

372
00:26:11,959 --> 00:26:14,340
When the share prices of our enterprises rise...

373
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,059
After that, we'll tell the press that this is just a strategic partnership. Am I right?

374
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,959
Junior Director Fu, you're intelligent indeed.

375
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,459
That's why

376
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,559
we need to let the media know that we're a couple right now.

377
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,774
It seems like this ball is very special to you.

378
00:26:46,775 --> 00:26:50,034
However, you need

379
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:52,339
to get over the past now.

380
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,919
Fine.

381
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,199
This time, I have a request.

382
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,019
Hype up the news as much as you can.

383
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:18,179
I want every corner of the world to know about this.

384
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,999
Sure.

385
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,290
Jing Zhixia, although you know that I'm not Lin,

386
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,150
I don't believe that you can react indifferently to me.

387
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:35,939
Okay. I will prepare all legal details by today.

388
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,299
Okay. No problem.

389
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,119
Okay, thank you.

390
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,679
Ai Xin.

391
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,959
Ai Xin. Ai Xin.

392
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,100
I think there's no need for us to talk anymore.

393
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,419
Ai Xin, hear me out.

394
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:02,879
I know my fault now. Can you please forgive me?

395
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:05,679
You either don't cheat, or you cheat all the time.

396
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,599
Yet you want me to forgive you?

397
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,599
That's impossible.

398
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,019
We've been together for so many years.

399
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:16,099
I don't believe that you can give it up just like that.

400
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:19,139
I know your personality well. It's difficult to cultivate a relationship.

401
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:21,899
Don't tell me you could find yourself another three-year relationship?

402
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,339
So you know it's difficult, too.

403
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,599
But I'm sorry about that. I already have a boyfriend.

404
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,659
Who is it?

405
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,179
Is it that man I saw last time?

406
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,480
His name is Jian Bufan, right?

407
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,139
I don't think I have to tell you that.

408
00:28:40,369 --> 00:28:43,118
What are you doing? Ma Shixian!

409
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:46,831
The diamond on Auntie's wedding ring this time is huge.

410
00:28:50,717 --> 00:28:51,940
Senior Sister?

411
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,720
How dare you steal my girlfriend? Just you wait.

412
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,520
I'll wait for you outside Ai Xin's house.

413
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,059
Ma Shixian?

414
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:00,779
Return my phone to me!

415
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,719
Senior Sister?

416
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,779
It's getting late.

417
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,979
I'll head upstairs now. You should go back.

418
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,039
The reporters are still outside.

419
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,159
Let's get out of the car together.

420
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,619
I'll get you a cup of water.

421
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,779
These two cups don't fit the interior design of your house.

422
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,919
I'll throw them away for you.

423
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,459
Where are you going?

424
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,039
Do you guys have a female housekeeper at home?

425
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,319
Since no one is wearing them,

426
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:42,319
you should throw them away.

427
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,279
Isn't your bed too soft?

428
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,919
I need a new set of pillows, blankets, and bedsheets.

429
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:51,759
I don't like used sheets.

430
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:54,279
There's no reporter in my house.

431
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:56,679
Don't you think you're too much into character?

432
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,599
Why is the ball still here? Didn't you throw it away?

433
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,159
It doesn't belong in your house.

434
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,079
I'll throw it away for you.

435
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,799
Do you know what doesn't belong in my house?

436
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,879
- What is it?
- It's you.

437
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:27,319
You!

438
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,279
Fu Zeyi!

439
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,119
Fu Zeyi! Fu Zeyi!

440
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,719
Miss He, do we need to take a picture of that?

441
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:41,919
Take a picture of that? Just scram!

442
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,099
Fu Zeyi, it seems like you haven't gotten over Jing Zhixia.

443
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,379
Ai Xin, it isn't what you think. You shouldn't believe him.

444
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:58,519
Don't touch me. I think there's no need for us to continue this discussion.

445
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,299
What are you trying to do?

446
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,779
Ai Xin, are you sure you want to be together with a brat like him?

447
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,459
Since you already know about our relationship, you'd better scram.

448
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:14,499
Have you made up your mind?

449
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,959
It's because you don't understand me.

450
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,339
I don't understand you?

451
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:24,039
He's just a brat. He's only toying with you.

452
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,879
Do you know how old you are? Do you think he's capable enough to marry you?

453
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,959
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

454
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,919
Ai Xin, will you marry me?
