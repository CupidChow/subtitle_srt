[Episode 5]

16
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,659
Pool?

17
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,499
That's right.

18
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,359
Your job is... to wipe it all clean.

19
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,559
I'm the hotel owner and daughter of a rich family.

20
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,880
I can let it go when you treat me like a clerk and a driver.

21
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,580
Now you want me to be a cleaner? I refuse.

22
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,539
Article 12 of the contract, Party B shall unconditionally obey Party A.

23
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:09,239
Do you call that a contract?

24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,299
It's obviously a slave contract.

25
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,119
You can sue me for compensation. I'm not short on money.

26
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,379
I know you have money,

27
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,897
but if this goes to court,

28
00:02:18,897 --> 00:02:22,802
I'm afraid news of Aizhe Hotel using knock-off furniture

29
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,759
to deceive their customers will get out.

30
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,500
You can't bully me like this.

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,078
Can't you be more ethical?

32
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:33,759
Ethical? That's only a tool the weak use to bind the strong.

33
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,770
You...

34
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,343
Are you going to wipe it or not?

35
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,019
Can I leave after I'm done wiping it?

36
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,792
You haven't started cleaning it. We'll see after you clean it.

37
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,435
I'll clean...

38
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:51,059
I'll just clean it then.

39
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:58,259
Director Fu, it's time for your meeting.

40
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,139
Take your time cleaning it. All the best.

41
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,019
He's obviously bullying me.

42
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,880
You want to bully me, huh?

00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:37,879
Dad.

46
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,439
Second Uncle.

47
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,719
This is the business district's new objective.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,059
New objective?

49
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,979
I can tell that you haven't started anything without looking at it, right?

50
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,040
I'll be stepping down as the chairman of the board of directors in several months.

51
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,180
As the candidate for the new chairman,

52
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,359
now is the time for you to do well to win the shareholders' support.

53
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,840
But you can't even manage a trivial task like this.

54
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,499
Brother, that's enough.

55
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:14,099
Zeyi, did you come across an obstacle?

56
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,119
If you need help, you can tell me.

57
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,739
Don't carry the burden yourself.

58
00:04:21,176 --> 00:04:24,145
Fu Group has always been strict in its work.

59
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:26,365
No mistakes allowed.

60
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,249
Even though you're the son of the Fu family,

61
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:30,350
you can't afford to make mistakes.

62
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,349
If you commit any mistake and embarrass the Fu family,

63
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:36,189
I'll drive you out immediately!

64
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,529
Okay. Got it.

65
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,189
I'll get going then.

66
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,300
Zeyi.

67
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,061
Stop right there!

68
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,409
Brother. Brother!

69
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,930
Get the medicine.

70
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,569
Here. Hurry.

71
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,869
Slowly.

72
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,849
Why do you harm your health by getting all worked up?

73
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:04,559
Ever since this brat was a child,

74
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:06,740
he's always been indifferent, no matter how you try to talk to him.

75
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,580
I don't even know what he's thinking all day.

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,919
Young people nowadays have their own opinions,

77
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,680
but I think Zeyi is very competent.

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,899
Watch him for me next time.

79
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,560
He's my only nephew.

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,239
Who will watch him if not me? How about this?

81
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,179
I'll talk to him in private.

82
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,559
Don't worry.

83
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,019
Are you done with your meeting? Can we go now?

84
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,691
Did you finish your job?

85
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:47,251
Is getting off work all you can think of?

86
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:49,639
I'm done cleaning.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,219
That's not enough.

88
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,079
You need to clean it until I'm happy with it.

89
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,119
Zeyi,

90
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:05,059
I thought you already left. How about this?

91
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:09,047
How can I help you?

92
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,179
It's good for youngsters to have a broad mindset.

93
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,839
But now, you're, after all, still inexperienced.

94
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,120
If you need help, just let me know. I'll do what I can to help.

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,190
But you've obtained that land. Why aren't you implementing anything yet?

96
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,189
I know what I'm doing!

97
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,010
- You don't need to worry about it.
- All right then.

98
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,949
I want a glass of water.

99
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,269
Are you talking to me?

100
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,269
Yes, who else?

101
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,670
Is there another person in this room?

102
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,949
Second Uncle, she's...

103
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,729
It's all right.

104
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:41,399
I'll go get it.

105
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
Is that your new assistant?

106
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,160
Youngsters nowadays are not sensible at all.

107
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,899
She doesn't even know the most basic manners.

108
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,779
I'm so tired.

109
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:58,459
Oh, right. Senior, what do you think Junior President Fu is discussing with him?

110
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,719
I've worked at Fu Group for eight years.

111
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,020
Senior President Fu lost his temper just now.

112
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,279
Junior President Fu may not see eye to eye with General Manager Fu,

113
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,099
but I think...

114
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,380
he'll need General Manager Fu's support to put in a good word for him.

115
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,519
I guess Junior President Fu must be begging General Manager Fu now, right?

116
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,399
It looks like he's a difficult but important client.

117
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:24,699
If I mess it up, I'll be fired as I wish.

118
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,329
Zeyi, I understand your feelings and ideas.

119
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:37,629
Do you still think that as your second uncle...

120
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,049
I'm so sorry.

121
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:41,929
What is this?

122
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,549
Why is he not upset?

123
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:48,710
You and your dad argued. I feel bad about it.

124
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,709
I get caught...

125
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,210
I get caught in the middle. It's hard for me to put in a good word for you.

126
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,100
Get out of my way.

127
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,170
I know your kind intention so I also know that you've put in a great effort.

128
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,489
Well... don't just talk. Have some snacks.

129
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:07,769
You said that, but your action...

130
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,009
Have a cookie.

131
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:11,370
What are you doing?

132
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,950
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,809
Enough. Get out.

134
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:17,769
Just get out.

135
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,469
You're being mysterious. Who are you guarding against?

136
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,269
You should know how I work.

137
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:29,009
Before it's done, I don't want to say much

138
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,610
because I especially hate the false display of superficial work.

139
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,109
I think...

140
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:36,009
What's wrong with you?

141
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:38,549
I'm so sorry. What did I tell you?

142
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,229
I'm not fit to be an assistant.

143
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,608
You can't even do well in this work. Get out.

144
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:44,389
- I'll wipe it for you.
- Enough!

145
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,249
- Are you hurt?
- No...

146
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,060
Just be straightforward. No need to beat around the bush.

147
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,230
So you hurt the innocent.

148
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,369
Me? Hurt the innocent?

149
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,659
I thought you were the one who hurt me.

150
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,828
That's too much. Why did you carry me out?

151
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:18,733
How was my acting?

152
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,493
Not great.

153
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,889
You were not hurt?

154
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,029
It's not even boiling water, it's just lukewarm, that's all.

155
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,929
That means you were putting on an act just now.

156
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:40,029
If I didn't make it look severe, could I have gotten off work early?

157
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,649
I'm sorry for making you lose an important client.

158
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,369
Client?

159
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:48,189
He's not a client. He's my second uncle.

160
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:51,809
As expected from Fu Zeyi. You even lost your temper with your uncle.

161
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:54,829
In any case, you did well.

162
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,929
How about this? Take the day off tomorrow.

163
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:11,572
Really?

164
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,359
Where do you think you're running off to?

165
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:43,779
I'm not. Can't I go on a short getaway on my day off?

166
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,879
I happen to be free, too. Let's go together.

167
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,610
I'm used to going on a holiday alone.

168
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,890
Bye bye.

169
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,961
I'm sorry. From today on, you need to get used to traveling with another person.

170
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,919
He won't even let me off on my holiday. What's the matter with him?

171
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,959
Is this how you spend your holidays?

172
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:29,455
It's rare to have such a good mood. I like shopping sprees.

173
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,919
You can leave if you don't like it.

174
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,439
What if you run away when I leave?

175
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:36,259
It's all right.

176
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:39,239
Then shop until you're happy.

177
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,800
I will take this bag.

178
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,280
I'm sorry, Miss Jing. Someone has reserved this bag.

179
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,960
Sure enough, it's bad luck to be with you. I can't even buy the bag I want.

180
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,819
Let's go then.

181
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:59,149
Do you insist on coming with me?

182
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,835
I can bring you along. You'll have to pay for my services as a tour guide.

183
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,609
Sure. I'll pay for today's expenses.

184
00:12:19,609 --> 00:12:22,350
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

185
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,729
Please come again.

186
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:32,329
I will have this steak and a pizza.

187
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,879
I want this one, this one, and this one.

188
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,200
You ordered so many. Can you finish them all?

189
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,800
Help me to announce it.

190
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,619
Ladies and gentlemen, this lady said she's paying for your meals.

191
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,051
Thank you.

192
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,620
Here.

193
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,599
Eat first.

194
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:58,920
Where are we going after this?

195
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,119
Do you still want to follow me?

196
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,000
- Where are we going?
- I want to go to the washroom.

197
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,679
Do you want to go there while holding hands like high school girls?

198
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,499
What's wrong?

199
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,099
Hey, are you okay?

200
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:23,460
- What's wrong?
- Open your eyes.

201
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,619
Don't come close. Give him some air.

202
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:27,339
Do you hear that? Don't come too close. Thank you.

203
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,999
- Move away.
- I think he has a heart attack. Did you bring his medicine?

204
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:32,919
No, we only came out for a meal.

205
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,310
Are you a doctor? If you're not, you'll be responsible if anything happens. It has nothing to do with our restaurant.

206
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,719
Stop pinning the blame on others when she's trying to save his life.

207
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:41,979
Even if anything happens, it's a problem with the service and dishes of your restaurant.

208
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,399
Don't just stand here. Call an ambulance!

209
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,160
He's waking up.

210
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:05,470
He's waking up. He's awake.

211
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,880
He's waking up.

212
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,219
He's waking up.

213
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:10,995
Slowly.

214
00:14:10,995 --> 00:14:14,099
He should be okay.

215
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:15,419
This way.

216
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:17,799
- Step aside, please.
- Hurry.

217
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,659
Give me a hand.

218
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,639
Thank you.

219
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,579
Are you okay?

220
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,679
Did you know

221
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,499
that my dad died suddenly

222
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:52,880
all alone in the middle of the night in an empty restaurant

223
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,799
at the hotel?

224
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,239
If someone were there to provide first aid,

225
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,239
he would have survived.

226
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,599
Is that why

227
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,219
you learned to give first aid?

228
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:12,655
My dad knew how to perform first aid, too.

229
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:17,039
He even prepared defibrillators in the hotel

230
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,760
in case any guest in trouble needed to use them.

231
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,819
But why...

232
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:27,599
Why did no one help him when he was in trouble?

233
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,479
I suffer from heart palpitations, too.

234
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,319
When I listen to the song you composed,

235
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:35,079
it calms my heart palpitations.

236
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,999
Have you really forgotten?

237
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,559
What's wrong?

238
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,679
Are you having heart palpitations now?

239
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,760
- Where's my phone?
- Your phone?

240
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,579
Find that song for me.

241
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,299
Okay.

242
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,000
What's wrong with her? She just saved someone.

243
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,410
Why is this happening?

244
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,960
She needs help.

245
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,699
Let's go.

246
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,799
Didn't you say you don't remember?

247
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:10,999
Do you remember it now?

248
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,719
Uncle, do you know how to play "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"?

249

Who are you calling "Uncle"? There's no such person here.

Didn't you say you don't know me?

251

How do you remember that song?

252
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,699
Can't you continue pretending?

253
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,039
I learned it.

254
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,949
Just now...

255
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:08,049
What about just now?

256
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,789
Nothing. I'll get off first.

257
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,990
Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital?

258
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,530
I just had low blood sugar.

259
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,130
When I did a checkup at the hospital,

260
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,790
the doctor said my heart palpitations are caused by low blood sugar

261
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,709
so my hands tremble and I feel dizzy.

- Xiao Fu, did you run into something tricky there?

to keep Lin under control.

What does Fu Zeyi mean by this?

Is Fu Zeyi here? I need to see him.

What did he do to you again?

Wait a minute.

Was he the one who tortured you like this?

It was your day off yesterday.

00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,890
Did he still cling to you and torment you?

301

I'll seek justice for you now.

Why should I sell my shares to you?

328
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,769
I can offer three times the price.

329
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,250
It's not about money. My dad left the hotel to me.

330
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,789
I have sentimental value for the hotel.

331
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,639
Sentimental value?

332
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,699
Then why did you sell your shares to Fu Zeyi?

333
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:28,246
What did you say?

334
00:24:28,246 --> 00:24:30,336
Your reaction...

335
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:32,329
Didn't you know about this?

336
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:36,670
He acquired your shares to obtain the land the hotel was on.

337
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,809
He plans to demolish the hotel to build Fu's business district there.

338
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,439
I called earlier to ask about the sale of shares.

339
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:49,679
Miss Jing, it's a pleasure working with you.

340
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,640
Miss Jing trusts me now.

341
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,479
Then I'll wait for your good news.

342
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:57,119
The Fu Group's business district will be built near Aizhe Hotel.
[Fu Group's Business District Blueprint]

343
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,639
I don't see Aizhe Hotel on the map.

344
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,059
You can keep on dreaming.

345
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,749
I won't let you touch Aizhe Hotel.

346
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,269
So should we contact other minor shareholders?

347
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,509
We'll just wait and watch the show.

348
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,519
Get out of my way.

349
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:39,750
[Fu Group's Business District Blueprint]

350
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,260
No wonder Aizhe Hotel is not on the map. You are planning to demolish it.

351
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,834
You found out.

352
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:05,339
Why? Did you not want me to find out?

353
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:08,219
If your second uncle didn't come to me to buy my shares today,

354
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:10,580
I would've been kept in the dark.

355
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,379
My second uncle came to you to buy your shares?

356
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,539
Didn't you acquire my shares as well?

357
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,979
What an elaborate trap, Director Fu.

358
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:25,740
You suppressed me in the name of compensation.

359
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,959
Then you forced me to sell my shares at a low price.

360
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:31,572
It's all to demolish this hotel

361
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:34,219
to build Fu's business district.

362
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,950
Since everything had gone according to your plan,

363
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,590
why...

364
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:44,606
Why did you have to keep a loser like me here?

365
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,550
Do you need a loser like me

366
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,399
to celebrate your victory,

367
00:26:57,399 --> 00:26:59,720
or are you punishing me?

368
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:04,719
You want to punish me so I can watch the hotel my father had built ruined in my hands.

369
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:07,581
All that for your trap to be perfect?

370
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,759
I thought we could...

371
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,279
Being ruthless is your true self, right?

372
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,619
It's all your conspiracy, isn't it?

373
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,399
I'll never let you get your way, Fu Zeyi.

374
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,039
Have you ever played the piano before?

375
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,579
No.

376
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:04,259
It's all right.

377
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,970
Today, our first lesson is about how to recognize the notes.

378
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,139
No.

379
00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:14,034
Then what about learning "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"?

380
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:16,250
No.

381
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,029
Then what would you like to learn, Mr. Fu?

382
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:21,449
I want to learn the song I sent you.

383
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,379
No problem. I'll play it right away.

384

01, 53,

385
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,540
27, 49,

386
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,419
36.

387
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,080
One more time.

388
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,710
Okay.

389
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,539
One more time.

390
00:29:02,378 --> 00:29:04,175
One more time.

391
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:54,875
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid of being alone  ♫

392
00:29:55,825 --> 00:30:02,265
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

393
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:10,324
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

394
00:30:10,324 --> 00:30:17,085
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

395
00:30:17,085 --> 00:30:24,855
♫  If I decide to be brave this time,  ♫

396
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:31,470
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

397
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:39,405
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

398
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:45,635
♫  It will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

399
00:30:49,905 --> 00:30:53,390
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

400
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:58,135
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

401
00:30:58,135 --> 00:31:01,385
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

402
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:04,935
♫  in order to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

403
00:31:04,935 --> 00:31:08,330
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

404
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:14,940
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

405
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:21,645
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
