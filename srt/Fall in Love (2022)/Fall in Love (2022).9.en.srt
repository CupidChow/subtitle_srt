[Episode 9]

15
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,146
Now I've returned

16
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:39,566
I'd like to see

17
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:44,230
what you've been doing with my identity all this time.

18
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,849
I'll tell you what I did.

19
00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:49,155
The person who is dating Jing Zhixia is me.

20
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,404
You can back out now.

21
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:53,004
I may not have come back for a long time,

22
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:56,412
but I saw how she searched for me

23
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:59,842
as she looked at you just now.

24
00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:06,310
Hello, Sister Jingjing.

25
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,129
Xiao Xia, why did you go overseas again?

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,110
Your dad said this before he passed away.

27
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,770
You must take over the hotel he passed down.

28
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,337
Dad's heart attack was caused by overwork.

29
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,689
Do you want that to happen to me, too?

30
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,611
Miss Jing, it's your turn now. Please don't use your phone inside.

31
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,889
Mom, I have to hang up now.

32
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:30,869
Doctor, my heartbeat is so loud that I can't sleep every single night.

33
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:34,829
My father passed away because of heart disease.

34
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,824
I wonder if...

35
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,139
We cannot rule out the genetic cause.

36
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,699
I'll have to check the result on Monday.

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,410
Excuse me. What's the music playing in the store?

38
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,399
Our shop is renting the DVD. We're playing a movie now.

39
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:31,369
What's the name of the movie?

40
00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:33,109
"Billy."

41
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:34,760
Thank you.

42
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,990
Lin is the composer of this song.

43
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,209
A Chinese?

44
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,089
I can't find any details on this composer. Is this person so mysterious?

45
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,170
Hello?

46
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,369
I finished composing the song. Do you want to hear it?

47
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,969
That was fast.

48
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,589
It's very late. Would it disturb others?

49
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:39,729
No. The soundproofing here is good.

50
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,589
Wait for a while.

51
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,009
You... Did you stay up all night last night?

52
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,241
Yes.

53
00:05:56,241 --> 00:06:00,829
It's because artists have more inspiration at night, right?

54
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,258
I almost finished arranging the song,

55
00:06:03,258 --> 00:06:07,109
but I'm going out to record some voices today. After that, I'm going to arrange them into the song.

56
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:10,049
- I want to go, too.
- Okay.

57
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:13,349
Then we'll put both our names on this music score.

The winner is the first person who gets the key to her house.

I'll go to sleep and return the body to you.

163
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,364
Lin, no!

164
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,000
Lin has returned for real this time.

165
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,460
What exactly did I do that gave him the leeway?

166
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,489
Kissed?

167
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,050
That's your first kiss.

168
00:12:44,988 --> 00:12:47,107
What's so funny?

169
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:49,011
So how does it look?

170
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:50,879
Very good.

171
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,480
Very good?

172
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,779
Recently, I wrote a new article on the official account

173
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,519
called "Kissing can prolong life,"

174
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:04,539
but I need to add a subheading called "After kissing,"

175
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,699
"a second personality is likely to surface."

176
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:09,859
What nonsense are you talking about?

177
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,279
I happened to be under the weather

178
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,370
when he took the chance at that time.

179
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,150
A first kiss is such a huge stimulation

180
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,623
that it's possible to awaken a second personality.

181
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:25,159
It may be caused by missing your brother, Fu Zilin.

182
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,079
You told me

183
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,979
that the person inside me isn't Fu Zilin.

184
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:32,292
Let's be serious here.

185
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:37,699
Are you certain you want to switch with Lin on alternate days?

186
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,919
Yes.

187
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:44,960
But he's not supposed to appear.

188
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,859
But

189
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,664
I don't want him to disappear yet.

190
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:52,779
We still have some unfinished business.

191
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,947
Director Fu, I made an appointment with your fitness coach at 7 a.m.

192
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:07,639
You'll have breakfast at 8:30 a.m. You can take a look at the hotel upgrade plan while you're at it,

193
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,729
because you need to finalize the terms for the suppliers in the 9 a.m. meeting.

194
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:12,769
You have a business lunch at noon...

195
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,449
The schedule you arranged for me ends at 11 p.m.

196
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:18,889
Why is my schedule so packed?

197
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:21,889
- Do I need to make some adjustments?
- Of course.

198
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,929
If you arranged a full schedule for me, when do I have time to date?

199
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,761
Can't I enjoy some personal life?

200
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:30,689
Are you discussing it with me?

201
00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:32,449
Can't I?

202
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:34,949
- Of course, you can, but...
- That's it, then.

203
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:37,772
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

204
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:40,550
You never talked to me in such a manner.

205
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,689
Am I usually a bossy person?

206
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,897
How about we call it "highly efficient"?

207
00:14:49,897 --> 00:14:53,189
The Director Fu I used to know was like an efficient machine.

208
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:57,249
Emotionless, very detailed, and very accurate.

209
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,909
Of course, a character like yours in the industry is considered decisive and successful in everything.

210
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:03,670
You don't need to rest or date.

211
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,720
You have no stand, only benefit until...

212
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,540
Until what?

213
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,409
Until you met Miss Jing.

214
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,709
I saw you get angry and go mad for the first time.

215
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,249
You finally behaved like someone with feelings.

216
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:23,589
That also includes the intonation you used while talking to me.

217
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,429
This had never happened before Miss Jing showed up.

218
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,889
So do you think Fu Zeyi...

219
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,609
I mean,

220
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:36,469
do you also think that I, Fu Zeyi, am serious

221
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,789
about Jing Zhixia?

222
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:43,250
[Jing Zhixia]

223
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,150
Excuse me. I need to take this.

224
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,709
Hello?

225
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,089
What? You're ill?

226
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,269
Okay. I'll be right over.

227
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,049
I'll cancel all your schedule for today.

228
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:03,429
About the question about Miss Jing,

229
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,869
do you still need me to answer it?

230
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,049
Let's go.

231
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,638
What brings you here?

232
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,169
I said you didn't have to come.

233
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:33,289
Of course, I must check on you as your boyfriend.

234
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,500
It's not serious. It's only a low-grade fever.

235
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,860
I'll know after I test it.

236
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,400
You... Why did you suddenly kiss me?

237
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,089
I used my lips to measure your temperature.

238
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:52,809
The temperature is quite high.

239
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:55,329
No one takes temperature like this.

240
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,429
I just wanted to kiss you.

241
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,889
It's your fault that my temperature increased.

242
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,749
Is it really okay for you not to be at the office?

243
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,988
You're sick, so let me be.

244
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:27,258
It's only a cold, but it's infectious.

245
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,349
There's no need to put on your mask at home.

246
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,909
Today, get some proper rest. I'll take care of you.

247
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,189
It's not that.

248
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:38,149
My cold caused rhinitis again.

249
00:17:38,149 --> 00:17:40,249
I have a cat at home.

250
00:17:40,249 --> 00:17:42,889
Its fur made me sneeze all the time.

251
00:17:42,889 --> 00:17:45,409
I'd feel more comfortable with a mask on.

252
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,429
I don't dare to get close to it now.

253
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:49,969
Did you hear that? It's upset.

254
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:53,289
Taking care of it is the best care for me.

255
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,022
No problem.

256
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,399
But

257
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,359
you need to take me in for today.

258
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,239
What is it called?

259
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,340
Its name is Guaiguai.

260
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,699
Guaiguai. Guaiguai.

261
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:17,859
We only have one room in this house.

262
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,859
I'll sleep where Guaiguai sleeps.

263
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,519
It stinks.

264
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,119
I didn't expect Guaiguai to be so clingy.

265
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,439
Well, I didn't expect that you're a professional poop-picker.

266
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:42,659
It shows you don't know me that well.

267
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,461
By the way,
[Guaiguai's Vaccination Appointment]

268
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,200
did you make an appointment for Guaiguai's vaccination today?

269
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,810
You must have forgotten.

270
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,679
Yes, I forgot about it.

271
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,099
It's okay. I'll handle this.

272
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:56,959
Before that, I'll get you something to eat first.

273
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,899
It's all right. I can order takeout.

274
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,490
Just trust me. Just go.

275
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,759
Just go. Get some rest.

276
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,679
Go and rest. The kitchen is mine now. Be good and get some rest.

277
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,700
Go inside and sleep. Do you hear me?

278
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,430
Be good.

279
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,059
Sleep, okay?

280
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,259
Fu Zeyi is going to cook?

281
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,319
It smells so good.

282
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,659
Here you go. Your millet congee.

283
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,659
Did you cook all these?

284
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:49,139
Of course.

285
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,299
What do you think?

286
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,980
I didn't expect you to know how to cook.

287
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,699
Where's Guaiguai?

288
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:05,599
- Has it eaten?
- Yes.

289
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,619
Before I cooked the chicken, I gave it some shredded chicken breast.

290
00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:10,879
Look how happy it is.

291
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,019
I'll give you a "like."

292
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,679
Eat up.

293
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,079
Why are you looking at me?

294
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,379
I like watching you eat.

295
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,639
I'm curious.

296
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,059
When you cook for people, do you feel happy when you're cooking

297
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:35,039
or when you're watching them eat?

298
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,479
I want you to get well faster.

299
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,459
Only then I'll be happy.

300
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,839
I'll take Guaiguai out for its vaccination later.

301
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,239
Do you have any spare keys to your house? Give me one.

302
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:01,619
It's okay. I can open the door for you when you come back.

303
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,959
What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?

304
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:07,979
It's not that.

305
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:12,319
After you give me the key, it'll be convenient for me to take care of you.

306
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,259
It's okay.

307
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,419
You've done enough for today.

308
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:18,879
I'm not used to it.

309
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,999
You were the one who's sick today.

310
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,879
You're behaving so differently today. I'm not used to it.

311
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,539
Go back to the bossy Fu Zeyi.

312
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,919
All right, enjoy your meal. I'll take Guaiguai for its vaccination.

313
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:04,592
Why did Fu Zeyi behave like Lin from a year ago?

314
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,290
♫  I'll pretend to be pitiful  ♫

315
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:21,097
But why does it feel so unfamiliar?

316
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,600
♫  Because of meeting you  ♫

317
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,420
♫  I don't need you to worry, I just want you to see  ♫

318
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,310
♫  I'm not tricking you  ♫

319
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,240
♫  You think it's just pasttime  ♫

320
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,080
♫  You will be able to distinguish the right way  ♫

321
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,839
Where am I?

322
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,059
What's this?

323
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,099
No wonder I felt like I was suffering from sleep paralysis all night.

324
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,839
What do you want?

325
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,839
Don't come near me!

326
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,129
Hey, take it away from me.

327
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,309
I thought you liked it.

328
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,269
Me? Like pets?

329
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,369
Zhixia has rhinitis. Cat's fur can cause allergies.

330
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,389
Please take care of the cat for her.

331
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:26,949
You need to observe it for 24 hours after its vaccination.

332
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,769
It's Lin's doing again.

333
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,959
What are you doing?

334
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,439
It likes you very much. Don't scare it.

335
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:40,919
It scared me, okay?

336
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,339
Why did you hug it to sleep if you're scared of it?

337
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,780
You took long to realize this.

338
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,499
Last night?

339
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,299
What else did I do last night?

340
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:56,559
It was you who took care of the cat and me yesterday.

341
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,119
Don't tell me your amnesia is relapsing.

342
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,519
No. I... remember.

343
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:06,359
We need to observe the cat for a day, right?

344
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:08,359
I'm glad you're okay.

345
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,859
I want the millet congee you made yesterday.

346
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,260
Why do you want millet congee? It's not nutritious at all. You should take medicine if you're sick.

347
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,479
Why should I take medicine when it's not a serious cold?

348
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,599
I can just drink coke.

349
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,239
Coke?

350
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:27,700
[Coke Zero]

351
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,979
Why are you drinking coke?

352
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,059
Do you have ginger at home?

353
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,539
Are you making coke and ginger remedy?

354
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,219
I think there's some in the kitchen.

355
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,679
Okay. That's enough.

356
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,779
Go now. Leave this to me.

357
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:55,499
Get some rest.

358
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,199
Wasn't he good at cooking yesterday?

359
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,879
Why is he so clumsy today?

360
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,679
But he looks pretty adorable.

361
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,839
Why are you so careless?

362
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:51,619
I'm okay. I'm not injured. It's all right.

363
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,059
Can you even do it, Fu Zeyi?

364
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,639
What did you say?

365
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,279
I have a cold.

366
00:27:15,315 --> 00:27:18,759
Even with fever. Take your medicine.

367
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:20,539
I'll go now.

368
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,919
I thought my fever was gone.

369
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,101
I need some ice.

370
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:51,722
Here you go.

371
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,399
Drink it while it's warm.

372
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,460
How is it?

373
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,714
It's tasty but too hot.

374
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:10,599
I'll drink it later.

375
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,700
Oh.

376
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,550
Why does it taste burnt? Did the ginger burn at the bottom of the pot?

377
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,099
People do make mistakes, don't they? You did great yesterday.

378
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:32,519
Moreover, I'm already happy

379
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,929
that Fu Zeyi is willing to cook for me.

380
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,669
Get some proper rest.

381
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,809
I'm not sleepy.

382
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,210
Really?

383
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,869
Yes.

384
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,359
I'll lie down with you for a while.

385
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,339
It's okay.

386
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:59,879
You can get back to work. I'm going to sleep now.

387
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,059
All right. I'll go to my meeting then.

388
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,137
That's more like it.

389
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:11,997
You need to go back to being Fu Zeyi.

390
00:29:11,997 --> 00:29:14,679
By the way, I forgot to tell you

391
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,639
that I changed the meeting venue to your living room.

392
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,689
I can't believe you did that.

393
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,809
Move away.

394
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,529
Go away.

395
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,229
Go away.

396
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,609
Fine. Just stay there.

397
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,969
You can sit there.

398
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,109
Are we having the meeting there?

399
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:16,489
Director Fu is still sitting there. Yet, you want to start the meeting?

400
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,069
Director Fu.

401
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,079
Guaiguai, let's go back to your room.

402
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,549
All right. Let's start the meeting.

403
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,809
Okay.

404
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:16,029
I can't believe it's Miss Jing's house.

405
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:18,909
Are Director Fu and Miss Jing...

406
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,629
Switch off your phones before the meeting.

407
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:28,809
Why switch them off during the meeting?

408
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:32,669
It's a secret meeting. It's to avoid information from leaking out.

409
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:35,469
Director Fu, there's an interview for an executive later.

410
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,689
Do you want him to be here too?

411
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,569
Yes. Tell him to come here.

412
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:41,009
All right.

413
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:43,350
[Press to switch off]

414
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,789
It's switched off.

415
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,529
It means they're plotting something.

416
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,409
Next,

417
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:02,429
it's your showtime.

418
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:05,909
Don't worry, Director Fu. Leave this matter to me.

419
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:08,709
Today's agenda is the adjustment of Yiju Home Furnishing's cooperation project.

420
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:13,329
After we breached the previous contract, a new party contacted Director Sheng now.

421
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:16,609
Since Director Sheng hasn't signed the contract with them,

422
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:19,369
it means he's not happy with their plan.

423
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:23,449
Since he gives us another chance to renegotiate the deal, we should prepare a gift in advance

424
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:27,109
as an apology for the previous breach of contract.

425
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,689
Hello? I'm here for an interview.

426
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:39,130
Hello. Please come in.

427
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,210
Please wait.

428
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,829
This way, please.

429
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,369
Director Fu. The candidate is here.

430
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:48,170
Director Fu, I've heard a lot about you.

431
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,929
Here's my resume.

432
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:51,869
Tell me about yourself.

433
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,329
I've been in this industry for more than ten years.

434
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:55,850
My overall understanding of the market is...
[Resume]

435
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,669
Then you should know how to cook, right?

436
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:59,269
Cook?

437
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,829
Yes. Right now?

438
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:06,430
It shouldn't be spicy.

439
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,830
I don't want anything too sweet, oily, and fatty.

440
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,969
There are ingredients in the refrigerator.

441
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,649
You can start now.

442
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:16,149
Okay.

443
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,809
All right. We'll continue.

444
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,609
Director Fu, how do you want your steak?

445
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:31,949
- Medium well.
- Well done.

446
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,609
All right.

447
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,069
Mr. Fu, your food is ready.

448
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,570
Don't put the food on the table.

449
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,910
Where should I put them, then?

450
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:49,049
Ai Xin, send the two dishes from the left to Miss Jing's room.

451
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:50,449
Yes.

452
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,829
As for this one,

453
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,410
put it on the floor there.

454
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,149
- On the floor?
- Yes.

455
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:01,569
All right.

456
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,090
I thought the food was for us.

457
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,369
We always had instant noodles during meetings.

458
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:22,492
Come in.

459
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,109
Miss Jing.

460
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,770
I smelled something delicious just now.

461
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,009
Did Fu Zeyi make it?

462
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:31,729
Director Fu never cooks in the kitchen.

463
00:34:31,729 --> 00:34:33,449
Impossible.

464
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,450
He even cooked for me yesterday.

465
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,029
It looks like you still have a fever.

466
00:34:38,029 --> 00:34:39,829
You should rest well.

467
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,269
He never enters the kitchen?

468
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,749
Don't tell me it was my hallucination.

469
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,570
Your interview is over.

470
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,909
It's over?

471
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,729
Should I leave now?

472
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,629
Go home and wait for our reply.

473
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,749
All right.

474
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:23,429
Let's continue.

475
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,049
- Have they all left?
- Yes.

476
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:38,770
Don't you want to take a break?

477
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,549
I'm finishing soon.

478
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,910
Are you in some kind of trouble?

479
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:48,289
Is there anything I can help you with?

480
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,969
- For me?
- Yes.

481
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,490
It's classified information.

482
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,589
Are you sure it's okay if I look at it?

483
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:08,749
Yes.

484
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,909
Because you're the one I trust the most.

485
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:14,969
If there's a problem in the negotiation with Yiju Home Furnishing,

486
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:19,069
this box will be the key to turning the tide.

487
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:20,910
Then why aren't you keeping it?

488
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,989
I'm afraid I won't be around when that happens.

489
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:26,329
You won't be around? What do you mean by that?

490
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:27,730
Let's put that aside first.

491
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,629
Are you feeling better now?

492
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,330
I think the fever is gone.

493
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,029
The fever is gone?

494
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,589
What are you doing?

495
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:40,890
Why did you come so close to me?

496
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,229
Didn't you say your fever is gone? I need to check your temperature.

497
00:36:44,229 --> 00:36:45,509
You scared me.

498
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:49,009
I thought you wanted to kiss me like yesterday.

499
00:36:49,009 --> 00:36:50,950
Yesterday?

500
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,789
I kissed you?

501
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:56,569
You seem to have lost your memory.

502
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:03,449
Didn't you say it's more accurate to check it with lips?

503
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,689
Fine.

504
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:14,089
I'll show you what's accurate.

505
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:33,469
I'm still not fully recovered, and you've kissed me twice.

506
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,209
You need to remember

507
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,129
that this kiss belongs to me.

508
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:42,569
Compared to yesterday, was it better?

509
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:45,169
You acted more like a rascal today.

510
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,349
One more thing.

511
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:58,249
With our current relationship, shouldn't you give me the key to your house

512
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,389
after you registered your fingerprint on my door lock?

513
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:05,129
I won't give it to you.

514
00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:06,309
Why not?

515
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:09,429
Because you're being self-righteous now.

516
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,830
Oh.

517
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,769
Then

518
00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:16,729
would you give it to yesterday's me?

519
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:19,289
What do you mean by today's and yesterday's "me"?

520
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:20,870
Didn't you ask me yesterday?

521
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,809
I said I wouldn't give it to you.

522
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,189
So Lin was rejected too.

523
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,470
All right. Then we'll put this matter aside for now.

524
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,791
But you must promise me one thing.

525
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,630
What is it?

526
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,889
Let's not meet tomorrow.

527
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:41,730
What do you mean?

528
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,009
If we don't meet tomorrow, what about the day after tomorrow?

529
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,489
Are you breaking up with me?

530
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:49,929
No.

531
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,950
We can meet the day after tomorrow.

532
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,989
I'll come and see you myself,

533
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:58,909
but even if I come to you myself tomorrow, you must not see me.

534
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,790
Can I meet you or not? You're confusing me.

535
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,250
I'm not your subordinate.

536
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,169
Do I need to make an appointment to see you?

537
00:39:04,169 --> 00:39:06,389
What if I miss you?

538
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:08,169
Bear with it.

539
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:10,129
What about a video call?

540
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,649
Neither that.

541
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:18,296
Fu Zeyi,

542
00:39:18,296 --> 00:39:23,104
you make me feel like I'm waiting for you to pick up my name tag like a concubine in the imperial harem.

543
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:28,069
Are you afraid that I might run into you meeting another girlfriend tomorrow?

544
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:30,409
No. That's impossible.

545
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,469
It's because I just recovered.

546
00:39:34,469 --> 00:39:36,349
I'm not in a stable state.

547
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:39,439
I happened to have an appointment with my doctor too. I'll need to be in seclusion all day tomorrow.

548
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:41,639
That's right.

549
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,639
We can still meet up.

550
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,599
I can accompany you to the doctor.

551
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,859
If you're there, you'll affect me.

552
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:50,419
That's what the doctor said.

553
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,619
So

554
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,599
I'll be seeing the doctor tomorrow

555
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:58,500
and be in an unstable state.

556
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,999
But if I call you, don't you ever answer my call.

557
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:06,639
You can't agree to any of my requests,

558
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,099
okay?

559
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:12,503
Okay.

560
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:38,225
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid of being alone  ♫

561
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:45,915
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

562
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:53,775
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

563
00:40:53,775 --> 00:41:00,535
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

564
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:08,305
♫  If I decide to be brave this time,  ♫

565
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:14,930
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

566
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:22,855
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

567
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:28,985
♫  we will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

568
00:41:33,355 --> 00:41:36,920
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

569
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,585
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

570
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,835
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

571
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:48,385
♫  in order to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

572
00:41:48,385 --> 00:41:51,820
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

573
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:58,390
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

574
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:05,095
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
