Ring exchange during the launch event?

161
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,780
- Jing Zhixia arranged this?
- Yes.

162
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,039
Miss Jing suggested that we carry it out as an engagement party.

163
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:37,199
She sent her regards, saying it was a double delight.

164
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,080
Jing Zhixia, do you really want me to marry another woman?

165
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,919
As long as you like it. We'll proceed with her arrangement.

166
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,479
Yes.

167
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,490
Ladies and gentlemen, the event will soon begin.

168
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,210
We'll be ready in a moment. Thank you.

169
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:02,670
Zeyi is such an outstanding young man.

170
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,790
I can see now why Bei'er always talks about him.

171
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,019
Are you really going to let Fu Zeyi get engaged to He Bei'er?

172
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,619
He Bei'er is clearly not a person who is easy to deal with.

173
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,580
Since Jing Zhixia is here today,

174
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,770
we should expect a great show.

175

Thank you for attending the Fu and He family's strategic partnership banquet.

This partnership has become the perfect role model for the finance industry.

179
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,539
As we can see, the couple is a match made in heaven.

180
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,020
And the most important part is coming up next.

181

We also have a more surprising announcement for everyone.

182
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,639
Before we start, I'd like to invite a friend to the stage.

During my years abroad, I didn't have many friends,

186
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,120
but Zhixia and I got along very well.

187

I'd like to invite you as a friend to witness the moment of our life.

313
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,739
I only wanted to mess with you to see if you still cared about me.

314
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:48,699
You know how I feel for you.

315
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:53,599
From what I see, you are confessing your love and want to reconcile.

316
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,399
Can I take that as a yes?

317
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,459
I asked you out to make things clear with you.

318
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,559
I have a boyfriend now.

319
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,479
No way.

320
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,580
You know him.

321
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,519
I know him?

322
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,339
Fine.

323
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:12,239
Bring him here.

324
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,479
It's been too long, Fu Zeyi.

325
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,659
What now?

326
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:32,979
Are you going to break your promise?

327
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,779
Well, that's the power of love.

328
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,899
Drop the act.

329
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:48,439
You'd never fall for a man like him.

330
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,339
What kind of man do you prefer then?

331
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:55,559
Don't be so sure.

332
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,619
People change.

333
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:02,019
Besides, I don't think Xia Xia would fall for a man like you either.

334
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:03,659
Fine.

335
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,879
Tell me,

336
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:08,160
what does she like about you?

337
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,699
That question is such a cliché.

338
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:13,499
That's between Xia Xia and me.

339
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,879
I prefer not to share it with outsiders.

340
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,159
You've met him. Would you please leave now?

341
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,679
What should I do to a conversation with you?

342
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,239
Perhaps you should attend our wedding.

343
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:32,999
And...

344
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:37,779
would you please leave that seat?

345
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,759
I prefer sitting in front of her to admire her beauty.

346
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,839
You can find an actor but find a capable one at least.

347
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,379
I dare you to say that again.

348
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,339
Jing Zhixia, what are you up to?

349
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:21,159
Do you still not believe it?

350
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,820
Bring it on.

351
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,440
- What should I bring?
- What do you think?

352
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,599
Seriously?

353
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,659
Fine.

354
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,059
I'll leave.

355
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,739
Wait.

356
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,899
I'm not done with you.

357
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,759
I hope we don't meet again.

358
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,179
I don't want to ever see you again.

359
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,780
I think we overdid it.

360
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,499
Any sensible person can tell he's in love with you.

361
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:54,119
Does it matter?

362
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,779
Would you want to be with a liar?

363
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,419
Perhaps we shouldn't have met each other in the very beginning.

364
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:31,300
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid to be alone  ♫

365
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,610
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

366
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:46,650
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

367
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:53,380
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

368
00:32:53,380 --> 00:33:01,190
♫  If I decide to be brave this time  ♫

369
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:07,810
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

370
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,780
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

371
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:21,989
♫  we will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

372
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,759
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

373
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,419
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

374
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:37,730
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

375
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,169
♫  in order to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

376
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:44,719
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

377
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:51,230
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

378
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:57,949
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
