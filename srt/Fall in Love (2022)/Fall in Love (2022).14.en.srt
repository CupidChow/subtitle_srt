Who are you?

160
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,980
He's a good friend of mine.

161
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,544
I'll find your wedding ring for you.

162
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,810
This won't do.

163
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,580
Wait for me!

164
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,370
I've checked the corridor. There are three surveillance cameras here.

165
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,870
Let's check out the control room.

166
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,360
- Okay.
- Hey.

167
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,249
No need for that. There's no need to check the surveillance cameras. I'm sure it wasn't a thief.

168
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:47,010
How did you know?

169
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,820
Because a cat stole it from me.

170
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,660
- A cat?
- A cat?

171
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,129
That's right. There's a timid cat in the hotel.

172
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:57,224
I'll look for the cat then.

173
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,929
If you want to look for cats, you have to wait until nighttime.

174
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,739
Zhixia, do you truly believe that a cat stole her ring?

175
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,750
Why don't we check out the surveillance cameras first?

176
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,930
I'm sure it wasn't a cat.

177
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,129
- But I'm sure it's related to a cat.
- It's related to a cat?

178
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,070
Let's locate the cat for now.

179
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,430
But it's so dark right now.

180
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,680
I can't see anything.

181
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,470
Cats' eyes can reflect light.

182
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,420
It's easier to find them during nighttime.

183
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,420
By the way, Zhixia, cats love to hide in places like fire extinguisher cabinets or under vehicles.

184
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,460
That's why I'm luring it out with cat food.

185
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:39,330
I realized that you're a cat expert.

186
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,189
That's right. I love cats, but I can't keep one

187
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:44,940
because Fu Zeyi is afraid of cats.

188
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,520
I found it.

189
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,600
I found you.

190
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,790
We found you.

191
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,280
Kitty, where's your home?

192
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,660
Take me to your home, okay?

193
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,100
Come on.

194
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,760
I found you.

195
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,450
There are so many treasures here.

196
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,510
Yeah.

197
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,320
Did you find it?

198
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,020
Here you go.

199
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,320
It's really here.

200
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,430
Jingjing.

201
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,040
We found it.

202
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,009
Jingjing, they found the ring. Please stop being angry, okay?

203
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:11,770
The ring was indeed stolen by a cat.

204
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,140
Sister Jingjing, you're a prophet.

205
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,260
Did you know about it from the beginning?

206
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,540
- I...
- I thought it was strange.

207
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,870
The cat only kept furry things in its house.

208
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,380
Why did it take your ring all of a sudden?

209
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,680
Enough. I admit. I was the one who placed it there.

210
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,500
But why?

211
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,790
- Ye Ming,
- Jingjing.

212
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,100
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,825
I'm regretting my decision.

214
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:45,940
I don't wish to get married.

215
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,180
Did I do something wrong?

216
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,260
Zhixia, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

217
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,410
I only cared about my happiness.

218
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,940
I neglected your feelings.

219
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,360
If it weren't for last night...

220
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,030
Hello? Zhixia?

221
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,430
No! Don't leave me!

222
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,360
Don't leave me!

223
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:34,250
You misunderstood me completely. I wasn't talking to you back then.

224
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,629
You weren't talking to me?

225
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:39,589
Please go and get married. I wish to obtain happiness, too.

226
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:42,620
I don't want you to drag me down.

227
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,469
You're still so muddle-headed even though you're getting married tomorrow.

228
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:51,349
Don't blame me for being a naggy daughter.

229
00:18:51,349 --> 00:18:53,189
You mustn't forget the family rules of the Jian family.

230
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:56,949
After you're married into his family, you have to do your duties as a wife.

231
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,940
You shouldn't break bowls that shouldn't be broken.

232
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,020
Don't ruin clothes that should be washed. Don't look down on others' efforts.

233
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,330
That way, no one will make you do any chores in the future.

234
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,420
I swear, as long as Jing Jing marries me,

235
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,029
she can stay at home and do nothing. I'll do all of the chores.

236
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,809
All right now. Stop crying.

237
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,709
You still need to be a happy, beautiful bride tomorrow.

238
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,320
If you keep crying, your eyes will swell.

239
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,760
Oh, no! Ye Ming, hurry!

240
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,150
Hurry! Find my eye masks for me!

241
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,680
Thank you, Lin.

242
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,070
- Beautiful day.
- Are you nervous?

243
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,040
Auntie, Brother Ming, happy wedding.

244
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,320
Sister, you look beautiful.

245
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,860
I'm really happy to witness your wedding.

246
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,770
I was supposed to plan your wedding for you, but I was too busy.

247
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,020
I have to deal with all the affairs in the hotel.

248
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:13,350
I was so busy.

249
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,780
Are you sure about that? You just renovated your office time and time again.

250
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,880
Scram.

251
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,150
I'm here to be your host, aren't I?

252
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,930
I know it won't be awkward with you around.

253
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,820
Of course.

254
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,340
Mr. Ye, the musician can't make it because of an emergency.

255
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:32,909
They can't make it?

256
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:38,760
I knew it. I'm destined to have a flawed wedding.

257
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,800
Sister Jing Jing, don't be so willful.

258
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,640
Excuse me. If you don't mind, I can play the piano for you.

259
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,489
Really?

260
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:52,569
Yes, just treat it as your wedding gift.

261
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,940
Do you know what's the biggest difference between me and Fu Zeyi?

262
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,300
I know how to play the piano while he's clueless about music.

263
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,250
Sounds great.

264
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,920
That sounds nice.

265
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,380
It sounds familiar.

266
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,460
Yes, very familiar.

267
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,870
So Fu Zeyi learned that tune on the spot?

268
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,849
Uncle, do you know how to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?

269
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:15,940
Who are you calling Uncle?

270
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,030
I thought this was a sentimental tune. Why is she smiling?

271
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,850
She's not smiling at the tune. She's smiling at the pianist.

272
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,650
Are you sure he's just a good friend of yours?

273
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,030
He's obviously the ex-boyfriend you couldn't forget.

274
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,250
Next, let's have the long-awaited bouquet-tossing ceremony.

275
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,559
I wonder which of you here will receive the bride's blessing.

276
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,550
That song was for you. Did you like it?

277
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,820
Thank you.

278
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,620
Ready.

279
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,770
I...

280
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,410
- I'm going to toss it now.
- Toss it.

281
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,270
One, two, three.

282
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,350
Here it comes!

283
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,650
Who got it?

284
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,260
I...

285
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,680
Congratulations!

286
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,250
The mother has given her blessing to her daughter, Zhixia!

287
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,890
Seems like Aizhe Hotel is going to get a new groom.

288
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:46,160
- Be together!
- Be together!

289
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,540
- Be together!
- Be together!

290
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,970
- Be together!
- Be together!

291
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,130
- Be together!
- Be together!

292
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,150
- Be together!
- Be together!

293
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,680
This was so lively.

294
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,980
I think the dancing starts now.

295
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,910
May I have a dance with you?

296
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,430
No, my counsin's first dance belongs to me.

297
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,639
According to our ranks, you need to call me Uncle. Do you know your manners?

298
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:47,880
If your fans know about this, you'll be done for.

299
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,970
My fans are very understanding. You don't need to worry about them.

300
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,459
Both of you should stop arguing. Today is a joyous occasion. Xia's first dance belongs to her uncle.

301
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:58,179
- Uncle!
- Dad!

302
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,639
Uncle, a person of your seniority shouldn't fight with us.

303
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:05,699
You do know that seniors shouldn't fight with juniors. If so, why are you fighting with me?

304
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:09,639
I do not understand the meaning of courtesy. Am I right, Xia Xia?

305
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,539
She has to dance with me because I'm her elder. I'm the eldest around here.

306
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:14,979
- No way. She can only dance with me.
- Dad!

307
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:18,119
- You two! She'll dance with me!
- She'll dance with me!
- I'm the eldest around here!

308
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,190
I'm your elder!

309
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,700
Fireworks!

310
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,800
Look!

311
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:30,960
It's very pretty.

312
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,020
It's pretty!

313
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,670
Sister.

314
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:47,510
Why did you drag me here?

315
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,170
I wanted to invite you to a dance since the night at the beach

316
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,230
one year ago.

317
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,650
That's why you should let me dance with you tonight.

318
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,310
Lin, I have something to tell you.

319
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,970
Me, too.

320
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,430
I love you.

321
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,210
Let's end it here.

322
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,719
Now, I can finally tell the difference between you and Fu Zeyi.

323
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:44,480
If so, why did you reject me?

324
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,290
It's precisely because I've spent time with both of you... that I could tell you two apart.

325
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,259
However, I cannot tell whom I fancy.

326
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:57,650
I don't know whose name I will call when I see this face tomorrow.

327
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,390
As long as you're sure that I'm the one you love,

328
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,730
calling me Lin or Fu Zeyi makes no difference to me.

329
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,330
I kept trying to convince myself that Fu Zeyi was a bad person.

330
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,459
He tried to ruin our relationship and even tried to eliminate you.

331
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:18,695
I kept thinking that I must hate him and fall out with him.

332
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:23,818
But now, you've suddenly returned.

333
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:27,424
You're telling me that you're still alive.

334
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,769
Only then did I realize

335
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:33,352
that he's not as bad as I thought.

336
00:27:35,357 --> 00:27:40,187
But you? You had plenty of chances to tell me the truth.

337
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:41,960
- Zhixia.
- However, you chose to keep it a secret.

338
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,330
Zhixia, I didn't mean to hide the truth from you.

339
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,890
I'm not trying to blame you guys here.

340
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,830
No matter if it's Lin or Zeyi,

341
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,919
I can no longer trust either of you.

342
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,739
I'm a simple person. I get off work when it's time. I buy things I like.

343
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:03,719
I have no way to guess what's on your mind.

344
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:06,690
No matter who you are in the future,

345
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,990
always be good friends.

346
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,450
I'm heading back now.

347
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,570
Lin, she's abandoning you, too.

348
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:43,250
I really don't know what to do.

349
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,830
It's fine.

350
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,410
You still have me with you.

351
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:00,709
No matter what happens in the future, I will always stay by your side.

352
00:29:00,709 --> 00:29:02,838
We will face them together.

353
00:29:02,838 --> 00:29:05,908
Lin, I don't wish to give up yet.

354
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:23,500
You had plenty of chances to tell me the truth.

355
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,909
However, you chose to keep it a secret.

356

- I'm not trying to blame you guys here.

357

No matter if it's Lin or Zeyi,

358
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,260
I can no longer trust either of you.

359
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,800
Mom?

360
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,530
Why are you here to drink?

361
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,620
Does Ye Ming know about this?

362
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:56,190
What do you know? This isn't an alcoholic drink. It's a tonic.

363
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,420
Tonic?

364
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,640
Come. Try it.

365
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,700
Mom, I don't want to drink.

366
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Try it.

367
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,080
I promise you won't get drunk tonight.

368
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,120
Just one glass then.

369
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,320
What's with you and Fu Zeyi?

370
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,209
Although you've been smiling a lot today,

371
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:27,500
I can tell that you're troubled by something.

372
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,840
Mom, just drink. Stop talking.

373
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,869
After that, I got to know the so-called Fu Zeyi. Lin said he loved me.

374
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:38,220
Lin and Fu Zeyi are personalities of the same person.

375
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,560
This is how Fu Zeyi usually acts while Lin is normally...

376
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:44,009
When I checked his medical record in the hospital, I found out that...

377
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,129
Fu Zeyi! Don't kill Lin! It was terrifying!

378
00:30:47,129 --> 00:30:50,089
He takes me for a fool usually. In the end, he suddenly said he loved me. Is he out of his mind?

379
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,609
I thought his condition was worsening, but he suddenly said he loved me.

380
00:30:53,609 --> 00:30:58,069
My goodness! Mom, do you understand my pain?

381
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:04,489
What? How dare he take my baby daughter for a fool?

382
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,589
You have to stay away from this man. We're rich enough.

383
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:12,100
He bought the shares of Aizhe Hotel, right?

384
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,080
I'll ask my bank manager to transfer some money to you right now.

385
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,970
My dear mother! You're my dear mother!

386
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,660
You're my dear mother indeed!

387
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,960
Mom, can you add one more zero at the back?

388
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,769
Hello? Prepare some money for me.

389
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,500
Tomorrow, I'll go and redeem my freedom.

How is it? Does your head still hurt?

00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:56,120
No, but I feel dizzy.

394
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,200
You and Xia stayed here and drank throughout the night.

395
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,900
You kept mumbling about zero and one.

396
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,900
I don't remember what happened last night.

397

Brother Ming, where's all of my money?

398
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,220
You just transferred your money to Xiao Xia.

399
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,380
It's in USD, you know?

400
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,770
Let's head to the airport first.

401

We can talk about other things later, okay?

402
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,580
Let's go.

403

At least I'm still good looking.

Are you leaving too?

What? You can't bear to part with me?

Actually, I do like you quite a lot.

Why don't we...

Ye Yuxi, do you wish to die?

410

I was just joking. I knew you liked Fu Zeyi long ago.

Although I did like you a little bit before this,

I won't be as dumb as you.

You're still not willing to let go even though your hands are bleeding.

It's destined to end badly.

Why are you here?

Zeyi had disgraced the He Group with what he had done last time.

And, Director He is infuriated. He wants Zeyi to apologize to him in person.

Apologize to him in person? What about my pride?
