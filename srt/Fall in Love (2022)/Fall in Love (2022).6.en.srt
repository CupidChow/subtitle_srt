Director Fu, I already bought the limited edition bag as you instructed.

Which client are you giving it to?

Second Uncle has started buying the shares of Aizhe Hotel.

I didn't expect Fu Zeyi to act this quickly.

29
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,190
Sister, did you receive this email?

30
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,079
What's up with the new boss? Why is there a shareholders' meeting?

31

You guys know who he is. He's Fu Zeyi.

F-Fu Zeyi?

33
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,649
Demanding compensation from us has been part of his plot all along.

34
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:50,369
He did it to obtain the management rights for Aizhe Hotel so that he could tear it down.

35
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,989
This won't do!

36
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,429
Aizhe Hotel was built with your father's blood, sweat, and tears and mine.

Then you and Fu Zeyi...

Nothing matters anymore.

39
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,479
What matters now is that we have to stop Fu Zeyi from tearing down the hotel.

40

Why are we having a shareholders' meeting all of a sudden?

41

I don't know. Why is Fu Zeyi sitting over there?

42
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,710
From today onward, I'll be the new person in charge of the Aizhe Hotel.

43
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,720
- Why?
- What's happening?

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,919
For the past two years, the hotel's performance has stopped completely.

45
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,139
If this continues, it will definitely affect the profits of everyone here.

46
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,279
That's why I will propose a new plan today.

47
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:42,319
We shall tear down the original hotel

48
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,779
and establish a new business district.

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,460
A new business district?

50
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,319
Fu Zeyi, are you out of your mind?

51
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,639
You want to tear down our hotel, which has over ten years of history?

52
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:54,699
Xiao Fu, you're talking nonsense right now.

53
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,189
No matter how good your hotel is doing, can you ensure that it'll do well throughout the year?

54
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,289
A great business district is different.

55
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,429
You can make profit 365 days long.

56
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,009
The more money our tenants earn, the more money we make.

57
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:11,009
I'm sure everyone here understands that fact and accepts it.

58
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,189
That's why I would like to trouble you guys

60

From tomorrow onward, we shall commence the development of the forest behind the hotel.

Please cooperate with our endeavor.

Everyone... do you guys have any questions?

64
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,129
I do.

65
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,189
I object to your plan.

66

67
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,504
Don't be mistaken.

Currently, I'm the largest shareholder here.

69
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,689
I have the management rights. You don't have the right to object.

70
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,449
You own 33% of the total shares,

71

while I only own 20% of them.

72
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,709
I cannot object to your proposal alone.

73
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:59,163
However, if I include the 15% that my uncle, Jian Qian, owns,

74
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:01,049
we have more shares than you.

75
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:03,789
That's right! I still have 15% of the shares.

76

That's impossible. How could you sell them?

81
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:23,509
Didn't I tell you this before? I bought some properties.

82
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,809
I just sold a tiny bit of them.

83
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,489
How much is "a tiny bit"?

84

You got that right, son. I sold 3% of it.

Since I can't convince him by force, why don't I try an intimate approach?

160
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,129
I'll do it for the sake of the hotel.

161
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,934
Is the portrait on it that important?

162
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,609
Look.

163
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:10,589
This is the first head chef of Aizhe Hotel, Uncle Ren.

164
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,969
He's very particular.

165
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:17,769
He cooks instant noodles only for three minutes, not a second more or less.

166
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,349
And... and this.

167
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:27,790
This chubby man is the manager of the housekeeping department, Uncle Li.

168
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,429
He was especially terrified of his wife.

169
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,909
And this guy is our lobby manager. He loves to smile.

170
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:40,069
This woman is Auntie Li from the cleaning department.

171
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:44,230
She always buys delicious food for me.

172
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,789
I don't think you know the rest.

173
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,189
But I think you can recognize these two.

174
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:57,529
This is my uncle. This is Jian Bufan.

175
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,789
And...

176
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,529
this is me.

177
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,509
There are 52 portraits here.

178
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:17,749
All of them are veteran employees who grew together with Aizhe Hotel.

179
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:20,689
They're also the family I treasure.

180
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,409
Family?

181
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,035
But I didn't feel that you were treating this place as your home.

182
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:28,569
If not, why would you sell its shares?

183
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,910
I sold its shares

184
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:35,069
because I hoped that someone better could manage it

185
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:37,529
instead of tearing it down.

186
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,409
I'm done.

187
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,409
This is what you usually look like.

188
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:14,349
Do I look this ugly?

189
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,749
This is Employee No. 53.

190
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:24,909
Fu Zeyi,

191
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:27,809
if you manage our hotel well,

192
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:30,420
you'll be part of the family, too.

193
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:33,969
Even though you're the son of the Fu family, you can't afford to make mistakes.

194
00:15:33,969 --> 00:15:39,189
If you commit any mistake and embarrass the Fu family, I'll drive you out immediately!

195
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,410
Is it that easy to become a part of a family?

196
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,030
Why don't you give it a try?

197
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,880
Right now, you're an important part of Aizhe Hotel, too.

198
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:57,029
Although I don't think this is a suitable timing, I...

199
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:59,069
If so, you can keep quiet.

200
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,329
Can you please not tear down the hotel?

201
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,909
Forget it. Just forget about what I said.

202
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,349
I'll consider it.

203
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,409
What? I didn't hear wrongly, did I?

204
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,369
Are you saying

205
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:35,009
that you won't tear it down immediately?

206
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,309
I said I'd consider it.

207
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,740
I didn't say yes.

208
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:42,080
And

209
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:45,100
don't get too close.

210
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:48,760
What? Don't tell me you dare not look me in the eye

211
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,680
because you want to break your promise?

212
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,820
Sister!

213
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:03,329
- Sister.
- Director Fu, are you okay?

214
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:05,069
Sister,

215
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,812
so the "idea" that you came up with was to seduce him with your charm?

216
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,295
Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital?

217
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:17,988
It's fine. The wound isn't that serious.

218
00:17:17,988 --> 00:17:22,279
I have something to report to you. The research result on the natural oxygen bar of the back hill is out.

219
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,160
The researchers found several rare and protected plants.

220
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,439
- Do we need to deal with them in a special manner?
- No.

221
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,359
We should hasten the progress while Aizhe Hotel is still in the dark to prevent any additional trouble.

222
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,479
So are we proceeding with the original plan tomorrow?

223
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:40,299
Can you please not tear down the hotel?

224
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,770
I'll consider it.

225
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,320
I thought our plan would change

226
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,170
after what had happened to you there.

227
00:17:51,899 --> 00:17:55,439
Do you think I'm that easily convinced?

228
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,519
Understood.

229
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,359
By the way,

230
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,899
is the project plan for the new complex out yet?

231
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:05,139
The preliminary plan is ready. Take a look.

232
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,759
Will it affect our original plan if we add another hotel

233
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,599
to the complex?

234
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,159
If you're referring to Aizhe Hotel,

235
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,639
I don't think it'll be a big problem.

236
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,340
All right. Make some minor adjustments.

237
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,950
Okay.

238
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,159
Is it because of Miss Jing?

239
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,739
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that.

240
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,439
Hello?

241
00:18:55,439 --> 00:18:57,059
Ai Xin.

242
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,599
Since I was your sponsor,

243
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,339
are you willing to repay me now that you've grown up?

244
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,719
Are you willing to repay me?

245
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,399
Are you willing to do it even if I ask you to kill someone for me?

246
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,999
Doctor,

247
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:33,519
the melatonin you prescribed is no longer effective.

248
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,639
Can you please prescribe

249
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,619
some sleeping pills to me tomorrow morning?

250
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:46,752
[Uncle]

251
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,079
Hello?

252
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:55,739
Zhixia, why aren't you at the hotel yet?

253
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:58,485
I thought we didn't need to work today?

254
00:19:58,485 --> 00:20:00,380
Yes, I know we don't need to work,

255
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,690
but doesn't it provide Fu Zeyi with a chance to take down the back hill?

256
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,899
What?

257
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:08,599
Didn't he say he'd consider it when he was in the wine cellar?

258
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,051
I'll hang up for now.

259
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,239
Hello, the number you have dialed is unavailable. Please call again later.

260
00:20:19,239 --> 00:20:22,170
Fu Zeyi, just wait and see.

261
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,200
[Aizhe Hotel]

262
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,259
I'll be there immediately!

263
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,859
Uncle! The back hill!

264
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:32,879
Okay. Calm down.

265
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,139
The oxygen bar is safe. The hotel is safe too.

266
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,742
What do you mean?

267
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:39,539
It's a long story. Follow me.

268
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,639
- Sister.
- What's going on?
- Dad, you're here?

269
00:20:53,639 --> 00:20:55,900
This morning, a group of wild plant conservation experts said

270
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,700
they discovered several rare plants on the back hill.

271
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,120
They've added them to the wild plant conservation name list.

272
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,340
The trees are safe.

273
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,060
Also, in order to protect the habitat here,

274
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,319
the entire land around the back hill will be protected from now on.

275
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,480
That means Fu Zeyi cannot tear down our hotel.

276
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,599
That's right.

277
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,939
Not bad at all. I didn't expect you to be this smart.

278
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,599
You actually found some experts yourself.

279
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,619
Good job, Boy.

280
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:18,780
It wasn't me.

281
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,419
A good Samaritan delivered the plant information to the experts.

282
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:26,179
The experts rushed here overnight after reading it. That's how they stopped them.

283
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:27,399
Great job.

284
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:30,599
Fu Zeyi needs to be taught a lesson.

285
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,599
Why didn't I think of that? I even tried to beg him.

286
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,099
Sister, he's here.

287
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,379
Director Fu, I didn't expect you to be this famous.

288
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:46,319
Even the experts are here to pay you a visit.

289
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,679
Did you bring them here?

290
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,820
That's not important.

291
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,379
The important thing is that the unscrupulous Director Fu can actually fail too.

292
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,839
Seems like you don't always get your way.

293
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,439
Goodbye.

294
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,799
Zeyi,

295
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,519
I heard that you've encountered some trouble rebuilding Aizhe Hotel.

296
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,879
What's going on?

297
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:14,139
Second Uncle, you're pretty well-informed, aren't you?

298
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,299
Everyone in the company knows about it now.

299
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,219
All the shareholders came to me early in the morning.

300
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,699
Luckily, your father is abroad right now.

301
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,279
If your father learns about this, he'll surely throw a huge tantrum.

302
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:25,659
Tell me the exact situation so that I can cover up for you later, am I right?

303
00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:28,039
Don't worry, Second Uncle. I've already come up with a backup plan.

304
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,279
All right.

305
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,279
I'll hang up then.

306
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,419
Fu Zeyi,

307
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,279
I'll see how capable you are.

308
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,920
Keep a close eye on him.

309
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,479
Report to me immediately if anything happens.

310
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,162
Understood.

311
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,379
Hello, Ai Xin?

312
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:14,819
I won't return to the Fu Group for the time being.

313
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,999
I'll stay at Aizhe Hotel and come up with a solution so that those old men won't cause trouble for me.

314
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:20,679
All right, Director Fu.

315
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,279
What's the situation?

316
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,081
Why do you look so pale?

317
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:31,146

Lin's influence on my life is gradually increasing.

319
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,199
He was the reason my acquisition plan was ruined.

320
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:40,739
This is too much of a coincidence. It just had to happen right before we took down the back hill.

321
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:42,939
Should we investigate it?

All right, Director Fu.

Hello, Director Jing.

330
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,979
I thought you weren't taking down Aizhe Hotel? Then why are you still here?

331
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:20,259
I've already stopped the hotel rebuilding plan.

332
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,179
You don't need to be so hostile toward me.

333
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,779
Do you think I'll believe you?

334
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:28,559
The Fu Group's new business district is a mega project.

335
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,499
You won't give it up that easily. I'm sure you're up to something again.

336
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,379
The hotel's performance is terrible.

337
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,059
The other shareholders won't let you off.

338
00:24:44,059 --> 00:24:48,219
If you're free enough to keep an eye on me, why don't you come up with a way to manage the hotel better?

339
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:50,679
I will always keep an eye on you, Fu Zeyi.

Ye Yuxi is staying in our hotel.

Ye Yuxi? Who's that?

356
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,919
It's an idol who's quite popular lately.

357
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,256
Look. Those are all pictures of him.

358
00:25:42,256 --> 00:25:46,379
I know him. He's the brand ambassador for the bag brand I like.

00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,239
Fine. I knew it was because of some bag brand.

What's the matter?

363
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,739
It's all because of that Ye...

364
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,979
He's Ye Yuxi, Dad.

365
00:25:57,979 --> 00:25:59,979
That's right, Ye Yuxi.

- His fans.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,059
He's such a troublesome brat.

368
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,519
He wasn't satisfied with all the rooms. Listen.

369
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,539
He's here to stir up trouble. There's no way we can do business with him.

370
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,939
My dear uncle, you're an expert who's been in this field for three decades.

371

Is there a customer you can't handle?

372
00:26:21,967 --> 00:26:24,146
You do have a point.

373
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:27,679
So what I heard from the reception desk was true then.

374
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,179
They said Ye Yuxi once went to a famous restaurant.

375
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:34,119
He posted about them because he thought the food was terrible.

376
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:38,419
In the end, all of his fans went to the restaurant's page and left bad reviews.

377
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:40,939
This can't be.

378
00:26:40,939 --> 00:26:42,899
We finally managed to safe Aizhe Hotel.

379
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,739
We mustn't let them defame us on the Internet and affect our reputation.

380
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,019
We mustn't give Fu Zeyi the opportunity to exploit us.

381
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,239
He just wants a different room, right?

382
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,959
Just change his room until he's satisfied with it.

383
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,919
Yes.

384
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,719
However, he has another request...

385
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,819
What request?

386
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,239
He has chosen you to serve him.

387
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:11,379
Hello, room service.

Mr. Ye, I heard that you weren't satisfied with the room we had arranged for you.

395

May I know what is the problem?

I'm on a private trip and don't want to be disturbed.

397

But there's a skyscraper just opposite my room.

398
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,159
Do I have to be on the lookout for the paparazzi and sasaeng fans?

Ye Yuxi, are you an elementary school kid?

You're making things difficult for her on purpose.

Why are you so anxious?

407
00:29:02,219 --> 00:29:06,759
I did so because I don't want my brother to marry that old woman who's her mother.

408
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,300
Add a little sugar.

416
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:45,709
Not just that, but he would also use the opportunity to criticize me

417

for doing a bad job at serving the customers.

Otherwise?

432
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,749
Arrange an executive suite for me and I can move out at any time.

433
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,249
So did he truly come up with a new solution

434
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:53,629
and give up on taking over Aizhe Hotel?

435
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,779
This is our presidential suite,

436

the best room in Aizhe Hotel.

437

It's filthy.

- I'm─
- Who are you?

447

Why did you enter my room without permission?

448
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,480
I was staying here before you moved in.

449
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,990
You wouldn't even get to enjoy this room if I hadn't moved out.

450

- Fu Zeyi, don't tell me you want to break your promise?
- I forgot to take my document.

Get up.

452

You took your stuff, right?

453
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:13,619
You should stop interrupting my housekeeper from doing her cleaning duties.

454
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,899
Are there no other housekeepers in Aizhe Hotel?

455
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:19,720
Why are you doing the cleaning personally?

456
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,899
I told her to.

457
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,149
But I didn't force her. She did it of her own accord,

458
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:28,469
am I right?

459
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:30,249
The customer is king.

460
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,549
It's my duty to provide you with the best service.

461
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,469
You're a good housekeeper indeed.

462
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,069
Let me ask you this.

463
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:46,029
Can't you reject the customers' requests when they are unreasonable?

464
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:47,987
I'm doing it for the hotel's sake

465

and for your sake, Director Fu, Aizhe's major shareholder.

I don't think there's a problem with this.

Besides,

468

you also ordered me around before, didn't you?

469
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,369
She doesn't have any objections.

00:35:03,074 --> 00:35:09,835
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

475
00:35:09,835 --> 00:35:17,600
♫  If I decide to be brave this time,  ♫

476
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:24,120
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

477
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:32,154
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

478
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:38,385
♫  It will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

479
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:46,140
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

480
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,880
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

481
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,134
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

482
00:35:54,134 --> 00:35:57,597
♫  Just to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

483
00:35:57,597 --> 00:36:01,130
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

484
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:07,690
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

485
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:13,895
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
