Yes. Zhixia is one of us.

All right, then I won't waste time.

34
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:45,520
The Fu Group stole my designs.

Aren't the Fu Group and Helai Jewelry strategic partners?

37
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:55,649
I'm an independent designer.

38
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,583
I still have proprietary rights over the new product designs of the furniture promoted at the press conference.

If you want to use my designs, please pay the copyright fee

Tell me, how much are the copyright fees?

43

Not much.

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,409
- Just 500 million yuan ($71,8 million).
- Say that again?

45
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,540
That's daylight robbery.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,299
I know an artist's work deserves some respect,

47
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,220
but 500 million yuan is outrageous.

48

Fine, you can choose not to pay.

Okay.

I'm willing to apologize if I did something wrong.

Your apology isn't sincere at all.

How do you want me to apologize?

The day we announced the marriage alliance for the two enterprises, you left in front of everyone.

Let's do it on a similar occasion

Of course not.

Why did you tell me to agree to pay the fees?

70

As expected of Director Fu.

You clearly don't know him well enough. He's just as brilliant as always.

As far as I know, Fu Zeyi would always probe into new clients

for any dark history before working with them to get something to be used against them as a leeway.

You'll be able to suppress the other party with your domineering attitude.

You can put it that way. After all, the body belongs to Fu Zeyi.

Aren't you going to explain?

324
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,599
Congratulations on graduating smoothly.

325
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,879
Uncle Fu, thank you for sponsoring my studies.

326
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:07,400
So? Have you found a job yet?

327
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,210
Not yet.

328
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,500
Why don't you come and help me out then?

331
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:24,300
This person is my biggest competitor in the Fu Group.

332
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,400
After this, you must find ways to stay next to him.

333
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,410
All right.

334
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,200
I have nothing to explain.

335
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,100
So you had trouble sleeping because of this?

336
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,600
You feel guilty.

337
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Is that the same person you were on the phone with when you were with me the other day?

338
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,800
Also,

339
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,300
is this also the reason you can't be with me?

340
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,090
I'm sorry. I have nothing to say.

341
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,200
The senior I knew was kind and beautiful.

342
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,430
She was smart and competent.

343
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,950
She got scholarships every year.

344
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,190
In every school event,

345
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,800
she was always the center of attention as long as she participated.

346
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,200
There was also a boy who liked her for six years.

347
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,250
She would never be like this.
