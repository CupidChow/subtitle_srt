Not even my dad and mom bossed me around like this.

What did I ever do to Ye Yuxi?

19
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:52,700
He's clearly out to get me.

20

If not for Aizhe Hotel,

21
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,329
I would've turned against him.

22
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:01,070
Right. I also think that Ye Yuxi is purposely taunting you.

23

By the way, take a look at this.

He posted a snide remark about you on Weibo.

25

He didn't even photoshop my photo.

Look.

The comments are all praising our hotel.

"The hotel where Xixizi is staying seems very nice."

"I wish to stay in the same hotel as Yuxi."

I just got an idea.

A way to get back at Ye Yuxi

Every room at Aizhe Hotel is labeled as Ye Yuxi's preferred choice.

Thanks to your shenanigan.

43

Are you actually dumb or just pretending to be?

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,989
You're getting free publicity for Aizhe.

49
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,400
You're lowering your market value.

Do you think going to Aizhe to annoy Zhixia

You're promoting the room I stayed in as the highlight of Aizhe and cashing in on it.

63
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,129
Shouldn't you show your gratitude and treat me to a good meal?

He's not asking me out to eat.

69
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:32,300
He just wants to suck me dry.

70

That's not the point.

71
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:37,929
The point is that a handsome young man asked you out.

That just means a handsome young man is sucking me dry.

Director Sheng of Yiju Home Furnishing.

Yiju Home Furnishing has a large fan base and a high brand loyalty.

Are you thinking...

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,559
Are you hoping to use it as a base to develop a new market?

108

That's right.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,979
We went to great lengths to get Aizhe located in the central district and develop a new industrial ecosystem,

110
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,400
but then I thought about it from a different angle.

111
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,019
Wherever Yiju is, that place has the potential to be the new base.

112
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:06,479
I must say this is an unexpected move from you.

113
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,039
So the reason you shut yourself off at Aizhe

114
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,700
was to prevent any leaks.

115
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,500
Once I sign the contract with Director Sheng,

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,400
it should be set.

117
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,459
Director Sheng's primary concern in picking a partner is punctuality.

118

Is he related to the cooperation in some way?

He isn't.

127

And he's not a client.

Director Fu,

129

This is the latest limited edition.

How did you manage to buy it?

134
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,200
I didn't buy it. It's a gift from the brand.

135

After much self-reflection, I realized how awful I had behaved previously.

Consider this a little gift.

Your gift

138
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,779

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,279
Where are you going?

165
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:38,899
- I'm going to get my bag.
- I can get you another one.

166
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,519
Another one? That's a limited edition.

167
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,739
That's not a problem.

168
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,359
A bag from you? No, thanks.

169
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,519
Hello? Something happened. Help me out.

170
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,179
Buy me some time.

171
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:54,700
It's great that you're so busy.

172
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,699
Don't let me keep you.

173
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,999
I'm not done talking.

174
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,519
I'm going to take my bag.

175
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:05,920
♫  I have confessed twice  ♫

176
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,239
Why must you have his bag but not mine?

177
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:15,814
♫  You wouldn't want me to give up my dignity for love  ♫

178
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:19,064
♫  I have confessed to you a third time  ♫

179
00:11:19,064 --> 00:11:22,692
♫  Were you expecting it to be like a scene in a movie?  ♫

180
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:27,974
♫  I'll pretend to be pitiful, perhaps I'm doing it willingly  ♫

181
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,439
Dad.

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,719
What's going on between you two?

183
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,659
I asked what that was all about?

184
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,759
You two carry on. I'll take my leave.

185
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,659
Stay right there.

186
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,659
I want to talk to both of you.

187
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,399
Uncle, you wanted to talk to us because...

188
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:21,879
Keep quiet. I'll do the talking.

189
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,259
You don't have to listen to him.

190
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,179
Fu Zeyi, do you realize what you've done?

191
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,779
Director Sheng mentioned your partnership.

192
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,119
He thought you'd do your best to make up for Fu Group's losses.

193
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,379
But not only did you not turn up for the appointment but also didn't answer his calls.

194
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:41,579
Now, look at it. Director Sheng will never work with Fu Group anymore!

195
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,039
Something came up last minute. I wasn't able to inform him.

196
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,779
I'll pay him a visit to ask for pardon later.

197
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,539
Are you referring to her?

198
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:54,839
No wonder you wouldn't agree to a blind date with Helai Jewelry's daughter.

199
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,279
Is it because of her too?

200
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,479
It has nothing to do with her.

201
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:01,100
Rumors were circulating in the company that you were the one who wrote the letter to the botanic garden.

202
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,599
I didn't believe it,

203
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,614
but it seems like it's true.

204
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:07,183
- Uncle, what...
- Shut up.

205
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,359
Because of this woman, you disregarded the company's interest time and time again.

206
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,759
Do you not know

207
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:18,259
that I could sue you for tunneling benefits to Aizhe?

208
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,399
Look at you.

209
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,819
You still don't realize your mistake.

210
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,839
Quit if you don't want to do it.

211
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,499
I'm notifying you right now.

212
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,439
All your responsibilities at Fu Group have been terminated.

213
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:36,979
Since you want to stay at Aizhe, stay there forever.

214
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,359
Uncle.

215
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,599
I will return to the company,

216
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:43,519
and I'll have Yiju's signed contract with me.

217
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,819
Fine.

218
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,459
You have one week.

219
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:52,839
If you can't sort this out, you will not set foot in the Fu Group again.

220
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,059
What did Uncle mean by "tunneling benefits"?

221
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:02,919
I told you not to listen to him.

222
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,919
Did I cause trouble for you?

223
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,619
It's nothing.

224
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,079
Let's chat.

225
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,599
It's late. We can chat tomorrow.

226
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:49,779
I don't want to see you at the hotel again.

227
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,739
Do you own this hotel or something?

228
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,839
Come with me.

229
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:09,300
Imagine your fans and the media saw these photos.

230
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:15,239
I'm afraid your "born handsome" image would be ruined.

231
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,459
It's normal to have some shameful past before becoming famous.

232
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:23,799
Besides, being chubby is due to body constitution.

233
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,440
It's not a flaw.

234
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,019
Who knows, you might become chubby yourself one day.

235
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,059
Indeed.

236
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,239
Being chubby is a physical constitution and not a flaw.

237
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,399
But you're an exception.

238
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:42,159
You edited your past chubby photos into those of a pretty boy.

239
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,179
If your competitors got their hands on these,

240
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,379
do you think they'd spare you?

241
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,339
What is it you want?

242
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,719
Nothing much.

243
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,279
I'm just offering you a deal.

244
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,799
What deal?

245
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,859
Leave Aizhe.

246
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,599
That simple?

247
00:16:03,599 --> 00:16:05,519
There's one more thing.

248
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,059
Draw the line with Jing Zhixia and keep your distance.

249
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,879
So you are into Jing Zhixia?

250
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,479
I'm doing this for Aizhe.

251
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,919
Aizhe is currently in my purview, after all.

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,959
Okay?

253
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:28,139
Okay. Okay, I'll leave.

254
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,439
Because of this woman, you disregarded the company's interest time and time again.

255
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,859
Do you not know

256
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:52,199
that I could sue you for tunneling benefits to Aizhe?

257
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,819
Come in.

258
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,079
- Miss Jing.
- What is it?

259
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,579
This is the bag Director Fu got you as compensation.

260
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,738
When did he buy this?

261
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,918
If you really want to know,

262
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:15,698
you could ask him yourself.

263
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,198
Sister.

264
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:22,199
Hi, Senior Sister.

265
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,059
Sister, I got news about the thing you asked me to check.

266
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:32,579
What is it? What kind of trouble did Fu Zeyi get himself into?

267
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,859
It's related to you.

268
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,899
I know. Just tell me.

269
00:17:37,899 --> 00:17:39,639
I need water first.

270
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,319
Tell me.

271
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:49,500
You know what? That vamp at Aizhe is trying to seduce Director Fu. What a tramp!

272
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,720
Right, what a tramp!

273
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,259
Here is the thing.

274
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,919
People at the Fu Group said you're particularly attractive.

275
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:01,699
Fu Zeyi was enamored by your charms.

276
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:05,459
He steadied the capsizing ship and turned against himself to save Aizhe.

277
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,939
Did I hear you correctly?

278
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:11,459
He helped me to get back at himself?

279
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:14,399
That doesn't make any sense.

280
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,059
Don't look at me.

281
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:18,539
The people around you are all weirdos.

282
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:22,379
Ye Yuxi asked you out for a meal so I thought he was interested in you,

283
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:24,659
but he suddenly checked out in the middle of the night.

284
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:29,179
Today, Fu Zeyi gave up on demolishing the hotel because of you.

285
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:30,879
I don't know anymore.

286
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,579
Did you put a curse on them?

287
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,121
What is up with Fu Zeyi?

288
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:41,221
Was his father telling the truth?

289
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,800
Director Fu, are you sure you'll be working from Aizhe from now on?

290
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,779
I can no longer go back to the Fu Group.

291
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,119
I suppose you should think about whether you wish to stay with me.

292
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,759
Anyway, I wasn't able to get in touch with Director Sheng.

293
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,059
I have his secretary's number.

294
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,359
- Hello. 
- Hello, I am Ai Xin from the Fu Group.

295
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,879
- Are you Mr. Sheng's secretary?
- Yes.

296
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:19,559
I'd like to find out about Director Sheng's schedule.

297
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,219
Could you arrange a meeting with Junior Director Fu?

298
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:24,339
I'm sorry. Director Sheng is on leave today.

299
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,099
May I know what he has planned on his off day?

300
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,979
I-It's not for me to say.

301
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,379
Hi, please sign the receipt.

302
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:33,539
- So they're sailing at 3 p.m., right?
- Yes.

303
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,799
I have other things to do. Is there anything else you need?

304
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,799
No, thank you.

305
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,079
On leave? Going out to sea.

306
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,489
- Then it has to be a yacht club.
- Right.

307
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:47,049
I'll look for yacht clubs.

308
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,469
I got it, Director Fu.

309
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,309
The yacht clubs are located at either the South Olympic Bay or North Olympic Bay.

310
00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,909
They're at opposite ends. We don't have enough time.

311
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,369
Sorry, Director Fu. I need to get this call.

312
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,089
We don't have much time. Let's split up.

313
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,969
- You go to the south, and I'll go to the north.
- Okay.

314
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,089
Ai Xin?

315
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,589
I'm fine.

316
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,509
Are you okay?

317
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,429
Are you feeling unwell? What's wrong?

318
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:53,309
What's the matter, Ai Xin?

319
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,231
In the upcoming week, you'll do everything you can

320
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:03,180
to stop Fu Zeyi from working with Yiju's Director Sheng.

321
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,749
What do you want me to do?

322
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:09,110
You're smart.

323
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,789
You should know what to do.

324
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,189
Okay.

325
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,629
Ai Xin?

326
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,087
I'm okay. My stomach suddenly feels a bit weird.

327
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:28,489
- Do you want to go to the hospital?
- Senior Sister?

328
00:21:28,489 --> 00:21:30,040
No need.

329
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,729
What's wrong?

330
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:36,669
You look pale. Why don't I take you to the hospital?

331
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,489
Fu Zeyi, what kind of boss are you?

332
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:42,169
Look at the state your staff is in. Are you still making her work?

333
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:45,769
- It seems like you have murderous intent.
- You're mistaken.

334
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:48,469
It's not Director Fu's fault.

335
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:51,289
Ai Xin, I think you should rest today.

336
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:54,869
- But how will you manage by yourself?
- It's okay.

337
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:57,209
It's fine. I can handle it.

338
00:21:57,209 --> 00:22:01,809
- But, Director Sheng...
- No buts. Your boss said you don't have to go.

339
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:05,769
Come on, I'll take you to the hospital. Follow me.

340
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:07,389
Go on.

341
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,669
Let's go.

342
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,480
Get me a cab.

343
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,180
All right.

344
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,989
- Ai Xin.
- Here.

345
00:22:20,989 --> 00:22:23,469
The test result didn't show any problems.

346
00:22:23,469 --> 00:22:25,909
Here's a prescription.

347
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,909
You can go pay your wife's bill.

348
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:29,949
- He's not...
- Okay.

349
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,789
- Come to me if there's anything.
- Thanks.

350
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,749
I'll call my fiancé to come and get me.

351
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,105
The number you have dialed is not available at the moment.

352
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:45,783
Please try again later.

353
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,369
Let your...

354
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,889
junior settle the bill for you. Wait for me here.

355
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:01,009
If we can't find Director Sheng, Junior Director Fu will not be able to go back to the Fu Group.

356
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,810
[Miss Jing,can I trouble you to go to the South Olympic Bay to look for a person?]

357
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,245
Miss Jing, can I trouble you to go to the South Olympic Bay to look for a person?

358
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:10,499
The person is very important to Junior Director Fu.

359
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,669
What is he so busy with? Is there really so much to do?

360
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:16,369
He's here.

361
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,120
I'll take that.

362
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:23,569
Thanks.

363
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,689
Sorry, my dear. I'm late.

364
00:23:27,689 --> 00:23:29,769
- Shixian.
- Let's go.

365
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:31,789
The traffic was bad.

366
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,329
I'll go now, Senior.

367
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:38,689
- This is...
- He's my junior, Jian Bufan. He brought me to the hospital.

368
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:41,230
Junior, where are you headed? I can give you a ride.

369
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,049
It's fine. Bye bye.

370
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,840
It's Director Wang.

371
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,009
Hello, Director Wang.

372
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:55,069
Yes, I'm outside.

373
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,529
Okay. A meeting in the afternoon?

374
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,709
My dear, something urgent came up. I don't think I can take you back.

375
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:10,989
It's okay. You go ahead. I can go back by myself.

376
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:14,609
Why don't I send Senior home? I'm free anyway.

377
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:18,220
- That's great. Please send Ai Xin back home, Junior.
- Sure.

378
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:20,589
Stay safe.

379
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,189
Go on.

380
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,169
Your fiancé

381
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,249
sure is a busy man.

382
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:40,309
The person you're looking for is here. At the North Olympic Yacht Club.

383
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:41,749
How did you know?

384
00:24:41,749 --> 00:24:45,049
Forget about that. Just get yourself here.

385
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:54,949
I promise I won't bother Director Sheng. Just think of me as invisible, can't you?

386
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:58,389
I'm sorry. This is a private venue. Please leave.

387
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:00,529
Junior Director Fu.

388
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,389
Director Sheng knows you're tracking his whereabouts,
[North Olympic Yacht Club]

389
00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:09,520
but he's made it very clear that he doesn't have anything more to say to you.

390
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,480
Please save yourself the trouble.

391
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:13,089
I just need five minutes.

392
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,829
I'm sorry. Director Sheng left for an urgent matter.

393
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:18,729
He's really not here. Excuse me.

394
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,329
I'm sorry. I should've been more low-key.

395
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:27,569
It's not your fault.

396
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,889
- Why are you here?
- Ai Xin fell ill, didn't she?

397
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:34,289
She contacted me and said you were urgently looking for someone so I came to help...

398
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,749
to help her.

399
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,140
What should we do now?

400
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:44,529
Let's leave for now.

401
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:46,829
Look around and see if there are other exits.

402
00:25:46,829 --> 00:25:48,889
He has to leave sooner or later.

403
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:51,889
Excuse me, this place is off-limits. Please.

404
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:53,609
Let's go.

405
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,329
Did Fu Zeyi really do all those things for me?

406
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,029
What's the matter?

407
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:21,709
There's a girl over there.

408
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:25,720
Why is the little girl alone at the beach? That's dangerous.

409
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:30,869
Little Girl, why are you all alone? Where are your parents?

410
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:34,329
I'm looking for Xiaoyou. That's my best friend.

411
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:38,509
But look. The sea level is rising. It's dangerous.

412
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:42,309
You're not the sea. How do you know it will rise?

413
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,749
That's how tides work, Little Sister.

414
00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:47,849
Are you hungry? Let me take you to eat something nice.

415
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:50,770
You'll need energy to look for Xiaoyou.

416
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:54,509
You go ahead

417
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:56,469
and I'll accompany her.

418
00:26:56,469 --> 00:27:00,060
Never mind. Do you want to be a good Samaritan?

419
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:03,229
Then finish what you started.

420
00:27:03,229 --> 00:27:07,609
But you are strangers. I'm not supposed to go with you.

421
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,629
Hello, my name is Jing Zhixia.

422
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:16,049
This sourpuss is Fu Zeyi.

423
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:18,329
- What's your name?
- I'm Yanyan.

424
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:23,529
Now that we know one another's names, we're no longer strangers.

425
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:28,369
Do you have your ID card to prove that's your real name?

426
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,529
Children nowadays are too smart.

427
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,580
Do you have it?

428
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:38,029
- You don't?
- I don't.

429
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,469
So chubby. This isn't you. You're lying.

430
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,429
Is this you?

431
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:06,729
Yanyan, how did you get separated from Xiaoyou?

432
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:09,309
Do you know how to contact her?

433
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,050
I buried her in the sand,

434
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,550
and then I went to collect shells.

435
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:15,329
She was gone when I got back.

436
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,350
So Xiaoyou isn't a real person?

437
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,529
It doesn't matter if Xiaoyou is a person or not. She's my best friend.

438
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,249
Then why did you bury her?

439
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:26,529
I wanted to play in the water, but Xiaoyou can't get wet.

440
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,569
When I got back, I couldn't find the mark anymore.

441
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:43,289
The mark was probably washed away by the waves.

442
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:45,110
I have to go and look for Xiaoyou again.

443
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,669
Hold on. Look, it's getting dark.

444
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:48,630
Let's stop searching.

445
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:51,629
If you want someone to play with,

446
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,849
we can play with you.

447
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,289
Why do you look at me?

448
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,129
I won't play.

449
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,209
I won't.

450
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,949
What kind of games do you usually play with Xiaoyou?

451
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,610
We play house. There are three of us.

452
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,029
I'll be the mom. You can be the daughter in place of Xiaoyou.

453
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,470
Okay. Then that makes him the dad.

454
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,369
The dad is never at home. Forget about him.

455
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:28,189
He can be my daughter's husband.

456
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,089
So you're the mother-in-law?

457
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:36,549
It's your first time meeting the mother-in-law.

458
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:41,149
Let me introduce him. He is my new boyfriend.

459
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,189
Here's one million. Leave my daughter.

460
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:49,870
Where did you learn that from?

461
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,529
From the TV.

462
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:55,849
Children shouldn't watch so many TV series.

463
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,349
Pardon me. I only accept cash,

464
00:30:05,349 --> 00:30:08,029
and you'll sign a contract saying that the one million is a gift.

465
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:12,469
In case, you try to threaten me next time and ask me to return the one million. Okay?

466
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,329
What did he say?

467
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,589
Ignore him.

468
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,169
A child's life is so straightforward.

469
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:30,249
They eat and then they sleep.

470
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:40,289
It's been a while. You've even got a child now.

471
00:30:40,289 --> 00:30:41,989
- No way.
- No way.

472
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:44,389
I'm just joking.

473
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,429
You two seem to be on good terms today.

474
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:53,309
You're not having a lovers' quarrel, right?

475
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,769
We found this girl at the beach and brought her here.

476
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:59,469
You found the girl? You really did us a favor then.

477
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:03,689
This afternoon, a parent came to report a missing child.

478
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:06,929
That's great. She'll be reunited with her parents.

479
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,240
She fell asleep.

480
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,390
I'll take it from here.

481
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,909
Okay. Our job is done. Let's go.

482
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:33,409
Hold on.

483
00:31:34,842 --> 00:31:36,304
Hi.

484
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:38,723
May I know where Yanyan's parents are?

485
00:31:38,723 --> 00:31:41,329
Her mother passed away long ago.

486
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,550
How about this...

487
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,049
- Stay safe.
- Okay.

488
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:53,689
Bye.

489
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,669
What did you talk about?

490
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,149
You chatted with the mother for a long time.

491
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:05,890
That's Yanyan's nanny.

492
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,129
Her mother passed away a long time ago.

493
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,909
Her father is still on his way back.

494
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,629
No wonder.

495
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,769
Neither her dad nor mom are around.

496
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,469
That's why she made friends with a doll.

497
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:26,310
Anyway, I asked the nanny for a photo of Xiaoyou.

498
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,429
I think it'd be easy to find the same doll.

499
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,350
What? Are you going to buy the same one?

500
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,129
She's five.

501
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:38,709
She's not three.

502
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,430
I'm not a child, either.

503
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,609
I know that.

504
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,349
So what are you planning?

505
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,680
According to Yanyan's nanny,

506
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,540
the doll's eyes had traces of being patched.

507
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:12,149
Why look at me? Do you think I know how to sew?

508
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,289
I don't, either.

509
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,309
Here's the thing.

510
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,009
Both of us can't sew,

511
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:23,810
but the smarter one will surely be able to learn it quicker.

512
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,409
It's obvious you're the smarter one.

513
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,430
♫ You dumped me, and it's not easy to be single again ♫

514
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,250
Don't film.

515
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,880
♫ Everything is moving too fast, it's hard to accept  ♫

516
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,500
♫ I hid my inexplicable excitement with a wry smile ♫

517
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:51,520
♫ It's hard to become single once again ♫
♫ Once again, my love life has infinite opportunities ♫

518
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,200
♫ Our love has been engraved deep in my heart ♫
♫ In the end, we're no longer together ♫

519
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,640
♫ In the end, we've become a pair of strangers ♫

520
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,249
Done.

521
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,109
Let me see.

522
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:10,708
Not bad.

523
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:14,349
Yanyan's nanny told me that she'd hug Xiaoyou to sleep every night.

524
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:16,589
The doll must be especially soft.

525
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:18,769
There is a difference between an old and a new doll.

526
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,749
You have more strength. Squish it.

527
00:34:21,749 --> 00:34:24,149
You do it. For this, you don't need me.

528
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,329
Just squish it. Do it!

529
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,300
Come on.

530
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,349
How?

531
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:35,149
Hug it. Hug it.

532
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,349
- What?
- Squish.

533
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:38,450
- Yes.
- Like this?

534
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,129
Yes.

535
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,069
You said you have no strength? You're strong!

536
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:46,029
You need to squish hard.

537
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,320
One, two, three, really tight!

538
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:19,500
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid of being alone  ♫

539
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,990
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

540
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,849
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

541
00:35:34,849 --> 00:35:41,710
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

542
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:49,380
♫  If I decide to be brave this time  ♫

543
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:55,920
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

544
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:04,030
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

545
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:10,660
♫  we will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

546
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:18,040
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

547
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,760
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

548
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,010
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

549
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:29,459
♫  in order to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

550
00:36:29,459 --> 00:36:32,930
♫  If you were by my side  ♫

551
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:39,470
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

552
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:46,270
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
