00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:31,570
[Episode 3]

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,579
Miss Jing, did you enter the wrong room again?

17
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,339
No, I did not.

18
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,219
This is the place.

19
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,209
Money, you said? Do you think you're the only one with money?

20
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,049
I have it, too. I return it to you!

21
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,119
You...

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,539
How much did you drink? Why did you come here?

23
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,719
Not much.

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,399
You gave me this.

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,659
I'm giving it back to you.

26
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,910
- Why?
- Didn't our story have an end?

27
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,599
Why are you still pretending not to know me?

28
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,339
There's no one else here.

29
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:43,059
Just tell me. You remember me, right?

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,739
Hey. You better not throw up on me.

31
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:53,839
Or did you get amnesia?

32
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:58,379
This is what happens in TV dramas. You must suffer from amnesia, that's why you forgot me!

33
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,090
I thought of a way

34
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,179
for you to regain your memories.

35
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,270
Well? Do you remember now?

36
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,869
This is how it goes on TV dramas.

37
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:27,701
Do you remember now?

38
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,525
- You don't remember?
- Stop hitting me.

39
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,789
Do you remember?

40
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,710
Help me!

41
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,669
Which obnoxious guy

42
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:50,306
dares to disrupt my beauty sleep?

43
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:52,669
A police guy.

44
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,909
Why am I here?

45
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,858
This gentleman filled a police report. He said you assaulted him.

46
00:04:01,858 --> 00:04:03,539
Do you admit your crime?

47
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:06,939
I'm innocent. Look at me, I'm all weak and pitiful.

48
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,059
How could I have hurt him?

49
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:11,699
He must be feigning innocence.

50
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,139
I'm being framed.

51
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:15,279
He said you hit his head.

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,879
I did not touch him.

53
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,839
Maybe I did, a little. Just a light tap.

54
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,999
We have the proof right here. Are you still going to deny it?

55
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,239
I did pat the back of his head a little. Very lightly.

56
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:39,599
It couldn't have caused this injury.

57
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,839
Officer.

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,399
I hit his head so he could recall his memory.

59
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,280
Office, you heard her. She admitted assaulting me.

60
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,839
Are you better now? Do you recall anything?

61
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,440
I do. I remember you hitting me.

62
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,819
Officer, can I get in touch with my attorney now to sue her for assault?

63
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,259
Are you serious?

64
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,399
Go ahead and sue me if you dare. Do you think only you know the law? Officer...

65
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,699
I want to sue him. He's nothing more than a conman out to scam women!

66
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,019
All right. Let's add slander to the lawsuit.

67
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,979
- I'm going to sue you, too.
- What do you have to sue me?

68
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:23,619
Enough!

69
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,800
This is not the place for you two to have a lovers' quarrel.

70
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,999
- Me and her...
- Officer, me and him...
- There's no need to explain!

71
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,819
You. Come here!

72
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,419
Young people tend to be reckless.

73
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,619
Being a couple means accommodating the other.

74
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,799
If a problem arises, you have to solve it together.

75
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:50,439
There's a wise saying, "Patience is the key to keeping the peace."

76
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,610
A marriage without ups and downs will last longer.

77
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,079
Ordinary means longevity. Stability means resilience.

78
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,860
Okay. I won't sue her. Are you happy now?

79
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,479
That's right. A man has to be lenient.

80
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,360
Listen, a child from a single-parent family usually suffers from mental issues.

81
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,159
You should think for yourself as well as for your child. Am I right?

82
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:12,779
In this regard, you shouldn't choose divorce so casually.

83
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:15,939
Sure, I won't sue her.

84
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,579
But I want her to make a video.

85
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,479
She has to promise to never do it again.

86
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,499
There's no way I'm doing that.

87
00:06:24,499 --> 00:06:26,479
Miss, stand up!

88
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,719
You're in the wrong for hitting him. Domestic violence is genderless.

89
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:38,199
The point is that violence is not the solution, right?

90
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,319
It will only make things worse between you two.

91
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,959
If you don't resolve the problem, it will turn into a snowball that gets out of control.

92
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,959
Am I right? How will you resolve it then? So you must not...

93
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,779
Fine.

94
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,719
I'll do it.

95
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,960
I vow, from today onward, I will not threaten, coerce

96
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,119
or entice Fu Zeyi to do anything against his will.

97
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,459
If I violate it, I will be punished by heaven.

98
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,319
Have you seen enough?

99
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,999
What? Do you want to go back there?

100
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,659
Even if I do go back there, I will not let you off.

101
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:19,459
At most, we'd just suffer through the officer's compassionate teaching again.

102
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:22,199
Did you think you're off the hook because I called off the lawsuit?

103
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,119
Suing you for this type of injury will become a public dispute at most.

104
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,959
But with this video in hand,

105
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,559
it's an irrefutable fact that Aizhe Hotel's boss beat someone up.

106
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,500
How much do you think Aizhe's market value will suffer if this video is made public?

107
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,239
Also...

108
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,425
You faked it.

109
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:46,599
That's right. I did.

110
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,259
So I'm warning you

111
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,679
not to get in my way again.

112
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,599
Fu Zeyi! You toyed with my feelings and threatened me!

113
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,379
You dared to trick me. Beware of nightmares tonight!

114
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,519
It's the first time I came across

115
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:25,239
someone who went to watch the movie just to listen to my music.

116
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,020
Then write a song for me.

117
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,559
I'd like to have a complete song from you.

118
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,739
Director Fu.

119
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:11,399
Miss Jing wants to meet you in the presidential suite.

120
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,739
What for?

121
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,559
I'm not sure.

122
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,879
Hi.

123
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:31,420
The door was left open, so I invited myself in.

124
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,599
What are you doing here?

125
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:35,119
I came to thank you.

126
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,019
Thank me? For what?

127
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,040
No wonder, Aizhe got itself into this situation.

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,579
It's because its general manager can't even speak properly.

129
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,619
Thank you for not pursuing the matter with Aizhe

130
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,620
so I won't get angry no matter what you say today.

131
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,279
What do you mean?

132
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,399
Hello? What is it?

133
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,459
Director Fu, I sent the statement of cancellation of Aizhe's debt to your email. Please check.

134
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,999
Hold on. What statement?

135
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,159
The statement of the cancelation of Aizhe's debt.

136
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,140
- Did I ask you to do it?
- Yes.

137
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,700
[Jing Zhixia: Rest assured, I will clear Aizhe's debts.]

138
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,399
What was it you wanted to ask me?

139
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,799
Why did he suddenly leave?

140
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,339
Did I say something wrong?

141
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,499
A gift.

142
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:50,779
I should've brought a gift to express my gratitude.

143
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,292
Yes.

144
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,519
Why didn't I notice the window was open when I woke up?

145
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:26,301
I'm finally back.

146
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,599
Miss Jing, after all the things we've been through,

147
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,300
I reckon we're something like friends.

148
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,959
Hence, I've decided not to pursue Aizhe for its debt.

149
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:10,962
Long time no see, Zeyi.

150
00:12:10,962 --> 00:12:14,719
Didn't I get rid of Lin? Why is he back?

151
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:35,242
Are you back?

152
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,970
[One year ago]

153
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,155
It was a long time.

154
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,934
What did Lin do with my body?

155
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:23,835
Five days.

156
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,933
You haven't slept in five whole days.

157
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,929
All because of this woman?

158
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,909
Do you know you've wrecked our agreement?

159
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,289
Don't you know the consequences of your actions?

160
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,729
Hello, Old Mo.

161
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,729

Director Fu, this is the statement of cancelation for Aizhe's debt.

I'll be frank with you then.

I said Aizhe could defer its repayments,

but I changed my mind.

Aizhe has to clear its debt within one week.

Otherwise, the Fu Group will take legal action.

00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:39,539
Look, my dad said his earliest dream was to manage a hotel.

327
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,339
His last wish was for his precious daughter, me,

328
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:46,160
to be happy, content, and joyful.

329
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,559
So I sold off a little bit and kept a little bit.

330
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,479
I won't listen to your nonsense.

331
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:54,299
This is a family business. It should be run by the family.

332
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,619
What happens now that you have sold it?

333
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:01,299
Uncle. Come.

334
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,739
Sit down.

335
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,119
It's brand new. Mint condition.

336
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,780
Uncle, this is the new armchair for the boss you had ordered.

337
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,359
It's here?

338
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,679
The leather feels nice.

339
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,579
So what if it's nice? There could be a stranger sitting on it.

340
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:31,099
Uncle, hear me out.

341
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,919
The buyer I found is extremely wealthy.

342
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,520
They invested in the hotel purely out of interest.

343
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,539
They have no intention of managing it.

344
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,139
So Aizhe Hotel will be under your care from now on.

345
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,299
It's under your care.

346
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,139
- Really?
- Of course.

347
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:49,360
I had to ensure that Aizhe remains in the Jing family.

348
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,739
From now on, you'll be the one to play first fiddle in Aizhe.

349
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,719
As for me...

350
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,379
I can leave the country without worry.

351
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,559
I've got to say, young people like you have no sense of responsibility.

352
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,459
Don't you know how old I am? I'm about to retire.

353
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:10,659
Are you dumping the hotel on me?

354
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:12,079
Do you want me to break my back?

355
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,839
Please don't, Uncle. If you retire, the pillar of Aizhe Hotel will collapse.

356
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,779
It won't collapse. I will hold it up for you.

357
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,939
It's not going to fall.

358
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,719
Xiao Xia.

359
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:30,899
If you don't like working at the hotel, you can tell me.

360
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,939
There's no need to go abroad.

361
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,859
Your sister wants to go overseas by herself.

362
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:45,179
Only if I stay far away from him will I be able to forget everything and start over.

363
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,359
Director Fu.

364
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,419
Miss Jing has signed the contract.

365
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:57,840
She agreed to transfer the shares.

366
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,419
As you predicted, she did not question anything.

367
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,759
Good work.

368
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,199
Director Fu.

369
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:13,639
This is the list of Aizhe's shareholders. I've sorted it out.

370
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,899
I heard that Miss Jing resigned from Aizhe.

371
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,079
She's leaving today.

372
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,339
Resigning right after she got the money.

373
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:28,819
She's probably excited to enjoy her freedom somewhere.

374
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,179
Anyway, it's a good thing she resigned.

375
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,679
This means no one will be getting in our way.

376
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:05,319
Who knew I'd work here dutifully for a year?

377

378

♫ regret is the most beautiful ♫

382
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,618
Hello?

383
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:39,678
Fu Zeyi, can we meet?

384
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:42,559
I'm busy. No time.

385
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,639
I'll be at the restaurant.

386
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,859
He hung up on me again.

♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid to be alone  ♫

393

♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

394
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:56,000
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

395
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,860
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

396

♫  If I decide to be brave this time,  ♫

♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫
