You became bolder and even dared to get in your older sister's way.

Sister, you always come and leave work on time every day.

Are you worried that we don't have enough employees to attend to a CEO?

What about Uncle? Your dad is Aizhe Hotel's General Manager.

Isn't he part of the top management?

You know, my dad is only a paper tiger.

Did Uncle teach you to say this?

I didn't teach him that.

We need to receive him with the highest standards.

Or else, he'll cancel his stay if he's not happy.

What is he doing here?

162
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:09,699
We refused him earlier, but he told us that he's the Music Director of this movie.

163
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:12,219
Music Director?

164
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,899
You mean he made

165
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:17,399
all the soundtracks in this movie?

166
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,639
I guess so.

167
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,279
Then it's all right. Let him watch.

168
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,319
Thank you.

169
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,299
Hi.

170
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,739
Hello.

171
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:43,139
Well...

172
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,499
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:47,259
I hope I didn't disturb you.

174
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,459
Not at all.

175
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,279
I wanted to watch the premiere,

176
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,859
but I didn't expect they're still playing this movie.

177
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,039
Yes.

178
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,639
I think we're rather lucky.

179
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,639
Do you like this movie, too?

180
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,059
Yes.

181
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,259
I learned about this movie only

182
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,039
after listening to its soundtracks.

183
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,999
Wh-What's wrong with this movie theater?

184
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,619
Hello?

185
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,899
Why is there suddenly no sound?

186
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,639
Don't be upset. Don't.

187
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,299
It turns out you're playing the song.

188
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,699
Look.

189
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:18,279
The movie is talking about the pianist.

190
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,759
He passed away because of war.

191
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,099
His wife is still waiting for him persistently at home.

192
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,579
He turned into a ghost.

193
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,639
Yet, he has no way to touch his wife.

194
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,699
The only thing he could do

195
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,139
was to use this piano to communicate with his wife.

196
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,919
The piano piece he's playing

197
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,059
is about his last farewell

198
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:48,879
to his wife.

199
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,059
I'm heading this way.

200
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,259
What a coincidence. I'm going that way, too.

201
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:21,099
- Let's have a meal together. Let's go.
- Sure.

202
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,259
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

203
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,919
It's my first time seeing someone adding Dijon mustard to béchamel sauce.

204
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,059
Why are you doing it?

205
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:41,759
My friend taught me this.

206
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,599
He said adding Dijon mustard to béchamel sauce would make the overall taste

207
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:49,139
thicker and more interesting.

208
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,159
Do you want to try it?

209
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,839
Sure.

210
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,899
Thank you.

211
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,099
What do you think?

212
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,719
It's very unique.

213
00:17:05,719 --> 00:17:09,518
And... the taste has become richer.

214
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,779
You like focusing on small details.

215
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:19,178
No wonder, I feel like I could see a lot of movie scenes

216
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:22,799
every time I think of your music.

217
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,359
Your music... carries memories and stories.

218
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,099
It's also my first time meeting someone who watches a movie

219
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,639
just to listen to my music.

220
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:37,459
It was your music that healed me.

221
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,859
- By the way, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

222
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:46,939
- Have you written a song for others?
- As Director?

223
00:17:46,939 --> 00:17:51,279
No, I mean for someone because of feelings.

224
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,099
Never.

225
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,379
Then can you write a song for me?

226
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:04,199
I want a complete song composed by you, not a soundtrack of a movie.

227
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,939
When do you want it?

228
00:18:05,939 --> 00:18:08,219
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

229
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,459
The day after tomorrow is fine too.

230
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,779
I always tend to get the things I want right away. I'm not willing to wait even for a moment.

231
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:19,139
Think about it.

232
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,719
If tomorrow is the end of time,

233
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:26,839
you haven't even settled down in the chair to finish reading a book

234
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,639
or confessed your feelings to someone.

235
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:36,259
Therefore, I live every day as if it were the final day.

236
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:38,739
Like this, I won't have any regrets.

237
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,119
Is this too much?

238
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:46,059
Yes, pretty much.

239
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,839
But I'll do it.

240
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,879
You'll do it?

241
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,139
Because I always take my time when composing.

242
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:59,459
But I like your attitude

243
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,799
because I think human life is fleeting.

244
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:06,279
We're likely

245
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,219
to lose some things forever

246
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:10,739
if we miss them at that particular moment.

247
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,619
Why did the gentle and considerate Lin of a year ago

248
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:20,199
become today's arrogant Fu Zeyi?

249
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:21,907
It wasn't easy for me to move on.

250
00:19:21,908 --> 00:19:24,130
I can't let this scum affect my life.

251
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,120
Just compensate them.

252
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:29,403
I don't want to drag this matter out for a year and a half.

253
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,419
But we don't have that many funds.

254
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,019
Does Aizhe Hotel not even have 50 million yuan?

255
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:37,719
Let me explain.

256
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:41,600
It costs money to run the hotel, to make advance payments,

257
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,279
to pay for workers' wages, and to buy a house...

258
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,819
I even used my own shares to make some investments.

259
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,319
I'll think of ways to raise the money. I don't want to be entangled with him.

260
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,659
You have my support, Sister.

261
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:59,959
Don't be ridiculous. Are we really going to compensate them?

262
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:02,739
We must find ways to solve this problem as a family.

263
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,599
Don't just go down a blind alley. We must not pay them.

264
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,539
Hello? Hello there.

265
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:23,339
I'm Aizhe Hotel's CEO, Jing Zhixia.

266
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,819
I wonder if you have any updates regarding the sale of my shares.

267
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:28,200
Miss Jing, hello there.

268
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,439
When would it be convenient for you to meet us for a detailed discussion?

269
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,119
Send the materials to me first. I'll contact you after I went through them.

270
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,719
Sure. I'll send them to you right away. Please check.

271
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:41,339
All right.

272
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,379
Jian Bufan? What are you doing here?

273
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:55,779
I'm here to see if you need any help.

274
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,459
Sister, are you really going to sell your shares?

275
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:10,239
How did you know?

276
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:13,219
I just heard it.

277
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,579
You could even hear it from there?

278
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,619
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

279
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:22,359
You know how good my hearing is.

280
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:26,382
Well, it's all right. It'll get out anyway.

281
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:29,979
But your dad painstakingly built this hotel.

282
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:34,479
Your mom also wishes that the Jing family holds the management right.

283
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:38,179
I have no choice. It's 50 million yuan.

284
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,899
You don't have to go as far as to sell your shares.

285
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:49,699
Sister, I heard that Fu Zeyi is the scum you've been looking for.

286
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,256
Do you already know?

287
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,297
You reacted very strongly when you tried to catch the cheater.

288
00:21:53,297 --> 00:21:56,298
Even the cleaner Auntie Hao knows about it.

289
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:01,519
Sister, your relationship didn't even last for a week.

290
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,459
You can't let go of it after a year.

291
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,239
Sister?

292
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,960
Sister?

293
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,479
Who said I missed that scum?

294
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:12,119
I'm doing very well. I'm fine.

295
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,059
Enough already. Just go back home. Leave if there's nothing else.

296
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,379
Go now.

297
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:17,879
- Go.
- Wait.

298
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:22,399
- Just go.
- I'm free anytime. You have to tell me if you're okay.

299
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:24,679
I'll leave for real. You must tell me.

300
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,179
- Okay.
- I'll get going now.

301
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,619
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

302
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:45,770
♫  Our first love's ending is not beautiful at all  ♫

303
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,939
She turns on the tap again.

304
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,519
She'd still end up crying.

305
00:22:54,199 --> 00:23:01,950
♫  At the end of our first love, regret is the most beautiful  ♫

306
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,049
♫  It's a story only my heart can appreciate  ♫

307
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:07,799
♫  Memories can be painful yet silent and at ease when I reminisce  ♫

308
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,709
I'll let her be.

309
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:14,719
It's better to cry it out than make a scene after getting drunk.

310
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,849
I talked to Miss Jing.

311
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:21,889
As you expected,

312
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,655
she's not suspicious at all.

313
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,889
Well done.

314
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,569
Director Fu,

315
00:23:33,569 --> 00:23:36,909
this is the shareholder's list you wanted. I sorted it out.

316
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,789
I heard Miss Jing accepted to pay the compensation.

317
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:45,709
She'll leave after the procedure.

318
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,929
It may not be a bad thing that she leaves.

319
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,749
No one can get in the way of our plan that way.

320
00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:56,709
Are you really going to manage the hotel, or are you planning to do what you did one year ago?

321
00:23:56,709 --> 00:24:00,609
You only want the land and turn it into part of the Fu's business.

322
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,550
Kids, raise your hands if you know about Christmas?

323
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,249
- I know!
- I see, everyone knows.

324
00:24:06,249 --> 00:24:08,949
Okay. Christmas is coming,

325
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:12,829
and this tree is our Christmas tree this year.

326
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:16,749
Mr. Fu, thank you for your immense... generosity.

327
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,540
For the past six months, you've been giving the children

328
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,789
new textbooks and clothing.

329
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:24,329
Now, you're funding to provide better meals

330
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,309
and renovate the apartments.

331
00:24:26,309 --> 00:24:28,390
It's the least we could do.

332
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,289
I'm puzzled. Mr. Fu, you're a businessman.

333
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:35,469
Why would you want to buy this orphanage?

334
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,929
Probably because of empathy.

335
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,289
Empathy, huh?

336
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,909
I feel I've been blessed by the world.

337
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,329
So I have the responsibility to return this favor.

338
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:49,789
Interesting. Okay, I have signed the transfer contract.

339
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:51,649
Please review it.

340
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,400
[Fu Zeyi]

341
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,049
Thank you.

342
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,249
Mr. Fu is a nice gentleman, right?

343
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,150
I hope so.

344
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,389
Uncle, do you want a Christmas gift?

345
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,469
What is that?

346
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,889
The contract is effective immediately.

347
00:25:38,889 --> 00:25:40,609
You...

348
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,289
Hey, kid.

349
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:47,049
There's no Santa Claus in the world.

350
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,069
The land is what I wanted.

351
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:31,120
♫  There's not a day that I'm afraid to be alone  ♫

352
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:38,510
♫  I’m afraid of seeing you again after we said our goodbyes  ♫

353
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,469
♫  I'm slowly getting used to missing you  ♫

354
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:53,230
♫  It seems like I've locked my heart away as the memory lingers  ♫

355
00:26:53,230 --> 00:27:01,000
♫  If I decide to be brave this time,  ♫

356
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,490
♫  Then I'll hold your hands till eternity  ♫

357
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,649
♫  The moment we found the emotions we'd lost,  ♫

358
00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:21,780
♫  It will overcome those lonely moments little by little  ♫

359
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,560
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

360
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,360
♫  No matter how many promises we've broken  ♫

361
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,520
♫  There's nothing I'm not willing to do  ♫

362
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,079
♫  Just to have a simple and ordinary life with you  ♫

363
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,550
♫  If you were by my side,  ♫

364
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:51,090
♫  All my regrets will be blown away by the wind  ♫

365
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:57,490
♫  I only want you to be with me every second, every minute  ♫
