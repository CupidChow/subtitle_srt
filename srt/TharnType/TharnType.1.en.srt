2
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,330
As a freshman, my university life has begun.

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,360
Everything is better than I thought.

4
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,720
Even though my dear dad forced me

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,550
to stay in the dorm,

6
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,070
at least I still have my close friends and social life.

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,250
Not to mention

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,070
that my roommate is extremely handsome,

9
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,240
and he has a great personality.

10
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,790
We can definitely help each other find

11
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,500
the perfect girlfriend in our freshman year.

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,200
By the way, did I tell you?

13
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,240
I...

14
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,350
hate gay.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,980
That's why...

16
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,570
Type.

17
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,750
Why are you so loud?

18
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,660
Do you know the news?

19
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,600
About what?

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,810
Your roommate

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,170
is gay.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,910
What did you say?

23
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,950

[TharnType 1]

25
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Type.

26
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,440
Have you been back for a long time?

27
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,660
Have you eaten?

28
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,500
Here's some snacks.

29
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,510
Tharn.

30
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,320
What's wrong?

31
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,230
I want to ask you something.

32
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,430
What is it?

33
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,690
Why do you look so serious?

34
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,279
Are you gay?

35
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,740
Why?

36
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:35,740
Yes.

37
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,900
I have to be frank, then.

38
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,710
I hate gay.

39
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,659
Then what do you want me to do?

40
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,390
One of us must move out.

41
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,800
Are you this annoyed by the fact that I'm a gay?

42
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,030
Yes, I hate it.

43
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,380
I'm gay, but I never did anything to you.

44
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,180
Although you've never done anything to me,

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,230
I still don't want to stay in a room with a gay

46
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,420
like you.

47
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,110
You move out, then.

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,300
You're the problem, not me.

49
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,670
Tharn, I'll say it again.

50
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,260
I hate gay, I hate them to death.

51
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,620
If I knew you were gay from the start,

52
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,150
I wouldn't have gotten close to you.

53
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,790
You pervert.

54
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,440
That's your business.

55
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,730
Because I will never move out.

56
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,040
Even if I have to stay with a narrow-minded person.

57
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,090
You have to move.

58
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,960
I don't know what kind of jerk you've met.

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,230
But even if you can kick me out,

60
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,320
you won't be able to survive in society

61
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,940
if you still judge others with such stupid logic.

62
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,580
Remember.

63
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,040
What are you doing?

64
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,090
Congratulations.

65
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,650
Because you have to stay with me

66
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,670
for another year.

67
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:37,130
Sure.

68
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,550
I want to change my dorm.

69
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,580
No.

70
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,510
There are a lot of freshmen this year.

71
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,310
Do you know how lucky you are to have a room?

72
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,450
Many senior students moved out

73
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,260
because freshmen are given priority.

74
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,130
I'm going to change no matter what.

75
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,430
No one wants to change rooms, aunt?

76
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,980
If there is, they'll change the rooms on their own.

77
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,220
No one would make a scene here.

78
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,140
But isn't this the Student Dormitory Service Center?

79
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,430
You can change it if there's really a problem.

80
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,830
I have a problem with my roommate.

81
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,510
What's the problem?

82
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,680
It must be very serious.

83
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,190
Otherwise, we can't change it.

84
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,990
My roommate...

85
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,680
Forget it, aunt.

86
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,690
But I can't stand it.

87
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,450
Call me aunt again and I won't help you.

88
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm sorry, sister.

89
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,940
If there's no reason, we can't change it.

90
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,620
I won't accept reasons like not helping

91
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,050
with the cleaning.

92
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,860
Living under the same roof, you two are responsible for talking it out.

93
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,280
What should I do?

94
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,700
The easiest way is to find someone who also wants to change room

95
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,800
and come here to report. I'll take care of it.

96
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,610
Okay, aunt.

97
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,570
Hey, you kid!

98
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,120
Hello, No.

99
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,660
Are you free tonight?

100
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,660
You have to be free.

101
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,280
Because you have to help me.

102
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,300
Type.

103
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,020
Are you serious about changing your dorm?

104
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,770
I said I want to change.

105
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,710
Type, let's be honest.

106
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,340
Who would like to switch rooms with you now?

107
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,020
We're all familiar with our roommates now.

108
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,630
I don't know.

109
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,940
But I need to find it.

110
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,120
Why are you so stubborn?

111
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,430
-Hello, senior. My friend...
-I want to change my room.

112
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,800
No.

113
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,180
He didn't say anything.

114
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,330
No.

115
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,000
What's wrong?

116
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,700
I want to change my room.

117
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,420
Okay, let's go.

118
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,100
If you change it tonight, I'll be doomed too.

119
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,080
It's killing me.

120
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,860
Let's find another room.

121
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,700
There's someone else.

122
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,380
Can we change rooms with you?

123
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,260
With whom?

124
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,370
With my friend here.

125
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,210
No.

126
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:02,340
Look at that long face, who would want to change with you?

127
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,370
Wait, don't worry.

128
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,800
Over there.

129
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,160
That's the last room on this floor.

130
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,430
And it's next to your room.

131
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,760
Do you want it?

132
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,390
Okay.

133
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,690
What's wrong with you?

134
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,310
What's going on?

135
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,770
Brother Khlui, Type wants...

136
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,460
Wait.

137
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,750
Seo Duang, be quiet.

138
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,430
Okay.

139
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,360
Brother Khlui.

140
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,370
Can we switch rooms?

141
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,650
What's wrong with you?

142
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,720
Come on.

143
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,280
Let's switch rooms, okay?

144
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,300
No.

145
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,210
My roommate is good.

146
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:34,950
Hello?

147
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,160
I guess.

148
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,230
Okay, brother.

149
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,660
Brother Khlui, is your roommate Korean?

150
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,230
I'm not sure.

151
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,810
I don't know if he's Korean or he's just crazy.

152
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,270
Okay.

153
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,590
I'll get going.

154
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,010
What's with that? Just for not changing rooms?

155
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,160
Why is he looking at me like that?

156
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,750
What?

157
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,620
Why are you going out?

158
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,220
Can you stop speaking Korean?

159
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,490
I don't understand.

160
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,550
You have to change your room.

161
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,080
I don't want to stay in the same room with you.

162
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,030
Get up and talk to me.

163
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,620
You have to change your room.

164
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,180
I won't.

165
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,700
Type.

166
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,310
I won't live in the same room with a gay.

167
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,910
Is that clear enough, jerk?

168
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,590
You have no right to kick me out.

169
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,660
Because I didn't do anything to you.

170
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,930
Not now, but what about the future?

171
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,130
I don't trust people like you.

172
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,570
People like you never turn anyone down.

173
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,190
You hate me, don't you?

174
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,260
Then will you be my wife?

175
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,580
No.

176
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,180
Goodness.

177
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,860
You're a grown-up. How can you fall off your bed while sleeping?

178
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,190
Stupid.

179
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,430
Are you scolding me?

180
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,400
See you tonight, roommate.

181
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,140
What? Who's your roommate?

182
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,530
I said I want to change my room.

183
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,890
Last class, we talked about Baroque and Classicism.

184
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,350
Let's talk about Romanticism today.

185
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:19,610
Does anyone know the characteristics of Romanticism?

186
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,930
Yes, the characteristics of Romanticism.

187
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,140
-We can tell the characteristics of each composer.
-Where are we?

188
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,700
In terms of imagination, emotions, music, and so on.

189
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,140
To freely express

190
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,900
and to pay more attention to emotional expression, not boundaries.

191
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,230
What's wrong?

192
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,210
Nothing.

193
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,730
Your face tells a different story.

194
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,190
Yes, something happened.

195
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,970
Did you meet your ex this morning?

196
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,910
No.

197
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,950
Did anyone fight over you?

198
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,210
No.

199
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:09,050
You'll get scolded by the professor, note it down quickly.

200
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,290
Someone wants to date you.

201
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,220
But he's a muscular guy.

202
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,340
He said,

203
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,800
"Why don't you make out with me, brother Tharn?"

204
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,050
Right?

205
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,280
Is it fun?

206
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,560
You've been making fun of me.

207
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:34,910
I rarely see you with a long face like this.

208
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,400
Tell me if you need anything.

209
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,180
I can help you.

210
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,550
Nothing.

211
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,260
Well, if you said so.

212
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,090
About the new band,

213
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,110
I'm interested in the guitarist.

214
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,650
He's good.

215
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,500
Tharn.

216
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,860
What did you just say?

217
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,370
I said I'm interested in the guitarist.

218
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,220
He plays well.

219
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,990
Here I come.

220
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,850
Judging by your face, it's not working, right?

221
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,540
Yes.

222
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,340
He just refuses to move.

223
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,270
Seriously, Type.

224
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,910
Who would want to move?

225
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,589
He did nothing wrong.

226
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,700
He just doesn't like girls.

227
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,980
He's not a psychopath.

228
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,569
He didn't kill or threaten anyone.

229
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,050
All he does is mind his own business.

230
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,930
Why should he move out, seriously?

231
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,480
Because he's gay.

232
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,640
Okay, he's gay.

233
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,760
But he doesn't have a thing for you.

234
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,350
Or...

235
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,850
Don't say crap, No.

236
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,070
If you say that,

237
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,870
I'll kick your mouth with my foot.

238
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,790
You almost hit my face.

239
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,820
Just kidding.

240
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,620
What are you going to do, then?

241
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:51,060
What kind of roommate disgusts you the most?

242
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,970
Don't tell me you want to...

243
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,820
Yes.

244
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,100
You're truly something.

245
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,280
Okay, I'll help you.

246
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,150
I'm your friend after all.

247
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,070
The first step.

248
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,710
-No respect...
-Wait.

249
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,390
Oh.

250
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:16,980
Here.

251
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,000
Someone who doesn't respect others' privacy.

252
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,570
That's a big no.

253
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,940
For example, when you go back to your dorm after training,

254
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,630
and you are going to sleep,

255
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,530
then the roommate walks in and turns on the lights.

256
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,720
He brings his friends in and plays the music loudly.

257
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,780
How rude.

258
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,490
That's right.

259
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,540
Next,

260
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:33,770
be lazy.

261
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,500
For example, roommates that don't wash dishes after dinner,

262
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,750
and just leave them in the sink.

263
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,220
And you have to wash the dishes.

264
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,270
Seriously, are you his servant?

265
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,290
Give me more.

266
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,350
Just use this method.

267
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,100
Do you remember our first year in high school?

268
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,620
I know what I should do now.

269
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,630
How?

270
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,080
Hey?

271
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,960
Where is my answer?

272
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,720
What's wrong with him?

273
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,320
Darn it.

274
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,820
I shouldn't have told him that Tharn is gay.

275
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,840
He was so close to his roommate before.

276
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,630
[Three weeks ago]

277
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,900
Hello my roommate, I'm Tharn.

278
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,190
Hello, I'm Type.

279
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,630
Is my bed this way?

280
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,600
Yes.

281
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,700
By the way, you can have the desserts.

282
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,960
You're a good person.

283
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,570
Someone bought it for me, and I can't finish it.

284
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,990
What a charming guy.

285
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,370
No one cares about me.

286
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,700
If no one cares about you,

287
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,260
there's no hope for someone like me.

288
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,110
If you need my help,

289
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,740
just let me know.

290
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,310
We're going to live together for a year anyway.

291
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,010
Okay, I won't be shy, then.

292
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,600
Okay.

293
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,710
[Three weeks later]

294
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,050
The war has begun, Tharn.

295
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,130
[Get out, gay!]

296
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,470
What's going on?

297
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,790
I didn't want to get involved with you.

298
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,780
But you want to play it like this?

299
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,580
Sure.

300
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,860
Type, are you sure you want to use this method

301
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,250
to force him out of your room?

302
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,570
That's your idea, No.

303
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,700
You don't have to do what I said.

304
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,430
Are you going to mess up his stuff?

305
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,630
Yes, if he's done replacing it tomorrow,

306
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,970
I'll mess it up again.

307
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,820
Let's see how long he can endure.

308
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,850
I think it'll take a long time.

309
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,410
Hey, wait.

310
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,520
Type, calm down.

311
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,960
I surrender.

312
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,240
Just kidding.

313
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,140
You're annoying.

314
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,210
I was just kidding.

315
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,360
Just kidding, my friend.

316
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,870
[I'm not moving, you narrow-minded man.]

317
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,480
What's going on?

318
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,770
What is this?

319
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,540
I've been looking for it.

320
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,450
I thought I had lost it.

321
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,840
This is a lubricant, you jerk.

322
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:04,880
Yes.

323
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,550
I didn't say it was the dishwasher.

324
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,920
Tharn, you're a bastard!

325
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,810
Uh-oh, there's not much left.

326
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,710
It's okay.

327
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,190
A pervert like me has a lot of it.

328
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,510
I'll give this one to you.

329
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:25,360
Take it as a welcome gift from your roommate.

330
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,440
I don't want it.

331
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,130
If others give you something, you take it.

332
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,400
About how you're going to use it,

333
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,160
it's your own business.

334

Neither am I.

338
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,680
Didn't your parents teach you

339
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,230
not to touch others' stuff without permission?

340
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,110
So that's why you messed up my stuff instead?

341

If you're going to be like this, fine, a tooth for a tooth.

00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,340
I'll definitely get you out of this room.

343
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,910
You must hate me so much, Type.

344
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,760
Sure.

345
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,810
Wait.

346
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:47,940
What's wrong?

347
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,880
What are you thinking alone?

348
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,800
About what?

349
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,500
Have you made up your mind?

350
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,090
You want to invite Team and Aom to your room for a drink?

351
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,090
I don't care.

352
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,860
Furthermore, they're already waiting in the room.

353
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,300
Do you want me to kick them out?

354
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,810
That's so unkind of you.

355
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,500
Why are you scolding me?

356
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,920
I'm just reminding you.

357
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,090
If Tharn finds out, he would be very angry with you.

358
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,770
The angrier, the better.

359
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,130
What a disgrace.

360
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,170
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

361
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,100
You look so proud.

362
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,070
Type, is it your roommate?

363
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,450
You're back.

364
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,210
My friends are here.

365
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,580
It'll be a bit loud.

366
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,990
Since your roommate is back,

367
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,470
let's go back.

368
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,480
Let's go, guys.

369
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,210
Where are you going in a hurry?

370
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,810
It's not even 8 o'clock.

371
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:05,180
My roommate didn't say anything.

372
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,270
Right?

373
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,490
Yes.

374
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,740
I have no objection.

375
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,330
The room is lit up with you here.

376
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,830
I want to join you.

377
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,220
-No.
-Okay.

378
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,640
Suit yourself.

379
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,580
Team, makes a toast for his roommate.

380
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,420
Okay.

381
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,540
Oh, my name is Aom.

382
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,810
I'm Type's friend, we've known each other since high school.

383
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,580
As for me,

384
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,870
Team.

385
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,270
My name is Techno.

386
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,600
What about you?

387
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,950
I'm Tharn.

388
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,130
What are you doing in my bed?

389
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,700
It's your bed?

390
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,100
Didn't you say it was your bed, Type?

391
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,530
How dare you lie to me?

392
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,220
I'm sorry.

393
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,780
I thought it was Type's bed.

394
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,510
Don't be angry.

395
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,510
I'm not mad at you.

396
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,900
It's nothing.

397
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,410
You're a good person, just like what Type said.

398
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,970
Type praised me?

399
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,060
I didn't.

400
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,930
Stop it, Type.

401
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,810
You were praising him just now.

402
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,910
What did he say, Team?

403
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,230
He said you are a good person.

404
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,740
You're open-minded.

405
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,690
Enough.

406
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,930
No matter how messy the room gets,

407
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,480
you'll still be a good roommate.

408
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,780
I didn't know you admired me so much.

409
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,330
I'll go buy some snacks.

410
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,850
Hey?

411
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,740
Hey!

412
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,890
I'm thirsty.

413
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,160
I'll help him carry the stuff.

414
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,080
Come back soon.

415
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,270
I'm going crazy.

416
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,250
What's wrong?

417
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,610
I'm nervous. I'm super nervous now.

418
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,400
Gosh.

419
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,300
I thought I was in World War II.

420
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,340
I'm going crazy.

421
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:13,910
Aunt.

422
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:15,870
You know what?

423
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,620
My room next door is so loud.

424
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,090
They fight every day.

425
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,340
I don't know about that.

426
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,870
But when can you stop calling me "aunt"?

427
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,820
Oh, aunt.

428
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,380
I'm just worried about them.

429
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,170
Also, I want to know

430
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,830
what they're fighting about.

431
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,560
Mind your own business.

432
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,370
Aww, I want to know.

433
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,090
Hey, what are you doing here?

434
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,800
Do you want to go back with me?

435
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,710
Hello.

436
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,750
Hello.

437
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,930
Seo Duang, can you speak Thai?

438
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,030
I don't understand.

439
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,650
What are you doing here?

440
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,410
Do you want to go upstairs with me?

441
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,600
No, you go first.

442
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,420
I'm not done talking with Aunt yet.

443
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,900
Stop calling me "aunt".

444
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,200
I'll get going, aunt.

445
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,970
You punk.

446
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,080
I love you.

447
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,570
I really want to know, aunt.

448
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,390
Did they fight again?

449
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,870
Did they fight?

450
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,310
You're so nosy.

451
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,700
Type, we need to talk.

452
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,200
You're still wet behind the ears.

453
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:47,070
What do you think you can do to me

454
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,760
with your childish ways?

455
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,130
If you weren't bothered,

456
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,430
you wouldn't have come out to provoke me.

457
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,890
Do you think that I'll move out just because

458
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,730
your friends are here?

459
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,290
I think it's very effective.

460
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,380
I should tell them

461
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,870
that you're gay.

462
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,840
Let's look at their reactions,

463
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,600
and see how they will feel about it.

464
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:13,780
Sure.

465
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,160
I'd like to see your friends' reactions too.

466
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,980
What will your friends look like

467
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,340
if they find out we've been living together for months?

468
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,290
I'm not gay.

469
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,130
I'm not like you,

470
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,440
and we'll never be the same.

471
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,170
Don't forget

472
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,340
that you live with a gay.

473
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,190
And...

474
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,660
Bastard!

475
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,890
If you come so close to me,

476
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,180
you might get infected.

477
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,600
If you do it again,

478
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,800
I'll kick you to death.

479
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,220
You said I was for all comers, didn't you?

480
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:05,040
What's wrong for me to make out with you, then?

481
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,380
Tharn, you bastard!

482
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,250
Stop! What's wrong?

483
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,890
It's nothing, aunt.

484
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,180
I'm just saying hello.

485
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,510
Say hello to friends.

486
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,180
So why did they fight?

487
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,930
Ah, Korean ghost!

488
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,590
What Korean ghost!

489
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,720
I'm Thai.

490
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,430
You scared me.

491
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,680
When did you come?

492
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,750
Just now.

493
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,250
Oh, they're gone.

494
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,050
I came to find you

495
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,140
because you didn't come back.

496
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,470
Let's go back. It's late.

497
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,190
Let's talk to the aunt tomorrow.

498
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,830
Let's go.

499
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,969
Amazing.

500
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,500
This is definitely your type, Type.

501
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,980
No wonder you like white women.

502
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,429
Gosh.

503
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,489
Type, your roommate is back.

504
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,239
Should we get his permission first?

505
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,210
Why should we?

506
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,260
I've opened it. Just watch.

507
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,600
My roommate is a good person.

508
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,100
He won't move out no matter what I did.

509
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,000
When did you become like this?

510
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,989
Let me tell you.

511
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,120
We should understand each other when we live together.

512
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:54,659
Is that what a dog lying on someone's bed should say?

513
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,400
But I think

514
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,770
this is not good enough.

515
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,140
Are you going to watch it with us, Tharn?

516
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,970
It's a waste of time to invite him.

517
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,090
He's not interested.

518
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,530
Who says I'm not interested?

519
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,140
Because you're...

520
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm what?

521
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,370
Play it. Why are you sitting there?

522
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,750
Hold on. I'll play the full screen.

523
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,430
You keep ordering me.

524
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,470
Hell.

525
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,420
Type.

526
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,700
I told you it's not good enough.

527
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,090
Boring. What is this?

528
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,080
Do you want to see mine?

529
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:43,850
No.

530
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,440
We're interested.

531
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,480
Just thinking about it makes me sick.

532
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,020
Why?

533
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,850
Why are you disgusted about it?

534
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,370
Tharn.

535
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:55,920
What's wrong?

536
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,900
Do you like to abuse people?

537
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,710
Darn it.

538
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,760
A handsome guy like you...

539
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,750
Let's give it a try. You won't be able to stop after this.

540
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,440
I'll open it for you.

541
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,790
Are you a bisexual?

542
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,540
No, I don't like women.

543
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,510
This video is a deception to make people think

544
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,620
that you're normal.

545
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,640
To be honest,

546
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,740
I don't care about this video.

547
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,630
But I care more about the person who watches it.

548
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,130
What are you talking about?

549
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,170
Just don't cause any trouble and stop trying my patience.

550
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,180
Bastard!

551
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,780
You two.

552
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:00,810
Just drink if you have nothing to say.

553
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,920
You're talking so loud. I'm enjoying it.

554
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,330
Team, Team.

555
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,240
It's the crucial moment.

556
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,270
How is it? The big chest.

557
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,390
Here you are.

558
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,370
Thank you.

559
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,090
See you. Bye.

560
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,520
No.

561
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:22,910
Follow us.

562
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,080
Be careful.

563
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:25,960
Okay.

564
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,920
Type, wake up.

565
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,590
Do you know whose bed you're sleeping in?

566
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,930
Hurry up. Wake up.

567
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,290
I want to sleep.

568
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,750
Type.

569
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,220
You know where you are.

570
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,570
Darn it, you're drunk again.

571
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,060
I wouldn't be surprised if something happened to you.

572
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,090
Hey.

573
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,200
Type, wake up.

574
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:02,560
Get up.

575
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,290
Did he tell you?

576
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,970
Type, wake up.

577
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,670
You have to wake up, friend.

578
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,200
Type.

579
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,640
You know, right?

580
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,920
What do I know?

581
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,420
I know nothing.

582
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,310
Are you talking about us having a drink here?

583
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,710
About the fact that I'm gay.

584
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:33,180
Now you know.

585
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,360
What did Type tell you?

586
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,650
He told me a little.

587
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,400
He never liked gay.

588
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,430
But I don't know why.

589
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,590
Since I knew him,

590
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,260
he told me

591
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,580
that he didn't like gay.

592
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,770
When I was studying with him,

593
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:10,840
there were people who mocked him.

594
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,640
They asked if he had been assaulted by a gay before.

595
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,070
Do you know what happened?

596
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,150
He chased his friends around the classroom and kicked them.

597
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,710
I was laughing at that time.

598
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,450
I'm not against gay.

599
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,980
I have many friends like that.

600
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,930
Some are sissies, and some are transsexuals.

601
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,840
But there's no one

602
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,180
like you.

603
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,680
Tharn.

604
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,910
I apologize on behalf of Type.

605
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:47,990
Okay?

606
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,300
He's not a bad guy.

607
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,990
You understand him, right?

608
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,790
Tharn.

609
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,300
Can I ask you for a favor?

610
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,380
What is it?

611
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,230
Can you move out,

612
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,780
please?

613
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,070
For my sake.

614
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,450
I've been so anxious lately that my hair is turning white.

615
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:25,900
Okay?

616
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,660
No.

617
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,680
I didn't do anything wrong.

618
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,800
Why should I move out?

619
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,660
So you don't have to put up with him.

620
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,440
I don't know

621
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,260
why your friend is prejudiced.

622
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,180
But if I move,

623
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,470
it means I accept the prejudice

624
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,000
that I'm wrong for not liking women.

625
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,970
I don't think I'm wrong.

626
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,290
So I won't move.

627
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,220
Okay, whatever.

628
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,700
Go on if you want to continue enduring Type's unreasonable act.

629
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,990
I just found out

630
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,960
that smart people like Type

631
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:38,070
would start psychological warfare against you.

632
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,290
Get up, Type.

633
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,990
He's heavy.

634
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,960
Help me

635
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,230
so that I can get him out of your bed.

636
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,920
Just let him sleep here.

637
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,360
Why?

638
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:59,020
I want to teach your friend a lesson.

639
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,480
Don't tell me...

640
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,020
Don't worry.

641
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,620
I won't do anything to a drunk person.

642
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:12,280
Are you sure?

643
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,080
Yes, go back.

644
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:17,050
It's almost 11 p.m.

645
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,080
Gosh, what should I do?

646
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,840
The housekeeper downstairs is fierce.

647
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,030
Okay, I'm leaving.

648
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,350
But

649
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,870
you really won't do anything to him, right?

650
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:40,370
Go easy on him.

651
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,210
We have class tomorrow.

652
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,670
The marks take time to fade.

653
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,830
Why do you suit my taste so much?

654
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,980
You hate me a lot, don't you?

655
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,250
You started it first.

656
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:20,030
Do you know

657
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,880
that you're

658
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:27,270
just like a child?

659
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:35,920
When you wake up, you're still wet behind the ears.

660
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,520
I'm curious to know

661
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,290
how crazy you would be if you found out

662
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,560
that you had slept with me all night.

663
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,280
Good night.

664
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,250
Roommate.

665
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,680
I'm afraid that you're hungry. I can lick the bed.

666
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,010
Don't insult my dad.

667
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,860
Who took care of me when I had a fever?

668
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,590
You don't want it to be me, do you?
