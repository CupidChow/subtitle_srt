2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,470
Type, get up.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,540
You slept on my arm all night.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,860
My arm is numb.

Type.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,300
Don't pinch my shoulder. It hurts.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,250
How long are you going to be shocked?

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,790
You got into my bed yourself last night.

9
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,900
You, me, on the bed...

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,420
And you're naked.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,620
Last night, you and I...

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,710
It is impossible.

13
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:48,970
Tharn, the son of a bitch!

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,500
You are a jerk. You are not human.

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,320
What happened?

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,380
What's wrong with you?

17
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,880
Do you want me to tell them?

18
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,370
Last night, you and I...

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:01,930
No.

20
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,210
Type?

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,270
Type.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
You're such a coward.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,530
Hey, are you going to cry?

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,340
No.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,050
Why was I in your bed?

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,850
You got into my bed yourself last night.

27
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
That is impossible.

28
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,810
Are you going to say that

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,280
I worked hard to drag you into my bed?

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,039
I was drunk last night.

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
You were drunk last night. If you got into your bed,

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,820
why would I drag you to my bed?

33
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,380
I could have sex with you on your bed.

34
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,610
Have you already had sex with me?

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,289
How do you feel?

36
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,700
That's my answer.

37
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,800
Darn it.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,320
My butt hurts.

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,280
But I feel like I fell off the bed.

40
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,640
I escaped.

41
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,270
Tharn, you lied to me.

42
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,350
I want revenge.

43
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,010
It was bitten by a mosquito.

44
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,440
It's not any other mark.

45
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,790
I'm going to kill you, bastard Tharn!

46
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,700
[TharnType]

47

[TharnType]

48
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,990
Everyone.

49
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,180
Don't forget to choose me when you're in your senior year.

50
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,960
What to choose?

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,890
Captain.

52
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,839
Are you sure?

53
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,570
No.

54
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,500
Type.

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,390
He's my friend.

56
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,120
Calm down first.

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,910
Calm down first.

58
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,430
Please.

59
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,130
Calm down first.

60
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,770
Calm down first.

61
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,660
Wait, calm down first.

62
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,750
Stop! Stop!

63
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,420
Stop! Stop!

64
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,560
Calm down.

65
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,790
I can't calm down.

66
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,050
It was all because of you.

67
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,780
You left me behind last night.

68
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,710
Do you know what happened to me?

69
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,830
Last night, you and him...

70
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,220
Wait, wait, wait.

71
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,810
Don't move.

72
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,350
I can say that I have nothing to do with this.

73
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,180
You got into his bed yourself.

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,080
What did you say, No?

75
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,710
I'm leaving.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,620
Won't you help me?

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,510
Did I get into his bed myself?

78
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,670
Yes, you did.

79
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,070
I helped to pull you down.

80
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,850
You just lay there with one posture.

81
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,420
Let me say it in advance. I didn't do anything wrong.

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,710
Besides,

83
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,660
your dormitory was about to close.

84
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,350
If I spent the night there,

85
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,400
my mom would scold me to death.

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,210
Stop!

87
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,650
It was all your fault.

88
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,240
Why did you get drunk?

89
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,510
You know who you live with.

90
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,010
My head hurts.

91
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:24,650
In other words,

92
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:26,590
I went through a hellish event this morning

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,810
because you left me behind.

94
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,020
I didn't leave you behind.

95
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,409
So have you had sex?

96
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:33,070
Not yet.

97
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,440
How did you escape it?

98
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,620
I don't care if he has escaped.

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,730
I've escaped anyway.

100
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,030
Yeah.

101
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,850
That means...

102
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,680
Tharn is a gentleman too.

103
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,890
What gentleman?

104
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,240
Calm down and listen to me.

105
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,710
Okay?

106
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,240
Last night, I told Tharn

107
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:51,820
not to do anything to you.

108
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,420
He said that

109
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,530
he wouldn't do anything to a drunk person.

110
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,570
That's why...

111
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
That's why I called him a gentleman.

112
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,150
That jerk.

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,000
Then why are you angry again?

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,060
That meant he was confident.

115
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,930
People who have sex with him

116
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,040
are willing to have sex with him.

117
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,520
If something really happened last night,

118
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,360
it would mean that I did it willingly.

119
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,370
That's impossible.

120
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,610
Alright, forget it.

121
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,890
It has passed.

122
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,170
Actually, I have good news for you today.

123
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,590
What is it?

124
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,910
Since I met Tharn,

125
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,200
nothing good will happen to me.

126
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,890
It's really good news.

127
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,370
I have found someone to switch rooms with you.

128
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,800
Who is it?

129
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,100
Champ.

130
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,340
This way. Come here.

131
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,880
What's wrong, No?

132
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,480
This is the one who wants to change rooms with you.

133
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,020
Only Champ

134
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,060
agreed to change rooms with you.

135
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,610
Yes, I am looking for someone to change rooms.

136
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,380
It's not because my roommate is not good.

137
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,690
But he studies medicine

138
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,060
and studies all night.

139
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,909
I can't sleep.

140
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,330
That's why I want to change rooms.

141
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,260
You can discuss it yourselves

142
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,690
and then go to the dorm to go through formalities.

143
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,410
I won't change rooms.

144
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,330
Thank you for being willing to change rooms with me.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,010
But my roommate and I have some things to deal with.

146
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,620
Sorry for wasting your time.

147
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,310
It's okay.

148
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,760
Let me know if you want to change rooms.

149
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,630
Okay.

150
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,060
I am leaving.

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,590
Where are you going?

152
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,380
I'm going to get changed. I'll train later.

153
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,880
Okay.

154
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,700
What were you doing?

155
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,070
I helped you out of kindness.

156
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,350
If I move out,

157
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,870
it will mean that I lose to him.

158
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,090
He should move, not me.

159
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,470
Hey.

160
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,430
But your hatred

161
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,280
needs to be wagered on your butt.

162
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,990
How is Techno now?

163
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,330
No? He’s fine.

164
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,220
Recently, he has been practicing football hard.

165
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,430
Yeah.

166
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,720
He wants to be the captain.

167
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,040
It's so cool to be a captain.

168
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,590
Hey, let me tie my shoelaces.

169
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,580
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,850
What was going on?

171
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,050
What was wrong with him?

172
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,980
He didn't watch where he was going.

173
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:13,980
Yes.

174
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,400
Is someone picking him up again?

175
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,710
Who are you talking about?

176
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,550
The French student who bumped into you.

177
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,610
Someone always comes to pick him up.

178
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,220
But he suspended his schooling without losing his status last year.

179
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,770
Why did he suspend his schooling?

180
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,030
Forget it. I don't care.

181
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,530
I only care about Techno.

182
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,340
You bastard!

183
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,480
What else do you care about besides my brother's butt?

184
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,300
If you have a picture,

185
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,280
send it to me.

186
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,330
Tell me whatever you want.

187
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,970
You know me well.

188
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,230
Okay.

189
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,320
I'll go back to my room first, Brother Tum.

190
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
Okay.

191
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,510
Hello, Mom.

192
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,820
I can take care of my brother.

193
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,610
Don't worry.

194
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,250
Let me see.

195
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,290
My goodness.

196
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,220
Try it. I want to know if it tastes good.

197
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,180
It looks as good as ever.

198
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,500
But I don't know if it's equally delicious.

199
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,970
How is it?

200
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,480
Well...

201
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,250
Is it not good?

202
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,930
But I made it the same way as last time.

203
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,240
Did I put too much sauce?

204
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,450
I was just kidding.

Why are you sitting here in a daze, Tharn?

209
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,130
No.

210
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,300
I was just thinking about

211
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,070
what to eat.

212
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,290
Just eat whatever you want.

213
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,440
Don't act like you have the whole world on your back.

214
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,030
Huh?

215
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,940
Did one of your exes

216
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,950
come back to you and beg you to get reconciled?

217
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,460
No.

218
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,300
I'm a little anxious about building a new band.

219
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,570
It is okay.

220
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,250
We still have a lot of time to find someone to join the band.

221
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,520
We still need a bassist and a guitarist.

222
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,480
Yes.

223
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,920
By the way,

224
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,750
I just thought of it.

225
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,470
I saw this video,

226

Song?

229
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,030
He is the Song who likes to call you idol.

230

Oh.

231
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,390
It's him.

232
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,340
I think his skills are good.

233
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,660
I'm going to ask him to come and try.

I'll tell you when the time is set.

Okay.

It's just some cheap snacks.

You didn't eat when I asked you to eat.

00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,310
Help me!

347
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:02,070
Help me!

348
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,140
Let's have fun, kid.

349
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,810
What's wrong, Type?

350
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,220
Let go of me!

351
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,810
Let go of me!

352
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,360
What's wrong with you?

353
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,380
Help me!

354
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,840
-Wake up!
-Help me.

355
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,420
Wake up!

356
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,380
Wake up, Type!

357
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,210
Help me!

358
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,460
Wake up, Type!

359
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,970
Help me, Tharn!

360
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,040
Wake up, Type!

361
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,980
Tharn, save me!

362
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,660
Wake up!

363
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,690
Wake up!

364
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,570
Help me!

365
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,150
It's okay, Type.

366
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,460
It's okay.

367
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,930
It's okay, Type.

368
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,900
I'm here, Type.

369
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,430
I'm right here.

370
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,190
It's okay.

371
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,520
Leave me alone.

372
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,080
What's wrong with you, Type?

373
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,290
I kindly woke you up.

374
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,640
Who asked you to wake me up?

375
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,600
You didn't.

376
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,900
But I'm kind.

377
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,720
I am kind to someone who is a grown-up but is still afraid of nightmares.

378
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,470
I am not afraid of having nightmares.

379
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,680
Leave me alone if you don't know anything.

380
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,310
What are you afraid of?

381
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,570
I'm not afraid of anything.

382
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,510
How could someone like me be scared?

383
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:49,650
You cried and shivered.

384
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,250
Were you not afraid of anything?

385
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,190
Stop acting tough.

386
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,950
It's my business to act tough.

387
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,050
But let me tell you.

388
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,360
Even if I cry my heart out,

389
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,780
I will never ask for your help.

390
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,830
Remember it.

391
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,050
Then I apologize to you.

392
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,790
It was me meddling.

393
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,250
I didn't ask for your help.

394
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,790
Type.

395
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,990
Wake up. It's eight o'clock.

396
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,710
Well...

397
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,140
Get up if you are awake.

398
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,250
I didn't wake you up because I had feelings for you.

399
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,420
I was just doing a good deed.

400
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,500
OK...

401
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,570
Get up. It's eight o'clock.

402
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,990
Shut up. Leave me alone.

403
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,030
Fine.

404
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,830
Go back to sleep.

405
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,360
What?

406
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,960
My head hurts so much.

407
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,200
No.

408
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,980
Type, where are you?

409
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,620
I'm going to school this morning.

410
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,570
Let's have breakfast together.

411
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,660
No.

412
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,770
You sound weird. Did you just wake up?

413
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,120
Get up. Time for class.

414
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,340
Don't tell me that you want to skip classes.

415
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,100
I have a headache.

416
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,780
Are you sick?

417
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,120
Do you need me to go up and see you?

418
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,430
No.

419
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,810
I'll be fine later.

420
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,280
Bye.

421
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,520
Gosh.

422
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh no. What should I do?

423
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,760
Tharn, Tharn, Tharn!

424
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,170
Tharn, Tharn.

425
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,400
Come here first.

426
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,650
What's going on? Are you irritable early in the morning?

427
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,840
What's up?

428
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,030
I'm rushing to class.

429
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,530
I want to ask if Type is seriously ill.

430
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,930
Don't you know he's sick?

431
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,560
How did you know he was sick?

432
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,520
I called him this morning

433
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,050
to ask him to have breakfast with me.

434
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,950
But he told me he had a headache.

435
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,420
Oh, right. His voice was super hoarse.

436
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,580
I called him just now,

437
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,130
but he didn't answer.

438
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,910
That's why I asked you

439
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,650
if he was seriously sick.

440
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,660
I'm sorry.

441
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,850
Are you in a hurry for class?

442
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,550
It's okay. Go to class.

443
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,450
I'll go up and find him myself.

444
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,590
I also have to go back to class.

445
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,910
Because the teacher of the next class is fierce.

446
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,080
Bye.

447
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,490
What's the matter?

448
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,230
Well,

449
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,360
go to class.

450
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,460
I'll go see him.

451
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,470
Didn't you say you were in a hurry for class?

452
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,490
Alright.

453
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,800
This is his porridge, right?

454
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,370
Give it to me.

455
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,740
I'll go see him. You go to class.

456
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,270
Bye.

457
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,450
Tharn, Tharn, Tharn!

458
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,220
My porridge.

459
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,300
My stomach!

460
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,390
Type, get up, and take some medicine first.

461
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,420
Come on.

462
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,270
Get up and take some medicine first.

463
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,000
Get up.

464
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,200
Type.

465
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,980
Type.

466
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,990
Let me wipe your body.

467
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,100
Dad, don't go.

468
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,110
Dad!

469
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,590
Dad!

470
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,710
Don't go.

471
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,010
I'm not leaving.

472
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,400
I just wanted to wipe your body, Type.

473
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,460
Don't go.

474
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm not going anywhere.

475
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,610
I am sitting beside you.

476
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,240
I was stupid.

477
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,260
I saw Tharn this morning,

478
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,210
but I didn't ask him for his phone number.

479
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,440
Tharn, Tharn, Tharn!

480
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,870
Where are you going?

481
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,050
How's Type?

482
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,920
He's still sleeping.

483
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,880
He's been sleeping since morning.

484
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,560
I'll buy him some fever reducer.

485
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,350
No need.

486
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,320
Here. I have bought it.

487
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,060
I asked Champ to bring me up.

488
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,040
Go with Type's roommate then.

489
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,880
Please take care of him.

490
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,050
I'll get something to eat.

491
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,170
Bye, Tharn.

492
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,449
Bye.

493
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,020
Thank you.

494
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,620
It is OK for me to go with Tharn.

495
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,699
What's up? Why are you looking at me like this?

496
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,030
No.

497
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,409
I just think you're kind.

498
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,139
I see you fight with Type every day.

499
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,010
You're still so kind to take care of him.

500
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,949
We live in the same room.

501
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,530
I won't let him die in the room.

502
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,540
Okay.

503
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,889
That was why I said you were a good person.

504
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:44,699
If you were sick and lying in your room...

505
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,090
I say...

506
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,580
He would definitely let you sleep and die there.

507
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,010
No.

508
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,090
Say it.

509
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,190
I have a favor to ask.

510
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,360
What is it?

511
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,230
Can you not tell Type that

512
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,420
I took care of him?

513
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,340
Why?

514
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,890
Fine, I'm begging you.

515
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,450
Okay.

516
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,840
This is your business.

517
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,690
You two are so strange.

518
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,890
Wait.

519
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,370
Give me your phone number.

520
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,970
In that case, I can call you to ask about Type.

521
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,030
Okay.

522
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,160
Okay.

523
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,650
Okay.

524
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,320
Let's go.

525
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,830
Why are you being nice to me again?

526
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,080
What do you want?

527
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,950
Smells good.

528
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,380
Will it be a sin to steal a patient's food?

529
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,800
You're awake. How are you?

530
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:18,910
Are you feeling better?

531
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:21,670
Let me see.

532
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,260
I skipped training to take care of you, the patient.

533
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,260
Is this porridge bought by you?

534
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,590
Yes, I bought it.

535
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,880
I bought it for you early in the morning.

536
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,490
But you were sick and you were lying, so I didn't wake you up to let you eat.

537
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,930
But I have heated it once for you.

538
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,930
I was going to eat it if you wouldn't eat it.

539
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,000
It was you.

540
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:46,920
What?

541
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,200
No.

542
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,610
Get up and eat it since you are awake. Hurry up.

543
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,520
You need to eat something before you take medicine.

544
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,980
I'm not hungry.

545
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,120
No.

546
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,610
You must eat something no matter what.

547
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,960
Hurry up.

548
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,680
If you take medicine now,

549
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,400
it will hurt your stomach.

550
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,700
Come on, get up and eat.

551
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,620
It's good to have two or three bites.

552
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,400
Hurry up.

553
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,870
You are so stubborn.

554
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,570
Where is he?

555
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,760
He...

556
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,310
Tharn?

557
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,900
I don't know.

558
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,390
Why did you ask about him?

559
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,680
Nothing.

560
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,140
I'm full.

561
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,330
What? Just three bites?

562
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,740
Medicine.

563
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,360
Here you are.

564
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,820
Can you do it?

565
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,670
Did you take care of me...

566
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,210
Tharn, you're back.

567
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,070
Where did you go?

568
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,570
Type is awake.

569
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,980
I went to get the test paper.

570
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,970
Oh.

571
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,170
What did you just say?

572
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,730
Nothing.

573
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,790
Who's calling?

574
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,760
I am done.

575
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,830
Hey.

576
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,870
Senior is calling. I am done.

577
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,370
Just pick it up.

578
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,810
I know.

579
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,910
I'll be scolded.

580
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,290
I'll pick it up outside first.

581
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,220
Okay.

582
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,400
Hello, Senior.

583
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,220
Yes.

584
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,020
Yes.

585
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,810
Who took care of me when I had a fever?

586
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,930
You don't want it to be me, do you?

587
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,230
Yes.

588
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,300
Then you're lucky.

589
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,690
Because I didn't have time

590
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,730
to take care of kids like you.

591
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,050
Then that was No.

592
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,850
Yes, your friend took care of you.

593
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,520
It is good that you are better.

594
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,630
Take a shower now that you're awake.

595
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,070
I don't want to be with people who spread the cold virus

596
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,310
and are dirty.

597
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,240
It's because my fever hasn't subsided yet.

598
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,570
It's not because I'm embarrassed.

599
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,210
Kick it!

600
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,170
Go on. I'll play with one hand!

601
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,810
Where did he go?

602
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:31,950
Hello, Brother Type.

603
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,010
Hello.

604
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,610
It's over. You lost.

605
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,530
Where have you been early in the morning?

606
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,230
Did you ride my motorcycle again?

607
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,060
If I don't report to the police and let them arrest you, it's your luck.

608
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,990
Hey, are you crazy, No?

609
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,650
I went to get some snacks from Kengkla.

610
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,160
He brought us snacks from Japan.

611
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,850
Want some?

612
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,600
Really?

613
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,440
Give it to me.

614
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,790
I almost forgot about it.

615
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:00,480
Gosh, be gentle.

616
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,310
What are they?

617
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,470
My dad told me to give them to you.

618
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,120
What are they?

619
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,810
Salted eggs.

620
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,240
I called him a few days ago.

621
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,690
He found that I was sick,

622
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,700
so he sent me something

623
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,260
to thank you for taking care of his beloved son.

624
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:18,700
Really?

625
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:19,760
Yes.

626
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,110
Then why did you give them to me?

627
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,450
Why didn't you give them to Tharn?

628
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,860
Tharn? Why should I give them to him?

629
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,730
What a waste.

630
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,470
Didn't you know it?

631
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,290
The one who took care of you when you were sick

632
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:32,730
was Tharn.

633
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:35,590
What are you talking about?

634
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,540
Wasn't it you?

635
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,000
No, it really wasn't me.

636
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,040
Well...

637
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,680
Tharn was the one who took care of you when you were sick.

638
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,600
He fed you food, water, and medicine.

639
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,560
He wiped your body.

640
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,340
Also,

641
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,630
he changed your clothes.

642
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,390
Hey, Type.

643
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,700
Hey...

644
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:02,500
What?

645
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,180
Listen to me first.

646
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,860
Your enemy called Tharn

647
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,000
is really a good person.

648
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:11,720
Hey.

649
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,610
He didn't even go to class to take care of you.

650
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,530
Didn't you even notice it?

651
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,740
The person who took care of you until you got better

652
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,150
was the person you hated so much.

653
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,470
You told me that you took care of me.

654
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,870
It was not me.

655
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,920
As far as I remember,

656
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,020
I only went to see you on the first day

657
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,560
when you were sick.

658
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,030
You jerk.

659
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,190
You're my friend. Why didn't you take care of me?

660
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,200
Yes, I'm your friend.

661
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,370
But I promise, if I took care of you,

662
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,050
you would definitely go to the hospital.

663
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,060
You will be better if you let Tharn take care of you.

664
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,210
How could you hit me? It hurts.

665
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:52,390
Darn it.

666
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,090
I'm going back.

667
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,620
Where are you going?

668
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:57,590
To the dorm.

669
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,820
Didn't you say you didn't want to go back to the dorm?

670
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,430
Mind your own business.

671
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,400
What?

672
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,080
You gave me salted eggs and taro.

673
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,520
I will be stuffed.

674
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,620
What are you doing, Type?

675
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,510
Why don't you go inside?

676
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:45,610
What's going on?

677
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,560
Did you quarrel with your roommate again?

678
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,250
Who said that?

679
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,710
No.

680
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,540
Why?

681
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,630
He's handsome, but has a bad personality?

682
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,520
No.

683
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,700
He's so nice.

684
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:08,750
He's so good that I feel guilty for hating him.

685
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,070
Then why do you hate him?

686
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,340
Since he's so nice...

687
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,640
But actually, I don't understand

688
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,550
why you wanted to switch rooms with me from the beginning.

00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,900
What?

690
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:55,310
Hello.

691
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:57,960
Tharn.

692
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,350
Did you do something to me at night?

693
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,060
Where are my clothes?

694
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,220
Give clothes back to me!

695
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,310
I'll have a shower with you.
