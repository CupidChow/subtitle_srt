1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,710
[Puifai, what are you doing?]

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,680
[I'm helping my mother cook.]

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,950
[Wow, you will be an understanding wife and loving mother.]

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:18,000
[I tried to make yellow curry today.]

5
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,020
[I want to eat it.]

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,960
[I'll make it for you next time.]

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,430
[Type]

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,030
[What are you doing?]

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,960
[Let's kick.]

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,230
Okay I'll be right there

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,080
[Type, what are you doing?]

12
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,520
[I'm thinking about you.]

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,890
[TharnType]

14
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:11,110
[TharnType]

15
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,050
Have you eaten?

16
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,520
When did you come back?

17
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,490
A while ago.

18
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,590
So did you eat?

19
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,840
I brought you spicy fried noodles, and I have put them in the fridge.

20
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,470
How do you know what I want to eat?

21
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,060
Well,

22
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,250
it should be the hottest dish in the restaurant.

23
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,900
How do you know I like spicy food?

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,660
Oh, Type.

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Every time you eat,

26
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,160
you always add a lot of chili and fish dew.

27
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,910
Every time you eat Kway Teow,

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,930
you add chili sauce until the soup turns red.

29
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,310
Every time you decide where to eat,

30
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,000
you always choose a southern Thai restaurant.

31
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,060
How could I not know you like spicy food?

32
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,350
What about you?

33
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,110
What about me?

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,300
Can you eat spicy food?

35
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,320
Do you want to know about me?

36
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,880
I can eat spicy food,

37
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,440
but not as much as you.

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,420
I like carbonated drinks,

39
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,910
but I don't drink them every day. It'll increase the level of my blood sugar.

40
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,710
I like fried eggs, but only sunny side up.

41
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,900
I don't eat overcooked eggs.

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,160
I only put jam on the bread, not butter.

43
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,550
And Western food is my favorite.

44
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,860
I like steak, lasagna, and spaghetti...

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,260
These are my favorites.

46
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,570
I was just asking if you could eat spicy food.

47
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,590
I've already eaten.

48
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,019
But I can eat it later,

49
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,769
so that I won't waste your regard.

50
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,810
Type.

51
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,159
Type.

52
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,560
What's up?

53
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,810
Are you free this Friday?

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,530
I'll go to Jeed's bar to help the seniors perform.

55
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,290
She asked me to invite you.

56
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,159
Are you going to help your senior again?

57
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,960
I'll go the day after tomorrow too.

58
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,740
But...

59
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,560
I didn't call you because the place is far away.

60
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,270
It sounds fun.

61
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,500
Then I can know if what Jeed said is true.

62
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,740
What did she say?

63
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,040
She said you were cool.

64
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,950
That's definitely not true.

65
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm just an ordinary person who likes playing drums.

66
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,150
Okay, I'll go.

67
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,130
Then I can see

68
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,560
what you mean by 'ordinary'.

69
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,700
What about you?

70
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,340
How much can you make by playing drums for your senior's band?

71
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,290
Jeed asked that day too. When will you start a new band?

72
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,650
She's waiting.

73
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,450
Very soon.

74
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,980
I just got a good guitarist.

75
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,000
So Friday...

76
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,310
Okay. Got it.

77
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,470
I won't miss it.

78
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
You don't need to repeat it.

79
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,420
Which room?

80
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,020
Darn it. Ask me to come without telling me which room it is...

81
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,500
Is this right?

82
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,270
Techno.

83
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,540
What are you doing at my college?

84
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,320
Thank Buddha

85
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,540
for sending this handsome angel to save me.

86
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,800
What angel?

87
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,880
This, Tharn.

88
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,060
The senior of the student union asked me to send this document here,

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,550
but I can't find the room.

90
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,970
Please help me, Tharn.

91
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,020
Please.

92
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,900
Okay.

93
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,410
But why did you deliver it yourself?

94
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,590
Are you also a member of the student union?

95
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,960
No, I'm not.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,690
I just took a nap in the student union's office.

97
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,250
The president of the student union came

98
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,950
and threw this document at me.

99
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,500
Then he said,

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,090
"Don't eat and sleep for free here.

101
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,860
Do something meaningful."

102
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,130
So I had to leave the room with an air conditioner

103
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,700
and come to your academic building through the campus.

104
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,130
Today may be my unlucky day.

105
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,440
By the way,

106
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,540
don't you have classes later?

107
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,410
No.

108
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,470
But I have a rehearsal.

109
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,120
Sounds interesting.

110
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,290
After you take me to deliver the document,

111
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,440
can I go to the rehearsal with you? Please.

112
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,070
Are you serious?

113
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,070
Of course.

114
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,020
Let's go. I want to see you rehearse for a long time.

115
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,880
Are you satisfied?

116
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,730
Awesome!

117
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,760
You're so cool.

118
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,179
Hey.

119
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,780
Can you teach me?

120
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,460
I want to learn how to play drums.

121
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,640
Sure.

122
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,540
Type has never said that you are so good at playing drums.

123
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,320
Otherwise,

124
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,570
I would have followed you long ago.

125
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,290
Speaking of him...

126
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,930
Forget about him.

127
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,630
He's probably obsessed with the girl now.

128
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,020
What's the matter?

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,950
Did you just say

130
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,460
that Type fell in love with a girl?

131
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,650
I didn't say anything.

132
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,010
You must have heard it wrong.

133
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,710
Sorry, I'm late.

134
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,580
It's okay. If it's you, I can wait.

135
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,510
Are you saying I'm really late?

136
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,020
I didn't say anything.

137
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,450
Come on. What do you want to eat?

138
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,490
Anything is fine. You decide.

139
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,600
Usually when women say "anything is fine",

140
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,370
they have already made a decision, right?

141
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,700
I haven't seen the menu yet. How could I decide?

142
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,520
I'm not talking about the menu.

143
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,580
What are you talking about, Type?

144
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:20,790
Well,

145
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:23,690
it's like how you chose me.

146
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,550
You are opinionated.

147
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,430
Come on. Let's order.

148
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,380
What do you want to eat?

149
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,380
[No is calling.]

150
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,280
Anything is OK.

151
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,850
I want to recommend a dish.

152
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,620
-What is it?
-This one.

153
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,850
Crispy chicken.

154
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,100
Tharn.

155
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,210
Why are you sitting alone in the dark?

156
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,960
I thought you were a ghost.

157
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,850
Where did you go?

158
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,700
I went out to eat with a friend.

159
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,130
What friend?

160
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,860
It's none of your business.

161
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,060
A girl, right?

162
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,740
None of your business.

163
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,120
You said it was none of my business,

164
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,300
but you went out with a girl.

165
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,780
Why did you raise your voice?

166
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,580
Who the hell did you go with and where did you go?

167
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,070
You're not my parent.

168
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,100
It's my business wherever I go.

169
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,580
It has nothing to do with you.

170
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,200
I was just asking you, Type.

171
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,220
Can't you tell me?

172
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,490
But I don't like your tone and attitude.

173
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,470
I never ask where you go or who you're with.

174
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,400
You have no right to ask me either.

175
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,910
So you don't want to tell me

176
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,110
because you were with a girl, right?

177
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,280
Type, you have someone else, right?

178
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,430
It's none of your business.

179
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,770
But I'm your husband.

180
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,170
You're not my husband.

181
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,540
You don't have to look at me like that.

182
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,540
We're just sex partners.

183
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,160
Who I like and whom I pursue

184
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,980
are my business.

185
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,890
You have no right to stop me.

186
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,310
You are not my master.

187
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,870
You mean

188
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:05,670
even if you have sex with others,

189
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,280
it will still have nothing to do with me?

190
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,290
Yes.

191
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,550
Even if I have sex with someone else,

192
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,310
it will have nothing to do with you.

193
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,030
So even if I have sex with someone else,

194
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,850
it will have nothing to do with you either.

195
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,740
Yes.

196
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,120
If you have someone else,

197
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,870
I won't interfere.

198
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,430
You once scolded me.

199
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,070
You said I dated around.

200
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,580
But you're doing the same now.

201
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,080
Tharn, son of a bitch!

202
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,630
You asked me

203
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,150
to have sex with someone else

204
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,230
and sleep with others.

205
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,080
But I won't do that.

206
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,080
Because I only have you.

207
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,050
I have you.

208
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,940
Why should I have someone else?

209
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,200
So what's wrong with me being jealous?

210
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,600
Then remember,

211
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,520
I'm not gay.

212
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,850
I like women.

213
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,820
If you can't accept me being with someone else,

214
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,170
let's end this.

215
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,530
Are they fighting again?

216
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,500
Brother! Brother! Brother!

217
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,400
Be quiet! I can't hear them!

218
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,090
Brother Khlui.

219
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,330
Brother Seo Duang.

220
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,210
I'll sleep here tonight.

221
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,630
Did you have a fight with Tharn?

222
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,210
Sister. Sister.

223
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,780
I'll fly to Korea and cry for you.

224
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,070
I live with a lunatic, right?

225
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,600
My best friend.

226
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,420
What's wrong?

227
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,300
You look weird today.

228
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,050
Didn't you say the teacher canceled the class?

229
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,600
Why are you here?

230
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,300
I'm fine.

231
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,000
But you're acting weird today.

232
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,860
Normally, you are calm and quiet.

233
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,920
But today you're as still as a wax figure.

234
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,400
Be careful if someone knocks you unconscious and drags you into his cave.

235
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,170
Don't say I didn't remind you.

236
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,150
It's not funny at all.

237
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,930
What's wrong?

238
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,810
Tell me.

239
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,990
I'm fine.

240
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,040
I couldn't sleep last night.

241
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,420
So I watched the video of the concert all night.

242
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,440
You did this again.

243
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,190
What about you?

244
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,760
Why are you here?

245
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,490
Didn't you know that the teacher canceled the class?

246
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,700
I didn't know it until I left my house.

247
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,780
What about you?

248
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,080
Your dormitory is just a few steps away.

249
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
If I were you,

250
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,980
I'd go back to my dorm and sleep.

251
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,750

[Rule 6. Can you follow it?]

255
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,930
I'll go get some drinks.

256
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,890
Are you going to stay here?

257
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,330
I'll get going, Lhong.

258
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,550
I won't attend the afternoon class.

259
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,540
Tharn.

260
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,990
Tharn. Tharn.

261
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,690
Your ball.

262
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,920
If you have something to say, say it.

263
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,880
Okay.

264
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,920
I have something to confess.

265
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,320
What is it?

266
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,730
I told Tharn.

267
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,190
What did you tell him?

268
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,690
You and Puifai are getting to know each other.

269
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,970
But I called to inform you.

270
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,460
But you didn't answer my phone call.

271
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,190
Fine. I didn't mean to say it.

272
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,060
I went to his college that day.

273
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,720
Then it accidentally slipped out.

274
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,320
I told him you fell in love with a girl.

275
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,870
Did you have a big fight?

276
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,970
I'm such a bad friend.

277
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,570
I have a bad mouth and a foul mouth. I am a chatterbox.

278
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,330
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,520
Why are you apologizing?

280
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,910
Aren't you mad at me?

281
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,860
I have nothing to do with him.

282
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,190
It's my business that I have someone else.

283
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,200
Whether he knows it or not,

284
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,160
he has no right to stop me.

285
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,590
One more thing.

286
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,980
Don't make it look like I was caught cheating.

287
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,900
Hey.

288
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,890
But when Tharn found it out,

289
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,680
he looked angry at you.

290
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,980
So what?

291
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,320
It's his business to be angry.

292
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,100
You're right.

293
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,260
He likes you,

294
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,200
but you don't like him.

295
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,750
Who you want to date...

296
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,170
Even if he knows it, it has nothing to do with him, right?

297
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,440
This is better.

298
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,700
He can finally give up on you.

299
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,500
Where did you kick it to?

300
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,790
Go pick it up.

301
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,060
You bastard!

302
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,000
What's wrong with me?

303
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,880
Yes. What's wrong with you?

304
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,340
You stood here talking to yourself.

305
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,840
How long are you going to stand there?

306
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,470
I'm waiting for an answer.

307
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,440
The answer is here.

308
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,040
Let's be the same as before.

309
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,670
Are you sure you won't make trouble again?

310
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,720
I think this is better.

311
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,910
If I want it,

312
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,170
I'll have sex with you and vent my desire.

313
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,150
If you want to have sex, you will tell me.

314
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,260
I think this is easier.

315
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,200
Good.

316
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,300
It is good that you figured it out.

317
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,300
[Type, are you free on Wednesday?]

318
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,170
[I'm sure I'm free if it's you.]

319
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,540
Type, the banana glutinous rice cakes we said that day...

320
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,040
I found a nice place selling them.

321
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,870
Let's go together next time.

322
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,260
Type?

323
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,410
Type.

324
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,410
What? What did you say?

325
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,830
Are you okay?

326
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,550
I'm fine.

327
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,350
If you are fine, what did I just say?

328
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,280
The stray cat behind the dorm, right?

329
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,420
Wrong.

330
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,630
A newly released love movie?

331
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,220
No.

332
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,870
The flashing street lights in the alley?

333
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,030
Still wrong.

334
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,150
I was talking about banana glutinous rice cakes.

335
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,340
Oh.

336
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,210
Were you thinking about other girls?

337
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,080
No.

338
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,400
What made you think so?

339
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,830
I was just missing my dog.

340
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,480
My mom called this morning and told me it was dead.

341
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,370
Really?

342
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,310
How old was it?

343
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,400
I'm sorry, Puifai.

344
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,860
I don't want to talk about it.

345
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,970
It followed me for a long time.

346
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,130
I'm sad too.

347
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,450
You took advantage of me.

348
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,030
No, I just wanted to hold your hand.

349
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,240
Are you free this Friday?

350
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,560
What's the matter?

351
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,630
It is my birthday.

352
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:38,990
Really?

353
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,130
Yes.

354
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,380
But I wonder if anyone wants to celebrate with me.

355
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,210
Everyone is busy,

356
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,220
including my parents.

357
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,560
I'm all alone.

358
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,430
If someone can accompany me to dinner, that will be great.

359
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,630
Poor thing.

360
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,950
Have you been abandoned by your friends?

361
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,010
So you can't come either?

362
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,170
It's your birthday.

363
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,610
How come I will not be available?

364
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,750
You will come, right?

365
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,180
I promise.

366
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,720
I'll keep my word.

367
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,460
What are you doing?

368
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,570
Our promise.

369
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,690
Let go of me!

370
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:14,950
[So you're free this Friday, right?]

371
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,310
You're amazing.

372
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,190
What?

373
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,380
Even if I'm on you,

374
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,890
you can still talk to others.

375
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,130
Tharn.

376
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,370
Yes?

377
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,080
This Friday...

378
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,650
My performance will start at 7 p.m.

379
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,290
I don't think I can make it.

380
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,050
It's Puifai's birthday this Friday.

381
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,930
It's okay if you're not free.

382
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,840
I'll help you tell Jeed that you have something else to do.

383
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,170
I'll confess my love to Puifai.

384
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,350
Okay.

385
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,020
Good luck.

386
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,130
Remember to tell me the result.

387
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,020
Then I will know how to position myself properly.

388
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,160
By the way, don't forget to buy her a gift.

389
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,820
Otherwise, she will abandon you before she becomes your girlfriend.

390
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,990
Honey.

391
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,100
-What’s the matter?
-I'm glad it rained right after I got here.

392
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,240
-What? No nonsense.
-Let's go home in this atmosphere.

393
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,390
Stop horsing around.

394
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,900
What's wrong with him?

395
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,010
I don't know.

396
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:00,150
He's been drinking since he left the stage.

397
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,550
Can't he hear us?

398
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:05,960
He's unstable.

399
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,020
Try to curse him. He won't even know.

400
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,720
Tharn!

401
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,770
Hello, Brother.

402
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,260
Are you okay?

403
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,520
I'm fine.

404
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,970
I was just thinking about something.

405
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,690
Of course.

406
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,380
You've been like this since you were on the stage.

407
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,560
Everyone went back after you left the stage, but you're still sitting here.

408
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,720
I'm sorry, Jeed.

409
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,330
Was my performance really that bad?

410
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,850
It has nothing to do with this.

411
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,480
Your music was as wonderful as ever.

412
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,130
All the girls in front of the stage were looking at you.

413
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,170
Wait. How did you know the girls were looking at him?

414
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,530
Relax. I was observing the audience for him.

415
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,820
Are you sure it was not for yourself?

416
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,040
Jeed, why should I do that?

417
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,390
My wife is young and beautiful, with a perfect figure.

418
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:07,560
I will never get tired of you.

419
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,790
-What?
-Brother is still here.

420
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,090
We're all on the same side. It doesn't matter if he knows it.

421
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,830
You're mealy-mouthed.

422
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,210
Hey.

423
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,900
You're restless because of that handsome guy.

424
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,480
Right?

425
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,720
What's up?

426
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,650
Is he your new boyfriend?

427
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,850
No.

428
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,600
Khong, they are still flirting, right?

429
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,940
He’s nice.

430
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:44,890
He is tall, tan, and handsome.

431
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,000
Too perfect!

432
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,360
Jeed!

433
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
Your husband is still here.

434
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,520
I was observing for him.

435
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,700
Just like what you did before,

436
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,140
You always like to argue.

437
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,010
Let's change the subject.

438
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,730
So, who is he?

439
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,540
He is...

440
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,260
No matter how hard I try,

441
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,590
he will never care about me.

442
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,640
Don't make that face.

443
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,790
A broken love never kills people.

444
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,600
But too many heartbreaks can also cause you too much pain.

445
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,080
This is ridiculous.

446
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,370
It turns too dramatic.

447
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,480
We are at a bar. Let's change the topic.

448
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,770
You should drink at a bar.

449
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,240
Why do you talk about things that are so stressful?

450
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,960
Come on. Come on. Come on.

451
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,000
Happy birthday.

452
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,950
Thank you, Type.

453
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,740
Wow.

454
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,840
Open it.

455
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,340
When did you buy it secretly?

456
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,360
I won't tell you.

457
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,720
So cute.

458
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,850
I really like it.

459
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,860
I'm glad you like it.

460
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,620
I was worried you wouldn't like it at first.

461
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,410
Of course, I like it.

462
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,790
I really like it.

463
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,940
If you like it,

464
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,180
when you hug it, think of the person who gave it to you.

465
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,720
Why should I think of him?

466
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,160
He is not as cute as you.

467
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,960
You said that I was not cute. Give it back to me then.

468
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,390
No way. Since you gave it to me, it's mine.

469
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,860
I won't give it to you. Give it to me.

470
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,510
You're not cute,

471
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,200
but you're handsome, you know?

472
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,690
You are

473
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,590
very pretty too.

474
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,739
Happy birthday.

475
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,800
Were you taking advantage of me?

476
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,980
Yes, I was.

477
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,260
I'll go to the bathroom.

478
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,889
I can't stand a playboy.

479
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,400
Hold this for me.

480
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,100
Okay. Come back soon.

481
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,650
I think Tharn may like this place.

482
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,600
Are you rushing back to the dorm?

483
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,860
No.

484
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,410
The dormitory curfew is at 11pm.

485
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,610
We can still stay here for a long time.

486
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,180
Why don't you move to the dormitory outside the school?

487
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,660
My dad wanted me to stay in the dorm inside the school for the first year

488
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,980
so that I can make many friends.

489
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,320
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to make it.

490
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,100
There's a curfew in the dorm inside the school.

491
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,260
It's more convenient to stay in the dorm outside the school.

492
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,310
I don't have to worry when I invite friends to stay overnight.

493
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,740
So if I miss the curfew,

494
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,240
can I stay overnight at your place?

495
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,420
Are you kidding me?

496
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,130
Just kidding.

497
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,690
What kind of person do you think I am?

498
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,320
You looked serious just now.

499
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,460
Was I serious?

500
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,880
-Yes.
-I was just kidding. Let's eat.

501
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,540
Thank you for taking me back.

502
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,940
You're welcome.

503
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,510
It's dangerous for a girl to go home alone.

504
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,420
Are you worried about me?

505
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,650
I won't tell you.

506
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,080
Is this your apartment?

507
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,160
What's the matter?

508
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
Very pretty.

509
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,570
My apartment?

510
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,430
I meant you.

511
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,760
You're really...

512
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,090
What's the matter?

513
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,150
I was just kidding.

514
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,890
Of course, I referred to the apartment.

515
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,360
Do you want to go up and take a look?

516
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,310
When you want to move to the dorm outside the school,

517
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,630
it might be a choice.

518
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,910
Okay.

519
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,600
I might be able to move here next year.

520
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,040
I'm sorry, Tharn.

521
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,490
I'm sorry.

522
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,590
I'm really sorry.

523
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,380
Why are you apologizing?

524
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,290
Puifai and I had sex.

525
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,960
She invited me to her room.

526
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,070
Suddenly,

527
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,680
I remembered what I said to you.

528
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,960
I said you could get involved with anyone,

529
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,990
and it had nothing to do with me.

530
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,460
I am in great pain.

531
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,390
Why?

532
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,320
I don't know.

533
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,550
I can't stand it

534
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,460
when thinking of you having sex with others.

535
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,960
Why?

536
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,360
When I embraced her soft body,

537
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,630
I kept thinking about your body.

538
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:44,250
When I kissed her,

539
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,560
I kept thinking about your kiss.

540
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,770
Every time I was with her,

541
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,720
why did I always think of you?

542
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,170
Did you really have sex with her?

543
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,920
I can't make it, Tharn.

544
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,850
Did you hear me?

545
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,340
I can't have sex with any woman anymore.

546
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,890
Maybe you're just tired.

547
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,500
No.

548
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,840
I'm not tired.

549
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,860
Maybe you are just

550
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,300
not interested in her.

551
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,090
I'm not interested in any women.

552
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,840
Maybe, you might be interested in other men.

553
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,060
Do you want to die, Tharn?

554
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,930
I'm a man.

555
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,960
I don't want to have sex with other men.

556
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,120
I can only have sex with you.

557
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,250
So?

558
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,630
I can only have sex with you.

559
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,700
Please forgive me.

560
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,420
Please forgive me one more time.

561
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,890
Good boy.

562
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,430
As you know,

563
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,400
I

564
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,490
will never be angry with you.

565
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:57,740
Now,

566
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,480
you belong to me, right?

567
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,170
You belong to me.

568
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,020
Because I will never let you go again.

569
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:16,750
As you know,

570
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,130
I

571
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,710
have belonged to you for a long time.

572
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:29,110
♫When I woke up this morning, the world seemed a bit different♫

573
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:35,150
♫The alarm clock woke me up as usual♫

574
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:40,450
♫You're sleeping quietly, and you don't know what's in my mind♫

575
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:47,150
♫I made you fall into a beautiful dream♫

576
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:53,180
♫Thinking that we once gazed into each other's eyes without words♫

577
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:58,660
♫The eyes you look at me are proof of our love♫

578
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,290
Is this how you coax me?

579
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,830
This is the only way I know.

580
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:19,040
♫I hope you're my last one♫

581
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,000
♫Accompanying me every time I breathe♫

582
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,520
♫I will never make you sad♫

583
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,400
♫Did you hear me, my baby?♫

584
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,130
Are you okay?

585
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,240
I'm not okay.

586
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,470
Type said he couldn't do it.

587
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:07,800
What?

588
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,680
He can't hug me.

589
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,200
Is he crazy?

590
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,950
He looks like he can eat you.

591
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:26,180
Calm down first.

592
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,680
Tell me what happened.

593
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,050
I saw you celebrating your birthday with him

594
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:34,240
on social media.

595
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,400
He already has a boyfriend.

596
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,040
Darn it.

597
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,550
He said he couldn't go on with me.

598
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,880
He said he couldn’t see his boyfriend sad.

599
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,030
What about me, Mai?

600
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,360
I will also get hurt.

601
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,260
I'm serious about him.

602
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,350
How could he do this to me?

603
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:18,550
It's okay.

604
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,660
Don't cry.

605
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:26,990
I'm here.

606
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:38,830
Don't cry.

607
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,950
I told her I wouldn't see her again.

608
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,530
After returning, I deleted her number

609
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,260
and all her contact information.

610
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,920
I can't go back to her even if I want to.

611
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,290
Why?

612
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,920
I told her I had a boyfriend.

613
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,810
-What?
-Yes, I really said that to her.

614
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,300
I said that when we had sex.

615
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,670
Then she slapped me.

616
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:33,660
This slap is too light compared to what I did to her.

617
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,370
Can you make it?

618
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,730
Dating a gay like me...

619
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,780
To be honest, I really don't know.

620
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,990
I've always liked women.

621
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,080
I feel like I lacked thinking,

622
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,080
which is why I had sex with a big man like you.

623
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,780
I'm sorry.

624
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:08,940
You know I have a bad mouth.

625
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,380
Don't be mad at me.

626
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,360
In the beginning,

627
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,160
I planned to break up with you

628
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,690
after you came back.

629
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,170
But seeing you like this,

630
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,220
I will never break up with you.

631
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,410
Were you scared?

632
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,140
Of course, I was.

633
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,720
You said you wanted to break up with me.

634
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:56,290
But I was afraid the whole week

635
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,370
that you would break up with me first.

636
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:02,890
I'm sorry.

637
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,400
I won't act like a jerk anymore.

638
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,570
It's good that you know you're bad.

639
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,770
Do you want to move out and live outside school with me

640
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,100
next semester?

641
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,590
My dad won't agree.

642
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,210
I'll pay the rent for you.

643
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,610
I want to hear you scream to your heart's content.

644
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,370
I think it'll be sexy.

645
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,280
Do you want me to kick you, Tharn?

646
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,730
I'm serious.

647
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,310
How can a man be sexy?

648
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,090
You don't need to know it.

649
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,690
It is enough for me to know it myself.

650
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,470
You must be a jealous person.

651
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,290
Can you date a jealous guy like me?

652
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,200
If I can't, I wouldn't have come back and let you have sex with me.

653
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,700
Then can I have sex with you for the whole night?

654
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,080
Do whatever you want.

655
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,750
Are you okay?

656
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:35,320
Yes.

657
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:42,330
Type, the food is cold.

658
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:43,970
Do you need me to heat it again?

659
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,990
It's okay. I can eat it.

660
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,830
You haven't looked me in the eye today.

661
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,610
Why did you kick me?

662
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,520
Let go of my foot.

663
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,400
Do you want me to let it go?

664
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:23,290
Look at me first.

665
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:24,580
Come on.

666
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,140
I have looked at you. Let it go.

667
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:32,810
Look at me longer.

668
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,040
Will you look at me?

669
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,590
Look at me.

670
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:37,720
Tharn, it is itchy.

671
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,340
Look into my eyes first.

672
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,180
I am looking at them.

673
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,790
I give up.

674
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:55,980
It's too shameful.

675
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,820
Are you satisfied?

676
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:04,920
I'm happy that you still remember what happened last night.

677
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,550
How could I forget it?

678
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,750
So you also remember

679
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:14,780
you and me...

680
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:20,850
I remember everything.

681
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:25,250
You and I

682
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,270
are together.

683
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,420
Is it fun?

684
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:10,810
Yes.

685
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,180
If you think it's fun,

686
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:18,380
continue.

687
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,680
Type.

688
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:54,240
I'm going to sleep.

689
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,200
Have a good dream.

690
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,240
Hello?

691
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:21,370
I'll be there soon.

692
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,450
[Tar]

693
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,450
My home is not far from the college.

694
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,140
Okay.

695
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:50,240
[Tar]

696
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,740
[Dad]

697
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,850
Hello, Dad.

698
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,270
How was it, Son?

699
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,800
How was it last night?

700
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,510
Did you get a girlfriend?

701
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,390
No, Dad.

702
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,740
You don't have my skills.

703
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,610
Honey, Son got dumped.

704
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:26,300
I didn't get dumped.

705
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,790
I just didn't feel right.

706
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,940
It is just an excuse.

707
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:35,110
Dad,

708
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,220
can I make a request?

709
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,620
Do you dare to make a request?

710
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,960
You can't even pursue a girl. What else do you want?

711
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,300
Is it a magic potion for treating heartbreak?

712
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,270
Can I move out and live outside the school next semester?

713
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,790
You can't bear it anymore. You are just thinking about living a comfortable life.

714
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,300
We promised to move out next year, right?

715
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:57,190
It's so comfortable to live in a school dormitory. You have so many friends there.

716
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,710
That's what you said to yourself.

717
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,570
I will also live with my friends when I go to live in the dormitory outside school.

718
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,040
What friend?

719
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,070
Well,

720
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,540
let me move out.

721
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,950
I promise I'll study hard

722
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,180
and be a good child.

723
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,980
I will go back to my room before 11 p.m.

724
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,040
I will stay away from drugs.

725
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,050
I will stay away from women.

726
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:19,770
Please, Dad.

727
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,550
I will also get good grades.

728
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,170
You can stay away from drugs,

729
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,010
but you are useless if you stay away from women.

730
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:26,850
Honey.

731
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,600
What kind of bad things are you teaching him again?

732
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,180
I have to hang up now, Son.

733
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,340
I'm in big trouble.

734
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:33,980
Okay, Dad.

735
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,240
Baby?

736
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,860
So cute.

737
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,280
Jerk!

738
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,090
Do you usually chat with your parents

739
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,150
like this?

740
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,400
Yes.

741
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,410
Didn't you call yourself "baby" when you were little?

742
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:14,730
No.

743
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:19,050
I usually call myself my name.

744
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,080
Then you're lucky.

745
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,890
But if you laugh at me...

746
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,910
Besides calling yourself "baby",

747
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,160
do you still suck your thumb?

748
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:35,990
You're such a jerk.

749
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,980
I'll stop teasing you.

750
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:39,840
So,

751
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:46,870
what does your dad think about you moving out?

752
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,910
I don't know.

753
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,260
But there should be no problem.

754
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,580
Tharn, I'm hot.

755
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,710
But I'm cold.

756
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,130
You bastard!

757
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:11,930
Then...

758
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,120
let's

759
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,190
take a look at dormitories outside school tomorrow.

760
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,410
How can I refuse you?

761
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:26,000
Even if I don't go, you will still find something to force me to go.

762
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,970
But I have never forced you.

763
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,310
I just found ways

764
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:36,990
to make you reluctant to reject me.

765
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,360
That was all.

766
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,770
You bastard!

767
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,060
I'm back.

768
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:04,530
Son, are you crazy after studying?

769
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,630
Type, a friend came to see you.

770
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,000
-Who is it?
-It's me.

771
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:10,510
Kom.

772
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:21,070
You're late.

773
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,530
What are you wearing?
