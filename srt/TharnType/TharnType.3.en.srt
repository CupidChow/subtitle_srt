You...

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,430
What's wrong?

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,630
No, nothing.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,729
I talked to Techno.

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,240
Well,

7
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,170
I apologize to you.

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,510
I was being nosy.

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,330
You shouldn't be saying this.

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,800
You should scold me.

11
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,560
I kept scolding you before.

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,380
But what can I get from scolding you?

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,590
I won't let you die in your room.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,300
No matter how much we hate each other,

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,620
I can't just sit back and watch.

16
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,190
You make me look like a bad guy.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,420
You are.

18
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,710
Are you scolding me, bastard?

19
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,530
It means you've fully recovered

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,670
that you can talk so loud now, right?

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,750
How much is it?

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,730
What?

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,789
How much is the medicine?

24
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,310
I don't want to owe anyone anything.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,920
You already paid.

26
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,280
I woke up in my sleep and paid for it, is it?

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,050
Tell me how much it is.

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,270
This.

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,270
You paid me with this.

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,140
I bought that stealing your money.

31
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,530
Anyway,

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,240
next time,

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,289
don't spill snacks on my bed again, okay?

34
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:51,470
I didn't.

35
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,410
Don't worry.

36
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,160
I won't ask you to repay the favor.

37
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,290
I'll think of it

38
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,400
as feeding a dog.

39
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,220
No matter how good you are to me, I still hate you.

40
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,200
Don't let your guard down.

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,830
I'm a crazy dog, I'll bite you back anytime.

45
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,950
Was it a dream?

46
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,760
You just recovered,

47
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,980
and you are turning crazy now?

48
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,310
That's my business.

Did you do anything to me?

What I do

52
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,310
is my business.

53
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,620
I'm going to class.

54
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,780
Hey, what do you mean?

55
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:03,920
Hey.

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,460
Don't mess with me.

Tharn.

60
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,270
Don't use my words against me.

61
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,180
-Don’t use my words against me.
-Again?

Damn it Tharn! Come back, I'm not finished yet.

65
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,240
What are you yelling about, Type?

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
Hello, Brother Khlui.

67
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,659
Can you stop fighting every morning?

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,020
It's already bad enough to have a roommate who's obsessed with Hallyu.

69
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,680
Now I have another noisy neighbor.

70
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,590
I know you hate each other, but can't you watch your volume?

71
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,210
Don't be so loud.

72
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,950
I can't stand it.

73
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,620
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,120
One more thing.

75
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,600
I want to tell you that the wall is thin.

76
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,150
I really don't know

77
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,170
why you two are fighting.

78
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,450
You really don't know what we're arguing about?

79
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,700
No.

80
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,370
I eavesdropped, but I can't hear you.

81
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,170
Whatever.

82
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,870
You two are like the couple in my neighbourhood.

83
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,890
You fight every day.

84
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,860
Be careful, you might end up together.

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,440
Hey, I have nothing to do with him.

86
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,620
I'm in a hurry.

87
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,190
Are you and Tharn...

88
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,590
That's not true.

89
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,840
Anyway, I'm sorry for yelling.

90
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,460
Fine.

91
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,210
There's no way we'll be a couple.

92
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,830
It's more like we had a grudge in our previous lives.

93
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,050
What are you looking at?

94
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,909
Why do you care?

95
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,410
I have to protect my junior.

96
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,160
They live next door just like our neighbours.

97
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,390
If your neighbours fight, aren't you going to stop them?

98
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,120
What kind of logic is that?

99
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,410
Don't you know?

100
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,470
I labelled myself a busybody.

101
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,880
And you, go back and practice, alright?

102
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,179
Type, can I borrow your lecture notes?

103
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,280
I fell asleep.

104
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,200
Champ said this will be on the exam.

105
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,560

106
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,250
Hey.

-Ouch.
-Techno.

108
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,210
Didn't you hear me?

109
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,830
Why are you so quiet?

110
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,070
Don't tell me

111
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,830
you're going to kick Tharn out again?

112
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,470
I'm telling you, he's a good guy.

113
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,740
Are you his friend or mine?

114
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,130
Now I'm friends with both of you.

115
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,570
Why are you so mad at him?

116
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,580
Let me tell you first.

117
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,850
You should be grateful to him.

118
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,740
He took care of you when you were sick.

119
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
Fine, do whatever you want.

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,120
If I were you,

121
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
I wouldn't give up

122
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,020
being friends with such a good guy

123
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,650
just because he's gay.

124
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm not saying he's bad.

125
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,380
But you're so quiet

126
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,740
because you're thinking of ways to get rid of him, aren't you?

127
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,810
When did I say that?

128
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,180
You're the only one who's talking to yourself.

129
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,300
So you've made up?

130
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
-No, not yet.
-What?

131
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,890
I'm grateful too.

132
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,320
I may hate him,

133
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,530
but he did help me.

Now,

135
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,110
I just don't like him.

136
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,220
So, we live our own lives.

137
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,190
That's good.

138
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,130
Since the war is over,

173
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,450
You have to buy him food.

174
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,740
He wants you to repay him.

175
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,360
Darn it.

176
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,310
Don't scold me.

177
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,350
Take it out on him, not me.

178
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,710
Hurry up and pack up, I'm hungry.

179
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,670
Again?

180
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,580
Are you going or not?

181
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,030
I'll leave if you don't.

182
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,810
I'm starving.

183
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,400
Follow me later.

184
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,360
Pay me 40 baht for your dinner.

185
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,600
But I didn't ask you to buy drinks.

186
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,810
Just take it.

187
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,890
Techno kept asking me to buy it for you.

188
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,530
I was annoyed, so I bought it.

189
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,070
Thanks.

190
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,280
Don't act like you're grateful.

191
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,550
In the end, you still want me to repay you.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,390
I have no choice but to do it.

193
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,300
I won't sleep tonight.

194
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,830
I must find out

195
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,460
what you did to me secretly.

196
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,360
I must be crazy.

197
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,690
I thought you were cute.

198
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,140
I hope you won't have nightmares.

199
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,320
Darn it.

200
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,600
Why do I keep thinking about his face?

201
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,810
I'm free after the exam.

202
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,070
I can finally go to the practice.

203
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,960
I'm happy for you.

204
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,160
Do you have any plans after this?

205
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,060
It depends on Type.

206
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,930
If he has no plans,

207
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,790
I'll practice with my sophomore seniors.

208
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,920
What's wrong?

209
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,740
Nothing.

210
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,920
Your "nothing" means "there is something".

211
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,370
Aren't you happy that the exam is over?

212
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,050
I don't want to go back to my room.

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,240
Don't tell me something happened between you and Tharn again.

214
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Type, did you fight with Tharn again?

215
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,730
The semester is almost over.

216
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,020
And you're still arguing?

217
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,430
He...

218
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,960
What?

219
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,390
Why are you not talking?

220
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,150
If you're going to say it, then finish it.

221
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,520
I don't have clairvoyance to read your mind.

222
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,940
I want to move out.

223
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,690
But your dad doesn't allow it.

224
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,760
That's why I'm stressed out,

225
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,230
because my dad doesn't allow it.

226
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,040
To be honest, Type,

227
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,680
you can switch rooms with me.

228
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,120
Switch rooms with him.

229
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,170
Then everything will be over.

230
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,290
It's okay. Thank you.

231
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,650
No problem.

232
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,890
Tell me when you want to change.

233
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,230
I'm going to eat first.

234
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,700
See you later.

235
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,780
To be honest, Type.

236
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,350
If you had a fight with Tharn,

237
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,190
find the source of the problem and solve it.

238
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,450
For example,

239
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,550
you hate him because he's gay.

240
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,990
Just forget that he's gay, then the problem will be solved.

241
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,730
Just like how you

242
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,780
ignore the unpleasant behavior of others.

243
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,390
Got it? It's that simple.

244
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,530
So you're blaming it solely on me?

245
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,720
Of course.

246
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,210
Next time when we go swimming,

247
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,760
I'll drown you.

248
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,760
Just kidding, okay?

249
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,820
Do you have to kill me, really?

250
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,750
I'm going back.

251
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,740
Wait.

252
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,850
You just said you didn't want to go back.

253
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,930
And you're going back now?

254
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,890
None of your business.

255
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,250
What? Wait for me.

256
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,500
What's wrong?

257
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,950
Why are you suddenly smiling?

258
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,890
Did too much studying drive you crazy?

259
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
No.

260
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,680
I'm just thinking about something.

261
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,600
Really?

262
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,570
Do you want to eat with me?

263
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,430
No.

264
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,890
I'm not hungry.

265
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,430
I want to go back to the dorm.

266
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,000
What about you?

267
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,900
Are you going to eat?

268
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,380
No.

269
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,620
You asked as if you were going to eat with me.

270
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,060
You always rush back to the dorm.

271
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,200
I guess you don't care about me anymore.

272
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,140
I saw you with a lot of friends.

273
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,900
You won't be lonely.

274
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,140
What do you know?

275
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,830
I'm so lonely.

276
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,770
It's indeed troublesome

277
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,050
when you're not handsome.

278
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,050
You're a bad friend.

279
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,290
What's wrong?

280
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,620
My pillow.

281
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,790
What are you laughing at?

282
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,110
Whether I laugh or not,

283
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,170
it is my own mouth.

284
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,960
You deserve a beating.

285
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,980
Do you want some?

286
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,440
Don't try to lure me with food.

287
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,680
You can't fool me.

288
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,020
I'm done

289
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,450
if you put something inside.

290
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,760
I won't fall for your trap.

291
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,440
People like me

292
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,680
would never use food as bait to trick you.

293
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
You have a sharp tongue.

294
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,740
I'm not only good at talking.

295
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm going to take a shower.

296
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,480
Where are my underwear?

297
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,650
My pants!

298
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,790
Don't mess with me, Tharn.

299
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,260
Give it back.

300
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,190
I can give it back to you.

301
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,850
But you have to let me take a bath with you.

302
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,260
What are you talking about?

303
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,370
You smell good.

304
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,350
What are you doing?

305
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,670
What are you doing?

306
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,190
Let go of me, Tharn!

307
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,050
I told you

308
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,220
that I'm not only good at talking.

309
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,940
Bastard!

310
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,020
Wash it for me.

311
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,810
Gosh, this is bad.

312
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,680
You don't like him, you hate him!

313
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,860
Open the door, Type.

314
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,740
I said open the door.

315
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,900
Have a good dream, Type.

316
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,800
But just now...

317
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,600
You're really...

318
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,160
Great.

319
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,930
Don't mess with me anymore.

320
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,000
Next time, it won't be just a punch.

321
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,790
Then next time,

322
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:38,220
don't ask me for help again.

323
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,520
I didn't ask you.

324
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,690
Are you addicted to me?

325
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,140
Screw you!

326
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,010
[I'll pick you up late today, Tar.]

327
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,520
[Class just finished.]

328
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,830
[The traffic is so bad.]

329
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,340
It's easy to buy a movie premiere ticket.

330
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:28,750
Okay, see you in half an hour.

331
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,740
Okay. See you later, beauty.

332
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,110
Is that the guy from the French class you mentioned?

333
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,660
Yes.

334
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,140
Hey.

335
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,160
Exchange.

336
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,070
Photos of Techno getting his balls scratched, right?

337
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,530
Hurry up.

338
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,190
Sent.

339
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,330
Check it.

340
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,750
Did you get it?

341
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,650
What's so good about No?

342
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,460
I really don't understand why you're so obsessed with him.

343
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,920
Yeah.

344
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,810
I think No

345
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,300
makes me realize that I can really love someone.

346
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,940
Without him,

347
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,910
the world would be boring.

348
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,860
I want to throw up.

349
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,040
Are you crazy?

350
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,410
Haven't you heard of love at first sight?

351
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,370
[I'm at school.]

352
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:43,710
[Where are you?]

353
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,210
It's all your fault.

354
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,130
She has been waiting for me for 10 minutes.

355
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,760
Just a moment.

356
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,040
I just went to get the book.

357
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm serious about this girl.

358
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,270
It took me a lot of effort to get her contact.

359
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,770
She's just a girl. I can find another one for you.

360
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,620
You little...

361
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,870
Hey, are you coming?

362
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,370
Yes.

363
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,630
Hurry up.

364
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,440
Let's go.

365
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:52,820
[I'm already home, Brother Tum.]

366
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:21,960
Tar!

367
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,790
Open the door for me!

368
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,570
I said open the door!

369
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,469
Don't force me to get the key.

370
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,830
Come out and talk with me.

371
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,170
Why didn't you wait for me at school?

372
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,580
I was so worried, you know?

373
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,100
If I waited for you, I wouldn't be home yet.

374
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,810
Tar!

375
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,960
Tell me if you're busy.

376
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,790
I can go home by myself.

377
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,080
Didn't I tell you that I can pick you up?

378
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,590
I told you there was a traffic jam.

379
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,190
Why didn't you wait at school?

380
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,420
Okay, I'm sorry.

381
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,100
How about this?

382
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,650
Next time,

383
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,960
if I can't pick you up on time,

384
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,940
I'll call you.

385
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,620
But you have to answer my call no matter what.

386
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,640
Whatever you're doing, answer it.

387
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm worried about you, you know?

388
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,720
All right, I'll leave you alone.

389
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,660
Have a good rest.

390
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,510
Come on.

391
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,800
Focus on training.

392
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,440
Don't forget, you are my most important team members.

393
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,420
Why didn't you tell Type?

394
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,150
I haven't seen him ever since I came.

395
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,990
All right, focus on your practice.

396
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,460
Who dares to order him around?

397
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,320
If you have the time to shout,

398
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,590
go practice, No.

399
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,880
Well, as you know,

400
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,990
my football skills are unbeatable.

401
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:14,140
Remember, I'm born with talent.

402
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,470
Just wait and see, Type.

403
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,440
The future me

404
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,010
will definitely be the leader.

405
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,100
Are you daydreaming?

406
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,330
This is for you.

407
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,800
Wake up, No.

408
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,610
You? Captain?

409
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,190
Yes.

410
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,890
Don't say that.

411
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,590
No is serious.

412
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,200
Yes.

413
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,220
He says it 100 times a day.

414
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,360
Whatever.

415
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,980
But when we're in our senior year,

416
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,810
we need a new captain.

417
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,220
All of you must vote for me, understand?

418
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,050
Are you canvassing for votes now?

419
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,450
You're too serious.

420
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,450
Look at my mouth.

421
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,120
I'm serious. I'm super serious.

422
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,980
Do you want me to wake you up?

423
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,810
You've been picking on me.

424
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,550
What's wrong with you this time?

425
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,540
Never mind.

426
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,070
Did you fight with your roommate again, Type?

427
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,810
You two always fight.

428
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,460
Tharn and Type had a fight.

429
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,840
Why didn't I know?

430
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,070
I don't know either.

431
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,310
I don't know either.

432
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,480
I don't know either.

433
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,920
Nothing.

434
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,740
No is talking nonsense.

435
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,700
I'm leaving.

436
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,610
I'll go with you.

437
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,260
Bye.

438
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,450
What's going on?

439
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,520
He just comes and goes as he likes.

440
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,410
Did you fight with Tharn?

441
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,680
No, I was just thinking.

442
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,170
-Are you sure?
-Hello, dear Techno.

443
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,690
-Hello.
-How are you?

444
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:55,660
I'm fine. What about you?

445
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,980
Very good.

446
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,640
I'm here.

447
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,250
Your friend?

448
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,720
Yes, he's my friend. His name is Type.

449
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,020
He's the perfect one.

450
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,340
His skin and body are shining.

451
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,630
-We came here right.
-Yes.

452
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,670
Ah.

453
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,420
You've been praising my friend since we met.

454
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,180
Aren't you going to praise me?

455
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,950
We'd like to praise you,

456
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,980
but you're already in the past, Techno.

457
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,820
We want to try something fresh, right?

458
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,300
Fresh?

459
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,590
Looks like you'll be beaten today.

460
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,430
That's too much.

461
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,730
Kiss me later if you're going to hit me.

462
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,070
I'll hit you. You kiss me, okay?

463
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,280
Kiss?

464
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,830
To her, kissing isn't enough.

465
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,790
She needs to go to bed and go wild, right?

466
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,150
Wild.

467
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:51,950
No,

468
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,220
I'm leaving.

469
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,200
Okay.

470
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,740
Wait, give me some time.

471
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,760
We're admins of the school's handsome guys webpage.

472
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,250
We want to upload your photos, alright?

473
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,940
We want to take a photo for you.

474
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,960
We need your name,

475
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,660
IG account and phone number.

476
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,890
So we can publish it.

477
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,840
I promise, your figure

478
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,690
-will drive the girls crazy.
-Very...

479
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,740
Especially...

480
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:20,900
Your muscular arms are perfect.

481
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,110
Stop it.

482
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,570
Find someone else.

483
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,560
Just for a moment, just one photo.

484
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,030
-Give me the camera.
-Wait.

485
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,480
Is he handsome?

486
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,300
-Yes.
-There are many more handsome boys in our university.

487
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,280
Find someone else.

488
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,130
-He’s good enough.
-Find someone else.

489
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,330
-Techno, come here.
-Just one photo.

490
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,850
-Let's take a photo.
-It's just a photo.

491
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,160
Look at the camera.

492
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,360
-Again.
-Okay.

493
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,750
Another angle.

494
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,330
Okay, I got it.

495
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,290
-Take a photo for me.
-Go.

496
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,560
Yes, that's it. It's perfect.

497
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,310
-Sister.
-Good. I think it's good.

498
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,580
Again.

499
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,020
Raise your hands higher.

500
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,950
I think it's enough.

501
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,840
Let go of me!

502
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,110
Mom!

503
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,920
-Stay away, sissy.
-What's wrong with him?

504
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,090
Damn it, I hate you guys.

505
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,570
Did my sissy give you a headache, punk?

506
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:16,020
Not at all.

507
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,660
But it makes me sick

508
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,870
to breathe the same air as you.

509
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,650
You've gone too far.

510
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,880
It's just a photo.

511
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,740
Is that too much?

512
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,680
I apologize on behalf of my friend.

513
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,180
He didn't mean it, that's how he talked.

514
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,290
-Calm down.
-Why are you apologizing?

515
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,080
This kind of harassment

516
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,680
is not something you can do to anyone.

517
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,900
-Hey, how could you say that?
-Calm down, okay?

518
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,600
Just stay where you are, Type.

519
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,590
Please.

520
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,250
Please calm down.

521
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,190
Techno.

522
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,300
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

523
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,330
Trust me. He didn't mean it.

524
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,820
He's discriminating.

525
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,800
What's wrong with being sissy? Is sissy not human?

526
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,200
Tell your friend, Techno.

527
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,860
It won't end so easily.

528
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,650
If he wants to mess with sissies,

529
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,130
we'll show him the power of LGBTQ.

530
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,090
I'm begging you, sis.

531
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,550
Can't we talk?

532
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,110
What's going on?

533
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,010
Darn it, Type.

534
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,740
What's wrong with being gay?

535
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,020
We're just going on a mission

536
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,890
to find the handsome guys, as usual.

537
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:24,810
We heard that the freshmen this year are handsome.

538
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,970
It takes a glance

539
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:29,830
to make women and gays faint.

540
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,040
But something unexpected happened.

541
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,810
We just went to greet him,

542
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,810
and asked for a photo to upload it.

543
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,490
Not only did he reject us ruthlessly,

544
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,160
but he also looked down on LGBTQ.

545
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,800
They called us monsters,

546
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,750
and attacked us.

547
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,250
But it's okay. We don't blame him.

548
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,710
I'll leave his photo in the comments section.

549
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,740
But please don't follow him.

550
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,020
It might really be our fault.

551
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,750
What are you looking at?

552
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,540
Haven't you seen humans before?

553
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,330
Type.

554
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,410
You're such a jerk, Type.

555
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,290
How could you scold a senior?

556
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,140
He's not a jerk, I think he's right.

557
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,620
They are monsters.

558
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,970
I'm so happy to see that.

559
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,120
Hey, don't say that. They didn't do anything to you.

560
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,170
They did nothing?

561
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,690
They exposed our friends online.

562
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,260
Hey!

563
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,630
Calm down.

564
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,100
Type.

565
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,980
Aren't you going to say something?

566
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,480
Type.

567
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,210
This is serious.

568
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:43,860
What's wrong, No?

569
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,160
How can you be so calm?

570
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,540
Everything is a mess.

571
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:48,860
Look.

572
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,190
What happened that day is posted on the school's notice board.

573
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,020
Got it?

574
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,100
Wait.

575
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,980
Aren't you going to apologize?

576
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,210
What about you?

577
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,500
Have you ever thought of apologizing to me?

578
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,370
What did you say to them?

579
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,480
I like him.

580
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,910
Really? You like that jerk?

581
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:36,830
Yes.

582
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,490
Why did you do that?

583
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,550
Is it wrong to care about someone you like?

584
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,790
What is it?

585
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,580
Why won't you let me go home?

586
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,130
Sleep with me.
