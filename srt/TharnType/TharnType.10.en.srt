Nothing.

Why are you so surprised?

Who are you talking to?

I'm talking about work with Lhong.

Okay, then.

00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,750
I won't betray you.

You feel guilty, don't you?

What should we eat?

12
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:06,290
I have to finish my assignment.

13
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,070
Take your assignment with you, then.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,900
You're my husband. You have to obey me.

How is it, honey?

16

Do you want to come with me?

17
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,280
What do you want to eat, honey?

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,640
Your husband will get it for you.

Aren't you?

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,530
All right, go eat with me first.

00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,310
Hi.

31
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,740
You are...

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,380
A friend of Tharn?

33
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,280
You can't even remember my name?

34
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,150
I'm...

35
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,780
-Your boyfriend's best friend.
-Lhong the punk.

36
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,290
Just call me Lhong.

37
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,820
That's me.

The most handsome lead vocalist in the band.

39
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,980
I heard that you're not as popular as the drummer.

40
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,270
So cruel.

41
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,340
It really hurts.

42
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,370
Don't overreact.

43
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,260
I'm going to tell Tharn that you teased me.

44
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,350
Go ahead and see who he'll side with.

45
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,680
You want to play it this way, huh?

46
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,750
Then I'll lose for sure.

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,450
How about this?

48
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,430
You treat me to a meal, and in exchange,

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,040
I'll tell you about Tharn.

50

I just bought a guitar.

I can't even afford a meal now.

About Tharn?

Yes, I know everything about him.

What do you want to know? Go ahead.

62
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,080
I know everything,

63
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,090
especially

64
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,850
about his ex.

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,950
Why should I know about his ex?

66
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,560
His ex is a legend.

67
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,990
He has dated every grade.

68
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,530
But none of them lasted.

69
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,630
Maybe he's cursed.

70
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,300
What curse?

71
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,909
We're doing fine, though.

72
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,520
You're the one who broke the curse,

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,670
if we don't count San.

74
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,340
Do you know him too?

75
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,710
Yes.

76
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,560
If we excluded him,

77
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,360
every ex of Tharn was a punk.

78
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,080
His probably started dating

79
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,330
his first boyfriend in the first year of high school.

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,700
He was a sophomore. He was very handsome.

81
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,610
He majors in violin.

82
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,290
But

83
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,900
Tharn found out

84
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,770
that he was five-timing.

85
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,790
You heard me right.

86
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,850
Five-timing.

87
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,060
He was even the sugar baby of a big shot.

88
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,730
And Tharn said

89
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,060
that he's lucky that he's not contracted any diseases.

90
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:35,510
But at that time, he had a total breakdown.

91
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,970
Then,

92
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,140
the two-month curse started.

93
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,680
What's a two-month curse?

94
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,810
Hello, I'd like to order a drink.

95
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,320
-What would you like?
-What do you want?

96
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,390
No, thanks.

97
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,020
Then...

98
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,350
-I want Sprite.
-Okay.

99
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,380
Thank you.

100
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,640
Because...

101
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,840
He hasn't dated anyone for more than two months since then.

102
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,410
Either his partner had an affair

103
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,230
or he was dumped.

104
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,280
And they all broke up because of ridiculous reasons.

105
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,460
For example, they said that he's too nice.

106
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,270
For some time, he became very promiscuous.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,620
He would agree with whoever was asking

108
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,690
to have sex with him,

109
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,720
until he met

110
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,240
Tar.

111
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,940
Who?

112
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,670
Tar.

113
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,360
The younger brother of my former bandmate.

114
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,659
He's cute and skinny.

115
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,220
He had a crush on Tharn.

116
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,200
He said that he fell in love with Tharn

117
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,100
the first time he saw him playing drums.

118
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,159
So he mustered up his courage and confessed to him.

119
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,080
Like a romance manga,

120
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,040
he confessed in front of all the people in the bar.

121
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,770
Then they

122
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,620
had sex.

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,230
You sure you didn't skip some steps?

124
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,700
It's true, they had sex.

125
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,030
During that time, Tharn's world was all pink.

126
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,539
He even wrote a song for Tar.

127
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,929
So sweet that it was rotting my tooth.

128
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,640
What's next?

129
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
And then,

130
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,920
they broke up.

131
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,860
It was over.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,140
How could it end like this?

133
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,600
They really broke up.

134
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,510
No, I mean, why did they break up?

135
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,220
Was that guy seeing someone else?

136
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,700
Or was Tharn sick of him?

137
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,840
Or what?

138
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,020
You can't just end it like this.

139
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,220
I don't know.

140
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,700
Tharn told me that they broke up.

141
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,090
Tum beat him up and said he hurt his brother.

142
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,650
As for Tar,

143
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,040
he never showed up in front of Tharn again.

144
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,330
He loved him so much that he wrote him a song. Why did they break up?

145
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,680
Well,

146
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,350
in the end,

147
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,100
you're the one with Tharn, right?

148
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,290
If you want to know more details,

149
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,770
you can ask Tharn.

150
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,200
But most importantly,

151
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,110
don't let him know that I told you these things.

152
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,280
I don't want him to nag me,

153
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,370
saying that I give his beloved boyfriend a headache.

154
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,380
I'm going to tell him that you, the foodie,

155
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,650
sold him out in exchange for food.

156
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,730
I know you won't do this to me.

157
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,360
Right?

158
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,040
Why aren't you eating?

159
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,750
I'll eat it if you're not eating.

160
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,600
You...

161
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,090
You have a big appetite.

162
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,110
I'm not fat anyway.

163
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,580
Brother Tharn,

164
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,970
can I sit here?

165
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,840
Tar, I'm leaving.

166
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,400
Wait, Brother Tharn. I have something to tell you.

167
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,170
But I have nothing to say with you.

168
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm busy, so I'll get going.

169
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,990
Brother Tharn, wait.

170
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,980
In the past,

171
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,800
we held hands like this too.

172
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,440
What is it?

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,650
I have something to tell you.

174
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,440
You must be mad at me, right?

175
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,410
I'm not mad at you anymore.

176
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,330
It's been a year, Tar.

177
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,160
Don't think too much.

178
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,360
I'm sorry for how I treated you.

179
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,130
If you have anything to say, just tell me.

180
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,500
I told you that I have work to do.

181
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,480
Well...

182
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,880
I don't know what to say.

183
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,190
And I don't know how to explain it to you.

184
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,200
But I have my own reasons for everything I've done.

185
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,510
When you've made up your mind,

186
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,730
say it to Tum, and let him tell me.

187
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,210
I'm leaving.

188
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,620
I never wanted to break up with you.

189
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,920
Why are you telling me this now?

190
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,100
Tar.

191
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,880
It's okay.

192
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,530
Sorry, Tar.

193
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:15,970
It's okay.

194
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,740
I never wanted to break up with you.

195
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,110
Then why did you break up with me?

196
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,150
I can't tell you.

197
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,320
But I have my reasons.

198
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,680
Is it hard to tell me the truth?

199
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,510
Or did I do something bad to you

200
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,820
that you wanted to break up with me?

201
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,330
I really can't tell you.

202
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,300
But...

203
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,030
Please forgive me, Brother Tharn.

204
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,350
What if I say...

205
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,770
No?

206
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,120
I'll keep apologizing to you

207
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,130
until you forgive me, then.

208
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,480
Why are you doing this?

209
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,280
What do you want?

210
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,390
Let's get back together.

211
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,760
I love you.

212
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,360
No matter now or then, I've always loved you.

213
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,840
Please give me another chance to make it up.

214
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,290
-Tar, I...
-Don't reject me first.

215
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,220
Please give me another chance to make it up.

216
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,770
[Type]

217
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,760
Tar, I have to go.

218
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,230
Brother Tharn.

219
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,360
Brother Tharn.

220
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,220
It's so hot.

221
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,910
You're back.

222
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,520
Yes, I've been back for a while.

223
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,400
Are you hungry?

224
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,040
I bought you food.

225
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,370
Of course I'm hungry.

226
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,700
But let me take a shower first.

227
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,280
Tharn.

228
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,550
Are you throwing a party?

229
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,860
Whose birthday is it today?

230
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,570
My birthday is April 2nd.

231
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,730
Tharn.

232
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,580
Don't hug me. I'm hot.

233
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,040
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,290
What's wrong?

235
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,120
If you're sorry because you bought too much,

236
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,610
next time, you can just buy as much as we need.

237
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,890
I'm sorry, Type.

238
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,200
What's wrong with you?

239
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,210
You keep saying sorry.

240
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,650
Did you do something bad behind my back?

241
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,980
No.

242
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,810
I just think that,

243
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,030
recently,

244
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't have much time to accompany you.

245
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,900
You think too much.

246
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,800
Don't worry about these trivial things anymore.

247
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,010
I know you’re busy with the band.

248
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,330
I’m also busy with the soccer team.

249
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,150
You sound like you're blaming me if you say that you're wrong

250
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,300
because you don’t have time for me.

251
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,330
I didn't mean to blame you.

252
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,470
So...

253
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,600
Do you want to eat?

254
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,840
Of course I'll eat it since you already bought it.

255
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,500
Just pick one or two later.

256
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,040
And put the rest in the fridge.

257
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,560
I love you so much, Type.

258
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,930
Don't say that too often.

259
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,420
It's not that valuable if you say it too much.

260
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,770
I'll take a shower first.

261
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:21,870
Type.

262
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,250
Why are you so cute?

263
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,620
Okay, I'm going to take a shower.

264
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,150
Tar.

265
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,800
Stop it.

266
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,730
I won't get back together with you.

267
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,400
I'm really sorry, Brother Tharn.

268
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,640
I really need to tell you something.

269
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,570
Go ahead.

270
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,290
I have a new boyfriend.

271
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,620
And I love him very much.

272
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,740
As for us,

273
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,120
it was over.

274
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,590
It ended last year.

275
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,410
Stop mentioning the past.

276
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,750
You can understand me, right?

277
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,390
If you really love me,

278
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,160
don't do it again.

279
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,430
Break up.

280
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,630
What?

281
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,090
You will break up eventually.

282
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,930
It won't last long.

283
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,210
Never.

284
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,260
Tar.

285
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,100
Why did you say that?

286
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,040
Tar? Hello?

287
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,360
Tharn.

288
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,220
What were you shouting just now?

289
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,990
Are you okay?

290
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,020
Who were you talking to?

291
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,740
Well...

292
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,020
I had a fight with Lhong.

293
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,490
What about you?

294
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,920
Why aren't you taking a shower?

295
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,940
There's no soap.

296
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,670
I told you that the soap

297
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,130
should be stored in the bathroom cabinet.

298
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,730
Where did you put them?

299
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,190
Sorry.

300
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,320
I'll get it for you.

301
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,800
Okay.

302
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,150
Tar.

303
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:16,000
Do you want some after I pack the food?

304
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,580
Tar.

305
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,660
Tar.

306
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,690
Do you want some after I pack the food?

307
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,010
Tar.

308
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,030
-Tar!
-Yes?

309
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I'm asking

310
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,890
if you want some after I pack the food?

311
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,380
No, thanks.

312
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,530
I'll take a shower first.

313
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:19,920
Tar!

314
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,040
Tar!

315
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,190
Tar!

316
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,780
Tar!

317
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:43,560
Tar!

318
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,950
Tar!

319
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,960
Tar!

320
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,730
What's wrong?

321
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,870
Tar! Tar! Tar!

322
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,070
Tar! Tar!

323
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,510
Tar!

324
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,660
Tar, look at me! Tar!

325
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,420
Look at me, Tar.

326
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,210
Hold on for me.

327
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,710
Tar! Tar! Tar!

328
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,720
Tar! Tar!

329
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,280
Tar, what's wrong?

330
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,250
Tar!

331
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,450
Tar!

332
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,610
Tar, are you okay?

333
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,880
Look at me, Tar! Tar!

334
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,900
Tar!

335
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,880
Look at me.

336
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,850
Look at me, Tar.

337
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,720
Look at me.

338
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,210
Tar!

339
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,180
Brother Tum.

340
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,330
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,640
I'm a bad guy.

342
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,060
You will never be a bad guy.

343
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,590
You will never be a bad guy.

344
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,600
You know what?

345
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,260
You are

346
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,750
the most important person to me in my life.

347
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,460
How can I live without you?

348
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,700
Stop it.

349
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,280
Don't do this again.

350
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,090
Sorry.

351
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,510
Tar.

352
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm sorry.

353
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,210
Tharn, I'm tired.

354
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,830
Okay.

355
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,610
I'll get you some food.

356
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,060
I'll leave it here.

357
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,210
Tharn.

358
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,840
I'm thirsty.

359
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:30,210
My feet hurt after running all day. I don't want to get up.

360
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,800
I'll get you some water.

361
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,130
Here.

362
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,380
I...

363
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,320
Your hand is sore. You don't have the strength to hold a spoon.

364
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,340
Do you want me to feed you?

365
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,140
You really know me now.

366
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,020
And now,

367
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,070
you like to act cute too.

368
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,310
Who's acting cute, punk?

369
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:40,210
Then why did you ask me to feed you? What's with that?

370
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,560
Annoying.

371
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,690
I'll give you a slap later.

372
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,850
Oh, right, Tharn.

373
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,230
I have something to ask you.

374
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,610
What is it?

375
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,650
We are using the same shampoo,

376
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,090
but why is your hair so soft?

377
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,340
Look at my hair. It's so rough.

378
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,880
You play soccer under the sun, remember?

379
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,920
I rarely get under the sun. That's why it is soft, I guess.

380
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,460
What's wrong with you?

381
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,650
Are you happy?

382
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,380
Are you happy to rub me with your hair?

383
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,330
I'm not just happy,

384
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,920
I'm over the moon.

385
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,800
So cheesy.

386
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,690
I admit

387
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,740
that I'm happy too.

388
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,630
Don't die this time.

389
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,560
Tharn. Tharn.

390
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,260
Sit here.

391
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,110
Tum.

392
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,070
Who has a powerbank? My battery is running out.

393
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:22,860
I'm going to die again.

394
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,140
I have a request.

395
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,870
I have nothing to say to you.

396
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,030
It's related to your brother.

397
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,490
I'm not looking for trouble.

398
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,240
But your brother called me a few days ago.

399
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,270
I don't believe it.

400
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,810
Oh, my God.

401
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,730
Calm down, you two.

402
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,880
It's impossible that my brother is looking for you.

403
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,080
This

404
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
is your brother's new number, right?

405
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,770
Why are you still in touch with Tar?

406
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,410
I didn't contact him.

407
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,390
-He's the one that contacted me.
-I don't believe it.

408
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,940
My brother wouldn't have looked for a punk like you.

409
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,770
Calm down, you two.

410
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,260
We are in the classroom.

411
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,050
Tum.

412
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:28,600
I'm begging you.

413
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,370
Let's talk outside.

414
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,280
Okay.

415
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,770
Do you want me to come with you?

416
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,310
You stay here.

417
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,400
I don't believe Tar will contact you.

418
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,130
Believe it or not.

419
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,230
But I need to talk to him.

420
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,920
Impossible.

421
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,300
I don't understand

422
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,140
why you hate me so much.

423
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,240
But I swear to God,

424
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,820
I've never hurt your brother.

425
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,770
Also,

426
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,300
Tar came begging me to get back together with him.

427
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,360
I don't believe it.

428
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,610
You have no idea

429
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,430
what has happened to Tar.

430
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,400
He refused to eat

431
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,020
or sleep.

432
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,880
He refused to go to school.

433
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,440
We had to take him to a psychologist.

434
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,010
But he still wouldn't say anything.

435
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,840
Do you know

436
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,910
how heartbroken I am

437
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,850
to see Tar in pain

438
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,510
because of someone like you?

439
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,489
Don't tell me

440
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,370
-that you are...
-It's none of your business.

441
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,030
Remember,

442
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,300
no matter how you beg,

443
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,739
I won't let you see Tar again.

444
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,090
Can you draw me a picture

445
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,310
when you feel like drawing again?

446
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,020
Sure.

447
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,630
I'll draw it for you.

448
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,970
I need to talk to Song.

449
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,330
Okay.

450
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,120
Type.

451
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,560
I'll go to Jeed's bar later.

452
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,810
I thought you were not performing today?

453
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,560
Because

454
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,760
my junior invited me over.

455
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:18,310
If you're not hungry yet,

456
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,970
let's have dinner at 10, okay?

457
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,010
Get lost, I'm starving right now.

458
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,660
Who asked you to kiss my face?

459
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,020
Wait for me.

460
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,390
If I can't kiss your face, I can kiss your lips, right?

461
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,050
Then...

462
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,030
I'm leaving.

463
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,640
Be a good boy and wait for me for dinner.

464
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,520
Bye.

465
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,060
Do you think I'll wait at home

466
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,470
like a fool?

467
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,050
Dream on.

468
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,740
[Bar]

469
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,520
Here we go. Three drinks for two.

470
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,240
Don't get too drunk. Take care.

471
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,750
-Tharn.
-Hello, Sister Jeed.

472
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,510
Hello.

473
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,110
What are you doing here? You're not performing tonight, right?

474
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,760
I'm meeting someone.

475
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,600
Where's that cute guy with big eyes? He didn't come with you?

476
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,870
No.

477
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,070
By the way, I saw Tum and Tar

478
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,540
in the bar today.

479
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,540
I don't want you to fight.

480
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,840
I know you've broken up.

481
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,690
We won't fight. It is Tum who asked me to come.

482
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:56,750
Okay, I'm relieved to hear that.

483
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,800
You guys won't fight, right?

484
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,330
Yes.

485
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:58,880
That's good.

486
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,310
I'll go serve the guests.

487
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,860
Okay.

488
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,200
Tar.

489
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,100
Brother Tharn.

490
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,000
Don't sit next to my brother.

491
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,250
And don't sit next to me either.

492
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,840
Brother Tum,

493
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,750
please don't be like this.

494
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,590
Tar.

495
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,140
Yes?

496
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,920
You know why I want to see you, right?

497
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,140
Why did you say

498
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,460
I would break up with my boyfriend for sure?

499
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,840
What are you thinking?

500
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,330
Even though we used to be together,

501
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,980
I don't like what you said.

502
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:21,290
I came to you today

503
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,850
not because I wanted to see you,

504
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,940
but because...

505
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,920
I want to know why you said that.

506
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm sorry.

507
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,450
I'm sorry.

508
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,740
This would be my last time seeing you.

509
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,180
If you have anything to say,

510
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,120
just say it now.

511
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,520
I can't.

512
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,890
Brother Tharn.

513
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,410
Please trust me for once.

514
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,970
What do you want me to believe?

515
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,790
I want you to believe that I love you.

516
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,460
I really love you.

517
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,310
But I don't love you anymore.

518
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,250
I know.

519
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,490
But I just want to tell you that I love you.

520
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,070
I really love you, Brother Tharn.

521
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,240
Sister Jeed, who is that?

522
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:34,380
Type, calm down.

523
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,360
Maybe it's not what you think.

524
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:38,820
Let me tell you.

525
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,770
He's the younger brother of Tharn's former bandmate.

526
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,150
They must be discussing something.

527
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,880
It's nothing. Don't think too much.

528
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,050
I'll get going.

529
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,580
Don't tell him I was here.

530
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,780
I'll talk to him when he's back.

531
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,950
Calm down.

532
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,730
Hey, Lhong.

533
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,830
Tell me everything you know

534
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,310
about Tharn's ex.

535
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,210
Stop crying.

536
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,000
This

537
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,550
would be my last time seeing you.

538
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,830
But

539
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,490
if you really love me,

540
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,710
please respect my decision.

541
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,980
I don't want to have any conflict with my boyfriend.

542
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,920
Okay.

543
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,010
I wish you happiness.

544
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,300
Don't be like me and you.

545
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:31,460
I'm leaving.

546
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,380
Good luck, Tar.

547
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,360
You're finally back.

548
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,130
What's wrong?

549
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:33,830
Why are you sitting here without lights on?

550
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,770
Where have you been?

551
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,670
I went to Jeed's bar.

552
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,070
Who did you meet?

553
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:45,950
Song.

554
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,680
I'll give you one more chance.

555
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,340
Who did you meet?

556
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,380
I went to see Tar.

557
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,760
He is

558
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,230
the younger brother of my former bandmate.

559
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,540
Why didn't you tell me

560
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,600
that he was your ex?

561
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,900
You must be surprised why I know it, right?

562
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,970
Because I'm not a fool.

563
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,310
How could I not know?

564
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,650
You're lying to me.

565
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,440
How could I not know?

566
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,590
You're acting suspiciously.

567
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:45,130
How was it?

568
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,730
Does that kid taste

569
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,090
as delicious as before?

570
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,930
Did he satisfy you?

571
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,870
After all, you haven't seen each other for a year.

572
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,330
Type.

573
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,470
What?

574
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,770
What do you want to say?

575
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,190
Did I say something wrong?

576
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,710
He was crying like that in front of you.

577
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,230
Or are you going to tell me

578
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,320
that the promiscuous Tharn

579
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,770
is incapable now?

580
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,930
It's not what you think.

581
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,990
There's nothing between us.

582
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,530
You want me to believe someone who lied to me?

583
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,560
Why don't you deny it now?

584
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,050
Say something!

585
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,670
Answer me.

586
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,230
I'm sorry.

587
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,400
But there's nothing between us.

588
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:56,880
Okay, I trust you.

589
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,720
I believe there's nothing between you and him.

590
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,230
Because you won't finish in such a short time.

591
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,090
But do you have feelings for him?

592
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,510
Answer me.

593
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,080
Do you have feelings for him?

594
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,550
As long as you say no,

595
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,150
I will believe you.

596
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:29,910
Answer me.

597
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,590
I love you the most, Type.

598
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:58,480
You want me to believe someone

599
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,610
who dares not answer my question?

600
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,480
I really didn't do anything.

601
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,490
I swear to God,

602
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,380
I won't see Tar again.

603
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,790
I don't want to hear his name in this house.

604
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,390
Type!

605
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,070
Let go of me!

606
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,040
-Where are you going?
-It's none of your business.

607
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,290
Brother.

608
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,190
What are you doing?

609
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:57,710
-It's a golden mask. Don't you know?
-Is this the right time?

610
00:50:58,460 --> 00:50:59,840
Skin care is important.

611
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,550
Pay attention to Type first, will you?

612
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,090
What's wrong with him?

613
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,350
Gosh.

614
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,090
Don't chime in when the adults are talking.

615
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:15,780
How cruel.

616
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,710
Anyway,

617
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:21,560
let him sleep at our house tonight.

618
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,410
Understand?

619
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:24,350
Okay.

620
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:31,880
Type.

621
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,980
Did you fight with Tharn?

622
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,120
Let him sleep in my room later.

623
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,890
♫I miss the time when we looked into each other's eyes♫

624
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:16,690
♫Don't need to say a word♫

625
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,040
♫The way you look at me♫

♫Tells me you love me♫

♫Do you think the same about those good times?♫

628
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:34,270
♫Should I keep it in my heart♫

629
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:40,940
♫Or should I tell you?♫

630
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,640
♫I've now made the decision♫

631
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:23,820

♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

641
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,750
I brought you some water.

642
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:50,490
Type.

643
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,310
I don't want to get involved between you two.

644
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,710
But

645
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,260
I have something to tell you.

646
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,140
A few days ago,

647
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,320
I didn't go to practice.

648
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,350
And I saw Tharn at the mall.

649
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,840
I'm not sure

650
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,660
if it's related.

651
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:27,580
But did you run away from home

652
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:31,950
because of a fair-skinned high school student?

653
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,110
What?

654
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:45,340
I went shopping that day,

655
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,660
and I happened to see Tharn with that high school student.

656
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,980
At first, I thought he was Tharn's junior.

657
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,770
But after a closer look, I realized

658
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,560
that the high school student was wearing a uniform from Nic's school.

659
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:13,710
No.

660
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,190
What?

661
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,510
You said that kid went to the same school as Nic, right?

662
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,610
Don't tell me you're...

663
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:27,220
That's right. I'm going to find him.

664
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,570
Gosh.

665
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,900
Is there any other way, Type?

666
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,690
No.

667
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,080
Just wait and see.
