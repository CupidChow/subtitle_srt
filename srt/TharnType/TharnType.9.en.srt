2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,820
San, what are you doing?

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,660
Type!

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,600
Let go of me!

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,100
I said let go of me!

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,260
I'll kill him!

7
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,910
Type, calm down.

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,390
You misunderstood.

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,630
What did I misunderstand?

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,270
I saw it with my own eyes.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,130
Do you think I'm a fool?

12
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,010
What did you see?

13
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,270
I saw you two kissing.

14
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,760
Why are you laughing?

15
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,590
I'm laughing at you.

16
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,610
Aren't you saying you were just roommates?

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,200
You said you have nothing to do with Tharn.

18
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,730
Then why are you so anxious now?

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,730
San.

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,130
Enough.

21
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:43,960
Stop it.

22
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,260
I haven't done anything yet.

23
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,660
I'm just saying what I saw.

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,210
I respect you as my senior,

25
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,380
but if you make him misunderstand,

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,810
I won't save your face either.

27
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,290
I haven't done anything yet.

28
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,270
He told me he had nothing to do with you.

29
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,120
That's why I have the right to do so.

30
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,890
You have no right.

31
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,670
Go back.

32
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,070
And thank you

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,780
for bringing me my car.

34
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,650
Tharn, let go of me!

35
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,840
Type, calm down. You misunderstood.

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,910
Let go of me!

37
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,810
He's mine.

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,110
Tharn is mine.

39
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,810
Do you hear me?

40
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,920
He's taken.

41
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,100
That's right.

42
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,550
I'm yours.

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,530
What are you laughing about?

44
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,930
Tharn,

45
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,200
I brought you the car all the way here.

46
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
Aren't you going to invite me to your house?

47
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,200
Or do you want others to see

48
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,060
a gay couple fighting here?

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,010
I hate your senior.

50
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,990
[TharnType]

51
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,130
[TharnType]

52
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,730
Type.

53
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,160
San kissed me

54
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,790
because

55
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,180
he was here to pass me the car.

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,710
You let him kiss you just because he brought you the car?

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
He was just kidding.

58
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,000
I swear to God.

59
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,140
I already have you.

60
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,270
I won't look for anyone else.

61
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,110
You'd better not get caught by me.

62
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,670
Type.

63
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,080
You actually dare to admit it, though.

64
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,360
What do you mean?

65
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,030
About the fact that you're dating Tharn.

66
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,140
I thought you would keep running away from the truth.

67
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,060
I'm not.

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,150
But you're a selfish guy.

69
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,090
Thorn told me that you were in trouble before.

70
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,370
Me?

71
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,580
What trouble?

72
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,680
The last time you went home,

73
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,100
you seemed sullen.

74
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,970
That's why I wanted to see

75
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,080
the one who made Mr. Tharn upset.

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,340
I wonder what he looks like.

77
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,980
I knew he was a trouble maker

78
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,270
the moment I saw him.

79
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,800
I'm a trouble maker?

80
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,920
You don't want to admit that you're dating Tharn.

81
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,730
If something goes wrong, it's always Tharn who solves it.

82
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,790
You think you're always right, and keep causing trouble.

83
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,830
Why should I announce to others

84
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,410
that I'm dating a man?

85
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,430
I'm not asking you to announce it.

86
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,090
I just want you to learn to care about his feelings.

87
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,540
Because he's usually straightforward and would just speak what's on his mind.

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,360
But Thorn said he wasn't able to say anything this time.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,640
Because his partner wants to keep it a secret.

90
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,570
In the end, he's always considerate of you.

91
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,670
San.

92
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,830
Type is not that kind of person.

93
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,200
You're looking for trouble, aren't you?

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,170
I'm very satisfied with how we are now.

95
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,150
Are you really satisfied?

96
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,930
All I see is you being the compromising one.

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,860
I don't think it is going to work.

98
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,570
Because when two people are in love,

99
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,390
it's not going to last long

100
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,640
if only one of them is making the effort.

101
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,920
Actually, I don't want to get involved in your matter.

102
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,650
But Thorn said you were serious about him.

103
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,400
So I wanted to teach him a lesson when I met him.

104
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,340
I was worried that you might be the one getting hurt.

105
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,930
Is he your son?

106
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,100
No.

107
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,640
He was my first love.

108
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,310
I love him very much,

109
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,250
and I want to take care of him.

110
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,530
I want to care for him,

111
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,170
but I don't have the chance.

112
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,050
Tharn.

113
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,390
To be honest,

114
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,730
what's so good about him?

115
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,020
-Go back to where you came from.
-Type.

116
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,510
You don't have to drive me away.

117
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,010
I'm just an outsider.

118
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,930
That's all I can say.

119
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,430
He's been hurt many times.

120
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,450
You better don't hurt him again.

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,130
You really care about him, don't you?

122
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:03,970
Not bad.

123
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,180
It's fun to see

124
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,380
a giant baby getting panicked.

125
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,040
-Type.
-Let go of me!

126
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,050
-Stop it.
-Why are you stopping me?

127
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,980
Tharn, you're happy now, right?

128
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,390
I hate your senior.

129
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,560
I understand you.

130
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,820
I don't like

131
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,140
seeing him have anything to do with you.

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,250
I know.

133
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,160
I don't like

134
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,650
seeing you with him.

135
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,059
Okay.

136
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,049
I don't like it.

137
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,530
He seems to know everything about you.

138
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,100
I don't like

139
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,039
the feeling when I saw you kissing.

140
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,710
I don't like

141
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,590
the fact that you're his first love.

142
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,160
Most importantly,

143
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,140
I hate this feeling of jealousy.

144
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,730
Okay.

145
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,490
I admit

146
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,310
that I'm jealous of him now.

147
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,550
I...

148
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,930
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,510
For what?

150
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,400
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,900
I've never been a good boyfriend.

152
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,190
I'll try to accept

153
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,420
the fact that I'm dating a man.

154
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,270
Actually,

155
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,570
you don't have to force yourself.

156
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,370
Because

157
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,670
I can wait until the day you are ready.

158
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,580
Your senior was right.

159
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,090
I'm a selfish guy.

160
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,280
But this selfish guy

161
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,540
never wanted to break up with you.

162
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,030
That means

163
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,650
I

164
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,120
should thank San, right?

165
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,560
Don't mention his name again.

166
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,580
Most importantly,

167
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,860
although he likes you,

168
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,320
you must always remember

169
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,750
that you are mine.

170
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,240
Where are you going?

171
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,420
To get something downstairs.

172
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,620
I almost threw the sweet chilli sauce

173
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,920
on your senior's head.

174
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,930
But you came first.

175
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,060
If the thing I bought is gone,

176
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,810
you have to pay me the money.

177
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,690
Why did you bring me here?

178
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,190
You seem to have nothing to do.

179
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,350
I was lying down and playing games.

180
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,100
Okay, I'll buy you a drink. Let's go inside.

181
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,230
Hurry.

182
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,450
♫I'm ready to give my everything♫

183
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:00,020
♫To win your heart♫

184
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,840
-Good evening, Khong.
-Tharn, you're here.

185
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,500
Hello.

186
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,470
I thought you came alone.

187
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,010
You brought your friend?

188
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,050
Have a seat.

189
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,640
Make yourself at home.

190
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,150
-Jeed.
-What?

191
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,290
-Serve them.
-Okay.

192
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,520
Here.

193
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,190
-Hello, Sister Jeed.
-Hello.

194
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,870
Help yourselves. I'll be back later.

195
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,410
Okay.

196
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,520
Go ahead, Khong.

197
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,740
Well,

198
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,980
why are you here together today?

199
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,230
Why can't we come together?

200
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,620
Last time,

201
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,570
I came here alone to drown my sorrows

202
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,790
because you broke my heart.

203
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,390
What?

204
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,610
But you look much better

205
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,780
this time.

206
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,510
Is there good news?

207
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,260
We're just friends.

208
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,410
Friends?

209
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,250
Friends who are above friends.

210
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,380
I'm so shy.

211
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,300
My goodness.

212
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,720
Why does Tharn look so surprised?

213
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,410
Why are you surprised?

214
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,100
I just want to tell others

215
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,790
that you're mine.

216
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,060
-I can't stay here anymore. I'm so shy.
-What are you talking about?

217
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,550
You scared me. I have good news.

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,580
Are you pregnant?

219
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,400
-What are you talking about? Sit down.
-What?

220
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,040
-You know nothing.
-So what's the good news?

221
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,560
Those two...

222
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,040
By the way, the toilet is empty today.

223
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,970
You can go in.

224
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,850
You're going too far, sis.

225
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,600
-You can talk about work in my office.
-Okay.

226
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,990
I'm here to talk to Khong today

227
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,960
about my return for the show.

228
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,550
That's why I want you to come with me.

229
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,590
He probably wants to be encouraged.

230
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,200
That's right, unlike me.

231
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,600
-Let's talk over there.
-Okay, I'll be right back.

232
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,480
Don't worry about him.

233
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,210
-Don't do anything to him.
-Okay.

234
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,120
What would you like to drink?

235
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,060
Anything.

236
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,590
[Bar]

237
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,980
Are you done with Tharn?

238
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,980
This is Sister Ten, and this is Sister Kae.

239
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,420
Hello, Tharn.

240
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,760
Do you know me?

241
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,780
They are your fans.

242
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,670
They came to greet me

243
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,100
because they saw you here with me.

244
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:13,110
Hello.

245
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,420
Tharn, do you remember me?

246
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,700
Will you be mad if I say I don't?

247
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,290
You're too handsome to be angry with.

248
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,690
Anyway, I used to buy you drinks a lot.

249
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,380
Thank you.

250
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,260
Can I buy you a drink tonight, Type?

251
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,030
Maybe next time.

252
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,530
You got rejected?

253
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,360
No.

254
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,850
Don't you think

255
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,740
that I'm saying this because I want to see you again?

256
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:03,560
I'm not an easy guy, but I'm not hard to get either.

257
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,380
This is my number.

258
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,520
Do you really want to just chat?

259
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,800
Type.

260
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,030
What?

261
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,790
Don't make me angry.

262
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,420
What did you whisper to her?

263
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,620
Nothing.

264
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,670
Type.

265
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,820
Don't act up here.

266
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,430
I was just joking around.

267
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,300
But you didn't look like you were joking.

268
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,970
Now, it's your turn to get jealous.

269
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,150
We're even.

270
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,660
By the way,

271
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,060
I'm quite charming too, right?

272
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,990
So charming, huh?

273
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,550
Follow me.

274
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,670
What?

275
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,670
Tharn.

276
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,850
This is not fun anymore.

277
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,240
But I'm having fun, Type.

278
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,130
If you do it here, I'll kill you.

279
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,980
Then try it.

280
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,610
I don't want to live too.

281
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,100
I want to die on your body.

282
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,810
Tharn.

283
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,130
You want to practice flirting, right?

284
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,240
Then practice with me.

285
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,610
Don't do this.

286
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,370
Is it fun to tease me?

287
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,770
Is it fun making me jealous?

288
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,010
I'm dying to drag that woman away from you.

289
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,180
And you think it's fun?

290
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,450
Yes.

291
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,500
What's interesting is

292
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,710
that I know tonight will be a wonderful night.

293
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,470
Let me tell you.

294
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,480
No matter how many women are crazy over you,

295
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,890
if you dare to betray me,

296
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:42,800
I will pay you back double.

297
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,980
Don't think

298
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,390
that I'll give in to you

299
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,310
just because I've admitted our relationship.

300
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,480
I, Thiwat, am crueller than you think.

301
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,610
And...

302
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,410
I guess someone won't have fun tonight.

303
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,190
[I'll be home late tonight.]

304
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,830
[Where are you going?]

305
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,870
[I'll be at Khong’s bar with the band. We'll probably talk for a long time.]

306
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,100
[Okay.]

307
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,370
[You can sleep first.]

308
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,190
[When are you coming back?]

309
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,370
[Will you wait for me?]

310
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,440
[You punk.]

311
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,710
[I'm not sure.]

312
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,020
[Whatever.]

313
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,960
[Are you worried about me?]

314
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,520
[Do you want to die?]

315
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,660
[Hahahahahaha]

316
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,480
Type, what are you doing?

317
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,630
Why aren't you practicing?

318
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,480
You've been stuck to your phone lately.

319
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,980
Are you chatting with your mysterious partner?

320
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,550
How is it? Is she pretty?

321
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,580
Is she prettier than my friend, Puifai?

322
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,470
Well, they are pretty if they have long hair.

323
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,220
What about you? Have you talked with your friend?

324
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,090
No. They all disappeared after scolding me.

325
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,610
By the way,

326
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,380
what brings you here?

327
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,510
Can you tutor me?

328
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,130
Please.

329
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,530
Who would have thought

330
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,100
that you would have such good grades despite skipping classes

331
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,890
and always being late to class?

332
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:27,070
[Let's go on a date after the exam.]

333
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,670
Wait, Type.

334
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,640
I just realized

335
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,370
that you would act like all other couples that are in love too.

336
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,420
What are you talking about?

337
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,790
Did you lose your mind playing soccer?

338
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,920
Fine. Will you help me or not?

339
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,840
Your partner will go crazy over you.

340
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,520
Crazy over me?

341
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,050
Are you some kind of ecstasy?

342
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,030
I'll pray that your partner will be crazily obsessed to you.

343
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,860
Alright I'll help you.

344
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,860
But you don't have to pray for me.

345
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,040
Because they're already all over me now.

346
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,610
Darn it, Type!

347
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,290
How are you so confident?

348
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm glad that you came with me.

349
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,850
Where am I?

350
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,860
Answer me.

351
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,690
Where do you think this is?

352
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,220
Your house.

353
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,860
Why did you bring me here?

354
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,950
So you know it's my house.

355
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,660
Then why are you asking?

356
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,390
You punk!

357
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,750
Alright.

358
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,960
I came back to change my car today.

359
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,560
And my brother wants to see you.

360
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,380
But don't worry.

361
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,960
Because my brother is the only one at home now.

362
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,780
Don't be nervous.

363
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,570
How can I not be nervous?

364
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,960
This is your home.

365
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,070
I never wanted to come at first.

366
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,580
Why are you two standing here?

367
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,260
Brother Thorn.

368
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,030
Do I look so scary?

369
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,430
I didn't see you coming in,

370
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,530
so I came out to look for you.

371
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,550
Hello.

372
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,450
Hello.

373
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,700
You're Type, right?

374
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,040
I only saw you in the photo before.

375
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,530
You look better in person.

376
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,000
You've seen me in a photo?

377
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,410
My brother followed your photo wall.

378
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,050
I like to observe people in secret,

379
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,780
especially when they're related to my brother.

380
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,630
It seems that Type

381
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,690
didn't know that you would bring him here.

382
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,240
But I can guarantee that my parents are not home.

383
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,440
Let's go.

384
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,550
Brother Tharn.

385
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,550
I miss you so much.

386
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,780
I forgot to tell you that Thanya is at home.

387
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,740
Don't you have piano class today?

388
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,480
I let it slip.

389
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,880
I said you would bring your friend home.

390
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,670
So she wanted to see you.

391
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,240
Because I miss you.

392
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,590
I miss you too.

393
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,740
Hello.

394
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,760
Hello.

395
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,130
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming home?

396
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,200
I just stopped by to get a new car.

397
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,710
So I didn't tell you. I'm sorry.

398
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,240
Brother Thorn said

399
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,370
that you would bring a special friend here.

400
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,180
So I called mom and dad.

401
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,200
They're coming back now.

402
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,220
I'm doing it good, right?

403
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,800
Here's the food. Look, whose favorite is this?

404
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,340
Good timing. Come and eat with us.

405
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,160
Come on.

406
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,600
Type, sit next to me.

407
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,820
Tharn, go sit on your chair.

408
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,780
Sit down. Don't be afraid.

409
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,800
Sit here.

410
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,950
You all must finish the food today, okay?

411
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,130
So can we eat now?

412
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,710
Yes, let's eat.

413
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,430
How long have you known each other?

414
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,340
Not so long.

415
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,370
We just met last semester.

416
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,020
You lived in the same dorm?

417
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,550
Yes.

418
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,490
That's why you moved out together?

419
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,820
Actually, I wanted to move out long ago.

420
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,760
But my dad didn't agree.

421
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,860
Until...

422
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,810
Tharn

423
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,820
joined to share the rent with me.

424
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,710
Then my dad agreed.

425
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,880
So you live in the dorm

426
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,980
because your home is far from school?

427
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,340
My parents are in Surat Thani.

428
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,270
Or, in other words,

429
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,100
his father has a resort on Phang Nga Bay.

430
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,850
Don't you have any relatives here?

431
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,000
Actually, I have an auntie living here.

432
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:29,000
I moved into her house since I was in middle school.

433
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,420
After I went to university,

434
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,400
I asked my dad to let me move to the dorm.

435
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,430
Is there any problem living together with Tharn?

436
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,480
I mean...

437
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,550
Did he make you uncomfortable?

438
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,660
No.

439
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,060
He's not making me uncomfortable.

440
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,650
Don't be nervous. I just want to talk to you.

441
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,260
Okay.

442
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,280
By the way, honey, speaking of Phang Nga Bay,

443
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,920
let's go for a vacation there. What do you think?

444
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,550
Sounds good.

445
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,030
We can stay in the resort of Type's family.

446
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,610
You're right, Dad. Let's go together.

447
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,110
It's nothing.

448
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:26,080
But haven't you just finished your vacation this year, Dad?

449
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,160
Let's go there another time.

450
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,240
We haven't been to the beach for years.

451
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,040
I'll find a time.

452
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,740
I think we should talk about it later.

453
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,810
Didn't you two just come back from a trip with your friends?

454
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,900
And you said you are so overwhelmed with work

455
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,530
that you don't have time to rest.

456
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,200
I think we should

457
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,970
let Tharn go there and check it out first.

458
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:53,590
We can go later.

459
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,870
I don't want to get hurt again.

460
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,170
Are you going to sleep at home tonight, Brother Tharn?

461
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,550
Yes, you should sleep here tonight too.

462
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,550
Then you won't have to drive home.

463
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,150
You sleep here. I'll go back by myself.

464
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,690
It's okay, you can sleep here together,

465
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,970
and go back together tomorrow, okay?

466
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,080
No, I feel sorry to stay.

467
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,490
You don't have to.

468
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,680
Thorn used to bring Sanran to play games,

469
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,780
and stayed overnight here a lot.

470
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,790
Who? Sanran?

471
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,160
Yes, Sanran.

472
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,610
He's a friend of Thorn. Do you know him?

473
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,460
Yes,

474
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,660
I know him.

475
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,920
Then just sleep here tonight.

476
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,830
And Brother Type too, okay?

477
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,490
I'll stay here tonight, then.

478
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,400
No problem.

479
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,640
Eat this.

480
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,980
Eat more.

481
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,740
My mom is an excellent chef.

482
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,650
Try it first.

483
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,580
Don't be mad at me, okay?

484
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,930
Did my face tell you that I was angry?

485
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,730
What's wrong with you?

486
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,760
Watch my mouth carefully.

487
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,220
I'm super angry.

488
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,780
Did you see it clearly?

489
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,990
I...

490
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,660
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,150
Still angry?

492
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
I didn't know

493
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,530
that my parents would know.

494
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,220
But they didn't say anything, though.

495
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's make up.

496
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,730
Don't feel pressured.

497
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,030
Don't worry,

498
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,580
and don't think too much.

499
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,310
What you're going to do if I think too much?

500
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,570
If you think too much,

501
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,590
I'll think more than you.

502
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,410
If you feel pressured,

503
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,260
I'll be more stressed than you.

504
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,780
If you're worried,

505
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,140
I'll be more anxious than you.

506
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,490
Trust me, Type.

507
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,330
I...

508
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,380
I won't let you deal with the bad feelings alone.

509
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,090
I'm your boyfriend.

510
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,590
Do you think I'll go soft on you, and forgive you?

511
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,870
Then will you forgive me or not?

512
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,650
Tharn.

513
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,640
Tharn, don't touch me. I'm itching.

514
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,090
If you don't stop,

515
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,540
I won't let you touch me for a week.

516
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,960
Okay, I'll stop.

517
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,400
Well,

518
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,820
we can do that now, right?

519
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,900
You're really...

520
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,100
Don't touch my face.

521
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,900
I'm happy

522
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,600
that you're willing to stay for the night.

523
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,180
But your parents are so scary.

524
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,110
Seems like my parents

525
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,600
adore you very much.

526
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,510
Otherwise, they won't let you stay overnight.

527
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,450
That means they like that Sanran guy too.

528
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,300
He used to sleep here every week.

529
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,890
But he came on his own.

530
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,900
But

531
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,720
my parents really adore you.

532
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,240
So,

533
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,390
you can rest assured.

534
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,570
I hate you.

535
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,290
But I love you.

536
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:51,890
I love you so much

537
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:09,280
♫My last lover♫

538
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,270
♫The person who stays with me all the time♫

539
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,800
♫I will not make you sad♫

540
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:26,830
♫Can you hear my words, baby?♫

541
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:34,520
♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

542
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,630
Type.

543
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,740
Normally, there should be a morning kiss.

544
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,910
Dream on.

545
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,440
You said you wanted this.

546
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,220
I'm going to take a shower.

547
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,220
[Bar]

548
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,530
Is Tharn playing in such a big bar?

549
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,480
Why are you so excited?

550
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,550
I thought he was playing in a small place.

551
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,870
I didn't expect it to be this big.

552
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,930
You know what?

553
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,210
I really admire him

554
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,260
after he plays the drums for me.

555
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,440
His hands are so fast.

556
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,280
Isn't it amazing?

557
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,620
By the way, how long has he been playing here?

558
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,160
Didn't I tell you?

559
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,940
You never told me anything.

560
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,420
I even found out

561
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,410
about you two being together by myself.

562
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:40,440
Okay. He has played here since he was in high school.

563
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,580
His previous band disbanded

564
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,970
because he had a conflict with the members.

565
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,790
He set up a new band during this holiday.

566
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,090
So the bar owner asked them to try playing here.

567
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:53,460
If she likes it, she'll let them play at the bar.

568
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,360
As you know,

569
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,520
his band is going to play at night.

570
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,450
Although it's not peak hours,

571
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,400
Tharn said

572
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,480
it's good enough for a new band.

573
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,350
Wow, you seem to know a lot about your boyfriend.

574
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,050
You punk!

575
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,210
I'm just telling the truth.

576
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,220
How many members are there in his band?

577
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,520
Four.

578
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,670
Who's the lead vocalist?

579
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,140
His friend, Lhong.

580
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,340
See? You can be a good boyfriend too.

581
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,520
How does it matter?

582
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,020
That's good.

583
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,410
You should learn to care about others,

584
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,170
instead of being hot-headed.

585
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,100
If I talked so much in the usual days,

586
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,190
you would have scolded me until I bent my ears.

587
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,830
You'll scold me until I can't find the way home.

588
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,420
-Should I scold you now?
-No.

589
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,380
Type.

590
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,240
Are you here to cheer for your boyfriend?

591
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,670
No, sister.

592
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,650
My friend asked

593
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,630
if there was a bar with a nice atmosphere

594
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,270
and delicious food nearby.

595
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,600
And I immediately thought of this place.

596
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,470
You're so sweet.

597
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,590
I'll find you a good seat today.

598
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,950
How about just in front of the stage?

599
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,610
Then you can see Tharn clearly.

600
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,270
Okay.

601
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,430
Follow me.

602
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,190
Make yourself at home.

603
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,050
Wait.

604
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,330
Do you like older women now?

605
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,590
Besides,

606
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,420
she even made fun of you and Tharn.

607
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,910
Don't you hate that?

608
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,640
She's older than me.

609
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,470
And Tharn is working here.

610
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,270
What does it have to do with Tharn?

611
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,690
Use your brain, No.

612
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,990
If I offend Sister Jeed,

613
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,370
then there will be trouble for Tharn.

614
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,460
You've really changed, Type.

615
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,890
Let's go.

616
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,880
What's going on?

617
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:00,670
Hi.

618
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,140
Type.

619
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,860
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

620
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,150
I didn't want to come. It was him who wanted to.

621
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,400
-Hi, No.
-Hi.

622
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,220
Why are you sitting here?

623
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:19,270
Let me take a break. I'll be on stage soon.

624
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:20,570
Okay?

625
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,480
Want a drink?

626
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,020
No, let's wait until my performance is over.

627
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,350
Don't invite him to drink.

628
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,050
Many people will buy him drinks

629
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,380
when he gets on stage.

630
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:36,800
Are you

631
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,350
jealous?

632
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,240
Get lost.

633
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,910
I knew it.

634
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,000
You would never talk nicely.

635
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,170
Are you trying to say that I'm mean?

636
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,440
I didn't say that.

637
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,850
But you know me so well.

638
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,040
You two

639
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,340
are quite sweet, huh?

640
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,580
What are you talking about?

641
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,480
Come on.

642
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,930
You two talk

643
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,190
as if there are only two of you in the world.

644
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,520
You're wrong, No.

645
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,560
There are not only him and me in my world.

646
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,270
But the person I care about

647
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,980
is him.

648
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,220
-I want to throw up.
-Me too.

649
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,310
-What are you talking about?
-Hi.

650
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,490
Wait, let me introduce myself.

651
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,210
I'm Lhong.

652
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,710
I'm his friend, I'm a major in music.

653
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,430
-Hello.
-Hi.

654
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,310
-I'm Techno.
-Techno.

655
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,360
-I'm a major in sports.
-Oh, Techno.

656
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,870
That's Type.

657
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,550
I'm a major in sports too.

658
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:43,990
Type.

659
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,890
I know you.

660
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,450
You're famous.

661
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,400
What do you mean?

662
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,610
Everyone in the school knows you.

663
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,750
Your photos were posted online.

664
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,190
Sorry, I talked too much.

665
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,830
Sorry, sorry.

666
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,010
You did talk too much, Lhong.

667
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,340
I'm sorry.

668
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,400
Are you going on stage? I've adjusted it.

669
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,740
Brother Tae is waiting for us.

670
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,250
Are they your friends?

671
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,830
Hello, I'm Song.

672
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,820
I'm the guitarist.

673
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,640
Brother Tharn and Brother Lhong are my idols.

674
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,600
I really like them.

675
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,510
Song, I think that's enough for your introduction.

676
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,900
My name is Techno.

677
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,380
That's my friend, Type.

678
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,520
Hello, Brother Techno and Brother Type.

679
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,950
Let's go, Brother Tharn and Brother Lhong.

680
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm so excited.

681
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,370
Let's go.

682
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,150
Let's go.

683
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,150
Okay.

684
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,160
Hurry up.

685
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,340
Got it.

686
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,390
Hurry up.

687
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,320
Type, I'll go first.

688
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,790
Good luck.

689
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,220
You're cheering for him?

690
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,380
What?

691
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,640
But are you okay?

692
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,550
Please give them a round of applause.

693
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,760
You can sing it together if you know the next song.

694
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,970
♫I know you're not interested in me♫

695
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:58,150
♫You won't be interested in me no matter what♫

696
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:04,440
♫But I'm not the kind of person that would admit defeat♫

697
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,840
♫You should've known how good I am to you♫

698
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,490
♫But I don't seem to be the person you want♫

699
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,080
♫I'm ready to give my everything♫

700
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:20,860
♫To win your heart♫

701
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,980
♫I won't let you leave with others♫

702
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,700
♫I won't let anyone stand by your side♫

703
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,750
♫No matter how long it takes♫

704
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:37,230
♫I'll give my everything to make you mine♫

705
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,970
♫I won't let anyone love you♫

706
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:48,430
♫Because you're the only person I want to possess♫

707
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,650
♫My heart is yearning, my heart is calling♫

708
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:58,410
♫I want you to know♫

709
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,520
♫I won't let you leave with others♫

710
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,170
♫I won't let anyone stand by your side♫

711
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,290
♫No matter how long it takes♫

712
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:15,070
♫I'll give my everything to make you mine♫

713
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:19,210
♫I won't let you leave with others♫

714
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:23,940
♫I won't let anyone stand by your side♫

715
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,970
♫No matter how long it takes♫

716
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:31,500
♫I'll give my everything to make you mine♫

717
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,730
♫I won't let anyone love you♫

718
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,270
Thank you.

719
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,600
Cover him up.

720
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,680
Otherwise, Team will kill me if he catches a cold.

721
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,380
Yes, honey.

722
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,250
Wait.

723
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,180
You will be the next.

724
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,000
What honey?

725
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,370
Tharn is Type's wife.

726
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:48,330
Tharn.

727
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:52,150
I have a question.

728
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,280
What is it?

729
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,900
The way you play the drum.

730
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,390
What?

731
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,110
You look so sexy.

732
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,610
When I'm playing the drum?

733
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,050
Yes.

734
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,210
To me,

735
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,840
sex and music are the same.

736
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:33,170
It gives me a climax of happiness.

737
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,400
Now,

738
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:40,400
I know

739
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,070
what my favorite instrument is.

740
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,640
Is it drums?

741
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:50,820
No.

742
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:59,310
It's you.

743
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:02,620
My favorite instrument is you.

744
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:15,930
Type.

745
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,690
Type.

746
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:32,950
-Do you want it now?
-Don't move.

747
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,660
Type, be gentle. It hurts.

748
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,360
Shut up. Don't move.

749
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:17,250
No!

750
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,030
No!

751
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,050
No.

752
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,500
Get up and have some porridge.

753
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,260
Tharn bought you porridge.

754
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,120
I can't take it anymore.

755
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,100
My head is going to explode.

756
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,950
Get up quickly.

757
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,060
Here.

758
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,520
Hey, Lhong.

759
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,780
Eat it carefully. Don't spill it.

760
00:48:59,370 --> 00:48:59,950
Type.

761
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,130
What?

762
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,810
Well,

763
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:07,220
last night,

764
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,550
I...

765
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,330
-Heard it.
-No.

766
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:15,950
If you continue,

767
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,030
you'll be dead.

768
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,220
If you tell this to others, I'll kill you.

769
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,830
I slept like a dead pig last night, bro.

770
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,510
I slept soundly.

771
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,530
-Good.
-Good.

772
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,110
-Type.

773
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:43,330
Lhong is coming tonight.

774
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,600
Can I tell him

775
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,940
about our relationship?

776
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,890
This is between you two.

777
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,000
It has nothing to do with me.

778
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,650
I'll drink it over there.

779
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,860
It's hot.

780
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,900
Just help me once.

781
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:37,260
Okay. Raise your hand when the lecturer calls my name.

782
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,490
Okay. I'll treat you for a week.

783
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,650
Thanks.

784
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,450
Tar, when did you come?

785
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:58,880
I've been standing here for a long time.

786
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,160
Really?

787
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,840
How come you have time to pick me up today?

788
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,300
Because

789
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,210
I'm free.

790
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,850
Don't you have classes?

791
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,330
Yes.

792
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:24,790
But the class ended early.

793
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,550
So I hurriedly came to see you.

794
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:35,600
Are you hungry? Do you want to eat something?

795
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,410
I want to go home.

796
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:43,480
Really?

797
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,610
Let's go home, then.

798
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:07,300
Let's go.

799
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:11,750
Let's go home.

800
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,630
Type.

801
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,920
If I tell Lhong that we're dating,

802
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,620
would you mind?

803
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,360
-If you mind...
-Don't behave so well,

804
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,360
it makes me feel like a bad person.

805
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,810
Haven't you heard about it?

806
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,640
The worse a person is, the more people love him.

807
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:49,190
Be it a good guy or a bad guy,

808
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,920
I don't want it.

809
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,720
I only want you.

810
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,000
I love you, Type.

811
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,500
I love you too, maybe.

812
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,040
You...

813
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,830
Hi, Lhong.

814
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,840
The handsome guy is here.

815
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:56,750
Have some water.

816
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,040
Thank you.

817
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:06,940
Lhong,

818
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:10,860
I have something to tell you.

819
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,440
What's wrong?

820
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,640
You look so serious.

821
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:21,230
Well...

822
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,100
Type and I,

823
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:26,750
we're dating.

824
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,200
Are you okay?

825
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,370
No.

826
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,610
I'll clean it up.

827
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,140
What's wrong?

828
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,430
Why didn't I know about this?

829
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:54,730
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you.

830
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:58,550
Well,

831
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,460
I forgot that I made a date with my family.

832
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:02,960
I'll go back first.

833
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,000
But you just came.

834
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,290
The date is really important.

835
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:13,770
I'll get going.

836
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,420
Here, take it.

837
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,220
What's wrong with him?

838
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,910
I don't know.

839
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,350
Take it.

840
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:38,960
I'll clean.

841
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,000
Be careful.

842
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,110
Brother Tharn, why don't I have a partner?

843
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,520
There's no one pursuing me either. I want to be in love too.

844
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,620
What should I do?

845
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:07,920
-Stop talking nonsense, Song.
-Brother Tharn.

846
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,760
-Let's go back.
-Okay.

847
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm sorry.

848
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,040
-Tar.
-Brother Tharn.

849
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:19,770
Brother Tharn, wait.

850
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,700
I... I miss you.

851
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,540
I have to go, Tar.

852
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:28,720
Let's go, Song.

853
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,220
You're home.

854
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,290
Yes, get back to sleep.

855
00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:00,220
Okay. You should take a shower too.

856
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,250
Then quickly come and be my pillow.

857
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:06,030
Okay.

858
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:28,070
Tharn had never been dating anyone for over two months

859
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,700
until he met

860
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:31,620
Tar.

861
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:33,960
Who?

862
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,610
I never wanted to break up with you.

863
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:40,470
Tar is begging me to get back together with him.

864
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,510
Why didn't you tell me

865
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,230
that he was your ex?

866
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,830
Does he taste

867
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,000
as delicious as before?
