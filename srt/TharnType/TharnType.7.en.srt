2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,860
One, two, three, four, five.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,140
Is pork expensive these days?

4
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,300
Type, Tharn, this way.

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,660
This way.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,180
I've reserved a table. Come and sit.

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,830
Here.

8
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,800
Have a seat.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,100
You two seem close lately.

10
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,700
Isn't it a good thing?

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,580
You can stop complaining about me and Tharn now.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,580
Yes, that's good,

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,340
but you are way too close.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,820
Are you seeing someone, Type?

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,380
What? Do you have a partner?

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,650
Puifai told me

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,690
that Type gave her hope, but lied to her later.

18
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,750
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,110
Then why didn't you tell her in the first place?

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,150
She's very upset, Type.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,480
But, forget it anyway. It's my fault.

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,880
I'm the one that introduced you to her.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,900
You don't have to call her and apologize.

24
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,580
She'll definitely vent her anger on you.

25
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,720
Okay.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,470
By the way, who is your partner?

27
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,070
Right, who is it?

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,060
Why should I tell you?

29
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,070
Aren't we friends? Do I know them?

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,680
If you keep asking me who my partner is,

31
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,280
you won't have time to buy food before class.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,530
Cheapskate.

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,780
I'm going to buy some food.

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,740
I'll come back to you later.

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,720
Okay.

36
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,320
Tell me about your partner, Type.

37
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,500
If I'm not mistaken,

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,370
that person is...

39
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,590
Do you want some water, No?

40
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,490
You look thirsty.

41
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm not thirsty.

42
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,690
So your partner is...

43
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,100
Hey, drink some water.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,530
You really look thirsty.

45
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,600
Wait, don't change the topic.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,750
Don't try to hide it from me.

47
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,480
What did we hide from you?

48
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,070
Yes, what are we hiding?

49
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,950
Stop teaming up to bully me.

50
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,920
Your partner, Type.

51
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,730
Who is that?

52
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,130
Oh my, there are so many people.

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,180
Why are you here so early?

54
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,670
Well, you guys can continue.

55
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,200
I'm going to class.

56
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,780
Hey, don't forget

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,870
that we're signing the contract for our dorm tonight.

58
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,110
Okay, I'll call you after class.

59
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,560
-Okay.
-I'm leaving.

60
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,110
Wait.

61
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,130
Dorm?

62
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,079
What dorm?

63
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,370
I'm moving to the dorm outside the school with Tharn.

64
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:20,900
What?

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,930
You're moving to the dorm outside with Tharn?

66
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,400
No, you understand it right about the question

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,340
you just asked.

68

[TharnType 1]

69
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,340
[TharnType 1]

70
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,870
What's up, Type?

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,890
Nothing serious.

72
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,110
Is Brother Seo Duang here?

73
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,240
Yes.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,540
Seo Duang, Type is looking for you.

75
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,330
What brings you here?

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,000
Aren't you going home for the holiday?

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,750
Here's the thing, brother.

78
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,010
We're here to say goodbye.

79
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:33,840
Are you quitting school?

80
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,070
What? You're quitting?

81
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,230
Shouldn't you think twice about it?

82
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,850
Khlui.

83
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,610
-Me?
-Yes.

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,820
They haven't finished yet.

85
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,690
Where are you going? Finish your words.

86
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,690
We're moving to the dorm outside.

87
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,090
You're moving in together?

88
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,409
Yes, brother.

89
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,300
We're moving in together.

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,640
Because you guys said

91
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,570
that the walls were thin.

92
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,900
I feel bad when we fight.

93
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,480
Oh.

94
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,140
So you're moving to a dorm with thick walls

95
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,480
that is soundproof.

96
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,850
It's not like that.

97
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,950
It's nice, though.

98
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,020
Here.

99
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,580
Since you're moving out together,

100
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,290
you should be more tolerant of each other.

101
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,120
It's normal for couples to quarrel.

102
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,120
That's how couples live, right?

103
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,370
I'm so happy as someone who has witnessed what you've come through

104
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,240
since the beginning.

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,580
What are you talking about? They're not getting married.

106
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,380
Are you out of your mind?

107
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,710
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

108
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,560
Thank you, brother.

109
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,990
We shall leave, then. Bye.

110
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,790
Bye.

111
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,360
-It hurts.
-Good luck!

112
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,380
Khlui, stop crying. Go pack up your stuff.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,360
Didn't you say you're going home tomorrow?

114
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,330
I'm happy.

115
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,180
Seo Duang, you don’t understand me.

116
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm like a father

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,030
sending two children

118
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,530
off to the door of happiness.

119
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,310
They got what they wanted.

120
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,200
When can you stop caring about others,

121
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,700
and care about the people around you?

122
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,130
Who?

123
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,450
Me. I like you.

124
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,410
You like me?

125
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,910
What do you mean?

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,070
Why are you laughing?

127
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,780
Nothing.

128
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,970
I'm just happy

129
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
that you're willing to tell Techno about us.

130
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,740
He's going to find out anyway.

131
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,200
You don't have to thank me.

132
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,070
I wasn't going to say if it wasn't Techno.

133
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,530
Oh, right. After moving to the dorm,

134
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,390
I'll go back to Phang Nga.

135
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,090
I promised my dad.

136
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,720
Is baby Type going home to find his dad?

137
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,250
Yes, I'll beat you up.

138
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,410
What are you playing?

139
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,530
Keep packing.

140
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,090
I'm home.

141
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,290
For the past 4 months, I''ve been sick of Tharn.

142
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,340
It would be nice to not see him for a month.

143
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,370
You punk.

144
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,060
Does studying make you go crazy?

145
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,180
Why are you yelling here?

146
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,940
I'm depressed, Dad.

147
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,180
That's why I'm letting it out here.

148
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,490
Are you depressed because of your relationship?

149
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,540
I heard you were dumped by a girl.

150
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,650
Oh, Dad.

151
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,780
Forget about the past.

152
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,520
How can I forget?

153
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,930
I transferred another 2,000 baht to you.

154
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,840
Is that the best you can do?

155
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,340
You're so useless.

156
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,160
When your dad was young, it didn't cost money to pursue a girl.

157
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,830
I was always surrounded by the girls too.

158
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,100
Dad, are you sure they were girls, not dogs?

159
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,950
How dare you talk to me like that, you little brat.

160
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,180
Stop talking nonsense.

161
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,500
By the way, when are you going back to Bangkok?

162
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,990
Dad, your son just came back carrying the luggage,

163
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,260
and you're kicking me out right away.

164
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,750
I didn't mean that. I'm just asking.

165
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,800
I'll take you home no matter what.

166
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,150
But look at you. You still moved out in the end.

167
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,120
You punk.

168
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,930
By the way, what's your roommate's personality?

169
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,520
Just like those with a pretty face,

170
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,530
he's annoyingly meticulous.

171
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,520
He's usually calm, as calm as ice.

172
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,880
But he's really scary when he's angry.

173
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
And he's stubborn.

174
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,140
I told him not to do it, but he still did.

175
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,410
I told him not to prepare food for me, but he did.

176
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,780
I told him not to hang the clothes, but he hung them up.

177
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,740
Sometimes, he even changed my bed sheets.

178
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,350
He's just a good-looking mixed-race man.

179
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,100
His father is of mixed Thai-American descent.

180
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,710
His nose bridge is so high that it's poking me.

181
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,590
All the girls go crazy for him when he plays instruments.

182
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,010
I heard you two were pretty close.

183
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,310
Who said we were close, dad?

184
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,370
If not, why did he do all these things for you?

185
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,110
And how do you know his parents' nationality?

186
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,550
When have you ever talked about a friend's look?

187
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,310
I don't even know

188
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,430
how your friends, Team and Aom look like.

189
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,550
But forget it.

190
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,610
It seems that you admire him a lot.

191
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,630
Who admires him?

192
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,540
You brat.

193
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,390
Aren't you the one praising him just now?

194
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,110
Dad.

195
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,240
Is this guest trying to say something?

196
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,240
[Guest is a homophone of Asian]

197
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,300
He's a foreigner, not Asian.

198
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,510
You know what I'm trying to say.

199
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,260
All right, I'll take care of the guest.

200
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,700
When you get home, don't just lie down.

201
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,610
There are a lot of foreign guests coming by these days.

202
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,500
Okay.

203
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,540
Hello.

204
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,520
Hello.

205
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,880
What would you like to drink?

206
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,960
Can I have a beer?

207
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,310
Okay, just a moment.

208
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,410
Okay.

209
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,430
[Hello?]

210
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,690
Hello?

211
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,060
[Did you miss me?]

212
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,160
You punk!

213
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,790
Are you asking for a beating?

214
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,500
[When did I ask for a beating?]

215
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,600
[I'm just asking you.]

216
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,310
Then my answer is no.

217
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,030
We just separated yesterday. Why would I miss you?

218
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,670
[Yes, we just separated yesterday,]

219
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,940
[yet you're calling me today.]

220
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,750
You punk!

221
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,810
[Are you home? How did it go?]

222
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,030
Are you worried about me?

223
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,090
[Yes, I'm worried about you and I'm possessive to you.]

224
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,880
I won't fall for your sweet words no matter how hard you try.

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,550
[But you're obsessed with my mouth.]

226
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,870
I told you.

227
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,410
No matter what you say, I won't be fooled.

228
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,150
[I'm not talking about sweet words.]

229
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,510
[I'm talking about my mouth when kissing you.]

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,390
Get off, you punk!

231
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,330
Who's obsessed? I hate you so much!

232
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,570
Are you done talking with your friends, Brother Tharn?

233
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,980
Yes, I am.

234
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,640
Let me see

235
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,570
where you stopped.

236
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,080
I've finished this song.

237
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,730
Next week, my teacher will teach me a new song.

238
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,510
Okay.

239
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,200
Don't go back to the dorm early.

240
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,940
Then, you can hear me play the new song.

241
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,720
Unfortunately, my band is going to practice next week.

242
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,870
I don't know if I'm able to hear it or not.

243
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,570
Are you leaving again, brother Tharn?

244
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,780
I missed you a lot when you were not around.

245
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,890
I miss you too.

246
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,320
I don't believe it.

247
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,130
If you miss me, why don't you come home often?

248
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,270
He misses you but he misses others more.

249
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,320
Brother Thorn, have you been back for long?

250
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,550
I'm home when you were about to break your promise with Thanya.

251
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,130
Actually, you're angry at me

252
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,600
because Thanya is clingy to me, right?

253
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,010
Yes.

254
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,630
I'm not happy.

255
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,510
Look, every time he's back,

256
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,780
you ignore me.

257
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,120
Because I can see you every day.

258
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,350
So you're not free next week?

259
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,410
Is it for practice or something else?

260
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,230
Well...

261
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,680
The pratice is part of the reason.

262
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,140
What's the majority part of the reason, then?

263
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,940
Remember when you came back last month

264
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,050
looking like you had everything ruined?

265
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,170
Yes.

266
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,960
What about now?

267
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,460
Now?

268
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,500
We're dating.

269
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,390
Oh, my God, this is good news.

270
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,910
Yes.

271
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,970
But it's so tiring.

272
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,350
Speaking of it, you've been single for half a year too.

273
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,700
Stop talking about me. What about you?

274
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,810
What can happen to me?

275
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,150
Taking care of Thanya takes up most of my time.

276
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,869
Brother Thorn, you should get a partner.

277
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,710
You're already 21 years old,

278
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,650
yet you're sticking to me every day.

279
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,420
That's not good.

280
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,069
What kind of kid could be so cruel?

281
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,319
Tharn, I have an appointment with San this week.

282
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,339
Do you want to come with me?

283
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,190
Is he back?

284
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,610
He's been back for a month.

285
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,080
He asked me out for dinner this week.

286
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,950
He's giving me some souvenirs.

287
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,170
He asked me to tell you

288
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,440
that if you have time, go visit him.

289
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,680
He misses you.

290
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,750
Well, let me think about it.

291
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,680
Whatever.

292
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,740
Type, what are you doing on the roof?

293
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,940
The roof is leaking, Mom.

294
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,050
Dad asked me to nail it with a wooden board.

295
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,900
He'll ask the roofer to fix it tomorrow.

296
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,010
He should've just called the roofer now.

297
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,880
You'll get hurt again if you fall down.

298
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,140
No, Mom.

299
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,030
If it rains again tonight,

300
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,410
we'll be flooded with complaints.

301
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,990
Our room is full.

302
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,500
There's no other empty room available.

303
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,990
You're right.

304
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,540
By the way, what brings you here?

305
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,090
A friend came to see you.

306
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,920
Who?

307
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,420
Me.

308
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,550
Kom.

309
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,040
You guys talk. Stay for dinner tonight.

310
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,930
Yes, ma'am.

311
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,860
-You guys talk.
-Bye, ma'am.

312
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,610
Bye.

313
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,210
You've changed a lot.

314
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,920
Why? Am I more handsome?

315
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,880
Don't make me say it,

316
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,400
or you'll be sad.

317
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:52,770
And you,

318
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,760
you look more and more like a city person.

319
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,450
What?

320
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,450
I can tell from your manner.

321
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,270
By the way, is the roof leaking?

322
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,110
Yes, I'm not sure if it's leaking anywhere else.

323
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,200
Yeah, there was a typhoon last night.

324
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,500
Let me take a look.

325
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,510
What?

326
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,290
Look at you.

327
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,510
Don't underestimate mechanical students.

328
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,190
Here.

329
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,060
Come on.

330
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,160
Do you want to show me your skills?

331
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,720
You're good.

332
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,310
-Give me a nail.
-Okay.

333
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,290
It won't get worse, right?

334
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,110
Trust my skills, okay?

335
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,590
That wretch, what is he looking at?

336
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,610
Who are you talking about?

337
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,530
That foreigner.

338
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,770
He's been eyeing me with a strange look since a few days ago.

339
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,200
Yeah, you're still so attractive to men.

340
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,580
Kom, you wretch!

341
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,200
Do you want me to kick you?

342
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,920
Don't mess with me.

343
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,860
Alright.

344
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,030
It's better to be loved than to be hated.

345
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,600
Besides, he's a guest.

346
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,890
Just put up with it.

347
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,490
I wish him dead.

348
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,310
Alright, calm down.

349
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,740
Are you going to the full moon party tomorrow?

350
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,520
Yes, I am. When are you going?

351
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,950
How about this? I'll call you by that time.

352
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,560
Call me then.

353
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,730
This party is great. It's been a while since I had some fun.

354
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,280
Yes, this place is relaxing too.

355
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,910
I'm done drinking.

356
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,710
I'll order more.

357
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,940
Okay, order some for me too.

358
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,890
Two more beers, please.

359
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,390
Hello, I'm Allen.

360
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,100
I stay at your resort.

361
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,820
What's your name?

362
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,960
Type.

363
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,790
Cheers.

364
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,660
I've got my eyes on you for days.

365
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,090
I think you're very, very sexy.

366
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,780
Type.

367
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,630
Calm down.

368
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,930
Stop drooling over me!

369
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,350
Stay in your place, you wretch!

370
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,610
I'm sorry, my friend is waiting for me.

371
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,390
Come here. Let's go.

372
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,920
Gay should disappear from this world.

373
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,400
If it weren't for my dad,

374
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,040
I would have punched him.

375
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,450
Disgusting.

376
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,830
I'd rather sleep in a dirty pigsty

377
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,510
than being touched by them.

378
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,500
These gay.

379
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,140
Type.

380
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,370
What's wrong?

381
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,410
What's wrong with you, Kom?

382
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,000
Are you going to say I'm prejudiced?

383
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,550
I am.

384
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,780
So what?

385
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,060
You're not like them.

386
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,710
I'm not cursing you.

387
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,190
I'm just like them.

388
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,410
What did you say?

389
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
I'm gay.

390
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,810
I'm not saying this to upset you.

391
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,780
Besides, I was never going to tell you, actually.

392
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,280
I know you hate it.

393
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,750
But I really can't take what you said

394
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,800
to people like me just now.

395
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,380
You know what?

396
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,990
How much longer do I have to tolerate your cursing towards people like me?

397
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,690
How many years have you been saying those words?

398
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,100
I feel terrible.

399
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,540
I want to say it out loud that I'm one of them.

400
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,220
Why can't you open your heart to people like us?

401
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:10,930
Not every gay is as bad as you think.

402
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,780
Type.

403
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm not asking for your understanding.

404
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,130
I know

405
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,550
that you might not want

406
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,880
to be my friend anymore after this.

407
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,450
But I just want to have one good friend

408
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,880
who can accept me for who I am.

409
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
But maybe what I'm asking for is too much.

410
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,050
I apologize for being gay.

411
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,510
[Kom]

412
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,510
[Calling Kom]

413
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,410
What's wrong?

414
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,100
[Nothing.]

415
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,970
[I just want to ask how you're doing.]

416
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,860
[It's been two weeks.]

417
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,770
It's good. I work for my dad sometimes.

418
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,740
Sometimes I get scolded by my mom when I lie down doing nothing.

419
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,720
When I'm in a good mood, I'll swim in the sea.

420
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,590
[Okay.]

421
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,680
You told me

422
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,890
that your dad has a resort in Phang Nga.

423
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,670
[Yes, I went to a full moon party last night.]

424
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,390
Okay.

425
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,200
How is it? Is it fun?

426
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,840
[Not good.]

427
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,150
A foreigner who's gay said I'm sexy.

428
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,520
How did you respond?

429
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,780
What do you think I'll do?

430
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,890
I told him to stop drooling over me,

431
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,160
and wished him dead.

432
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,250
Why?

433
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,790
Do you think I'm starting to grow feelings for gays

434
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,400
just because I don't like girls?

435
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,780
[I'm sorry.]

436
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,450
But,

437
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,980
I bet you don't know

438
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,240
how sexy you are.

439
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,460
Tharn.

440
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,780
Do you want me to kick you the next time we meet?

441
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,630
Alright, let's not talk about this.

442
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,530
Let's talk about you. How was your holiday?

443
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,740
Nothing much.

444
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,560
I went to school to practice playing instruments.

445
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,950
Now my band has a new guitarist.

446
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,890
So I need to practice to fit in.

447
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:44,210
[Also, a senior asked me to tutor the candidates.]

448
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,430
[But I don't think I'm that good.]

449
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,040
[So I turned him down.]

450
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,460
By the way, when are you coming back?

451
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,630
Why?

452
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,080
[I miss you.]

453
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,130
You punk.

454
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,860
I miss you too.

455
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,240
[Bar]

456
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,040
Mai.

457
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,040
Order whatever you want.

458
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,270
I'm waiting for Techno and the others.

459
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,640
No, thank you. I just want to make things clear.

460
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,360
What is it?

461
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,550
Is it about Type and Puifai?

462
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,550
I think we've made it clear enough.

463
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,550
Type feels guilty too.

464
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,530
But Puifai has been ignoring him.

465
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,760
How can he explain it?

466
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,130
But at least,

467
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,830
your friend should apologize to her properly.

468
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,790
Puifai is very upset.

469
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,110
What do you want me to do?

470
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,450
Do you want me to drag him here to apologize

471
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,720
or force him to date Puifai

472
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,260
even though he doesn't like her?

473
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,720
Stop it.

474
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,580
-You're so cruel.
-Hey.

475
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,550
Love can't be forced.

476
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,170
Hey, mind your own business.

477
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,660
Is it still others' matter

478
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,070
if it's about my feelings for you?

479
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,930
Mai.

480
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,780
You like me?

481
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,210
Yes.

482
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,330
Are you kidding me?

483
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,970
I'm not.

484
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,360
Since when?

485
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,220
Since the day we knew each other.

486
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,580
Gosh.

487
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,270
It's been a long time.

488
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,790
But you know nothing.

489
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:40,080
Mai.

490
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,610
I’m sorry.

491
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,940
I have no feelings for you.

492
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,960
Actually, I know it.

493
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,410
That's why I didn't tell you.

494
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,800
I think I should go back first.

495
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,910
Wait. I'll take you home.

496
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,770
Stay with your friend.

497
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,480
What's wrong with her?

498
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,630
Tiger,

499
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,820
my friend.

500
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,870
How are you?

501
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,290
You look so handsome.

502
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,700
I met Mai at the door just now.

503
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,130
What is she doing here?

504
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,190
No answer?

505
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,550
Don't tell me

506
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,580
that she's been waiting to scold Type for Puifai?

507
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,210
Really?

508
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,930
No.

509
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,550
She just came to talk to me.

510
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,120
Oh, really?

511
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,180
Wait.

512
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,080
You're talking about the girl just now?

513
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:48,660
Yes.

514
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,070
Gosh.

515
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,710
She's so pretty!

516
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,650
You punk!

517
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,940
Focus on alcohol when you're at a bar.

518
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,250
We can also have some eye candies, man.

519
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,020
Here, the menu.

520
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,840
I'm tired from standing.

521
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,050
-What?
-I'm tired.

522
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,550
Why are you tired? You just arrived,

523
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,910
-Calm down.
-and you come with me by train.

524
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,420
-There are times like this.
-You haven't paid yet.

525
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,490
I paid for the train. Pay me back.

526
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,010
It feels better when I'm with you guys.

527
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,700
-What?
-Nothing.

528
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,020
I got goosebumps, you punk.

529
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,840
Did you do something to me?

530
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,030
No. Drink it.

531
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,060
You drink first.

532
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,320
You drink first.

533
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,900
-Bring me a chair.
-Drink it.

534
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,430
[I have an event at school today. I can't pick you up.]

535
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:00,000
[Go home safely.]

536
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,200
[I'm worried about you. Take care.]

537
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,469
[Call me when you get home.]

538
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:15,159
[I can go back by myself. Don't worry.]

539
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,410
Brother Tum.

540
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,950
Tar.

541
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,480
You're back.

542
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,580
Yes.

543
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,160
Didn't you say there's an event in university?

544
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,730
How could you be back earlier than me?

545
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,910
Actually,

546
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,560
the event ended earlier than I thought.

547
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,440
So I came back quickly.

548
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,760
I haven't eaten yet.

549
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,010
I'm hungry.

550
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,130
I'll put my things upstairs first,

551
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,380
then I'll cook for you.

552
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,340
Why are you looking at me like that?

553
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,990
It's delicious, as usual.

554
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,290
I'm afraid that you might get sick of it.

555
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,020
This is the only dish I can cook.

556
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,270
Why would I?

557
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,670
Actually, I'll eat whatever you cook.

558
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,860
But I'd like to taste something else too.

559
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,300
Brother Tum.

560
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,290
I'm just kidding.

561
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,580
Like I said,

562
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,840
I'll eat whatever you cook.

563
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,040
As long as it's made by you.

564
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,300
By the way,

565
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:52,930
do you have a lot of homework lately?

566
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,970
No, why?

567
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,390
I don't see you drawing as much as you do before.

568
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:07,610
I thought maybe you're having a lot of homework.

569
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,720
I'm just tired of drawing.

570
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,660
Well, how about this?

571
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,800
Can you please

572
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,480
draw me a picture

573
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:28,010
when you're not tired of it anymore?

574
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,790
Okay, I will.

575
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,050
Call your mom when you get to the dorm.

576
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,000
So that she won't be worried about you.

577
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,330
Okay, Dad.

578
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,340
I'll call her right away when I get there.

579
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,710
I hope so.

580
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:58,240
Is someone going to cry after I go back?

581
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,910
You brat.

582
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,750
Dream on.

583
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,290
I'll get going, then.

584
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,410
Bye.

585
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,080
What are you looking at? Just leave.

586
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,780
You brat.

587
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,990
He probably hates me.

588
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,690
Do I play it better now, Brother Tharn?

589
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,040
It's great.

590
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,730
But do you know that you played too fast just now?

591
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,520
Yes, I know.

592
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,730
Why do you trust him so easily?

593
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,780
I think you play well.

594
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,720
How can I believe you?

595
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,740
Your sister is right.

596
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,660
She can tell that you're biased, and you're spoiling her.

597
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,710
Dad, how am I spoiling her?

598
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,590
I'm just telling the truth.

599
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,310
Okay, okay, you're telling the truth.

600
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,010
The truth is you are a clingy older brother.

601
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,980
Because my sister is cute.

602
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,070
You guys are really good at making kids.

603
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,520
Look, she looks just like a doll.

604
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,780
Of course, wouldn't you look at your dad?

605
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,860
What nonsense are you two talking about?

606
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,310
I'll prepare dinner.

607
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,770
We have a guest today.

608
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,640
Is there anything you want to eat?

609
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,320
We'll eat whatever you cook.

610
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,700
But can we have Thai food?

611
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,570
I'm sick of cheese.

612
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,740
Oh, honey.

613
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,630
That's Tharn's favorite food.

614
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,380
It's not like my second son is home every day,

615
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,650
of course I need to treat him better.

616
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,270
Okay.

617
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:14,380
[I'm back in Bangkok.]

618
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,540
Dad, mom, I won't have dinner at home tonight.

619
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,380
I'm going back to the dorm.

620
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,110
I'm leaving.

621
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,720
Tharn, San will be here for dinner tonight.

622
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,320
Didn't you say you wanted to talk to him?

623
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,380
Well,

624
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,860
please apologize to him for me.

625
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,920
I'm leaving, and I don't know when I'll be back.

626
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,420
Bye.

627
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:44,360
Brother Thorn, why is Brother Tharn leaving in such a hurry?

628
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,380
Judging by his happy face,

629
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,510
it's not hard to tell who he is looking for.

630
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,530
Well, that's about his happiness.

631
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,060
How can we stop him?

632
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,570
Okay, I'll go prepare the food.

633
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,950
You're late.

634
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,080
Am I late?

635
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,270
Yes.

636
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,720
I thought you would show up

637
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,000
as soon as I texted you.

638
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,380
I called you several times,

639
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,040
but you didn't answer.

640
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,130
And I'm not a dog

641
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:00,260
that will run over right away when the owner is back.

642
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,240
Aren't you?

643
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,530
No, I'm not.

644
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,780
But I'm your boyfriend.

645
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,250
What's this?

646
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,000
It's a gift to welcome you back.

647
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,230
Well,

648
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,250
have you forgotten anything?

649
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,350
What?

650
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,060
This...

651
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,040
I didn't forget.

652
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,850
It's you, you're too late.

653
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,320
Sorry.

654
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,770
I'm late.

655
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,100
Why didn't you tell me beforehand that you're in Bangkok?

656
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,000
You just came in all of a sudden.

657
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:54,000
You said you were going back, then you suddenly came to see me.

658
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,980
There's no one in the dorm today.

659
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,400
[What? I told you I was going to see you.]

660
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,420
[Besides, I want to see your friend.]

661
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:07,520
You said you wanted to go back to Phang Nga, but you didn't say you'd come to me.

662
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,100
[It's the same.]

663
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,700
[We won't see each other for 4 months.]

664
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,350
[Let me see you and say goodbye.]

665
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,280
You just want to skip work, right?

666
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,220
[If I dare to do so,]

667
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,020
[your mother will chop my head off.]

668
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,000
Talk nicely to mom first.

669
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:25,070
Tell her to drive carefully.

670
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,190
Bye.

671
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,680
No "baby" this time?

672
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:32,790
You punk.

673
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,510
Is your dad coming to you later?

674
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:41,550
Yes. My aunt is in the hospital.

675
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,540
But she said she's getting better.

676
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,360
So they went back today.

677
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,410
Actually, my dad wants to see you.

678
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,030
What?

679
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,900
You don't have to panic.

680
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,790
He just wants to meet my roommate.

681
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,070
Oh.

682
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,230
You thought I've told them about us?

683
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,470
I'm looking forward to something I shouldn't have.

684
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:22,700
I'm sorry.

685
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,260
For what?

686
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:32,400
Well, this is going to be a secret forever.

687
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,130
I know.

688
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:40,100
You won't tell anyone no matter what.

689
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,370
Are you mad at me?

690
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:47,290
Is it that important?

691
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:52,020
Whether I tell others or not, I'm your boyfriend.

692
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,590
You might think it's not important,

693
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:58,290
but to me,

694
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:00,850
it is a big deal.

695
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,230
I just want to tell others

696
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,250
that you belong to me.

697
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,540
That's all.

[Menu]

699
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,630
Here, order.

700
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,650
You said you wanted it.

701
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,870
A large portion of sashimi, cold salmon,

702
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:42,420
and 2 of each tuna sushi rolls.

703
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,500
Do you want rice?

704
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:46,220
I think no. You get full easily with rice.

705
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,310
Two miso soup, please.

706

What else do you want?

707
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,040
You only order raw food?

708
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,280
I want grilled mackerel.

709
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,580
One grilled mackerel?

710
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,470
Yes.

711
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,740
Hey, I haven't finished yet.

712
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,530
We won't be able to finish it later.

713
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,090
You eat like a bird.

714
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:08,080
Do you want to compete with me?

715
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,880
The food is here. Let's see who eats more.

716
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,640
Nonsense.

717
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,770
By the way,

718
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,270
your hair has grown.

719
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,920
My skin is tanned too.

720
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:23,900
I know.

721
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,410
I can see the shape of your swimming trunks.

722
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,570
Hey, what are you thinking about?

723
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,030
Nothing.

724
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:38,220
Hey, we ordered a lot, can you finish all of it?

725
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,570
Of course, they're my favorite.

726
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,120
I hope so.

727
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,780
Here. You want it, right?

728
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,150
You don't have to coax me in such a cute way.

729
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:55,190
I'm not a girl.

730
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,630
I'm not coaxing you because you're a girl,

731
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,180
but because you're my boyfriend.

732
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:13,270
Uh, whatever. Thank you for the food.

733
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,790
Let's eat.

734

Here.

735
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,020
I've been craving this for a long time.

736
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,530
Look.

737
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:27,920
It's thick.

738
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:32,140
Is it good?

739
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:33,940
Wonderful.

740
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,470
Eat up.

743
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,270
for the grilled mackerel.

744
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:46,360
You had nothing since last night. What are you waiting for?

745
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,640
Come on. Let's eat.

746

00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,390
I'm not a girl.

749
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,180
I know how to coax you, too.

750
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:00,850
I'm sorry about earlier.

-What do you think?
-What?

755
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:11,980
Is it good?

756
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,990
-Come. Have more.
-What?

757
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,150
It's good.

758

Eat.

759
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:24,210
That's right.

760
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:26,770
Do you want more?

761
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,870
No, thanks.

762
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,100
Why aren't you eating? Is it not good?

763
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,420
It's good.

764
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,820
Why are you sleeping like this?

765
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:43,460
I'll wait for you over there.

766
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,790
Type, wait.

767
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:48,720
Let go of me!

768
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,340
If I let go, you'll run away.

769
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,580
It's not just about me.

770
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,460
Okay, I won't go.

771
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,360
But don't talk like you did last time.

772
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,040
Okay.

773
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,370
What did I say last time?

774
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,150
That was a misunderstanding.

775
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,410
But if she says it again,

776
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,230
this time, she's right.

777
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,120
Okay.

778
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,700
Which one do you like?

779
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,380
They're all the same, it's just for sleep.

780
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,460
It's different, sir.

781
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,710
The material is different.

782
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,340
Wait, are you the guys who came here last time?

783
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,240
I remember you guys.

784
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,640
-Yes.
-Yes.

785
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,990
Do you want to try sitting on it?

786
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:45,460
Go ahead.

787
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:47,530
We have to sleep together anyway.

788
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:48,940
Nonsense.

789
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:52,440
We live in the same dorm.

790
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,490
What did I say wrong?

791
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:55,140
Do you live together?

792
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:56,910
Yes.

793
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:01,260
So we're here to buy a new mattress

794
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,960
for the new house.

795
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,250
Oh.

796
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,570
Then I'll introduce you to the latex mattress, is that okay?

797
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,820
It's more expensive than other materials,

798
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:12,930
but you get more than what you paid.

799
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:13,700
Sure.

800
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,010
Because you have the weight of two boys lying in bed at the same time,

801
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:19,710
the pressure will be heavier compared to girls.

802
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:21,350
If it's a spring mattress,

803
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:24,470
you'll hear a crunching sound when you move your body.

804
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,580
Oh.

805
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,520
There will be problems with the spring too.

806
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,170
I don't think it's suitable for you if it's too heavy.

807
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,900
Or do you want to try the foam mattress?

808
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:34,070
Foam mattress?

809
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:37,560
Yes, it's cheaper than latex mattresses.

810
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,710
It has good support, but it's not durable.

811
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,740
Okay.

812
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,080
Go follow her and choose it.

813
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,280
I'll answer the phone.

814
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:47,930
Are you leaving me alone?

815
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,220
-Okay.
-This way, please.

816

Didn't you ask Brother Thorn out?

[But you should know I want to see you.]

[Is there anything you want recently?]

00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,830
No, I'm embarrassed to ask for it.

824
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,910
[Don't be like that, Tharn.]

825
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,900
[You know I don't like to guess what you want for birthday.]

826
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,360
[So tell me. What do you want?]

827
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:33,000
I really don't want anything.

828
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,250
[Well, if you don't like the gift, don't take it to heart, then.]

829
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,610
Alright.

831
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,930
What's wrong with you with that cry?

832
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,180
Are you free the day before school?

833
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,170
The day before school...

834
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,090
Oh.

835
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:26,850
You know it, right?

836
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:38,900
The day before school.

00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,050
I'm free during the day.

In the evening, I have to go home.

Go home?

Yes.

00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:50,060
It's a rule set by my mom.

842
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,620
You can celebrate your birthday with anyone,

843
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,360
but dinner time must be spent with family.

844
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:02,010
So I have to go home for dinner.

845
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:06,440
What if you're dating someone?

846
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:08,430
My mom said I could bring them home

847
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,780
if I'm seeing someone.

848
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,200
If they ask,

849
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:19,700
"Shouldn't you pay more attention to your other half?"

850
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,840
My mom said to answer

851
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:27,280
that my birthday is her suffering day because she gave birth to me.

852
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,970
So the person who can make a choice

853
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,480
is my mom.

854
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:36,330
My mom also said

855
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,520
to tell them this if they don't understand.

856
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,540
If we don't love our family,

857
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,370
how can we love others?

858
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,350
So...

859
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,700
Go to my house with me.

860
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,740
What?

861
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:57,480
Come to my house on my birthday.

862
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,320
Have you forgotten?

863
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,070
I already told my family.

864
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:03,540
What?

865
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:15,530
I confessed to my family when I was in grade 12.

866
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,600
My family knows that I'm gay.

867
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,100
Don't be like this.

868
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,360
Let's make it clear first.

869
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,100
I think we've made it clear.

870
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,640
Come to my house as my birthday gift.

871
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,880
I haven't made it clear yet.

872
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,160
I'm not going to your house.

873
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,310
Even if your family knows about your sexuality,

874
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:01,340
I'm not shameless enough yet.

875
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:04,480
Just because I can go to your house to announce that I'm your boyfriend,

876
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:10,200
and your parents can accept who you are,

877
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:14,130
it doesn't mean they can accept their son's bedmate.

878
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:20,590
Type.

879
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:26,080
Just be my boyfriend.

880
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,460
You're not my bedmate.

881
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,850
Just tell me what you want.

882
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,160
But I'm not going to your house.

883
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,370
I said what I wanted.

884
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,170
When did you say that?

885
00:58:41,170 --> 00:58:42,480
I've been listening.

886
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,960
I told you, but you didn't listen.

887
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,170
Stop dawdling.

888
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,450
I want...

889
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:10,880
You.

890
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,650
You already got it.

891
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,420
Here comes the cake.

892
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,450
Look.

893
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,140
Happy birthday, Brother Tharn.

894
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,230
Thank you.

895
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:54,790
[Happy birthday. No matter how many years have passed, you're always important to me.]

896
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,390
Who gave it to him?

897
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,530
Speak of the devil.

898
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,480
But who's next to him?

899
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:08,140
I'm his first and only one.
