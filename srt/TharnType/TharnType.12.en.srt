My mom took our Princess to practice playing piano.

59

Brother Thorn, do you still call  Thanya "Princess"?

What's wrong with it?

61

I'm going to keep calling her that.

That's cute.

63

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,790
Yes.

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,409
Well...

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,300
How is Tharn?

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,140
Wait for me.

I'll get him.

I'll tell you what.

80
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,410
Tharn's friend is just like my younger brother.

81
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,550
If you like this place,

82
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,800
you can come here often.

83
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll come often, then.

84
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,350
No problem.

85
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,370
Then Tharn...

86
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,030
Tharn is sleeping.

87
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,980
He must be tired after all these scenarios.

88
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,260
He probably doesn't even want to see me.

89
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,740
Don't be mad at him.

90
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,330
He's been through a lot.

91
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,620
Okay.

92
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,290
I've never been mad at him.

93
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,930
Anyway, I apologize on behalf of Tharn.

94
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,930
And thank you

95
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,750
for staying by his side as a friend.

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,160

It's okay.

99
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,000
I think I should leave first.

100
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,040
Ask Tharn to call me

101
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,440
when he wakes up, okay?

102
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,040
Okay.

103
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,400
I'll go back, then.

104
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,020
Bye.

105
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,600
Bye.

106
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,040
Good luck.

107
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,250
I've always been by his side.

108
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,950
But he never needed me.

109
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,100
He's just sitting there.

110
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,290
Here.

111
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,040
I bought it for you.

112
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,060
Thank you.

113
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,100
So,

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,090

115
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,860
Like I told you.

116
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,900
Type, sometimes I don't understand you either.

117
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,630
Why are you enduring all this pain?

118
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,500
I'm not in pain.

119
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,520
Well, judging by your dark circles,

120
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,600
you must have slept so well last night.

121
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,500
An angel sang you a lullaby, right?

122
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,140

123
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,960

I've been looking for you.

125
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,670
What is it?

126
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,020
Did you fight with someone?

127
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,960
No, why?

128
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,820
I saw someone waiting in front of the academic building,

129
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,680
looking for Type from the first year.

130
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,310
So I come to tell you right away.

131
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,650
Who was waiting for me?

132
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,710
I don't know. I didn't ask for his name.

133
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,490
But he's handsome and draws a lot of attention from the girls.

134
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,550
I'll go have a look.

135
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,250
I'll be right back.

136
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,060
What's wrong with him?

137
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,980
Honestly, Champ, I don't know either.

138
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,610
I'm confused.

139
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,430
Whose drink is this? Can I drink it?

140
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,090
Yes, drink it.

141
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,690
How is it? Let's find something to eat.

142
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,220
Okay, let's go.

143
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,650
Let's go.

144
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,550

I want to talk to you.

I'll get straight to the point.

149
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,690
Why did you break up with Tharn?

150
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,340
I'm asking you,

151
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,500
why did you break up with Tharn?

152
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,670
I'm sorry.

153
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,460
I don't want to get involved in your business.

154
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,700
I just...

155
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,190
My brother is in a terrible situation.

156
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,320
How is Tharn doing, brother?

157
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,840
If you still love him,

158
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,780
why did you break up with him?

159
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,610
It's over.

160
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,420
But Tharn can't get over it.

161
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,820
I pity my brother.

162

Do you know

163
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,060
what he looked like when he came home?

164
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,040
He cried.

165
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,960
My brother, who never cries, cried.

166
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,390
And he kept asking what he did wrong.

167
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,550
What did he do wrong?

168
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,690
Why did Type break up with him?

169
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,590
I don't understand.

170
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,000
Weren't you two on good terms at home last time?

171

What actually happened?

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm sorry.

173
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,300
I didn't mean to yell at you.

174
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,369
I just...

175
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,530
When

176
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,890
Tharn was still a child,

177
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,170
he was very clingy to me.

178
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,350
He's like a magnet.

179
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,320
We were always together,

180
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,750
and we played together too.

181
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,140
Then my parents had Princess.

182
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,190
He could tell

183
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,840
that he's not the youngest anymore.

184
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,370
He acted more maturely,

185
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,360
and he no longer clung to me and acted cute.

186
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,110
Everyone teased him,

187
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:11,440
saying that he became a brother with the birth of his younger sister.

188
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,320
He's willing to sacrifice himself for his sister.

189
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,720
But he can't lose you.

190
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,330
He never cried when our attention

191
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,930
was shifted to Princess.

192
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,070
But when he broke up with you, he cried his heart out.

193
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,860
Please answer my question.

194
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,610
What's wrong with my brother?

195
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,510
Why did you break up with him?

196
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,000
I won't get involved in your matter anymore.

197
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,040
Is he that bad, brother?

198
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,590
He's terrible.

199
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:02,380
Everything I've done,

200
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,730
I did it for Tharn.

201
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,590
You did it for Tharn?

202
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,880
Can you promise me

203
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,190
not to tell Tharn

204
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,050
if I tell you this?

205
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,980
What do you mean?

206
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,930
Promise me first.

207
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:26,680
Okay,

208
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,000
I promise you.

209
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,450
Lhong, is Tharn not picking up?

210
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,660
Yes.

211
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,320
What's going on?

212
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,190
He's been gone for days.

213
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,930
Damn it, he's so irresponsible.

214
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,190
Don't badmouth him, okay?

215
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:08,930
Why?

216
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,540
Why can't I?

217
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,610
You saw it, he didn't come to the rehearsal.

218
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,420
Let me tell you.

219
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,550
No matter how good he is,

220
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,300
no one would want to work with him

221
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,870
when he is this lazy.

222
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,590
Then quit!

223
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,430
Don't do this, Brother Lhong. Calm down. Don't fight.

224
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,760
Don't think I'll beg you.

225
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,920
You know who's the best in this band.

226
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,040
It's neither me nor Song.

227
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,510
Most importantly,

228
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,390
it is not you either.

229
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,770
Tharn is the best.

230
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,550
It is Tharn who made us a team.

231
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,450
If you want to quit,

232
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,330
you're welcome to.

233
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,040
Do you know how many people want to play music with Tharn?

234
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,600
-Brother Lhong.
-How dare you talk to me like that!

235
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,130
Stop it! Enough!

236
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,550
Enough, Brother Tae.

237
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,920
Brother Lhong, don't say that.

238
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,350
We'd better go home today. We'll talk after you've calmed down.

239
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:21,360
Fine. I'm doing this for Song's sake.

240
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,040
You're provoking me, huh?

241
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,090
You want to fight?

242
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,230
-Brother Tae, that's enough. Calm down.
-Come back. Get back here.

243
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,700
Brother Tae, that's enough.

244
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,540
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

245
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,820
Look at him.

246
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,160
You know it too, Lhong is worried about Brother Tharn.

247
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,850
We can't get in touch with Brother Tharn now.

248
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,340
And Brother Lhong was already in a bad mood.

249
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,220
You're taking their side because they're your idols, right?

250
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,070
Stop laughing. What's so funny?

251
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,500
Are you feeling better?

252
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,530
Let's resume the practice.

253
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,350
Then no one can say a thing about us.

254
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,480
Go on.

255
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,410
Darn it.

256
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,330
I thought it was a ghost.

257
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,570
What are you doing here?

258
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,990
How long are you going to watch this video?

259
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,310
What am I doing, No?

260
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,860
If you're asking for the answer you gave me,

261
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,740
you're doing this for Tharn.

262
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,810
Yes.

263
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,090
I'm doing this for Tharn.

264
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,350
Even if he hates me from now on.

265
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,130
He never hates you.

266
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,680
But he will hate me later.

267
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,750
Type.

268
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,760
Three times.

269
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,310
What 3 times?

270
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,360
I'll only break up with him 3 times in my life.

271
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,970
Type.

272
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
Go to sleep.

273
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,280
You have to help me tomorrow.

274
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,220
I don't want to help you.

275
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,760
But I have no choice because we are friends.

276
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,280
It's too late to break with you now.

277
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,500
Thank you.

278
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,810
When it's my turn next time,

279
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,320
you need to help me too.

280
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,540
Okay.

281
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,830
Why are you being so emotional?

282
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,130
It's late.

283
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,650
You can go to bed now.

284
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,260
I'm sleepy.

285
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Turn off the light for me.

286
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,820
Okay.

287
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,720
Damn it.

288
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,460
It's okay.

289
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,550
He won't be like this for long.

290
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,010
Give him some time, Lhong.

291
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,440
Lhong.

292
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,970
Type.

293
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,010
What's wrong?

294
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,280
We haven't met for days. How have you been?

295
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,590
I'm fine.

296
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,890
What about you?

297
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,010
I think you should reconsider

298
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,230
about breaking up with Tharn.

299
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,710
Do you really think so?

300
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,460
What do you mean?

301
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,330
If I apologize to Tharn,

302
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,080
do you think he will forgive me?

303
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,500
I told you that day,

304
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,460
you should think carefully about breaking up.

305
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,620
I'm afraid it's too late if you want to get back with him now.

306
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,010
At first, he couldn't let go.

307
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,690
But he's much better now.

308
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,230
He also told me

309
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,180
that he has let you go.

310
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,910
If you want to get back with him now...

311
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,990
I think I'd better not say it.

312
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,420
Go ahead.

313
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,990
Because there's nothing that can hurt me more.

314
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,670
He told me

315
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,610
that even if you apologize to him,

316
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,500
he doesn't want to see your face anymore.

317
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:07,470
Did he say that?

318
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,110
Yes.

319
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,210
I heard it with my own ears.

320
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,560
What if I don't believe you?

321
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,150
You don't have to trust me.

322
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,990
But my friend is not stupid.

323
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,120
You hurt him so bad.

324
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,090
I'm afraid he won't forgive you easily.

325
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,050
And you even fell into Tar's trap.

326
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,170
I don't think Tharn wants to have his heart broken anymore.

327
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,490
I'm sorry for telling you the truth.

328
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,060
I'm telling you because

329
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,530
I'm doing this for you and Tharn.

330
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,660
Go to hell.

331
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,460
What's wrong with you?

332
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,060
You're so much worse than I thought.

333
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,130
What is this, Type?

334
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,800
You got into a fight with Tharn and took it out on me?

335
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,360
You're such a liar.

336
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,150
I'm really stupid

337
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,490
for believing you for so long.

338
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,660
You've gone too far.

339
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,000
Am I?

340
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,330
Wasn't it too much for you to hire someone

341
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,780
to bully a 10th-grade student?

342
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,820
What are you talking about?

343
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,440
I have no idea.

344
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,200
Stop lying.

345
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,790
Tar and I have talked.

346
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,320
I know all the dirty things you did.

347
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,750
No matter what,

348
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,280
I'll be the reason you break up.

349
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,850
What do you mean?

350
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,010
Answer me.

351
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,160
-Type.
-What do you mean?

352
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:13,840
Type.

353
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,380
Answer me.

354
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,160
I was forced.

355
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,830
What do you mean by that?

356
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,080
Type.

357
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:23,710
Do you believe him?

358
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,060
Be quiet, Brother No.

359
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,950
I can't tell you.

360
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,770
If you don't tell me,

361
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,030
it means you did what you've done

362
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,040
because you hate Tharn, right?

363
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,740
I don't hate him.

364
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,200
I love him.

365
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,780
Don't talk trash if you know nothing.

366
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,890
Then tell me.

367
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,770
In the end,

368
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,210
I couldn't run away from the fact that I was sexually assaulted by them.

369
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,400
Do you believe the words

370
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,330
of the one who made you break up with Tharn?

371
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,420
You're more stupid than I thought.

372
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:16,380
I'm not stupid.

373
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:19,510
Tar showed me the video.

374
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,030
Enough.

375
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,240
So...

376
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,770
Tar is the brother of Tharn's former bandmate?

377
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,870
Let me summarize it for you.

378
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,610
Okay.

379
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,380
Tar is the younger brother of Tharn's former bandmate.

380
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,990
He fell in love with Tharn

381
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,140
when he first met him.

382
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,620
And he asked him out.

383
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,560
Tharn agreed.

384
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,620
But when it was around their first anniversary,

385
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:22,150
Tharn asked him to meet at a hotel.

386
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,780
He drank the wine the waiter gave him

387
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,860
because he thought that was from Tharn.

388
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,870
In the end,

389
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,360
he woke up and found himself

390
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,540
lying in bed with 3 men who had just sexually assaulted him.

391
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,870
Do you believe him?

392
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,160
But he threw up.

393
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,980
I'm afraid he's acting.

394
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,770
No.

395
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,940
I don't think he's acting.

396
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,700
I'm sure about it.

397
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,780
You sure?

398
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,770
It looks like I consented to it no matter what, right？

399
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,990
That's why I didn't dare to tell Brother Tharn.

400
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,440
He will definitely hate me.

401
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,730
When I woke up,

402
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:21,960
I found those men around me.

403
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,660
[Gross.]

404
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,700
[Disgusting.]

405
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,710
[It stinks.]

406
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,350
Dirty.

407
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,210
Stop it.

408
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,730
Please don't break up with Brother Tharn.

409
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,140
Don't let his plan succeed.

410
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,930
Who is he?

411
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,680
He's

412
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,680
someone that Brother Tharn trusts

413
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,310
more than you and me.

414
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,990
He has always been by Brother Tharn's side,

415
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,740
but I didn't notice it.

416
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,469
Don't tell me

417
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,650
that it's Lhong?

418
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,449
He's the brain behind this.

419
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,340
He wants to hurt you the way he hurts me.

420
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,590
But he can never hurt me.

421
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,010
And he will regret messing with the wrong person.

422
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,840
It's a good thing that we can see all the bastards' faces in the video.

423
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,350
And also, I'm lucky

424
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:50,489
because my friend happens to know those bastards.

425
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,270
If I give them money,

426
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,870
they'll be willing to say it.

427
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,460
And we'll know who hired them.

428
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,400
What does that have to do with me?

429
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,470
Did they tell you I did it?

430
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,470
No.

431
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,030
But I'll give the video to Tharn.

432
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,160
No,

433
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,020
tell me,

434
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,730
is Tharn really dating Type?

435
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,430
Is this the right time to ask?

436
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,250
I'll tell you everything later.

437
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:35,070
Hold your phone properly.

438
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,210
Type told me to record the whole thing.

439
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,690
Tharn will never trust you.

440
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,690
Even if he doesn't,

441
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,480
at least he will know the truth about Tar.

442
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,280
Do you think a good guy like Tharn

443
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,240
will just sit back and do nothing

444
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,780
if he finds out his ex was framed?

445
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,260
Even if he doesn't forgive me,

446
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,120
he would still go back to Tar.

447
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,160
As for you,

448
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,670
you will always be someone who's aiming for the moon.

449
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,660
You better start thinking of an excuse to tell Tharn now.

450
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,010
You can never do that.

451
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,630
Do you hear me?

452
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,960
You can never beat me.

453
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,880
No!

454
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,450
Oh, my god. What's going on? What should we do?

455
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,990
Should I go and help him?

456
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,090
No. Let's focus on taking the video

457
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,500
until Lhong admits he did it.

458
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,740
You grab it. I'll go help him.

459
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,490
No, you can't go.

460
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,620
You have to keep shooting.

461
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,110
Just wait a bit more.

462
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,800
Keep holding your phone. I beg you.

463
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,610
Gosh.

464
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,770
Did you hear that?

465
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,890
You can never beat me.

466
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,060
He's mine.

467
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,740
Did you hear that?

468
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,340
Did you hear that? He's mine.

469
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,240
I've been by his side for 4 years.

470
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,000
And he has never deemed you valuable for the past 4 years.

471
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,980
Shut up!

472
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,700
Shut up!

473
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,500
Shut up!

474
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,030
Tharn will never love you.

475
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,180
Remember.

476
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,240
You know nothing. Shut up!

477
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,290
I'm not like those bitches.

478
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,700
They all lost trust in Tharn

479
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,580
once I said something.

480
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,190
Unlike me.

481
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,560
I believe in everything about Tharn.

482
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,610
I'm the only one who loves him.

483
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:05,890
No one suits him better than me.

484
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,460
But you have no right to hurt Tar.

485
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,160
I have no right?

486
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,070
Tar said that Tharn loves him the most.

487
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,510
But as you can see,

488
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,390
he begged those men to make out with him all night.

489
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,730
You're a bastard.

490
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,330
Tharn will never want you.

491
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,870
Then you should die.

492
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,080
If it's not because of you,

493
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,550
Tharn wouldn't be like this.

494
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,590
He wouldn't have become like this.

495
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,280
It's all your fault.

496
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,760
It's all your fault!

497
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,000
Did you hear that? It's all your fault.

498
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,190
You're a loser.

499
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,130
I didn't lose.

500
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
I won.

501
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,090
You lost.

502
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,160
Go to hell!

503
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,750
Lhong, stop!

504
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,410
Tharn!

505
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,250
Lhong!

506
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,430
Go to hell!

507
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,490
Type!

508
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,360
Are you okay?

509
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,260
I'm fine.

510
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,540
Why are you here?

511
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:27,860
We'll talk about this later.

512
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,860
I'm glad you're okay.

513
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,240
Tharn.

514
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,880
Tharn.

515
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,810
Tharn.

516
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,070
No.

517
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,510
Please take care of Type.

518
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:57,950
Okay.

519
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,570
Calm down, okay?

520
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,120
Tharn.

521
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,300
Don't look at me like that.

522
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,040
It's me, your best friend, Lhong.

523
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,590
Tharn.

524
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,180
Don't look at me like that.

525
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,050
What have you done?

526
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,820
I didn't do anything.

527
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,330
I didn't do anything.

528
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,710
How could you do this to me, Lhong?

529
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,430
Tharn.

530
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,050
I didn't do anything.

531
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,690
He made me angry.

532
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,800
So I feel angry for you.

533
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,190
Trust me.

534
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,970
Trust me, Tharn.

535
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,710
Trust you?

536
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,020
You want me to believe

537
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,430
someone who hurts everyone around me?

538
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,730
Tharn.

539
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,150
Do you trust them but not me?

540
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,160
I'm always by your side, Tharn.

541
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,850
Everything I've done, I did it for you.

542
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,890
For me?

543
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,600
You said you're doing this for me?

544
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,030
Because no one deserves you.

545
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,830
It's none of your business.

546
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,300
No one truly loves you, Tharn.

547
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,640
No one deserves you.

548
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:51,940
I want you to meet a good person.

549
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,600
So I tested him.

550
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,440
But none of them deserves you.

551
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,740
They are all bad guys.

552
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,940
Just now,

553
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,360
what did you say you've done to them?

554
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,230
What have you done to them, Lhong?

555
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,670
I just said that you've had a change of heart,

556
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,500
and none of them believe you anymore.

557
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,270
Unlike me.

558
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,870
No matter how you lie to me,

559
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,120
I still trust you.

560
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,840
I'll always be by your side.

561
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:44,920
Of course it has to be me.

562
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,950
It has to be me.

563
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,440
It has to be me, Tharn.

564
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,000
I know you.

565
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,390
I know you think that I'm important too.

566
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,010
You can break up with them,

567
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,160
but you can't break with me.

568
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,530
You can have no boyfriend,

569
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,640
but you can't live without a friend like me.

570
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:30,870
I know.

571
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,910
I know you love me too.

572
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,050
You are very important to me.

573
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,060
But it's not what you think.

574
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,520
It's not true.

575
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,490
It's not true.

576
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:06,510
It's not true.

577
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,340
I always trust you.

578
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,180
But you hurt Tar.

579
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,950
You hurt all of them.

580
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:18,810
Tar?

581
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:23,480
He doesn't love you for real.

582
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:25,990
I can prove it.

583
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,970
He can have sex with any man.

584
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:38,330
You'll see how happy he is.

585
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,510
I feel disgusted

586
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,770
seeing you with Tar.

587
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,060
Tar doesn't love you.

588
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,850
All he wants is a man.

589
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,440
I have the video.

590
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,520
I have the video, I can send it to you.

591
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,710
Look at his slutty...

592
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:25,290
It's my fault.

593
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,560
I hurt the kid.

594
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,660
If I hadn't been with Tar,

595
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:38,940
this wouldn't have happened to him.

596
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,580
Stop blaming yourself, Tharn.

597
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:50,130
He's the one responsible for it, not you.

598
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,890
Don't touch him.

599
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,640
Stay away from my friend.

600
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,360
Tharn.

601
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,310
I'll quit.

602
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,090
What are you talking about?

603
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,680
You can't quit.

604
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,870
You said you love music.

605
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:28,050
You can't quit, Tharn.

606
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,340
You can't.

607
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,340
Everything started because of me.

608
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,490
Because I'm friends with Lhong.

609
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,690
Because I was Tar's boyfriend.

610
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,440
It's all my fault.

611
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:49,090
I must be responsible.

612
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,650
Stop trying to be a hero.

613
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,020
He's the one

614
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,820
who should be responsible, not you.

615
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,600
You really want to break up with me, isn't it?

616
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:01,880
No, Type.

617
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:04,660
Don't break up with me.

618
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,910
Don't break up with me, Type.

619
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,410
Did you hear that?

620
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,610
How many more times do you have to hurt him?

621
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,790
You break him up with all the ones he loves,

622
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,850
and now you're taking music, his favorite thing, away from him?

623
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,540
No, Tharn.

624
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,970
You can't quit.

625
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,650
You can’t give up music.

626
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,750
You can’t give up playing the drum.

627
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,620
You told me you love music.

628
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,700
Stop pestering Tharn.

629
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,280
Tharn.

630
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,470
Look at me.

631
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,650
Look at me.

632
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,580
I'm your best friend, Lhong.

633
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:12,000
-Please don't ignore me.
-I told you to stop pestering Tharn.

634
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,220
Tharn.

635
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,400
I love you, Tharn.

636
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,230
I love you, Tharn. I love you.

637
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,320
But I don't love you.

638
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,530
Type.

639
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,000
Let's get out of here.

640
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:01,490
Okay?

641
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:03,990
Let's go.

642
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:05,440
Enough.

643
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,090
Let's go.

644
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,570
Let's go, Tharn.

645
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,360
You don't have to quit.

646
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:21,560
I will.

647
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,050
If I can't be with you,

648
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,980
everything is meaningless.

649
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,590
I'll quit.

650
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,750
I can't take music away from you.

651
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,660
I really can't take it away from you, Tharn.

652
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,540
Tharn.

653
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:06,460
Tharn.

654
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,960
Tharn, I love you.

655
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,670
Tharn.

656
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,680
Tharn, I love you.

657
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,240
I love you, Tharn.

658
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,310
Tharn.

659
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,960
Surprise! I'm back from Germany!

660
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:34,600
Lhong!

661
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,620
What happened?

662
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,660
Why are you crying?

663
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,850
Why was I brought to this world?

664
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,250
Are you crazy?

665
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,330
If no one is going to love or care about me,

666
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,620
why was I brought to this world?

667
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,980
What are you talking about?

668
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,000
Are you crazy?

669
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,660
Mom and dad don't love me,

670
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,490
you and brother don't care about me either.

671
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,020
If you don't see me as your son,

672
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,990
you see no value in me as your brother.

673
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:21,700
Why don't you just let me die?

674
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,390
Why am I still alive?

675
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,590
It hurts.

676
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,480
I'm in pain.

677
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,200
Does anyone know about that?

678
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:39,730
Now even Tharn has left me.

679
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,580
Why am I still alive?

680
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:45,120
I don't want to live anymore.

681
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,480
Just let me die, sister.

682
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,100
Because I have nothing now.

683
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,420
Who said you have nothing? You still have me.

684
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,210
I know you hate me too.

685
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,630
No.

686
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,390
I've never hated you.

687
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,470
It's not true.

688
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:16,540
I don't believe it.

689
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,520
Believe it or not, I'm still your sister.

690
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:26,530
My absence doesn't mean that I don't love you.

691
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:29,020
If I don't love you,

692
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:31,960
I won't let you cry on my expensive clothes.

693
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:43,380
I'm sorry.

694
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:48,590
Your brother and I didn't know you were in so much pain.

695
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,280
I love you.

696
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:14,280
Sister.

697
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:21,770
I'm sorry.

698
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,710
-It's okay.
-Sister.

699
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,690
I'm sorry.

700
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,770
Be gentle.

701
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:43,430
Just a little.

702
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:47,480
Be gentle. It hurts.

703
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,230
I'm almost done.

704
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,920
I'm sure it was Lhong when I pretended to be drunk

705
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,760
during the drinking with him.

706
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,110
I told him that you belonged to me.

707
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,690
And his expression has confirmed to me

708
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,540
that he is the one behind all of this.

709
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:25,010
I'm sorry.

710
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,330
You

711
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:35,750
won't say that word to me again, right?

712
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:44,810
No, I won't.

713
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:47,810
I've learned a lesson.

714
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:55,920
You're not the only one who's sad.

715
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,040
I'm so sad that I'm losing my mind too.

716
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:03,930
When I said that we should break up,

717
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,890
my heart ached too.

718
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,030
I'm sorry.

719
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,090
I was too willful.

720
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:30,070
But I just

721
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,340
want you to keep your eyes open.

722
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:34,370
No said

723
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,510
that there's no need to do that.

724
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,380
Just don't play along with Lhong's game.

725
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:44,340
But I can't stand Lhong lying to you.

726
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,380
And I

727
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,690
don't want to wait until the day he makes us break up.

728
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,080
That's why

729
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,440
you broke up with me first, right?

730
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,890
I'm sorry.

731
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,600
You hurt me.

732
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:12,990
I'm sorry.

733
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,320
You're driving me crazy.

734
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,000
I'm sorry.

735
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,200
My family is so worried.

736
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,730
What do you want?

737
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:31,160
I begged you, but you still left me.

738
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:33,070
I didn’t go to class for a week,

739
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,990
and I didn’t go to Khong’s bar for the performance.

740
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,550
Sorry.

741
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,120
If Brother Thorn didn't tell me,

742
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,250
I wouldn't have known it until now.

743
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,360
This Brother Thorn...

744
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:49,400
He promised me not to tell you.

745
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,020
You have to make up for your mistakes.

746
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,320
What do you want me to do?

747
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:00,340
Do you want me to kneel down and apologize?

748
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,350
You have to make up with me.

749
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,700
And be with me forever.

750
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,240
Okay.

751
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,990
Let's date

752
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,000
until we die.

753
00:59:55,330 --> 01:00:01,480
Oh, right. I didn't say that I did't want to get deeper with you

754
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,650
because I really wanted to break up with you.

755
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,730
But I'm worried

756
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,650
that I would stop the plan because I love you.

757
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,580
What did you say?

758
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,440
Why are you asking me again?

759
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,510
Because you said you love me just now.

760
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:28,580
Have I never said I love you?

761
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,790
No, you haven't.

762
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,320
Then let's just say I did.

763
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:38,990
Hey, Type.

764
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,470
Stop playing the fool.

765
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,290
Say it again.

766
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,620
Okay?

767
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,580
Okay?

768
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:49,810
Alright.

769
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,490
Listen carefully.

770
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,430
I'll only say it once.

771
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:11,690
I love you, bastard Tharn.

772
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,950
Crybaby.

773
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,790
Why are you crying?

774
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,210
Come here.

775
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,740
Be gentle.

776
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,150
Then don't move.

777
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,270
You hurt me.

778
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,830
Don't you like pain?

779
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:26,480
Why are you complaining now?

780
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,040
How many punches did you get hit with?

781
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,150
I don't know.

782
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:37,260
I lost count after the third punch.

783
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,870
He may seem weak,

784
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,200
but his fist was super powerful.

785
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,050
You can hit me.

786
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:49,050
You want to be the good guy again, huh?

787
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,280
Can you beat Lhong for me?

788
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,640
If you can, I'll call you a hero.

789
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,530
You can't do it either.

790
01:03:03,890 --> 01:03:05,510
He's still your friend no matter what.

791
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,650
It's not that I can't do it.

792
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:13,180
But I...

793
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:17,710
I don't want to see him again.

794
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,010
I don't want to know what he did behind my back.

795
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,420
Or who he hurt.

796
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:31,780
Forget it.

797
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,820
Lhong wasn't like this before.

798
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:44,050
He was quiet and didn't talk to anyone.

799
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,780
I approached him first.

800
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:51,160
But I envied him at that time.

801
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,560
His family is lenient with him.

802
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:55,960
He can do whatever he wants.

803
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,490
He can learn anything he wants.

804
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:01,550
But now,

805
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,980
I realized

806
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,100
that it's not worth being envious.

807
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,010
In fact, no one cares about him.

808
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,040
Lhong once told me

809
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:15,910
that he wasn't lonely

810
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,150
because I was with him.

811
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:31,020
I should know how he feels.

812
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,220
I've atoned for your sins.

813
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,310
It's your turn to atone.

814
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:54,880
How?

815
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:57,680
Like this.

816
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:29,740
Do you want more?

817
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:32,080
Don't ask.

818
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,610
It's your ex-boyfriend.

819
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:12,930
Tar?

820
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:24,670
Yes.

821
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,100
No told him everything.

822
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,960
So he wants to apologize for causing our quarrel.

823
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:34,770
Also,

824
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:37,250
he's going to study in France.

825
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:42,780
Is that so?

826
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:44,610
Why?

827
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,760
Are you sad?

828
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:49,750
No.

829
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:52,800
Don't make trouble.

830
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,480
I'm not.

831
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:59,780
By the way, he told me

832
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,710
that he was willing to tell me everything

833
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,680
because he had planned to study abroad at that time.

834
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:10,230
It's good that it's over.

835
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:20,370
What's wrong?

836
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:26,330
Tell Tar

837
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:33,730
that I'm sorry for everything.

838
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,470
Okay.

839
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,880
I'm not the type to get jealous without reasons.

840
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:50,230
I knew a hero like you would say that.

841
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,550
Are you going to tell him yourself or I'll tell him for you?

842
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,070
Tell him for me.

843
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,710
Okay.

844
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:10,300
Let's go. I'm hungry.

845
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:22,950
[I'm not brave enough in this life. Let's meet again in our next life.]

846
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:19,120
Dream on.

847
01:08:19,649 --> 01:08:23,189
You can never beat me, no matter if it's in this life or the next.

848
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:26,240
Why are you talking to yourself?

849
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,540
You're so annoying, Tharn.

850
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:32,180
What's annoying? Let me see.

851
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:32,920
No.

852
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:34,450
Let me see.

853
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,359
No.

854
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,970
I'll show it to you in my next life.

855
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:40,439
What do you mean by "next life", Type?

856
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,260
Type.

857
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:56,590
Come in.

858
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,029
What are you doing?

859
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,050
Painting.

860
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,840
Why are you still up?

861
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:14,100
You'll be on the plane tomorrow morning, right?

862
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,340
I'll go to bed soon.

863
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:19,479
You came at the right time.

864
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,330
I have a gift for you.

865
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,420
What is it?

866
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:24,510
Here.

867
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,090
What is this?

868
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:32,680
This is...

869
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:33,680
This is...

870
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,120
This.

871
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,029
I promised you.

872
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:49,810
I drew you well.

873
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,960
You drew yourself too handsomely.

874
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,530
Go to sleep.

875
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,980
When you get there,

876
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,540
take care of yourself, okay?

877
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,120
You can't stay up so late.

878
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:17,260
Okay.

879
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,390
Also,

880
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,830
don't skip meals, okay?

881
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:31,100
If not, who's going to take care of you if you get sick?

882
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:32,940
Okay.

883
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:52,170
The weather there is much colder than here.

884
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:57,030
You need to dress warmly, okay?

885
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:01,840
Cover a thick blanket when you sleep.

886
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:04,830
Okay.

887
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:11,650
Brother Tum.

888
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:13,430
What's wrong?

889
01:11:18,730 --> 01:11:19,980
I'm sorry.

890
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:23,650
Why are you sorry?

891
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:29,190
Why do you say sorry to me?

892
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:32,990
Well...

893
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:40,130
I'm sorry I didn't tell you anything.

894
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,780
Don't think too much.

895
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,830
Actually, as long as you know, no matter what happens,

896
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,500
I'll always be by your side,

897
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,730
that's enough.

898
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:05,650
You don't have to apologize to me.

899
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:12,650
Thank you.

900
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,740
Brother Tum.

901
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,400
Because of you, I am who I am now.

902
01:12:46,210 --> 01:12:48,220
You are the most important person in my life.

903
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:57,790
I'm also the person you love the most in the world.

904
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:02,250
Okay.

905
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,300
Cheers.

906
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:11,640
Are you okay?

907
01:13:13,670 --> 01:13:17,370
Today, we came all the way here to see you, you, and you.

908
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:19,090
But you guys disbanded.

909
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:24,040
Right, I chose to come here instead of going back to watching the comeback show.

910
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:24,650
I know, right?

911
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:25,920
Oh, come on.

912
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,790
Then...

913
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:30,390
Did Lhong really quit?

914
01:13:38,660 --> 01:13:39,430
Yes.

915
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,170
Then we really need to find another singer?

916
01:13:42,790 --> 01:13:44,300
[Who will replace him?]

917
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,110
I don't know.

918
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:53,960
[Let's not talk about serious things today.]

919
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,790
Let's drink.

920
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:59,000
[We can find another singer, right, Champ?]

921
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:00,100
What did you say?

922
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,130
What are you talking about? I can't hear you.

923
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:03,400
What did you say?

924
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:05,910
Champ, let me ask you seriously.

925
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,300
Can you stop eating?

926
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,280
Gosh, you've been eating nonstop.

927
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:12,180
No, what are you complaining about?

928
01:14:12,180 --> 01:14:13,230
I'm hungry.

929
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,020
Look at your body, then look at mine.

930
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,940
The amount of food we need is different.

931
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:20,180
Okay, I'm petite.

932
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,870
So, why don't you sing a song?

933
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,850
Don't let me come for nothing.

934
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,350
Go!

935
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:28,640
Wait, Brother Khlui!

936
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,650
What do you want, Brother Tharn? Do you need help?

937
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,000
It's okay, Song.

938
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,330
Tonight,

939
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:38,060
I'll do it.

940
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,670
What is he doing?

941
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,910
How would I know? I'm sitting with you.

942
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:49,100
Bastard.

943
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:11,590
♫When I woke up and opened my eyes this morning♫

944
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:15,490
♫The world has changed♫

945
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:17,930

♫I hope you fall into a beautiful dream♫

950

♫I miss the time when we gazed into each other's eyes♫

♫No words are needed♫

952

♫Can you hear my words, baby?♫

976

So romantic.

01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,730
What is it?

986
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:54,000
-What?
-Are you happy?

987
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,500
He's grinning from ear to ear.

988
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,000
-He smiled.
-Of course.

989
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:00,510
What do you think?

990
01:19:01,330 --> 01:19:02,210
It's cheesy.

991
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,510
I know you like it.

992
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,970
So sweet.

993
01:19:11,970 --> 01:19:13,030
Cheers.

994
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,240
Cheers.

995
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,240
Your face turned dark.

996
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:19,190
It turned red, okay?

997
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,400
Just kidding.

998
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:38,860
Wait for me.

999
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:39,810
Okay.

1000
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:45,840
Are you sleepy?

1001
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:47,880
No.

1002
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:49,950
Then...

1003
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:51,300
Are you hungry?

1004
01:20:07,730 --> 01:20:08,930
In the end,

1005
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:11,820
I still fell in love with you.

1006
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,330
You'll love me more and more.

1007
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:16,740
I got goosebumps.

1008
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,430
Well,

1009
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,310
are you hungry?

1010
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:29,860
No.

1011
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:33,080
How are you hungry? You've had a lot.

1012
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:36,720
I mean, are you craving me?

1013
01:20:38,980 --> 01:20:40,960
All you think about is eating me.

1014
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:43,520
I'm expressing my love.

1015
01:20:43,730 --> 01:20:44,750
You talk too much.

1016
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,510
Let's go home.

1017
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:47,610
Come. Let's go home.

1018
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:51,130
Also,

1019
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:56,890
don't ever let go of my hand again.

1020
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,170
Hold it tight.

1021
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:39,940
[Three years later]

1022
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:48,590
[Where are you? Is class over?]

1023
01:21:48,590 --> 01:21:51,660
[I'm out. I'm heading to the pitch.]

1024
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,560
Are you going back?

1025
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,230
So what are you doing here?

1026
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:07,430
You didn't even kick the ball.

1027
01:22:08,110 --> 01:22:10,480
I forgot something in the locker.

1028
01:22:11,850 --> 01:22:15,110
Okay, let's go eat.

1029
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:17,570
I found a buffet where you get 1 person free if you come with 4 people.

1030
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,910
I'll have 2 people's portions, then.

1031
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,640
Champ.

1032
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:26,780
What's wrong with you? Are you out of your mind?

1033
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:28,380
Are you leaving?

1034
01:22:28,930 --> 01:22:31,480
Sorry, my driver is here.

1035
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,070
If you are the doll in the car,

1036
01:22:37,730 --> 01:22:39,680
I can be your driver.

1037
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,940
Goodness.

1038
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,730
So you’re leaving with your husband.

1039
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,390
I was wondering why Ken had a fight with me today.

1040
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,430
What’s going on?

1041
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:58,270
Ken said you drive an Audi that costs 4 million baht,

1042
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:02,160
but you don't have money to buy him a meal of 40 baht.

1043
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,570
You're using a wallet worth 15,000 baht,

1044
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:09,130
but you have no money to spend 5 baht on a stick of BBQ.

1045
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:15,950
And you two went to an international buffet for 2,000 baht per person.

1046
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,120
But...

1047
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,490
It was Tharn's money.

1048
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,770
How dare you say that?

1049
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:24,670
I pay it willingly.

1050
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,860
We're leaving, then.

1051
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,530
Bye.

1052
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:31,930
Good luck.

1053
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:33,130
You two bastards.

1054
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:35,690
Buy me a meal.

1055
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:38,690
Seriously, am I still your friend?

1056
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:40,750
Let's go.

1057
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:42,210
Let's eat too.

1058
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,820
What? Eat me?

1059
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,110
I mean eating.

1060
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:48,450
Okay, now the air is freezing.

1061
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:50,390
I could feel the cold creeping up my back.

1062
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:13,560
Pete.

1063
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,210
Tin.

1064
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,990
Are you here to pick Ken up?

1065
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:20,440
What about you?

1066
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:23,910
I'm going home.

1067
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:26,950
Hello, Brother Tharn and Brother Type.

1068
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,590
Are you here to pick Ken up?

1069
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,760
He went to poop. We met him just now.

1070
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:34,720
Wait a little longer.

1071
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,810
I'll wait at the soccer field, then.

1072
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,430
You're more straightforward now

1073
01:24:42,020 --> 01:24:43,790
since he kissed you that day, huh?

1074
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:46,610
Because he belongs to me.

1075
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,870
I'm leaving. See you on Monday.

1076
01:24:50,870 --> 01:24:51,550
Okay, Tin.

1077
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:55,640
By the way, Brother Tharn, Brother Type.

1078
01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:01,060
I have something to ask you.

1079
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,770
Well...

1080
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:08,060
Are you two a couple?

1081
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:15,910
Why do you get shy when you're the one asking?

1082
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,380
Do you remember what I said?

1083
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,420
You'll get what you hate.

1084
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,080
I used to quarrel

1085
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,460
a lot with Type.

1086
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,000
You know that, right?

1087
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,890
-We'll get going.
-Okay.

1088
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:39,220
Bye.

1089
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:50,920
Your juniors are always funny when I meet them.

1090
01:25:51,660 --> 01:25:53,520
Yes, they're funny.

1091
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:55,470
Especially their partners.

1092
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,330
Pete's partner is fine.

1093
01:25:57,500 --> 01:25:58,930
But Ken's boyfriend is funny.

1094
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:05,180
Aren't you going to ask what I said to my junior?

1095
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:07,200
Ask?

1096
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:08,750
About what?

1097
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,380
Forget it.

1098
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,690
I won't tell you if you don't ask.

1099
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,000
Then I'll ask.

1100
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:23,710
You said you hated me.

1101
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:25,950
How about now?

1102
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,300
You're more annoying than before.

1103
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,530
Are you sure?

1104
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:33,250
Yes.

1105
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:35,530
Just say you hate me.

1106
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,820
Because no matter what,

1107
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:44,510
you love me.

1108
01:26:47,860 --> 01:26:49,040
I hate you.

1109
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,140
It means you love me.

1110
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:53,670
I really, really hate you.

1111
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:57,060
That means you really, really love me.

1112
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,360
I hate you the most.

1113
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:03,660
That means you love me the most.

1114
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,000
Yes, you're right.

1115
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:48,280
I love you.

1116
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:54,080
I love you too.
