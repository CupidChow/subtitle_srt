Are you asking to be kicked? It's too cute.

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,680
Too cute?

00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,450
How about this one?

No.

00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,330
It's too pale.

How about this one? It's darker.

I'm looking for something like this.

But do you have one in a darker color?

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,070
Yes, but there are only bed sheets for 3.5 feet here.

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,810
The bed sheet for king-sized beds is over there.

00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:35,820
Hey, sister.

17

Why do we need a king-sized one?

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,580
I'm sorry. I thought you two...

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,260
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

Buy whatever you want. I don't want to choose anymore.

I'm sorry.

It's okay.

00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
It's just that

25
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,410
my boyfriend is shy.

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,080
So I didn't misunderstand, right?

27
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,100
Not really.

28

It's a bit expensive, but the fabric is good.

47

Just take it.

50
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,710
I said I wanted to buy it for you.

51
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,390
I said no. It's too expensive.

-No.

No.

00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,300
I earned it from my part-time job.

What job?

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,680
Just a job.

When I was a freshman,

64
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,670
my senior invited me to play there.

65
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,019
After he graduated, the bar owner trusted me,

66
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,480
so she asked me to continue playing there.

67
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,880
When I was in grade 12,

68
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,150
I had some problems with my band members.

69
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,820
So the band was disbanded.

70
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,200
Then...

71

Why did you disband?

Forget it.

73
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,440
This has nothing to do with me.

Let go of me!

75
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,450
I had a fight with a band member.

Why?

77
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,710
Did you fight because you made out with his brother?

78
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,650
Yes.

79
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,400
It's not like that.

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,470
I dated my friend's younger brother.

81

When we broke up,

82
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,610
my friend accused me of hurting his brother.

83
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,100
But, in fact, I was the one who got dumped.

84
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,500
Then why did you tell me this?

85
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,860
I want you to know me.

86
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,170

99

You said you ran out of detergent,

And you ate all the snacks I stored.

101

Why can't you buy them together with me?

102

Or are you afraid of something?

103

I'm not.

104
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,530
Didn't you say we were bedmates?

105

We can't even be friends

106

if we cut off the sex part?

107

Hurry up, Type.

174
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,360
Wait.

175
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,780
I thought we were eating at a restaurant in front of the school,

176
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,810
but not this kind of place.

177
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,540
This is the bar I'm playing in. Come on.

178
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,030
What?

179
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,480
Nice atmosphere. I like it.

180
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,760
I'm glad you like it.

181
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,950
You're smiling differently today.

182
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,950
How do I usually smile?

183
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,230
Like you're asking to be beaten.

184
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,920
I'm working now.

185
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,020
What do you mean?

186
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,320
Have you heard of "business smile"?

187
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,970
I’m a musician.

188
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,460
My duty is to entertain the audience.

189
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,360
I must learn how to smile even though I'm not the lead vocalist.

190
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,760
When I smile, customers like it.

191
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,710
When customers like it, they'll be satisfied.

192
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,700
When they are satisfied, the bar owner will keep hiring me.

193
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,140
So this is just a fake smile.

194
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,030
You can say so.

195
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,890
But this sincere smile

196
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,440
belongs to you.

197
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,610
So cheesy.

198
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,740
How is the pay here?

199
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,720
It's good. The more satisfied customers are, the more they pay.

200
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,260
What brings you here, Tharn?

201
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,230
I thought you're not playing today.

202
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,070
Hello, Sister Jeed.

203
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,690
I'm not playing today.

204
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm a customer today.

205
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,830
Oh.

206
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,090
This is Type.

207
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,200
He's my friend.

208
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,860
This is Sister Jeed, the boss here.

209
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,050
Hello.

210
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,570
Hello.

211
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,250
Are you sure he's a friend? Not your boyfriend?

212
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,530
No.

213
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,770
He's really just a friend.

214
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,620
Okay, I got it.

215
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,220
Such a handsome guy that suits your taste

216
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,080
is really your friend, huh?

217
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:36,980
Sister Jeed,

218
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,090
can I leave my friend with you for a while?

219
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,420
I'll go out and say hello to the people outside.

220
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,910
Of course.

221
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,030
-Thank you.
-Okay.

222
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,620
Tharn.

223
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,460
Don't worry.

224
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,260
Are you scared of me?

225
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,030
No.

226
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,140
Type, right?

227
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,460
I'm sorry for teasing you just now.

228
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,110
It's been a while

229
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,980
since Tharn brought someone here.

230
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,210
So when I saw you,

231
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,220
I thought you were...

232
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,570
By the way, do you know that Tharn is...

233
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,050
Yes, I know.

234
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:29,160
That's why I thought you were his boyfriend.

235
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,750
No, we're just friends.

236
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,170
If not, then not.

237
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,040
Well, since he's not here,

238
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,980
let's gossip about him.

239
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,890
Let me tell you.

240
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,860
Every time he plays here,

241
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,740
all the girls go crazy over him.

242
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,800
They give him their numbers, and buy him drinks.

243
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,190
What a pity.

244
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,490
If he forms a new band soon,

245
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm sure the bar will be filled up by female customers.

246
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,070
But as I said,

247
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,120
Tharn hasn't brought anyone here for a year.

248
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,600
You're the first one he brought in a long time.

249
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,840
Oops, I talked too much.

250
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,900
Have fun. I'll get going.

251
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,650
Okay.

252
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,160
What did you talk about with Sister Jeed just now?

253
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,740
Nothing special.

254
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,710
She gossiped about you.

255
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,690
About me?

256
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,540
Yes.

257
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,510
She said every time you played here,

258
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,060
the girls were fascinated by you.

259
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:10,320
She's exaggerating.

260
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,180
You are indeed friendly.

261
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,760
This is my job.

262
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,750
Business smile, remember?

263
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,880
Then, do you want to know

264
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,160
what Sister Jeed

265
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,080
whispered to me just now?

266
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,490
What?

267
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,970
If you want to know,

268
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,600
come closer.

269
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,730
So nosy.

270
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,470
She asked me

271
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,940
if I only saw you as a friend.

272
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,910
You are the...

273
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,490
You're the friend I want to do this with.

274
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,220
Type.

275
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,940
You're drunk.

276
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,300
I'm not drunk.

277
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,220
You're drunk.

278
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,740
I'm not drunk.

279
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,730
This much alcohol can't get me drunk.

280
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,310
If you're not drunk,

281
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,450
why did you do that?

282
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,590
Alcohol didn't make me drunk.

283
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,140
Instead, it gave me courage.

284
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,430
Type, do you know

285
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,530
how long I've been longing to do this with you?

286
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,530
I want to go back, I'll be waiting for you at the entry.

287
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,560
Tharn.

288
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,810
Tharn.

289
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,750
I know you're awake.

290
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,300
Sleep with me.

291
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,570
Come here.

292
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,580
Hey.

293
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,030
You said you wanted to sleep.

294
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,090
That's not what I meant.

295
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,310
Why?

296
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,090
This is sleeping. Let's sleep together.

297
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,480
Don't act up.

298
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,810
What do you mean?

299
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,220
You said you wanted to sleep.

300
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,910
Or do you want me to sing you a lullaby first?

301
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,090
Go to sleep quickly.

302
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,630
If you don't want to, whatever.

303
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,790
What is he doing?

304
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,980
Ridiculous.

305
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,970
Why are you talking to yourself? Are you crazy?

306
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:07,700
Mind your own business.

307
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,130
You wretch!

308
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,360
I asked because I was worried.

309
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,330
I thought you were crazy talking to yourself.

310
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,360
Here's your drink.

311
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,200
I have a question for you.

312
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,580
Have you decided to join the team?

313
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,600
I don’t think so.

314
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,500
I don't want to be a burden.

315
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,670
Playing with you is enough for me.

316
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,830
But I really hope you can be part of my team.

317
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,990
Because you can help me become the leader.

318
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,350
That's a great plan.

319
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,630
Are you daydreaming again?

320
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,730
Don't crush my dream!

321
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,720
Are you really my friend?

322
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,230
By the way, what happened to Tharn this morning?

323
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,560
It has noting to do with him.

324
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,860
I saw him this morning.

325
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,160
And then?

326
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,680
He ignored me.

327
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,230
He looked strange.

328
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,460
Besides,

329
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,590
he looked extremely silent.

330
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,850
What happened?

331
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,600
That's why I came to ask if you had a fight with him again.

332
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,530
Are you my friend or his friend?

333
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,260
His... No, I'm just kidding.

334
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,240
Of course I'm your friend.

335
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,860
That's why I asked you first. If not, I'll go to him.

336
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,080
I feel bad for him too.

337
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,410
Why?

338
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,500
Why would he fall for someone like you?

339
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,860
I avoided it in time. I'm good at it now.

340
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,650
You're really...

341
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,660
What's going on between you two, then?

342
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,930
How far have you gone?

343
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,840
But I believe you will never be soft on him.

344
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,650
I made a bet with my friends.

345
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,190
I'll win for sure.

346
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,230
You look weird.

347
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,580
Don't tell me you and him...

348
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,290
Darn it.

349
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,020
Put away your dirty thoughts.

350
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,340
In your dreams.

351
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,550
Is that your hand or leg? Wait for me.

352
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,430
Yay! It's over!

353
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,380
Great.

354
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,620
Yeah.

355
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,000
Brother Thorn,

356
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,390
why isn't Brother Tharn home yet?

357
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,830
He'll be back soon.

358
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,910
Why? Are you tired of me?

359
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,250
No, I just miss him.

360
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,870
Don't you miss me, Thanya?

361
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,880
I see you every day.

362
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,290
But I haven't seen Brother Tharn for a month.

363
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,880
Don't be upset.

364
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,780
If the prince feels wronged, will the princess comfort him?

365
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,340
Fine.

366
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,580
Who is that?

367
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,720
I don't know.

368
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,950
Brother Tharn.

369
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,400
Brother Tharn, I miss you so much.

370
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,290
Yeah, now Tharn is back, so you don't care about me anymore?

371
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,890
I told you I saw you every day.

372
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,840
Of course, I see you every day.

373
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,720
That's why you're sick of me, right?

374
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,570
No.

375
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,140
Brother Tharn, look at Brother Thorn.

376
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,680
Stop teasing Thanya.

377
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,720
Look, she's getting angry.

378
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,440
She's cute.

379
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,120
Why are you home?

380
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,280
Look at you sighing.

381
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,870
What's the problem this time?

382
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,440
Nothing.

383
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,700
It's just that my roommate is willful.

384
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,360
So, what is my princess doing?

385
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,480
I'm playing the piano.

386
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,890
You're just in time.

387
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,940
Go on and teach me to play the piano.

388
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,970
I'd love to, Your Highness.

389
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,080
But Thanya must find me something to eat first.

390
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,830
I'm hungry.

391
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,470
I don't have the strength to teach you.

392
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,840
Okay, let's go.

393
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,360
Let's go.

394
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,030
Let's go.

395
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,730
[I'm going home.]

396
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,330
What's wrong with you?

397
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,130
Why are you mad at me?

398
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,930
You didn't tell me when you went home.

399
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,650
You said nothing to me.

400
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,420
What did I do that made you angry?

401
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,190
Is it because of that kiss?

402
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,120
Dream on. I'll never coax you.

403
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,460
Brother Tharn, are you okay?

404
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,290
Why do you keep getting the notes wrong?

405
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,290
I'm fine.

406
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,440
I've been studying hard lately,

407
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,470
so I hardly practice piano.

408
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,740
Now my hands are stiff.

409
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,070
But you never made any mistakes before.

410
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:16,110
Brother Tharn is not as good as me, right, Princess?

411
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,660
No, Brother Tharn is much better than you.

412
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,590
That's right. Now he's back,

413
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,450
all you care about is him.

414
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,160
I'm already out of favour.

415
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,820
I'm thirsty.

416
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,520
Get me some water from the kitchen.

417
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,020
Bring some water for Brother Tharn too.

418
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,940
So there's something you don't want me to know,

419
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,470
right?

420
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,670
Okay.

421
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,920
I'll get you some water.

422
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,120
Okay.

423
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,830
What's wrong?

424
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,890
Nothing.

425
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm just tired.

426
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,640
Okay, then.

427
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,070
But if you have any problems,

428
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,900
you can tell me anytime, brother.

429
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,230
Thank you, but I'm really fine.

430
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,410
I need to go to the toilet.

431
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,490
It must be a relationship problem.

432
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,050
Drink.

433
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,900
What is this?

434
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,020
You saw it. Don't tell me you think it's water.

435
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,800
Thank you.

436
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,130
I'm not thirsty.

437
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,350
I'll sleep in my friend's room tonight.

438
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,540
Where's my Sprite?

439
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,850
Punk!

440
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,840
I bought it for him. He didn't drink a sip.

441
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,800
What actually happened?

442
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,460
I hope you get diabetes.

443
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,690
I hope you die from clogged arteries.

444
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,590
I'll make you drink it until you collapse.

445
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,460
Why should I do that?

446
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,750
I'm not trying to coax you.

447
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,850
Actually,

448
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,540
you don't have to do this.

449
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,330
I should be the one asking you.

450
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,600
Just tell me what happened.

451
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,790
I have nothing to say.

452
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,090
Tharn.

453
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,050
You must be happy that I'm doing this.

454
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,360
Tonight,

455
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,670
I'm going to sleep in my friend's room.

456
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,210
It hurts.

457
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,570
♫I won't let you leave with others♫

458
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,270
♫I won't let anyone stand by your side♫

459
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,370
♫No matter how long it takes♫

460
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:30,470
♫I'll give my everything to make you mine♫

461
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,600
If you want this kiss so much,

462
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,540
I can give it to you.

463
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,970
But I'm not coaxing you.

464
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,650
So don't laugh.

465
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,850
Stay where you are.

466
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,230
It's not that I don't want to leave.

467
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,900
But I can't live without you.

468
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,600
Tharn, you're heavy.

469
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,510
I've been waiting for you to coax me.

470
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,470
I'm not coaxing you.

471
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,850
Wait.

472
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,160
You sound like you knew I would do this.

473
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,170
Tharn, you wretch!

474
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,620
But in the end,

475
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,320
you made me realize

476
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,690
that you care about me.

477
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,000
-No, I don’t.
-Are you angry?

478
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,910
Because I didn't tell you when I went home?

479
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,830
-No, I didn’t.
-You bought me Sprite

480
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,680
because you knew I liked it.

481
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,550
And you kissed me

482
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,740
because you knew I wanted it.

483
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,780
Am I right?

484
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,050
Yes, you're right.

485
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,960
But you forgot one thing.

486
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,960
You lied to me.

487
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,350
But that day,

488
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,580
I was really hurt.

489
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,130
I was being serious that day.

490
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,560
You're not just a friend to me.

491
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,530
Don't mention it again.

492
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,490
You lied to me, and I gave you a kick. We're even now.

493
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,670
Darn it, Tharn.

494
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,860
Type.

495
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,940
What am I to you?

496
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:24,220
Type.

497
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,240
What am I to you?

498
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,220
You want the answer to be "boyfriend", right?

499
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,050
That would be great.

500
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,240
Lover.

501
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:38,710
What?

502
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,990
Yes, lover.

503
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,910
What kind of friends would kiss?

504
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,360
A lover?

505
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,090
We're lovers, then.

506
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,480
You are easy to satisfy.

507
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:07,680
If not, you can give me something better.

508
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,330
Don't push your luck.

509
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,290
I forgot to tell you.

510
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,470
If you pull my ankle again,

511
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,000
you won't even have a place to live.

512
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,000
You can let me go now.

513
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,160
Tharn!

514
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,330
What are you doing?

515
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,630
At least I'm a lover

516
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,940
that belongs to you.

517
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,140
You seem to be very close recently.

518
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,500
You're overthinking.

519
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,200
No, I'm not.

520
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,860
Let's take Tharn for example.

521
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,970
His faculty is over there, but he chose to eat here.

522
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,790
What's so strange about that?

523
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,190
Can't I eat here?

524
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,420
No, it's not strange.

525
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,440
You just look really close.

526
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:08,710
What about you, Type?

527
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,160
You don't hate gay anymore?

528
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,670
Forget what I said.

529
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,640
This should stay between you two.

530
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,300
I still hate gays.

531
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,470
But I don't hate Tharn.

532
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,240
What do you mean?

533
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,060
You've been

534
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,220
busy meddling in others' business lately, No.

535
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,270
I'm just surprised.

536
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,480
By the way, are you two

537
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,640
hiding something from me?

538
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,540
I'm going to class. I don't want to be late.

539
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,840
Type, are you done eating?

540
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,040
I'll clean up your bowl.

541
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,340
Hurry up. You were late yesterday too.

542
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,540
I'm late because of you.

543
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,410
-Bye.
-Okay.

544
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,710
Wow.

545
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,970
What?

546
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,970
How did you make him late?

547
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,650
He set an alarm,

548
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,250
and it was annoyingly loud.

549
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,820
I turned it off, so he woke up late.

550
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,740
That's all.

551
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,250
Hey, guys.

552
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,560
What are you eating? Why didn't you invite me?

553
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,030
Is food the only thing in your life, Champ?

554
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:56,730
All right. There are not many important things in my life.

555
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,330
Did you skip class?

556
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:02,890
I don't want to go to morning classes. I still have plenty of leave.

557
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,150
Great. I'll skip class too.

558
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,200
Forget about me.

559
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,580
I used up all my leave.

560
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,730
Getting scolded is better than skipping class.

561
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:14,730
I'm leaving.

562
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,950
Wait.

563
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,030
Are you going somewhere tonight?

564
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,040
Let's have dinner together.

565
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,210
There's a new restaurant behind the campus.

566
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,310
I heard the food is delicious.

567
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,630
You really only know about eating, Champ.

568
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,650
How about this?

569
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,400
If you treat me,

570
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,860
I'll go.

571
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,530
Okay.

572
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,180
-Well, people like me
-You must treat.

573
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,120
-only go Dutch.
-Off you go!

574
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,040
So, are you coming?

575
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,580
Okay, I'll call you after class.

576
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,000
I'm going to class.

577
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:42,640
Bye.

578
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,590
That's great.

579
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,920
What?

580
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,490
My plan worked, No.

581
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,170
What plan?

582
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,770
One of my friends wants to meet Type.

583
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,250
Is your friend...

584
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,480
A girl or a boy?

585
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,660
A girl, of course.

586
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,130
Why would a boy want to meet him?

587
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,900
You're weird.

588
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,510
But it's good. He's been through a lot lately.

589
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,280
It's not bad to introduce him to a girl.

590
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,890
I'll go get some food. I'll be right back.

591
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,160
Brother Tharn.

592
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,540
It's really Brother Tharn!

593
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,190
You're my idol.

594
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,500
I really admire you.

595
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:55,530
Thank you very much.

596
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,900
You're amazing too.

597
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,100
So, what else do you want to show us?

598
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,780
Show it to your idol.

599
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:04,850
No problem. I'll show you.

600
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,150
Come on.

601
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,930
Hey, No and Type.

602
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,340
This way.

603
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,600
Okay.

604
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,610
They are my high school classmates.

605
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,120
Mai and Puifai.

606
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,680
We bumped into each other here.

607
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,490
So I sat with them.

608
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,910
Do you mind?

609
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,380
It's too late to say no now, right?

610
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,510
Wow.

611
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,600
The tablewares are in place,

612
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,340
and the food is ready.

613
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,450
I ordered for you.

614
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,600
My name is Techno.

615
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,270
You can call me No.

616
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,070
This is Type.

617
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,600
Are you from the same faculty?

618
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,890
Yes, we're in the same school, but we're in different majors.

619
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,160
That means you all majored in science.

620
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,700
Impressive.

621
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,570
No.

622
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,010
Look at me. What's so great about me?

623
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,220
That's true.

624
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,880
You're an exception.

625
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,000
Although I don't study science, I have good observations.

626
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,530
Type, do you like yellow curry?

627
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,320
In my hometown, it's actually called sour curry.

628
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,950
Does the South call this sour curry?

629
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,330
Yes, but I prefer fish kidney curry.

630
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,400
Come on. Let's eat.

631
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,280
Let's eat.

632
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:48,810
Wow.

633
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,520
Isn't it spicy, Type?

634
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,350
He's from the south.

635
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,490
He told me

636
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:56,540
when his mother cooked curry,

637
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,670
she sprinkled chilies handful by handful.

638
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,240
More like a basket of chilies.

639
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,750
I want to try. Do you have the recipe?

640
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Puifai, you like cooking too, right?

641
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,100
Why don't you ask for his number?

642
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,650
Maybe Type has some delicious recipes.

643
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,410
Let's exchange it now.

644
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:18,930
Come on.

645
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,390
Can I have your contact information?

646
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,880
My family likes Southern cuisine.

647
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,000
Added.

648
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,210
Thank you.

649
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,140
Do we still have class today?

650
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,240
Yes.

651
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,390
Which class is it?

652
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,130
I haven't checked it yet.

653
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,610
Have you finished your assignment?

654
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,280
Who do you think I am?

655
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,130
Bye.

656
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,150
Okay. Take care. Bye.

657
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:54,670
Okay.

658
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,090
Bye.

659
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,620
Bye.

660
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,530
Bye.

661
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,110
Puifai has a crush on you.

662
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:13,830
I know.

663
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,860
So confident.

664
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,670
I have to be confident.

665
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:24,080
You should be confident. She even asked for your contact information.

666
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,780
Is there any hope for my friend?

667
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,180
I should ask you that question instead.

668
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,730
Do I have a chance?

669
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,480
Does your friend have a boyfriend?

670
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,160
She's cute.

671
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,330
No, she's single.

672
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,070
She just broke up with her boyfriend.

673
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,640
[Mai]

674
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:08,780
Hello, what's up?

675
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,830
Hey Champ, what are you doing?

676
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:12,720
Boxing.

677
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,790
Again?

678
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,760
Yes, what brings you here?

679
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:20,020
Nothing, I just wanted to talk to someone.

680
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,130
You really have nothing to do.

681
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,760
Let's have dinner together sometime.

682
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,460
Of course. Just let me know when.

683
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,260
Really?

684
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,670
Why would I lie?

685
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,550
Who else will come with us?

686
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,520
Why would there be someone else?

687
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:37,840
Don't you want to have dinner together?

688
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:39,170
Who did you call?

689
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,000
Gosh, when will you understand?

690
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,660
Why are you angry?

691
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:49,970
What's wrong with her?

692
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:02,690
Type.

693
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,680
Where have you been? You're late.

694
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,880
I went out to eat with Champ and the others.

695
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,680
What about you? What are you doing?

696
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,020
I'm hanging your clothes.

697
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,060
Hanging my clothes?

698
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,430
I did the laundry.

699
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:24,440
So I washed your clothes for you too.

700
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,780
If you mind,

701
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:28,910
you can wash it again.

702
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:31,230
If I had minded,

703
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,790
I wouldn't have come back to sleep here.

704
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,200
Want to do something more than just sleep?

705
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,530
Tharn, you wretch!

706
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,800
You can only talk nicely for a minute, is it?

707
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:41,620
You're talking nonsense again.

708
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:46,170
You should thank me instead of scolding me.

709
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,780
Thank you.

710
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:50,960
What?

711
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:54,240
I'm going to take a shower.

712
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:24,050
[What are you doing, Type?]

713
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,570
[I'm ready to sleep, but I can't fall asleep.]

714
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,650
[Why? Are you sick?]

715
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:56,180
[No, because I've been thinking of you.]

716
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,390
You mean,

717
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,500
Type fell for a girl?

718
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,560
Is this your apartment? It looks nice.

719
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,530
Do you want to go upstairs?

720
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,160
You're seeing someone, right, Type?

721
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,870
You and I are just bedmates.

722
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:19,580
No matter what or with whom I'm doing it,

723
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,280
it's none of your business.

724
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,990
That's easy.

725
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:24,290
When I want it,

726
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,020
I'll do it with you.
