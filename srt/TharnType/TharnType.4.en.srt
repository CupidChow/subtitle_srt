Type.

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,010
Look at your masterpiece.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,740
What?

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,380
And then?

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,500
And then?

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,200
Type.

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,280
I think you should apologize to them.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,380
Why should I apologize? I didn't do anything wrong.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,530
As you can see, if that group of people continued to curse,

11
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,290
this wouldn't end so easily.

12

Type.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm worried about you now.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,040
You just need to use your lips to say sorry.

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,680
You won't lose your dignity.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,250
-I think...
-I said no.

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,000
Go home.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,310
I want to sleep. I have a headache.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,120
How about this?

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,900
I'll go buy some food later.

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,130
Do you want anything?

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,650
No, I'm not hungry.

23
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,160
OK.

24
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,590
I don't know how to help you either.

25
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,150
You said no to this

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,110
and said no to that.

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,970
You said no to everything.

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,820
You said no to everything.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,390
I won't care about you anymore.

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,710
Why should I care about you?

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,380
Are you okay?

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,660
You should have known everything, right?

33
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,660
Which side are you on?

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,880
Do you want to hate me

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,380
or use me to insult gays?

36
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:47,500
Oh. I guess you will hate me.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,810
Because I cursed your kind.

38
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,690
I don't know what I've become today.

39
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,430
People were looking at me wherever I went.

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,260
Maybe this is karma.

41
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,710
I scolded you like that before...

42
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,100
Later, my narrow mind will infect you.

43
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,020
Can I help you with anything?

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,950
Normalize the sexual orientation

45
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,460
of all people in the world.

46
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,500
Can you do it?

47
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,010
I can't.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,640
Because I will never stop loving men.

51
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,270
Guys,

52
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,120
do you all understand the lesson I gave today?

53
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,970
If there is anything you don't understand,

54
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,930
you can come to me after class.

55
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,550
That's all for today.

56
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,930
Goodbye.

57
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,200
Tharn.

58
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,660
I think you should move to the dormitory outside the school.

59
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,450
Why do you stay with this kind of person?

60
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,159
What kind of person are you talking about?

61
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,290
You should know what kind of person I mean.

62
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,280
Move out.

63
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,350
Otherwise, you'll get involved.

64
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,180
Obviously, your roommate is a nuisance.

65
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,290
Why should I move out?

66
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,490
He and I

67
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,700
have no conflict.

68
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,350
I want to know this too.

69
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
How could you bear living with him for months?

70
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,310
You heard from the start that

71
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,660
he hated gays, right?

72
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,480
I only deal with him

73
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,710
when necessary.

74
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
Does he know you are...

75
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,740
Why do you care about me so much?

76
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,430
Have you reviewed

77
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,070
for the midterm exam?

78
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,700
Heartbreaking. This sentence is very heartbreaking.

79
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,260
Can you not mention it?

80
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,270
I want to finish watching this wonderful scene first.

81
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,200
Put aside reviewing and all that.

82
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,040
Where are you going? Don't you have a rehearsal today?

83
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,220
I'm not you.

84
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,380
I'm going back to my dorm to review the lesson.

85
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,770
Okay, responsible and hardworking Mr. Thara.

86
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,420
We only have one theoretical test.

87
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,640
The rest are practical operations.

88
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,840
You're really diligent.

89
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,270
You're excellent.

90
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,050
Give you a like.

91
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,190
What?

92
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,020
I saw your finger held up.

93
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,380
Take care.

94
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,100
Okay.

95
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,590
You didn't go to class today either?

96
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,240
Leave me alone.

97
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,010
I have talked to Techno.

98
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,440
He said you didn’t go to the large class.

99
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,540
I know he can take your place during the roll call.

100
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,370
But you haven't been to class for a week.

101
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,950
Stop poking your nose into my affairs.

102
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
You should go and revise Thai.

103
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,410
"Poking your nose into my affairs" and "caring"

104
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,250
are not the same.

105
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,790
Do you also care about me?

106
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm going to laugh my teeth out.

107
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,330
Then laugh.

108
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,600
Forget it. Let's go eat.

109
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,190
I'm not hungry.

110
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,920
Type, get up and eat.

111
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,990
I told you to leave me alone.

112
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,560
I didn't ask you to buy me food.

113
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,700
I didn't ask you to be nice to me.

114
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,120
You bastard!

115
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,440
What are you going to do, Tharn?

116
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,130
Let go of me!

117
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,410
Tharn, let go of me!

118
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,900
Eat something.

119
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,860
Please.

120
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,200
I don't care if you think I'm gay

121
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,180
or something you hate,

122
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,290
but please eat something first.

123
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,980
Please.

124
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,740
Are you begging a jerk like me?

125
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,770
I know you did nothing wrong.

126
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,270
But almost everyone in the school thinks I was wrong.

127
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,490
No matter what others say about you,

128
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,010
to me,

129
00:10:58,910 --> 00:10:59,850
you did nothing wrong.

130
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,470
Even though I hate gays...

131
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,550
Even though I hate you?

132
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,100
Yes.

133
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,160
Even if you hate me...

134
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,680
Type,

135
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,200
you can tell me if you have anything.

136
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,690
I can be your listener anytime.

137
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,590
I'm right beside you.

138
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,690
Okay, Type?

139
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,330
Tell me.

140
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,940
When I was 11,

141
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,820
I was harassed by a creep.

142
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,170
He was a worker who came to my dad's resort to fix the roof.

143
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,510
I saw him almost every day.

144
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,850
He told me that

145
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,290
he knew where a football court was.

146
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,470
So I followed him.

147
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,370
Then he hit me.

148
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,890
I was short.

149
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,170
How could I have had the strength to fight back?

150
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,670
He tied me up.

151
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,800
No matter how I begged him, he wouldn't let me go.

152
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,650
I still remember it clearly that

153
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,310
that place was very messy.

154
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,740
You made me ejaculate, right?

155
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,500
But a man who hates gays like me

156
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,250
ejaculated in front of another man when I was 11.

157
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,050
That was really bad.

158
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,340
It was disgusting.

159
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,750
I was so depressed.

160
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,580
I couldn't breathe.

161
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,670
I couldn't stop crying.

162
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:03,080
He even touched me

163
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,670
and stripped me...

164
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,060

00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,710
I hate you.

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,750
♫My love for you will never change♫

176
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,930

♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

182
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,950
Are you still meddling in other people's business?

183
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,710
I'm just concerned.

184
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,210
I seemed to have heard another argument just now.

185
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,640
But it's quiet now.

186
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,880
Seo Duang,

187
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,690
I'm worried about Type.

188
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,270
That damn rumor spread throughout the school.

189
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,350
Everyone is talking about this no matter where we go.

190
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,480
Then...

191
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,990
what do you think?

192
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,940
Do you agree with Type?

193
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,950
I don't know.

194
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,140
But I'm not against gays.

195
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,910
And I don't think Type is that kind of person.

196
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,070
Although he's straightforward and mean,

197
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,590
he has his own reasons.

198
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,520
Or

199
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,930
should I knock on his door and ask him?

200
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,850
Before you worry about people next door,

201
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,390
can you worry about yourself first?

202
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,980
How many 'F's are you going to get this semester?

203
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,910
Come on. Studying is not a big deal.

204
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,010
But inquiring...

205
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,360
I mean, it's more important to care about my juniors.

206
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,040
All right, read books now.

207
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,250
Leave the people next door alone.

208
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,650
Although you don't worry about yourself,

209
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,110
I'm worried about you.

210
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,610
What?

211
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,990
How long are you going to be like this?

212
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,579
Be quiet.

213
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,830
Mom.

214
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,320
Look at this.

215
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,650
That matter is about to get out of control. It was all because of you.

216
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,860
How could you blame me? You were involved too.

217
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,950
You were the one who kept instigating me

218
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,650
and now you're blaming me for everything.

219
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,470
To be honest,

220
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,230
if you were right about this, and I was right,

221
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,940
who was wrong?

222
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,520
That brat.

223
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,760
I wouldn't have done that

224
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,730
if he hadn't come to judge us.

225
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,230
Let me see.

226
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,350
The teacher is calling.

227
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,640
We're done.

228
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,490
Answer it. Answer it.

229
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,640
Hello, Teacher.

230
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,050
Yes.

231
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,320
What?

232
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,980
Okay, I'll be right there.

233
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,440
Okay, bye.

234
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,050
We're done.

235
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,310
The principal wants to see us.

236
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,450
I knew it.

237
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:26,190
Who shared our story online?

238
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,610
Look, this is really serious.

239
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,950
I think she did it. I remember her name.

240
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,050
So disgusting.

241
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,090
Bitch!

242
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:42,380
[Principal's Office]

243
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,990
What should we do?

244
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
We have to solve this within this week.

245
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,180
Or we will be done.

246
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:49,890
Wait.

247
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,700
Aren't you going to apologize to us?

248
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,420
What about you?

249
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,640
Have you apologized to me?

250
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,660
Why should we apologize to you?

251
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,050
If you hadn't published my photo,

252
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,970
you wouldn't have been scolded.

253
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,240
Besides, I could have called the police to arrest you,

254
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,340
but you're lucky

255
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,730
because I use my brain before I do things.

256
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,180
-The mouth of yours...
-Enough.

257
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:19,210
This is already troublesome enough.

258
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,570
I want to end this as soon as possible.

259
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,340
Are we going to let him go so easily?

260
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,900
If this goes on,

261
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,880
we'll be in bigger trouble.

262
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,460
Tharn.

263
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,800
What are you doing here?

264
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,420
Seniors.

265
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,220
I have something to say to you.

266
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,190
Type.

267
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,830
Go back to the dorm first.

268
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,110
I have something to say to them.

269
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,260
Even you are on their side.

270
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,350
What did you say to them?

271
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,520
What did I say?

272
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,520
Techno sent it to me. I can't believe it.

273
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,540
They kept scolding me

274
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,020
as if I'm a murderer.

275
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,750
But now they suddenly apologized to me.

276
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,660
What do they want to do?

277
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,540
It really worked!

278
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,180
What did you say?

279
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,210
What did you say to those two sissies?

280
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,110
Watch your mouth, Type.

281
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,260
Haven't you learned a lesson?

282
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,760
Tharn.

283
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,150
What did you say to them?

284
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,040
Did you tell them about my childhood?

285
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,390
That's why they pity me.

286
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,620
I warned you.

287
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,530
Mind your words.

288
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,840
You scold me.

289
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,070
I'm not angry.

290
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,490
But not everyone can tolerate your words.

291
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,090
If you had been calmer,

292
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,630
this wouldn't have happened.

293
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,190
It is good that those two people don't pursue you further.

294
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,550
They even cleared your name.

295
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,130
Oh. Don't worry.

296
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,140
I didn't tell them about you.

297
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,090
What did you say to them then?

298
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,950
I told them.

299
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,210
What?

300
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,310
I like you.

301
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,170
What do you want to say to us?

302
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,950
I want you

303
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,390
listen to me.

304
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,530
I'm gay.

305
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,540
I can tell.

306
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,770
But how did you deal with him?

307
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:39,700
He hates sexual minorities so much.

308
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,620
Doesn't he hate gays?

309
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,770
No.

310
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,160
Type

311
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,930
doesn't like the sexual minorities you mentioned.

312
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,900
A gay like me

313
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,380
has to live with him who hates gays.

314
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,650
Then how do you get along? Don't you fight?

315
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,710
You both wanted to kill each other at first.

316
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,430
But if you try to understand him,

317
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,070
you'll know he's a good person.

318
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,950
Although he has some prejudice

319
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,660
and acts like a jerk,

320
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,740
if you really know him,

321
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,670
you will find that he is a good man.

322
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,310
I came here today

323
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,790
not to make you sympathize with him

324
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,750
but to tell you...

325
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,620
I like him.

326
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,260
Oh, my. Do you like him?

327
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,270
Yes.

328
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,420
I admit that

329
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,930
I attacked him.

330
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,420
It sounds so exciting.

331
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,960
It sounds like a tanbi novel.

332
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,400
To be honest,

333
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,290
he hates gays may because of me.

334
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,400
I knew he didn't like me,

335
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,800
but I kept pestering him.

336
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,420
Because

337
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,070
I couldn't suppress my feelings for him.

338
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,000
He didn't resist it at first.

339
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,370
It's all because of me.

340
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,520
That day,

341
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,830
you touched him, right?

342
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,140
A little. I didn't expect this to happen.

343
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,010
Since he's a friend of Techno,

344
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,190
we thought he wouldn't mind.

345
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,470
If you didn't touch him,

346
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,840
just like how I attacked him,

347
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,930
he wouldn't have said that.

348
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,980
If you want to blame someone,

349
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,720
you should blame me instead of him.

350
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,760
But

351
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,330
the one who insulted us

352
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,720
was him, not you.

353
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,460
Why are you defending him?

354
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,180
If he was actually scolding me,

355
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,720
he was right, right?

356
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,890
Do you think I'm right?

357
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,950
If we're afraid of something or hate something,

358
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,890
we don't want to get close to it.

359
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,470
But you touched him

360
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,220
and tried to pat him.

361
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,180
What was wrong with him being angry?

362
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,120
You didn't even ask him

363
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,970
why he hates and fears us.

364
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,320
If your photos were posted online,

365
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,430
and someone scolded you,

366
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,340
even though they didn't know the truth,

367
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,980
how would you feel?

368
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,560
Are you saying that we did it wrong?

369
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,140
I'm not blaming anyone.

370
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,080
You didn't expect the thing to develop like this either.

371
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,870
I'd like to apologize on behalf of Type.

372
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,710
Because I was the one who did something wrong, not him.

373
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,420
Let me salute you.

374
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,470
I beg you.

375
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,550
Now,

376
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,910
Type is in a bad situation.

377
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,080
I can't stand

378
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,130
watching the person I like be like this.

379
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,220
I beg you.

380
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,920
Please.

381
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,610
Let's end this.

382
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,000
Got it.

383
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,750
You don't seem to believe me.

384
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,240
How can I trust you

385
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,110
after you said such nonsense?

386
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,120
You just told them

387
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,240
that you liked me and attacked me.

388
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,040
Then they trust you? Is that all?

389
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,140
Yes.

390
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,800
How much help can this be for this matter?

391
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,300
It's my turn to ask you.

392
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,890
Why didn't you call the police?

393
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,880
People like you who seek revenge should want to

394
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,100
retaliate against them.

395
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,300
Because at that time,

396
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,760
my dad reported it to the police.

397
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,600
The reporters knew about it.

398
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,640
You may not know, but I was on the news too.

399
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,930
What was the nickname they gave me back then?

400
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,280
T Boy.

401
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,100
It caused a commotion at that time.

402
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,590
Just because of a small report on the news,

403
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,580
everyone came to disrupt the life of

404
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,290
this psychologically injured boy.

405
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,820
Just because of that damn news,

406
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,290
neighbors knew what happened to me.

407
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
I didn't dare to go out for months.

408
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,370
Because I don't want to be asked...

409
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,120
Are you okay, Kid?

410
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,530
Poor thing.

411
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,880
Oh my god, consider it as driving away bad luck, Kid.

412
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,130
Your father...

413
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,670
See when it happens to your children...

414
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,240
In that case, you can avoid meddling in others' affairs.

415
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,930
If you ask me about my terrifying experience of being noticed by the media,

416
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,070
I know it very well.

417
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,600
It's the same this time.

418
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,080
If I call the police,

419
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,460
I will be relieved of my anger.

420
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,700
I can see them

421
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,800
suffer more because of their reckless actions.

422
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,430
And then?

423
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,090
In the end, I will be dragged into this mess.

424
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,310
I've had enough.

425
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,580
I've already had enough.

426
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,600
Why can't I avoid this kind of person in my life?

427
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,820
Type.

428
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,550
I have something to tell you.

429
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,510
I told them I liked you.

430
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,690
And then?

431
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,900
I'm serious.

432
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,690
You heard it right.

433
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,060
I think...

434
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,800
I like you

435
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,360
♫My last lover♫

436
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,420
♫The person who stays with me all the time♫

437
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,900
♫I will not make you sad♫

438
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:52,990
♫Can you hear my words, baby?♫

439
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:58,890
♫If the world collapses, please remember♫

440
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:02,850
♫My love for you will never change♫

441
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,130
♫You can rest assured♫

442
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,540
♫We will walk side by side♫

443
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,790
Hey, Type.

444
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,440
Does Tharn really like you?

445
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,290
What are you talking about?

446
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,290
I almost choked to death.

447
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,640
I need to wipe my face.

448
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,530
Don't change the subject.

449
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,080
I heard it from those two.

450
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,150
What did they say?

451
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,270
They said

452
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:49,040
they were willing to sacrifice their dignity to quell rumors for you

453
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,720
not because they were afraid of you calling the police

454
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,310
or sue them for compensation,

455
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,530
but because Tharn went to ask them to forgive you.

456
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,330
Tharn said it was all his fault.

457
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,760
He said because he liked you,

458
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,530
you started to hate gays,

459
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,540
and vented your anger on them.

460
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,020
What's the relationship between them?

461
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,360
Yes, I also asked them

462
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,830
what the relationship between them was.

463
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:21,090
But they insisted that Tharn really liked you,

464
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,000
but he was too aggressive towards you.

465
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:27,610
That's why a straight man like you doesn't like him.

466
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,880
So it's not strange that you scolded them.

467
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:33,740
In short,

468
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Tharn said it was all his fault.

469
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,970
If they have any dissatisfaction, go to him.

470
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
Does he really like you?

471
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,530
How could he like someone like you?

472
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,810
You have no common sense.

473
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,640
You kicked him out of the room like a kindergarten kid.

474
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,690
Calm down.

475
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,850
Are you here to scold me?

476
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,660
No, I was just asking.

477
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,480
So,

478
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,490
have you had sex?

479
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,760
Do you want me to kick you?

480
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,740
You're so grumpy.

481
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,970
It's Tharn's misfortune to like someone like you.

482
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,100
I'm going to buy some food first. I happen to be hungry.

483
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,350
How was your class today?

484
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,640
It is none of your business.

485
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,030
Why are you back so early today?

486
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,989
Are you concerned about me?

487
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,190
The midterm exam is coming.

488
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,370
So I'll focus on my review first instead of the music.

489
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,600
By the way, Type.

490
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,880
I bought you some food.

491
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,100
I've eaten dinner.

492
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,159
Take it as a midnight snack.

493
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,080
Why did you do this?

494
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,350
Is it wrong to care about the person I like?

495
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,690
Seriously,

496
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,500
what do you want from me?

497
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,570
If I tell you,

498
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,480
will you give it to me?

499
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,450
Don't joke with me.

500
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,830
I want to have sex with you.

501
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,190
Do you want to die?

502
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,560
I was just kidding.

503
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,400
Your reaction is more interesting than what I imagined

504
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,850
Why did you joke?

505
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,060
So what exactly do you want?

506
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,380
I want...

507
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
I was just kidding.

508
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,440
But I really thought so.

509
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,300
What are you talking about?

510
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,340
I want to have sex with you.

511
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,300
Don't be angry. Let me finish.

512
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,060
Say it.

513
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,260
I want to have sex with you,

514
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,070
but not now.

515
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,120
I told you I liked you.

516
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,880
Because I like you,

517
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,970
I will make every effort to attract your attention.

518
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,750
You're a man. You should know

519
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:22,630
what a man wants to do with the person he likes.

520
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,450
So,

521
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,910
be careful.

522
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,390
When you let your guard down, I...

523
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,440
I won't have sex with you.

524
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,620
You don't have other questions, right?

525
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,780
Then I'll continue to review.

526
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,350
With you looking at me like this,

527
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,220
are you in love with me?

528
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,630
Bastard!

529
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,770
Darn it. I don't understand.

530
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,720
I've decided.

531
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:25,380
Hello.

532
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,960
Hello?

533
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,140
Tharn, it's time to get up and eat.

534
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,030
What time is it?

535
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,630
Ten.

536
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,200
This was the first time I saw you drunk.

537
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,370
Last night, my senior invited me to the bar to watch him sing.

538
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,260
And then he bought me a drink.

539
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,600
By the way,

540
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:38,090
what's up with you? Why didn't you let me go home?

541
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,630
Have sex with me.

542
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,340
Have sex with me.

543
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,940
What did you say?

544
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,120
You heard me right.

545
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:56,860
Have sex with me.

546
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,130
I don't want to owe you.

547
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,910
What do you owe me?

548
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,010
You helped me many times, right?

549
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,310
I don't want to owe you any favors.

550
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,510
If one day you suddenly ask me to repay your favors,

551
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,640
what should I do?

552
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,740
So,

553
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,060
I promise to have sex with you once.

554
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,430
Then we will be square.

555
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,170
We won't owe each other anything.

556
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,370
And let me tell you.

557
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,380
No matter how hard you try,

558
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,680
I won't be with you.

559
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,110
If every time you're by my side,

560
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,660
I have to always be vigilant...

561
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,770
I'd rather have sex with you once.

562
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,120
Then we will be square.

563
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,950
You mean

564
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:55,240
you have sex with me

565
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,340
because you want to repay me?

566
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,610
Yes.

567
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,910
You said at first that

568
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,570
you wouldn't have sex with me?

569
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,110
I said I would only do it once.

570
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,310
Do you agree?

571
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,750
Consider it a good deed.

572
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,930
Just once?

573
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:23,700
Yes.

574
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:26,690
Just once. It won't happen again.

575
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,780
Do you want me to be the Top, or do you want to be the Top?

576
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,790
You top me.

577
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,090
I'll just lie still.

578
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,160
Good.

579
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,240
Because I want to tell you

580
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,330
I only do as a Top.

581
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,100
I'm going to take a shower first.

582
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,530
Hurry up.

583
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,880
Stop dawdling.

584
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,870
Are you ready?

585
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,090
How long are you going to waste?

586
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:48,220
I've been waiting all day.

587
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,280
Hurry up and finish it.

588
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,090
You know what?

589
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,180
We can't rush

590
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,600
when doing this kind of thing.

591
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,440
What's the difference between it and what I usually do?

592
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,780
Just do it.

593
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,260
Do you usually

594
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,870
do like this with your exes?

595
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:13,780
Yes.

596
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,760
Let me teach you.

597
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,020
This kind of thing

598
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,630
is not just

599
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,140
doing it.

600
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:45,230
I don't want a kiss.

601
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,970
I won't have sex with someone who won't let me kiss.

602
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,020
Darn it.

603
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,390
Are you satisfied?

604
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,350
How can I be satisfied with this?

605
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,670
Aren't you going to help me?

606
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:21,250
Get up.

607
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,040
Do you need my help if you made me feel pain?

608
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,850
How do you feel?

609
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,420
Very bad.

610
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,960
No one ever said I was bad.

611
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,400
They only praised me for my excellence.

612
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,610
It is good that you are fine.

613
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:05,100
I'm a man. Don't treat me like a woman.

614
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,290
I never thought of you as a woman.

615
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,600
I won't have sex with women.

616
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,510
So don't worry.

617
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,940
I'll only do this to a man who had sex with me.

618
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:23,360
Were all your bedmates women?

619
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,890
Don't insult my exes.

620
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,900
To be honest,

621
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,530
when I first had sex with a man,

622
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,500
I wasn't the Top.

623
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,380
It happened when I was 14 years old.

624
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,680
Grade 8?

625
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,720
Yes, almost.

626
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:09,870
I went to a male school at that time.

627
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,620
It's normal

628
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,970
not to see girls.

629
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,430
At first, I wasn't sure if I really liked men

630
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,180
or because of the environment,

631
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,270
until a senior

632
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:34,500
asked me to go to the music room.

633
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,060
He asked me directly

634
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,800
if I could have sex with him.

635
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,940
I was confused and wanted to try at that time.

636
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,890
So I agreed.

637
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,440
But that experience wasn't very good.

638
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,300
When I was in high school,

639
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,970
I tried again.

640
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,100
This time, I became the Top.

641
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,690
That made me understand that

642
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,290
I was born like this.

643
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,690
Is it because you've never had sex with a woman

644
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,430
you think you are gay?

645
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:28,930
I tried,

646
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,660
but I didn't feel anything.

647
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:41,980
I like this.

648
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:47,520
I like someone like you.

649
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,560
Why did you tell me these?

650
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,780
I want you to know me better.

651
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,620
Also,

652
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,430
there has never been a person

653
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,170
who only had sex with me once.

654
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,910
I told you there would only be once.

655
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,120
I heard it.

656
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:28,520
But I won't remember it.

657
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,570
You wretch!

658
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,480
I won't give in to you again.

659
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,050
Stop following me.

660
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,410
Later on, everyone will know that we come here together.

661
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,270
What does it matter?

662
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,450
I did come with you.

663
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,920
Two men come here for sexual infection tests.

664
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,920
What do you think others will think when they see it?

665
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,000
Use your brain.

666
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,510
They would think...

667
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:11,780
We're a couple.

668
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:13,230
Tharn.

669
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,390
I have already come to have the test according to your instructions.

670
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,980
So if I do the test,

671
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,400
you have to do it too.

672
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,680
Otherwise, it's not fair.

673
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,630
I'm already here.

674
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,770
Then stop thinking about what others will think of us.

675
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,950
You want to know

676
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,410
if I'm sick

677
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,630
and whether you were infected by me, right?

678
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:39,860
Yes.

679
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:05,810
How is it?

680
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,280
How is the test result?

681
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,570
Everything is normal.

682
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:13,840
Other than that damn doctor

683
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,580
who asked me if I had had sex with a man.

684
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:21,290
I was speechless. It's none of his business.

685
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:23,210
Just tell me the result.

686
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,200
It's a doctor's duty to ask questions.

687
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,010
Just answer him.

688
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,120
OK. Forget it.

689
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,410
What about you?

690
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,480
What about me?

691
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,980
Your test results.

692
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:39,650
Don't play dumb.

693
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,590
What did the doctor say?

694
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:52,070
Don't worry.

695
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,340
Because I'm normal.

696
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:56,900
What about you?

697
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,790
Do you think people like me will have diseases?

698
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,600
I'm very clean, okay?

699
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,260
I can rest assured.

700
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,050
Why are you laughing?

701
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,230
Since you're relieved,

702
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,980
let's go eat together.

703
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:19,610
I'm hungry.

704
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,550
Don't touch me.

705
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:27,060
Fine, I won't touch you.

706
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:32,270
So, you and I...

707
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,250
Have only had sex once.

708
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,910
Both of them are so handsome. What a pity.

709
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:51,420
It is not a pity. You should praise them.

710
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,790
Few young people dare to come and check for this disease.

711
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,390
Even couples should pay attention to

712
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,030
their sexual health after having sex.

713
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,540
This's right.

714
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,300
Are you sure they're a couple?

715
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,270
Aren't they? They're always together.

716
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,350
You're right. They must be a couple.

717
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,790
Where did you go yesterday, Type?

718
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:31,530
I think you skipped classes many times this semester.

719
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:32,940
Yes.

720
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,130
But let's not scold him.

721
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,430
He gets full marks in every exam.

722
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:39,420
By the way,

723
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,090
Type, can you help me with my study before the exams?

724
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,650
Wait, Champ.

725
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,940
He hasn't answered my question yet.

726
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,420
Where did you go yesterday?

727
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,860
I was not feeling well.

728
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,320
Don't worry about me.

729
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,010
Now you have got the answer. Are you satisfied?

730
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:58,010
It's my turn.

731
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,060
So, will you help me with my study?

732
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,360
What can I get from helping you?

733
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,240
I'll treat you to dinner.

734
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,190
Tell me what you want to eat. I will treat you.

735
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:12,220
Sure.

736
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,270
Come to me when you're ready.

737
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:17,950
Thank you, Type.

738
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,090
I'll text you the day before the exam.

739
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,130
Don't forget it.

740
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:21,900
Got it.

741
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,420
See you.

742
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,170
What's wrong with him?

743
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,770
Speaking of buying a meal,

744
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,850
have you thanked Tharn?

745
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:33,720
For what?

746
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,980
He was always there for you when you were sick.

747
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:40,820
And he helped you solve the dispute with seniors.

748
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,230
What do you want me to do?

749
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,550
Should I walk over and say "thank you" to him

750
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,640
or put a note on his forehead?

751
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,850
Look, you are like this.

752
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,420
Don't you know how to be grateful?

753
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,300
You don't even say "thank you."

754
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,280
What do you want me to do? Go ahead.

755
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,960
Treat him to dinner

756
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,350
and treat me too.

757
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,270
I helped you too.

758
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,260
Tell me if you want to eat for free.

759
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,930
No.

760
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,210
Whatever.

761
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,960
But I won't invite him.

762
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:22,200
Sure. I knew you wouldn't invite him.

763
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,060
But it's okay. I'll text him.

764
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,270
[The Pizza Company]

765
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,950
Sorry, I'm late. My teacher delayed the class.

766
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,720
It's okay.

767
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,010
By the way, Tharn, what do you want to eat?

768
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,300
From the first page to the last page, I want to eat all of them.

769
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,480
I need to use the toilet.

770
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:53,400
Okay, put it here.

771
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,130
Bastard!

772
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:57,900
What did you say?

773
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,700
Nothing.

774
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:01,790
Just order what you want.

775
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,940
By the way,

776
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,110
can I order anything?

777
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,220
How long are you going to waste?

778
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:11,950
Okay.

779
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,950
Hello, I want to order.

780
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,870
I want

781
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:21,320
a large portion of Hawaii pizza,

782
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,120
six chicken wings, garlic bread,

783
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,830
cream bacon spaghetti, drunken pasta...

784
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:26,440
Wait. And...

785
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,230
Oh, grilled ribs.

786
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,000
No...

787
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,410
Do you want fried fries?

788
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,620
What fried fries? That's enough.

789
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,910
I'll take these first.

790
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:37,760
I want a glass of water.

791
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,580
What about you?

792
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,510
Me too.

793
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:40,660
We want two cups of water.

794
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,580
What about Tharn?

795
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:43,820
Sprite.

796
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,220
One cup of Sprite, please.

797
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,170
Does he like Sprite?

798
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,790
Leave it alone. I just know it.

799
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:55,400
You know me so well.

800
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:57,470
Why are you sitting here?

801
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,020
Hey!

802
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,360
Calm down.

803
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,820
This is a public place, not the dorm.

804
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,090
Why are you so aggressive?

805
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:07,310
He was just sitting next to you.

806
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,810
It is good for him to sit here.

807
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,200
You need to get used to it, so you can control your mouth.

808
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:15,650
That's right.

809
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:19,950
To be honest, you should have gotten used to me already.

810
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,890
Really?

811
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,140
Thank you.

812
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:27,430
Thank you.

813
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,920
No, get me the ketchup.

814
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,740
Okay.

815
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,620
Let me do it.

816
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,620
What else do you need?

817
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,800
No, I just want ketchup.

818
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,020
Let me help you.

819
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,860
Too much.

820
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,740
-That's too much, brat!
-Too much?

821
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,200
-Too much.
-Give it to me.

822
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,940
Here you are.

823
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,000
Guys,

824
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:05,690
I need to use the toilet.

825
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,340
I think I need to pee.

826
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,190
You guys eat first.

827
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,670
Seriously.

828
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:19,260
Tharn, I'm not your boyfriend.

829
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,920
I know.

830
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:25,370
If you know it, don't act like my boyfriend anymore.

831
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,800
And why is your arm so close to me?

832
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,080
And the ketchup... I didn't need you to squeeze the ketchup for me.

833
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,300
I didn't need you to get the pizza for me either.

834
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,760
I know we're not a couple.

835
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:39,840
Then...

836
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,180
Just think of it as me taking care of my bedmate.

837
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:51,660
Since you said we were bedmates,

838
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,360
do you want me to do my duty tonight?

839
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,400
What are you talking about?

840
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:22,400
Where did you get the energy?

841
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,250
My bed is dirty again.

842
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:31,030
Type.

843
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,090
What?

844
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,150
I'll sleep on your bed tonight.

845
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,890
My bed is dirty. I don't want to sleep on it.

846
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,120
Are you free this Saturday night?

847
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,240
If it's about sex, no problem.

848
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,400
I don't want that.

849
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:03,180
I wanted to invite you to buy bed sheets with me.

850
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,360
Are you going to the canteen to eat something?

851
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,940
I would like to invite you to go with me.

852
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:41,560
Didn't you say it yourself?

853
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,530
You and I...

854
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:46,880
If we get rid of sex, we're just friends.

855
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,440
You're a friend to whom I want to do this.

856
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,860
You should be happy that I did this.

857
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,270
They were my high school classmates,

858
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:58,850
Mai and Puifai.

859
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:00,320
I have added you.
