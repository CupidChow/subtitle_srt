Thank you.

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,350
Happy birthday, Brother Tharn.

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,340
Thank you.

11
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:07,980
Okay.

12
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,530
You are 19 years old.

13
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,200
You look older than me.

14
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,690
No.

15
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,220
You look much older.

16
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,350
You dressed up as a princess, how could you say that about me?

17
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,940
Today is Brother Tharn's day.

18
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,190
On my birthday,

19
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,750
you didn't take my side.

20
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,010
Because you are the oldest

21
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,010
You're a real adult.

22
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,020
Look.

23
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,470
Tharn, today is your birthday.

24
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,470
You eat first.

25
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,030
-Okay.
-Eat, Son.

26
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,390
Is it another chocolate cake this year?

27
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,930
Yes, Son.

28
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,810
At first, I was hesitating

29
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,850
whether to make an orange cake or a chocolate cake.

30
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,900
But in the end, I chose chocolate cake

31
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,430
because you like food with a very strong flavor, right?

32
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,820
Well...

33
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,370
Yes, Mom.

34
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,340
I like strong-flavor food like chocolate.

35
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,560
Can I take one piece with me then?

36
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,180
I want to bring it to my roommate.

37
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,350
OK, kid.

38
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,670
Take more.

39
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,850
Are all the things in your dormitory ready?

40
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,339
Do you need any help?

41
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,300
No.

42
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,390
I went shopping with my friend.

43
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,020
We also bought a fridge and a microwave.

44
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,980
But I want to meet your friend too.

45
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,350
If there's a chance, I'll bring him here.

46
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,350
Okay.

47
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,520

48
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,670

49

Hello, everyone.

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,860
San.

51
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,700
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,670
Have a seat.

53
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,940
Can you be normal when you come to my house, San?

54
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,300
Happy birthday, Tharn.

55
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,909
Thank you.

56
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,800
You come here every year.

57
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,900
I was just passing by.

58
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,470
I remembered it was Tharn's birthday

59
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,070
so I came to congratulate him.

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,460
You've been using this excuse for four years.

61
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,120
Salad.

62
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,490
My name is Sanran, not Salad.

63
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,300
Tharn and I are like brothers.

64
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,870
We only have three siblings.

65
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,990
Where are you from?

66
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,540
Did you ask my parents?

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,420
Ma'am, look.

68
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,990
Thorn is kicking me out again.

69
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,940
Thorn, how could you say that?

70
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,200
San is so mindful of your brother.

71
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Thank you, Kid.

72
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:30,940
You're welcome.

73
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,650
You are just like my son.

74
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,040
You can come in and out of our house at any time.

75
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,730
Thank you, ma'am.

76
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,540
This is your birthday present.

77
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,159
You don't have to buy presents for me every year.

78
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,130
I'm embarrassed.

79
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,220
Do you dare to refuse my birthday gift?

80
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,900
Have some vegetables.

81
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,740
Thank you.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,770
I miss you when you were 14.

83
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,210
And if you don't mention

84
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,870
when I was fourteen,

85
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,840
it will be even better.

86
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,260
Why?

87
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,320
You were this tall before.

88
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,800
But now, I'm as tall as you.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,770
Yeah.

90
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,700
That cute kid is gone.

91
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,020
There's only Tharn who's as handsome as me now.

92
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,430
Shut up, San.

93
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,680
My brother is much more handsome than you.

94
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,560
Happy birthday, Tharn.

95
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,010
Thank you.

96
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,560
Let's eat, kids.

97
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,690
Or let's cut the cake.

98
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,159
Cut the cake.

99
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,720
The person whose birthday is being celebrated, please cut it.

100
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,040
You can eat the cake now.

101
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,820
It is mine.

102
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,010
Okay, dip it.

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,750
By the way, Type.

104
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,510
At first, I thought

105
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,410
you would invite Tharn to dinner.

106
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,960
He went home. Today is his birthday.

107
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,060
What? Is it his birthday today?

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,240
Yes.

109
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,940
In that case,

110
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,320
can you come and eat with us?

111
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,310
He went home.

112
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,460
Do you think someone like me

113
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,470
would go home with him?

114
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,060
Yes.

115
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,970
Use your brain, No.

116
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,390
It's not like that.

117
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,210
But...

118
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:33,500
Well,

119
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,030
it's your boyfriend's birthday.

120
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,880
Wait.

121
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,520
What did you just say?

122
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,830
Who has a boyfriend?

123
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,590
Did you hear it wrong?

124
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,409
Yes, you heard it wrong.

125
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,270
Who has a boyfriend?

126
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,659
But I heard it too.

127
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,120
I heard it too.

128
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,480
With my mouth like this, how can I have a boyfriend?

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,290
After careful consideration, what he said is right.

130
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,240
He's not likely to have a boyfriend, since he's such a bad talker.

131
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,250
Yeah.

132
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,190
He's not likely to have a boyfriend, since he's such a bad talker.

133
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,030
To be honest,

134
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,510
no one on the whole table here can beat me in terms of displeasing others with talks.

135
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,100
Sorry.

136
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,870
Let's eat.

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,940
It's almost burnt.

138
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,750
Give it to me

139
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,910
Champ.

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,570
I'm hungry.

141
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,970
You're so good at snatching.

142
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,880
[Happy birthday, Brother. Mom and Dad gave you a big gift.
So I'm afraid I don't have to give you presents. Take care of it. Love you.]

143
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,690
Type. Type. Type.

144
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,560
Wait.

145
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,250
Is Tharn's family that rich?

146
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,280
Yes.

147
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,820
Oh my, they bought an Audi for their son for fun.

148
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,419
It costs several million.

149
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,650
He told me

150
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,680
his father was the boss of a small company.

151
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,960
His brother drives a BMW.

152
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,260
His family must be very rich.

153
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,100
I think his father's company is not small.

154
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,160
Why does he live in the dorm inside the school?

155
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,870
He told me

156
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,370
he didn't want to waste his time practicing instruments.

157
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,480
So he lives in the school dorm. It's close.

158
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,370
He's very responsible.

159
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,040
He's a good man.

160
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,490
He's rich, he is not arrogant,

161
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,730
and he is so grounded.

162
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,810
That's it.

163
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,210
You were born lucky.

164
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,790
Of course.

165
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,390
Why is Type called "lucky"?

166
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,330
Because he has a rich friend.

167
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
Are you crazy today, No?

168
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,210
Does it have anything to do with him when his friend is rich?

169
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,100
That's his friend's money.

170
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,100
His friend will not spend for him.

171
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,250
I don't want rich friends.

172
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,690
I don't want to be compared.

173
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,550
I remember Tharn, your roommate.

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,030
He looks handsome and has a good personality.

175
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,660
He even learns instruments

176
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,730
He has cars.

177
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,150
I think all rich people are proud.

178
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,650
Right?

179
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,860
Right? Rich people are very proud.

180
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,180
Don't you feel depressed when living with him in the same room?

181
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,560
No.

182
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,770
I don't like you guys talking about my roommate like that either.

183
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,760
What's wrong with Tharn being rich?

184
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,820
You sounded like that was his weakness.

185
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,630
I get along with him because of his personality,

186
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,210
not because his family is rich.

187
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,100
Watch your mouth, Team.

188
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,150
Type, calm down.

189
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,960
That's how Team talks. He doesn't care much.

190
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,130
Don't get annoyed.

191
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

192
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,430
My friend...

193
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,510
Hey.

194
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,080
It was all your fault.

195
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,260
Your mouth...

196
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:35,890
Come on.

197
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,240
This burnt meat is for you.

198
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,050
Don't you usually eat burnt food?

199
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,730
Take it.

200
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,170
What's the matter, No?

201
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,130
[I wanted to ask you when we were in the restaurant.]

202
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,730
[What birthday gift did you buy for Tharn?]

203
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,580
You're really gossiping about my affairs.

204
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,810
[Of course.]

205
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,730
[I want to know everything about you.]

206
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,260
[So, what are you going to give him?]

207
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,170
I've prepared a gift.

208
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,780
I'm sure he'll like it.

209
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,760
[Hey, I just saw]

210
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,400
[Tharn's brother's photo posted on social media.]

211
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,080
[Who is the one tagged standing next to Tharn?]

212
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,980
[He's super handsome.]

213
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,250
Which photo?

214
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,540
[The last one.]

215
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,910
[On Tharn's homepage.]

216
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,040
[That's all for now.]

217
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,100
[I'm going out to buy something for my mom.]

218
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,110
[Thorn, Than, and the other three]

219
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,940
Aren't there only three siblings in Tharn's family?

220
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,450
Who is this?

221
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,500
[Happy birthday.]

222
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,250
[Aren't you going to bless me?]

223
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,770
[It is good enough that I didn't forget it.]

224
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:29,010
[Bless me.]

225
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,480
Damn it.

226
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,370
[Happy birthday.]

227
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,780
[Good night.]

228
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,550
You're going to play mental warfare with me, aren't you, Tharn?

229
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,930
[What's the matter?]

230
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,850
Happy birthday.

231
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,070
[Good night.]

232
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,550
Happy birthday.

233
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,350
[Good night.]

234
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,210
What are you playing?

235
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,690
Happy birthday to you.

236
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,680
Are you satisfied?

237
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,430
[I'm just waiting for you to bless me.]

238
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,100
[Got it?]

239
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,390
Good night.

240
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,730
You're not here tonight.

241
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,760
I'll occupy your bed.

242
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,900
Happy birthday, handsome boy.

243
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,420
Lhong, you're too heavy.

244
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,110
And I'm not handsome.

245
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,490
Whether you are handsome or not,

246
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,760
many people are waiting to give you gifts.

247
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,850
They are humans, not elephants.

248
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,930
Here you are.

249
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,360
A birthday present.

250
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,740
Gum?

251
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,600
Yes, it is good that I didn't forget it.

252
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,780
Thank you.

253
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,060
You remember my birthday every year.

254
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,800
If I can't remember it, I will be stupid, friend.

255
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,930
Your brother tagged so many people on social media.

256
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:36,940
By the way,

257
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,830
did that brother go there too yesterday?

258
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,260
Yes, he gave me a gift.

259
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,700
That is to say,

260
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,510
the first love is unforgettable, right?

261
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,530
What are you talking about?

262
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,430
Forget it.

263
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,700
By the way,

264
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,640
come to the band for rehearsal next week.

265
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,800
I have found a new bass player.

266
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,350
Tae, do you remember him?

267
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,140
He went to the singing class with me.

268
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,350
Yes.

269
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,340
It's him. You should remember him.

270
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,970
Tell me when you'll gather for rehearsal.

271
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,920
Okay, busy man.

272
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,700
How about this? I'll make an appointment with you one year in advance.

273
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,990
Then you will have time to rehearse with me.

274
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,240
You deserve a beating.

275
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,300
I'm scared.

276
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,170
Just let me bother you.

277
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,000
I heard you moved out.

278
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,200
You didn't even tell me.

279
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,850
Yes.

280
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,630
I moved out. It's more convenient in terms of time.

281
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,250
I can go back to the dormitory anytime I want.

282
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,170
Hello, everyone.

283
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,190
Get ready for class.

284
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:01,440
[There is no Sprite. Have some Coke first. I hope your blood sugar will rise. Open the drawer.]

285
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,150
A birthday present?

286
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,330
It's much better than I thought.

287
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,280
There's no Sprite.

288
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,850
Open the drawer.

289
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,480
Come back, Type.

290
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,390
I can't wait to use my birthday present.

291
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,280
What?

292
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,550
You're back.

293
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,569
Yes.

294
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,200
I came back in the morning.

295
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,630
Well,

296
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,470
what did you buy?

297
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,410
I haven't eaten yet.

298
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,850
There are several kinds of food.

299
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:41,080
Chocolate, strawberries, oranges,

300
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,810
sweet melon and peaches...

301
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,350
When did you become a vegetarian?

302
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,390
Why are there only fruits?

303
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,950
Yes.

304
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,920
Which one would you like?

305
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,550
The birthday gift you bought me...

306
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,470
You...

307
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,290
Just choose one flavor.

308
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
Aren't you hungry?

309
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,800
I want to eat food.

310
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,310
Then,

311
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,380
I will choose chocolate.

312
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,880
Do you think you can eat me?

313
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,030
Then try it.

314
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,400
It's my birthday.

315
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,500
Your birthday was yesterday.

316
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,310
I was kidding.

317
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,930
You're hungry, right?

318
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,720
Over there.

319
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,170
I brought you a cake

320
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,420
from home.

321
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,650
Eat it first.

322
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,230
Is it a leftover from your home?

323
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,850
No.

324
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,590
I brought it especially for you.

325
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,360
Because you wouldn't go to my house to celebrate my birthday.

326
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,090
You eat it first.

327
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,550
I will buy you food

328
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,650
after I take a shower.

329
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,570
Are you going to buy me food?

330
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,570
Yes, what do you want to eat?

331
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,370
I can't think of anything.

332
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,070
Go take a shower.

333
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,230
I'll wash myself after you.

334
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,810
Then we'll go and look for food together.

335
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,890
Okay.

336
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,550
Tharn, lend me a pair of pants.

337
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,570
Okay.

338
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,740
Take one. They are in my bag.

339
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,140
I brought them from home.

340
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,700
[Happy birthday. No matter how many years have passed,
you're important to me.]

341
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,290
Who gave it to him?

342
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,010
The man his brother marked in the photo?

343
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,710
Your gift is nice.

344
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,910
Did you check it?

345
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,330
It's in your bag.

346
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,820
Since you got such a good gift,

347
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,940
you can throw away my gift.

348
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,490
Type.

349
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,720
I like your gift.

350
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,860
Who gave this to you?

351
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,430
Are you jealous?

352
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,060
You deserve a beating.

353
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,880
How can people like me be jealous because of you?

354
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,510
Then you probably don't want to know

355
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,930
who gave the gift to me.

356
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,680
Yes. No need to tell me.

357
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,310
Go out and buy me chicken rice noodles.

358
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,920
I don't want to go out.

359
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you angry?

360
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:59,780
What's up? Why are you so fidgety?

361
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,030
Mind your own business.

362
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,560
You bastard!

363
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,860
But you look scarier today than usual.

364
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:08,910
Why do you say so?

365
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,680
Nothing.

366
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,890
Never mind.

367
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,160
By the way, I wanted to ask you.

368
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,600
Can I tell sisters

369
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,260
that you are dating Tharn?

370
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,300
Calm down.

371
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,800
So sharp.

372
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,360
Don't poke me.

373
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,110
What did you say?

374
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,360
I didn't say anything. You heard it wrong.

375
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,370
My mouth was a little big.

376
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,230
I'll poke you.

377
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,570
Okay.

378
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,210
Let's eat. Let's eat.

379
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,130
Oh, right.

380
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:43,420
But aren't you dating Tharn?

381
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,650
What? Are you going to keep it a secret?

382
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,200
Yes.

383
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,260
Then...

384
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,940
Don't you pity Tharn's feelings?

385
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,900
Why should I?

386
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,600
I don't think he wants to make it public either.

387
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,060
I don't think he wants to tell anyone.

388
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,740
You're right.

389
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,670
Then why are you so fidgety?

390
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,000
Shouldn't you fall in love with your boyfriend?

391
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,280
Fall in love?

392
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,150
I want to catch him, kill him,

393
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,490
and put him in the toilet bowl.

394
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,050
What did you argue about?

395
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:24,090
Don't tell me it was about his birthday again.

396
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,830
See? I told you.

397
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,400
I told you

398
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,980
to celebrate his birthday with him

399
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,080
instead of having dinner with us.

400
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,540
How about this?

401
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,940
Let's go celebrate his birthday.

402
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,590
I'll ask him out first.

403
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,760
Tharn. Tharn. Tharn.

404
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,550
Here he is.

405
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,570
Treat me too, Tharn.

406
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:04,150
[Let's go make up for your birthday celebration together. Type will go there too. 
Treat me too, Tharn.]

407
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,470
Do you force him like this?

408
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,480
A little.

409
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,040
I haven't seen him for a month.

410
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,450
Besides, in that case,

411
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,660
you two can be reconciled.

412
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,450
This is an additional benefit, you know?

413
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,910
[Okay. I'm leaving school at 4:30 today. Where will we meet?]

414
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,490
That means he agreed.

415
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,600
I'll get ready for it first. See you then.

416
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,930
You need to come.

417
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:26,960
What's wrong with him?

418
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,880
Hey, call your boyfriend

419
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,040
and ask him if he's finished school.

420
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,590
I have told you.

421
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,260
Don't say we're dating.

422
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:42,770
I'm sorry.

423
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,630
Then call him and ask him where he is.

424
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,820
No need to call him.

425
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,680
The handsome guy is coming when we speak of him.

426
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,130
By the way, who's the person next to him?

427
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,960
Is he a senior at Tharn's college?

428
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,030
Gosh.

429
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,710
This college is full of handsome guys.

430
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,970
Do they choose good-looking ones or people with good grades?

431
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,680
How are you? Are you okay?

432
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,710
Who's next to you?

433
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,220
This is Sanran.

434
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,460
My senior in my previous school.

435
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,000
Hello, Sanran.

436
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,520
Hello.

437
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,730
This is Techno.

438
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,600
This is Type, my roommate.

439
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,940
Thorn said you live with your roommate.

440
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,700
Nice to meet you.

441
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,930
Why do you look so familiar?

442
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,110
It's him.

443
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,560
Tharn took him to his birthday party.

444
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,010
I see. I saw you on a social media platform.

445
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,830
Actually, Tharn's brother and I are also good friends.

446
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,630
Why do you have so many identities?

447
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,820
Actually, there are more than just these identities.

448
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,300
You're a senior I respect a lot.

449
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,310
Oh.

450
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,390
That works too.

451
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,560
I happened to pass by,

452
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,320
so I gave Tharn what Thorn asked me to give him.

453
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,630
I was going to invite him to dinner.

454
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,380
I guess I came on the wrong day.

455
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,990
It's okay.

456
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,640
Let's go eat together later.

457
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,550
Okay, it's my treat.

458
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,820
Lead the way.

459
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,250
You are just like my dad.

460
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,020
Let's go.

461
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,060
I have a restaurant I want to go to.

462
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,770
It is Southern food. It must be delicious.

463
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,470
Is it far?

464
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,100
No.

465
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,780
This way, Brother.

466
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,630
What's the matter?

467
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,830
Nothing.

468
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,000
Anyone else wants more?

469
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,600
Every dish here is delicious.

470
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,960
I come here often.

471
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,560
What's good?

472
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,420
This one.

473
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,260
It is yellow curry. Type really likes it.

474
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,460
He said

475
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,910
the yellow curry his mother made

476
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,610
is the best in the world.

477
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,730
Even Puifai asked him how his mother made it.

478
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,770
Have you and Puifai been to this restaurant before?

479
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,320
Puifai...

480
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,630
Is Puifai Type's girlfriend?

481
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,840
No.

482
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,480
No.

483
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,670
Have you opened the gift I gave you?

484
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,390
Yes.

485
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,770
But you don't have to buy gifts for me next time.

486
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,790
I'm embarrassed.

487
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,970
You don't need to be embarrassed.

488
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,750
I bought gifts for you since you were little.

489
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,030
But you only bought me snacks before.

490
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,350
Now I've grown up.

491
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,060
I have money to buy you gifts.

492
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,320
Have you known each other for a long time?

493
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,100
Since Grade 7...

494
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,690
Because his brother and I are friends.

495
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,260
His brother introduced us to each other.

496
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,910
Because he was afraid that his brother would be bullied.

497
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,600
What?

498
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,920
Tharn's as strong as a buffalo.

499
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,530
Who dares to bully him?

500
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,910
When he was a child, he was this little.

501
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,860
Think about it. He is a half-blood.

502
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,910
He has bright eyes and fair face.

503
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,300
His brother was afraid that Tharn would be bullied,

504
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,910
so he introduced Tharn to us, seniors in Grade 1 in high school.

505
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,520
If anything happened,

506
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,830
we could help his brother.

507
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:59,720
I don't think we should talk about our childhood.

508
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,480
It is so far away that I almost forgot it.

509
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,560
But I want to know it.

510
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,340
Do you have a photo?

511
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes. I'll send it to you.

512
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,620
He was so cute when he was little.

513
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,510
Your senior keeps your photo.

514
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,010
He will definitely extort you, Tharn.

515
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,040
Type.

516
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,690
I ordered fish dew shrimp for you.

517
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,550
It's a signature dish.

518
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,560
It looks delicious.

519
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,430
It's a pity that Tharn can't eat it.

520
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,960
Try it. It's not that spicy.

521
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,060
Tharn doesn't eat raw and spicy food,

522
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,430
unlike his brother.

523
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,940
Thorn likes to eat Cold Mixed Jumping Shrimp,

524
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,610
letting shrimps dance in his mouth.

525
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,660
Is that so? I just knew that you don't eat raw food.

526
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,950
I can eat some too.

527
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm not completely unable to eat it.

528
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,220
But you vomited it when you were little.

529
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,870
Sanran, stop it.

530
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,980
What did I say wrong?

531
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,430
You've played enough.

532
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,320
I haven't played anything yet.

533
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,370
I'll be back soon.

534
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,570
Type.

535
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,040
Darn it.

536
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,190
Tell me if you don't like it.

537
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,520
You've been away for so long. Is everything okay?

538
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,810
Yes.

539
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,920
What's your relationship with Tharn?

540
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,510
We are roommates.

541
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:44,830
That's good.

542
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,250
You're just roommates.

543
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,550
Do you know

544
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,270
apart from being his senior,

545
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,460
his brother's friend,

546
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,240
who I am?

547
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,690
I'm his first and only one.

548
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:26,750
What's wrong?

549
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,820
You were like this when you were in the restaurant.

550
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,350
Talk with me first.

551
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,500
I have nothing to talk to you about.

552
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
Sorry.

553
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
I didn't tell you I didn't eat raw fish.

554
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,060
Then why didn't you tell me?

555
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,450
Because I can eat some too.

556
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,910
It's not that I can't eat it.

557
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,780
Don't lie to me, Tharn.

558
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,010
You don't like raw fish, do you?

559
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,660
No.

560
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,640
I don't like it.

561
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,700
Then why didn't you tell me?

562
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,050
That day, I thought you liked it as much as I did.

563
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,360
That's why I asked you to eat it with me.

564
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,400
Is it fun?

565
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
You made me look like a fool.

566
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,670
I watched you act as if you liked eating this and that.

567
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,040
I was not acting.

568
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,050
You wanted to eat it.

569
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,640
I just wanted to do as you wished.

570
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,670
I don't need you to do as I wish.

571
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,590
Then what do you want me to do?

572
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:30,980
Tell me.

573
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,130
Tell me

574
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,650
what you like or dislike.

575
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,480
Have you ever listened to me

576
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,830
when I told you?

577
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,640
But you had a chance to tell me that day.

578
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,650
Why didn't you tell me?

579
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,320
What do you want me to say?

580
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,620
I don't like it. I don't eat it.

581
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,940
Then who would be the one who got irritated?

582
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,390
It would be you.

583
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,920
Are you blaming me?

584
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,510
I'm not blaming you.

585
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,700
You're saying it was my fault.

586
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,330
Yes. I never listened to you.

587
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,590
I never cared what you like or dislike.

588
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,420
I don't care about anything.

589
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,610
But I don't like to

590
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,940
know them from that person either.

591
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,270
What do you want me to do?

592
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,120
Don't see him again.

593
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,040
Why should I follow your words?

594
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,290
Because I hate him.

595
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,600
I don't need to avoid meeting him

596
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,880
just because you hate him.

597
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,310
Sanran is my brother's friend

598
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,850
and a senior I respect.

599
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,010
What did he do to you?

600
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,870
You don't need to know

601
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,600
what he did to me.

602
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,130
You just need to know

603
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,840
that I hate him. It is enough.

604
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:27,330
Just like

605
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,280
you don't have to care about my feelings, right?

606
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,179
Tharn.

607
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,370
I warn you not to see him again.

608
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,530
What if I don't follow your words?

609
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,139
Let's break up then.

610
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,050
♫When looking at each other, I miss you♫

611
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,720
♫Don't need to say a word♫

612
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,030
♫The way you look at me♫

613
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,820
♫Tells me you love me♫

614
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,240
You don't like to

615
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,110
hear about my things from Sanran.

616
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,190
But you know what?

617
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:25,000
♫Maybe I should say it♫

618
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:25,030
Sanran knows me better than you.

619
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,430
Because if he were here,

620
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,800
he would tell you

621
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,430
I hated breaking up.

622
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,590
♫My last lover♫

623
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:54,660
♫The person who stays with me all the time♫

624
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,130
♫I will not make you sad♫

625
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,310
Go to hell.

626
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:06,260
♫Can you hear my words, baby?♫

627
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,140
♫If the world collapses, please remember♫

628
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:18,300
♫My love for you will never change♫

629
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,180
♫We will walk side by side♫

630
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:27,200
♫As long as you always love me♫

631
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,720
Tharn, are you asleep?

632
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,960
I'm sorry.

633
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,340
Turn around and talk to me first.

634
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,260
I didn't mean it.

635
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,530
I didn't really want to break up with you.

636
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,170
I just said it under the circumstances.

637
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,650
Okay, go to sleep.

638
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,100
We will have class tomorrow morning.

639
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,650
I'm sorry.

640
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,140
Please forgive me.

641
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,700
Lhong.

642
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,750
Come here.

643
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,420
What's wrong with Tharn?

644
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:17,500
I don't know.

645
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,830
Sorry, I got up late.

646
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,700
But I came here as soon as possible.

647
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,640
Call us next time.

648
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,740
You have our social accounts too.

649
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,960
Brother Tharn, I don't want to be late either.

650
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,340
But I memorized the score a bit late last night.

651
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,150
But I came here as soon as possible.

652
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,400
Don't be mad.

653
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,620
Tharn is not angry. I'm angry.

654
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,260
Hurry up.

655
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,420
Okay.

656
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,890
Can I be angry?

657
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,870
No need.

658
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,590
By the way, what's the matter?

659
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,330
You seemed distracted just now.

660
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,970
I'm fine.

661
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,590
Yes, you are fine.

662
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,830
But if anything happens to you, tell me right away.

663
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,040
Don't forget that I'm your friend.

664
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,420
OK. I'll tell you right away if anything happens.

665
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,340
I'm sure our band will be great.

666
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,820
Yes.

667
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,300
Can we start the rehearsal?

668
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:35,600
Come on.

669
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,750
Come on.

670
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,190
Have you eaten?

671
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,810
Yes.

672
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,550
Oh.

673
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,320
What's this?

674
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,640
My breakfast.

675
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:30,740
But it'll be bad in the morning.

676
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,100
Yes, I bought it for you.

677
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,340
Well...

678
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,120
How long are you going to piss me off?

679
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,240
I said I was reliable to displease others when talking.

680
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,520
I was wrong. I had a fight with you.

681
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,030
But I don't want to break up with you.

682
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,120
Turn around and talk to me.

683
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:47,040
Why did you say that if you didn't want to break up?

684
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,150
I just said it under the circumstances.

685
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,110
What if I said "break up" under the circumstances?

686
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,220
Forget it.

687
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,630
I'm afraid you won't be as heartbroken as I am.

688
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,470
If I didn't care about you,

689
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:08,980
I wouldn't sit here to coax you.

690
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,190
Why did I buy you dinner?

691
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,810
Why did I find a laundry to mend your clothes?

692
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,900
I begged you to forgive me,

693
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,440
because I care about you, right?

694
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,330
My terrible boyfriend.

695
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,240
I'm sorry.

696
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,660
Please forgive me.

697
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,400
Then, in the future,

698
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,610
you need to consider my feelings.

699
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,980
I don't want to hear you say "break up".

700
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,540
I forgive you.

701
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,830
But you have one thing to apologize to me.

702
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,550
About Sanran...

703
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,730
I have told you.

704
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:27,900
San is my respected senior.

705
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,930
No.

706
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,650
You had sex with him.

707
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:35,650
How did you know it?

708
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,530
It means it's true, right?

709
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,770
You really had sex with him.

710
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,790
Yes.

711
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,430
San is my first boyfriend.

712
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,020
You are dissipated.

713
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,580
That's too harsh, isn't it?

714
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,160
Tharn.

715
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,370
It's just a hug.

716
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,690
Why are you making a fuss?

717
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,000
Yes.

718
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,040
Don't cherish yourself so much.

719
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,830
I'm not like you who have sex with anyone.

720
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,270
Then why do you suddenly want to know about my exes?

721
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:26,010
Because your first love picked a fight with me.

722
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,870
San?

723
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,960
Can you not emphasize that it was him?

724
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,100
Do you want to know about me and him?

725
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,170
[Bar]

726
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,020
Look at your face.

727
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,060
Why did you tease my brother again?

728
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,340
You have just come. I've been waiting for you all night.

729
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,300
As you know,

730
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,100
I need to wait for the princess to sleep first.

731
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,520
But don't change the subject.

732
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,200
Answer my question first.

733
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,790
What did you do?

734
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,060
Just...

735
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,000
Just a little.

736
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,150
So it must be related to my brother.

737
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,510
Seriously, after thinking about it,

738
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:28,910
I shouldn't have introduced my brother to you.

739
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:31,810
You've said that for five years.

740
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,790
What? I have to keep saying it.

741
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,060
How could there be someone like you

742
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,830
who pesters his friend's brother?

743
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,140
And at that time, Tharn was only 14.

744
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,580
He was only that little when he was 14.

745
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,490
And he was so cute

746
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,340
and cheerful.

747
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,420
Of course, I liked him.

748
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,120
Of course, if there was a chance, I would pursue him.

749
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,890
San,

750
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,590
this was not a pursuit.

751
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,840
What you did is called a quick battle.

752
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,180
You knew that Tharn wanted to learn music,

753
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,390
so you took him to the music room

754
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,390
and had sex with him.

755
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:12,150
If

756
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,530
you hadn't confessed to me and got beaten by me,

757
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,580
I would have broken up with you.

758
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,700
Back then,

759
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,010
Your fist was really good.

760
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,280
It hurts even when I think about it.

761
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,400
You deserve it.

762
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:28,550
I wanted to hurt you.

763
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,330
Think about it.

764
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,820
I just took Tharn to the hospital.

765
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:37,540
I asked my best friend to take care of my brother.

766
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,030
What happened then?

767
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,770
My brother was fucked by my best friend.

768
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,440
You don't need to beat around the bush to scold me.

769
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,990
By the way, San,

770
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,340
except for the case,

771
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,820
you were nice to my brother.

772
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,230
You kindly advised my parents

773
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,520
to agree to send Tharn to study music.

774
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,710
You taught him and took care of him.

775
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,830
I also thought

776
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:09,240
when Tharn said he only treated you as his brother back then,

777
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,650
you would give up.

778
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:13,740
But you didn't.

779
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,650
Please stop pestering my brother.

780
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,690
I can't give up on Tharn.

781
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,250
Because he's very important to me.

782
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,520
That's why I can't let this go. Do you understand?

783
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,580
With you saying so, what do you want to do?

784
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:40,430
Just wait and see.

785
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,770
Cheers.

786
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,070
Did you have sex with him when you were 14?

787
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,200
Yes.

788
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,790
Think about it.

789
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:18,460
If a woman wants to have sex with you,

790
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:20,870
will you say no?

791
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,080
That's a woman.

792
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,290
But this is a man.

793
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:32,870
If you don't pay attention to gender,

794
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,210
you'll see a bigger world.

795
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,340
So,

796
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,430
he was your first time.

797
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,130
Yes.

798
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,140
He let you know

799
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,000
you were not born to be Bottom.

800
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,300
And he's your good brother.

801
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:00,090
He also taught you how to persuade your parents to let you learn music.

802
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:00,590
Yes.

803
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:02,930
Good.

804
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,670
Great.

805
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,760
He is so good that I hate him.

806
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,750
Then tell him.

807
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:18,930
Tell him who I really belong to.

808
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,060
It is impossible.

809
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,560
Let's stop talking. I'm sleepy.

810
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,820
I'm going to sleep.

811
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,250
Don't sleep. Let's talk.

812
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,440
No.

813
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,220
Don't you want to prove it?

814
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,500
Don't you want to prove what I really like?

815
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,600
Do I like to submit to San

816
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,540
or to be like this with you?

817
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,840
You were not as naive as you said, right?

818
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,400
You've been cunning since childhood.

819
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,410
I'll answer you then.

820
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,030
I like this.

821
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,780
I like to be like this with you.

822
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,310
Go to sleep.

823
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,740
Remember what you said.

824
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,310
Okay.

825
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,230
How can I forget to buy dipping sauce when making hotpot?

826
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:32,630
Darn it.

827
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:44,720
Tharn.

828
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,940
Seriously,

829
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,000
what's so good about him?

830
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,830
Go back to where you came from.

831
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,420
It's your turn to be jealous because of me.

832
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:54,900
We're even.

833
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,520
I'm sorry.

834
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,630
Brother Tharn, wait.

835
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,180
I have to go, Tar.

836
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,280
Let's go, Song.
