00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,780
What are you going to do now?

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:10,230
You know me. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,900
Hey, what are you doing?

[Hello?]

00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,450
Hello, my name is Type.

7
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,990
I'm Tharn's boyfriend.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,130
I have something to tell you.

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,270
You jerk!

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,440
That coward hung up on me.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,340
Don't tell me you called him.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,480
Yes, Tharn's ex-boyfriend.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,640
He made me look like a bad guy that wanted to kill him.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,620
No.

15
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,970
What?

16
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,810
You said

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,330
that he goes to the same school as Nic, right?

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,520
Don't tell me you're...

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,010
Yes, I'm going to find him.

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,350
Gosh.

21
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,810
Is there no other way, Type?

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,430
No.

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,190
Just wait and see.

26
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,600
Calm down.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,860
He's here.

28
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,329
You're fast.

29
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,380
Any news?

30
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,370
Calm down, Brother No.

31
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,820
You only give me one night.

32
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,180
It's not like we only have one or two students in my class.

33
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,440
So you didn't find anything?

34
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,970
I did.

35
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,180
But what are you going to give me in exchange?

36
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,050
I...

37
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,190
Are these all the students from your class?

38
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,170
Yes, brother.

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,840
You were going to negotiate with me,

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,480
but you just gave it to him the next second?

41
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,720
It depends.

42
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,200
I know who I can negotiate with and who I can't.

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,850
-I'd give up
-What is it?

44
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,050
if it's Brother Type.

45
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,550
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

46
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,340
Oh, so you knew it?

47
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,570
I found him.

48
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,770
Where?

49
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,130
This kid.

50
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,680
He's my classmate in French class.

51
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,370
I met him several times.

52
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,650
He's famous because he's handsome.

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,020
You're done now, right?

54
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,430
I'm going to school, then.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,430
Wait.

56
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,550
Do me another favor.

57
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,760
Is it him?

58
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,380
Yes.

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,870
He's so tall.

60
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,640
Hey.

61
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,200
Isn't this bullying?

62
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,890
What bullying? When did I bully him?

63
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,590
Yeah, you didn't.

64
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,890
But there are three of us.

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,100
We're outnumbered.

66
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,620
Look at you now. You look like you would kill.

67
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,670
Speaking of look, I've been wanting to tell you this long ago.

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,640
What?

69
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,850
Your brother is so good-looking.

70
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,659
And?

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,770
-How come the older brother is so ugly?
-You jerk.

72
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,820
You ask me to relax, don't you?

73
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,930
Please keep being nervous, then.

74
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,130
Brother Type, that's Tar.

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,940
Bring him here.

76
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,400
Are you Tar?

77
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,270
Calm down.

79
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,370
Didn't you say my brother is here?

80
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,320
You're Tar, right?

81
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,690
-Yes.
-I'm Type.

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,590
Where are you going in a hurry?

83
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,210
Don't you want to talk to me first?

84
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,420
Or you only talk to Brother Tharn?

85
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,580
Aren't you going to say anything?

86
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,750
I'll make you break up with Brother Tharn.

87
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,670
What did you say?

88
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,630
Calm down, Type.

89
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,950
Kiddo, your face is pretty,

90
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,720
but not your mouth.

91
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,780
How can you steal someone else's boyfriend?

92
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,840
You're going to break up anyway.

93
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,640
-You jerk.
-Calm down, Type.

94
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,460
-Calm down, please.
-Calm down.

95
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,950
We're in a cafe. It's crowded.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,040
People are going to say that you're bullying the kid.

97
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,490
You too, kid.

98
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,550
Weren't you broke up with Tharn a long time ago?

99
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,659
Why are you ruining others' relationship?

100
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:37,360
No matter what you say, you will break up in the end.

101
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,800
No matter what,

102
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,260
I will make you break up.

103
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,840
You're finally back.

104
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,900
Where did you go to date your ex-boyfriend again?

105
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,920
I had training today.

106
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,800
Ask Lhong if you don't believe me.

107
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,000
No need, I trust you.

108
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,240
Because I went to your ex-boyfriend just now.

109
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
Are you scared?

110
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,960
All I did was meet your Tar.

111
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,220
He doesn't belong to me.

112
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,790
But you belong to him.

113
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,340
Don't you know?

114
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,790
What do you mean?

115
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,600
Nothing.

116
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,540
He told me that you belong to him.

117
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,990
No matter what,

118
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,720
he'll take you away from me.

119
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,309
-Type, you know that...
-I'm not done yet.

120
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,520
Don't interrupt.

121
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,020
That kid...

122
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,990
He said that you still love him.

123
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,000
And he loves you very much too.

124
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,200
He loves you so much that he's willing to be the other man.

125
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,910
Because he didn't want to lose you.

126
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,110
He said

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,540
that he has never forgotten you.

128
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,140
He couldn't wait to come back to you.

129
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,220
His cheeks streamed with tears when he said these to me.

130
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,660
I feel so bad for him.

131
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,210
Type.

132
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,340
-I love you.
-Shut up.

133
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,810
When did I ask you to talk?

134
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,700
You know what?

135
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,930
Your ex-boyfriend is very pretentious.

136
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,700
He cried like the world was ending in front of me,

137
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,450
saying that he would take you back.

138
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,410
Does he think he's the heroine of a novel?

139
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,690
He thought I'd give you back just because he cried and begged me.

140
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,990
I won't give up my thing so easily.

141
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,920
I gave him a punch, but it didn't diminish my anger.

142
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,310
Did you hit him?

143
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,150
Why?

144
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,900
Are you worried about him?

145
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,450
Are you worried about him?

146
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,760
Are you blind?

147
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,070
He's a man too.

148
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,340
He won't die just because he was punched.

149
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,040
Calm down, Type.

150
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,660
I'm worried about you.

151
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,110
I don't want you to get into trouble.

152
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,120
You're also a hypocrite.

153
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,240
Just be honest if you're worried about him.

154
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,560
Yes.

155
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,330
That's who I am.

156
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,350
Bad-tempered,

157
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,550
and bad-mouthed.

158
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,450
I never think before I speak.

159
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,030
I'm a jerk who bullies kids.

160
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,650
Is there anyone who would think for me?

161
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,780
Who's going to understand me?

162
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,460
I understand you, Type.

163
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,310
But listen to me first.

164
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,610
I want to explain what happened last night.

165
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,270
Let go of me!

166
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,510
Type.

167
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,430
I love you.

168
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,380
Let go of me!

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,140
I love you, Type.

170
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,870
Let go of me!

171
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,870
I don't want to hear anything.

172
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,650
It's over.

173
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,250
I told him that you don't belong to him.

174
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,330
But you belong to me.

175
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,250
Don't ever see him again.

176
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,940
You promise?

177
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,450
I promise,

178
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,710
I won't see him again.

179
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,470
Look into my eyes and say it again.

180
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,050
I promise, I only have you.

181
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,840
Trust me, Type.

182
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,920
Okay?

183
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,690
Remember what you said.

184
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,090
Where are you going?

185
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,770
Anywhere. As long as I don't have to see you.

186
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,610
Screw it!

187
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,560
[Bar]

188
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,150
Type.

189
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,910
Don't drink too much.

190
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,710
You've been drunk since evening.

191
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,530
You don't have to stop me.

192
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,660
The reason I'm like this

193
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,960
is because of your damn friend.

194
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Don't be like this.

195
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,990
Just trust Tharn since he says it's nothing, okay?

196
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,790
You want me to trust someone who lied to me?

197
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,490
He probably doesn't want you to feel uncomfortable.

198
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,570
You know him.

199
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,030
He might be thinking from your perspective.

200
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,030
If you knew it, weren't you going to overthink?

201
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,140
Besides, he just went to see Tar.

202
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,290
He didn't make out with him.

203
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,460
No said the same thing as you did.

204
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,210
Why am I so unfortunate that no one is on my side?

205
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,630
That's not what I meant.

206
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,060
What should I do?

207
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,600
If what you said is true,

208
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,130
then it was actually Tar who was in the wrong.

209
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,840
Now only you know it was his fault?

210
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,640
Gosh.

211
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,700
You should understand

212
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,200
that you're totally different from him.

213
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,860
People who don't know you would think that it's your fault for sure.

214
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,340
Who would do that?

215
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,980
Who would beat up an 11th grade kid like this?

216
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,750
Luckily, there was no teacher who saw it,

217
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,240
and no one took a video either.

218
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,020
Otherwise, you're doomed.

219
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,890
Calm down.

220
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,970
The more you act as he planned,

221
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,900
the more you lose.

222
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,900
That's who I am.

223
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,340
I'm a bad person.

224
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,180
At first, he said he could accept all of me.

225
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,870
But in the end, he told me to control my temper.

226
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,450
As Tharn's closest friend,

227
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,360
I know he can accept you as who you are.

228
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,700
Otherwise, he won't give in to you all the time.

229
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,000
But you have to stay calm.

230
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,670
Tar is very cunning.

231
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,150
And I just found it out too.

232
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,080
He looks innocent,

233
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,190
but he's vicious on the inside.

234
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,280
He even said he's going to take his Tharn back.

235
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,910
Have I been deceived?

236
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,090
Tum said his brother was very obedient.

237
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,450
Both you and Tharn were deceived.

238
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,410
But no matter how bad Tar is

239
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,300
or how he cries at Tharn,

240
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,500
as long as my friend ignores him,

241
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,500
things won't go his way.

242
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,640
If Tharn responds to him, I'll break up with him for sure.

243
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,660
Don't worry, he won't do that to you.

244
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,740
He loves you so much.

245
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,590
I hope so.

246
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,690
Take your man back.

247
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,160
Why is he with you?

248
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,860
Because you had a fight.

249
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,690
That's why I tried to advise him.

250
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,510
Type.

251
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,740
Why is he so drunk?

252
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,990
-Type.
-I told you, you two had a fight.

253
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,380
Can't you two talk it out?

254
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,849
Okay, thank you for sending him home.

255
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,119
Type.

256
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,380
You're welcome.

257
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,530
This handsome Lhong is glad to be at your service.

258
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,380
Talk nicely, okay?

259
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,640
I'm leaving.

260
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,910
Lhong.

261
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,640
Well...

262
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,900
Did he say anything to you?

263
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,510
What are you doing?

264
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,060
My boyfriend.

265
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,120
You belong to me, Tharn.

266
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,790
Take care of him first.

267
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,480
He's so cute when he's drunk.

268
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,980
I belong to you, Type.

269
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,590
Thank you for sending him back.

270
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,320
Let's go in.

271
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,980
You're welcome. I'm leaving.

272
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,460
I

273
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,870
belonged to you long ago, Type.

274
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,600
Don't move. I'll make you feel better.

275
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,870
You're so mean. No matter when it is,

276
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,980
you can always make me go crazy for you.

277
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,060
When I saw Lhong holding you,

278
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,940
I was jealous.

279
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:14,540
You rarely drink. Why would you go with another man?

280
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,530
Even though Lhong is my friend,

281
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,760
I would still be possessive of you.

282
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,390
As for Tar,

283
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,710
you don't have to worry.

284
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,810
Because that child

285
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,020
means nothing to me now.

286
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,020
You're the only one I have, Type.

287
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,190
What are you talking about? You woke me up.

288
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,150
I'm sorry.

289
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,640
Well,

290
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,960
how do you feel?

291
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,810
Why are you apologizing?

293
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,150
Because I yelled at you.

294
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,130
Really?

295
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,560
Yes.

296
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,480
After talking to Lhong, I figured it out.

297
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,330
I have never listened to you.

298
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,040
I was always angry at you in the past.

299
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,060
I don't know why, but I feel wronged.

300
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,640
I feel terrible.

301
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,090
I don't know how to explain my feelings.

302
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,680
You don't have to apologize to me.

303
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,610
I should be the one to apologize.

304
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,020
I won't see Tar again.

305
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,260
Please forgive me.

306
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,200
Tharn.

307
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,040
Hug me.

308
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,670
You're drunk.

309
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,330
I'm not drunk.

310
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,110
I think it's true

311
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,000
that people who get drunk always say they're not drunk.

312
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,580
You jerk.

313
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,890
So...

314
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,550
You've forgiven me?

315
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,680
No, not until you give me a hug.

316
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,910
You really love to act cute, don't you?

317
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,760
Please forgive me.

318
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,370
Okay.

319
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,830
Your friend cleared your name.

320
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,930
You have a good friend

321
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,770
Lhong

322
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,310
is my best friend.

323
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,740
If this happens again, I won't let you off.

324
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,840
Okay.

325
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,330
I promise.

326
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,700
You promised me.

327
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,150
You promised.

328
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,740
Tharn, Tharn.

329
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,950
What's wrong, Lhong?

330
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,430
Why are you yelling?

331
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,030
Look at this.

332
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,380
What is this?

333
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,210
At first, I was wondering what this was, like you are.

334
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,650
-Last week.
-Yes?

335
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,820
I uploaded the video you practiced in the band,

336
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,690
and also the video you practiced at Brother Khong's shop.

337
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,820
Someone reached out to us after watching it.

338
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,550
But the message he sent is a little strange.

339
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,800
You don't know unless you try.

340
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,680
Yes.

341
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,290
Let's try and talk to him first.

342
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,280
I'll tell Tae and Song, then.

343
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,880
I think we shouldn't tell them for now.

344
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,380
We should talk to that person first.

345
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,020
I don't want them to have their hopes too high.

346
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,720
Come on. Let's share the joy

347
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,690
and split the disappointment together.

348
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,360
Here.

349
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,160
Well,

350
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,530
do you want me to handle it, or you?

351
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,920
I'll do it.

352
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,630
Send me the number.

353
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,360
Okay.

354
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,790
If I make an appointment with him, we'll go together.

355
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,140
Okay.

356
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:30,300
[I'll be home late tonight.]

357
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,250
[I'm going to practice. I'll be late too.]

358
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,060
[What do you want to eat? I'll buy it for you.]

359
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:50,670
[It's okay, I'll eat with No.]

360
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:58,100
["Dinner with No" is different from "eat with No".]

361
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,040
Hello?

362
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:06,640
Where are you?

363
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,570
My car has a flat tyre.

364
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,830
I'm going crazy. I'm running out of time.

365
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,390
I don't know how to change tyres, so I called a mechanic.

366
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,570
But I don't know when the mechanic will be here.

367
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,450
Should I go find you first?

368
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,890
No need.

369
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,040
It's almost time to meet the record label.

370
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,350
Talk to them and buy some time.

371
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,110
I'll be there soon.

372
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,110
Okay.

373
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,010
Come here asap.

374
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,060
Let go of me!

375
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,240
Brother Tum isn't here.

376
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,580
Let go of me!

377
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,850
I said let go!

378
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,830
Let go of me!

379
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,620
Brother Tum isn't here.

380
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:12,780
I said let go!

381
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,840
What are you doing?

382
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,010
Mind your own business.

383
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,030
Step back.

384
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,250
I bought this kid. He's mine.

385
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,720
Brother Tharn, I didn't sell myself.

386
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,700
What is it? Should I call the security?

387
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,290
What a waste of money.

388
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,490
Are you okay?

389
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,770
He's fine. It's just a misunderstanding.

390
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,740
Sorry.

391
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:46,880
It's okay.

392
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,660
Are you okay?

393
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,970
Brother, I didn't sell myself.

394
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,910
I really didn't.

395
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:57,740
Get up first.

396
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:35,480
[Come and see for yourself.]

397
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,930
You want to play it like this, huh?

398
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,200
Type.

399
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,260
Why are you here

400
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,650
at the hotel?

401
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,100
Did Tharn ask you to come?

402
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,430
Yes, he invited me too.

403
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,850
Let's go find him. Let's go.

404
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,690
Are you okay now?

405
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,790
Much better.

406
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,610
I'll call Tum.

407
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,150
Do you hate me that much?

408
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,750
What are you doing?

409
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,630
Tar, didn't you get beaten?

410
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,770
Why did you lie to me?

411
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,820
I was so worried about you, you know?

412
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:51,000
At least you would still worry about me.

413
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,410
Tar, stop!

414
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,010
Tar, let go of me!

415
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,290
No!

416
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,730
I won't!

417
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,050
I won't let you go again.

418
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,660
I said let go of me!

419
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,080
No!

420
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,230
I'm not letting go!

421
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,310
Tar, if you don't stop,

422
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,990
I'll never see you as my brother anymore.

423
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,410
No!

424
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,740
I won't let go!

425
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,440
Tar.

426
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,180
I have an appointment. Let go of me.

427
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,880
Your date is not going to show up.

428
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,240
What do you mean?

429
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,400
Did you lie to me?

430
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,660
Listen to me first.

431
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,670
I didn't want to lie to you.

432
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,220
But I have no choice.

433
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,980
You have a choice.

434
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,659
But you chose to lie to me.

435
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,380
-Let go of me!
-No.

436
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,540
No.

437
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:12,840
Brother Tharn.

438
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,699
Listen to me.

439
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,420
This is my only chance to be with you again.

440
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,199
I don't want to lie to you.

441
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,199
Just this once, please.

442
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,639
Tar.

443
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,790
You have no more chance, Tar.

444
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:30,830
Please let this be the last time. After that, I won't bother you anymore.

445
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:31,880
Tar!

446
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:34,199
Tar!

447
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:40,210
Don't do this! You're degrading yourself!

448
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,860
I have no choice.

449
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,380
I had no choice a long time ago.

450
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:56,010
I'm just a playboy now.

451
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,900
I can have sex with anyone.

452
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,160
I'm cheap.

453
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,760
But I love you.

454
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,750
I love you.

455
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,420
I really love you.

456
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,170
Tar, I'm seeing someone.

457
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,300
Then break up. You have to break up no matter what.

458
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,420
You have no choice.

459
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,240
Just like me.

460
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,300
Come out, you jerk!

461
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,030
It's not what you think, Type.

462
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,790
I don't want to believe it.

463
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,670
You misunderstood.

464
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,280
There's nothing between us.

465
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,770
You win. Are you satisfied?

466
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,150
I'm an idiot

467
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,400
to think that Tharn would never cheat on me.

468
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,600
I was stupid.

469
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,090
I thought a man's nature could be changed.

470
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,530
I should have known

471
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:20,890
that

472
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,600
you'll end up having sex with him.

473
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,130
Let's break up, Tharn.

474
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,630
No, Type.

475
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,040
I won't break up with you.

476
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,990
Please don't say that. I won't break up with you.

477
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,550
I can't stand it anymore, Tharn.

478
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,400
How do you think I feel

479
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,040
to be jealous of my husband all the time?

480
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,790
I'm also tired of this game with your ex.

481
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,880
I've had enough!

482
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,250
Calm down, both of you.

483
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,210
Type!

484
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,900
Anyone could tell that this was the brat's plan.

485
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,110
Don't just blame it on Tharn.

486
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:21,930
What do you mean?

487
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,500
What plan?

488
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,960
Don't be fooled so easily.

489
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,380
Type.

490
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,360
He's in a fit of anger.

491
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,610
Let him calm down first.

492
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,860
Calm down.

493
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,820
How do you want me to calm down?

494
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,090
He said he wanted to break up with me.

495
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,500
Tell me everything you know.

496
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,430
I only know

497
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,100
that after I got here,

498
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,640
Type was about to take the elevator coming up for you.

499
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:20,180
He said Tar sent him a message

500
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,920
saying that you still loved him.

501
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,370
If he doesn't believe it, come here to check.

502
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,890
He will prove it.

503
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,110
Tar.

504
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,220
Don't let me see you again.

505
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,390
Tharn.

506
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,150
Brother Tharn.

507
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,570
What are you doing?

508
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,940
I'm moving out of this room.

509
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,370
We've broken up.

510
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,160
Do you want me to be the third wheel

511
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,670
when you bring someone home?

512
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,170
I won't break up with you no matter what.

513
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,890
But I want to.

514
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,660
Type.

515
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,530
I have nothing to do with Tar.

516
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,450
Trust me.

517
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,750
Do you think I'm stupid?

518
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,400
Didn't you know

519
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,100
that it was Tar who asked you out?

520
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,930
Why do you still believe him?

521
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,360
I knew

522
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,190
he set this up.

523
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,580
Then why?

524
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,380
I don't want to hold it in anymore, Tharn.

525
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,690
This time, it was a set-up.

526
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,870
But who knows which of your exes will come

527
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,630
crying to get your sympathy again next time?

528
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,700
It was San before.

529
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,600
Now, your ex is pestering me.

530
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,330
Then who's next?

531
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,660
Do you want me to die of madness?

532
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,420
I didn't do anything, Type.

533
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,060
That's why I'm telling you

534
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,470
that I can't stand it anymore, Tharn.

535
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,990
I don't want to be a clown anymore.

536
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,350
Look at me.

537
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,130
I'm a man.

538
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,950
Is this what you wish me to be like?

539
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,650
I follow you around, get jealous all the time,

540
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,420
and tell everyone that you belong to me.

541
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,510
I'm tired.

542
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,930
Now, I hate myself more and more.

543
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,690
If we're going to break up,

544
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,050
wouldn't it be better if we broke up now?

545
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,970
Let's not get any deeper.

546
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,870
Don't make me lose myself anymore.

547
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,810
Let me go.

548
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,280
Type.

549
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,330
I love you.

550
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,280
Please give me another chance.

551
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,050
Give me another chance.

552
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,220
I promise

553
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,640
that I won't break your heart again.

554
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,770
I won't let you cry again.

555
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,090
Don't leave me.

556
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,880
Don't break up with me.

557
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,750
Don't break up with me.

558
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,180
Don't do this.

559
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,320
Don't make me give up everything.

560
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,290
Type.

561
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,770
I'll eat spicy food.

562
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,610
I'll eat raw food.

563
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,780
I won't be picky anymore.

564
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,200
I'll wake up early and wake you up.

565
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,580
I'll learn to cook.

566
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,510
I'll cook for you.

567
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,760
Can you not leave me behind?

568
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,040
Can you not break up with me?

569
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,130
Everything I've done,

570
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,670
I did it for you, Tharn.

571
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,710
♫I've now made the decision♫

572
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:41,520
♫Now I'll make you♫

573
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:49,090
♫My last lover♫

574
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:55,130
♫The person who stays with me all the time♫

575
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:59,570
♫I will not make you sad♫

576
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:06,700
♫Can you hear my words, baby?♫

577
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,740
♫If the world collapses, please remember♫

578
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,780
♫My love for you will never change, you can rest assured♫

579
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,620
♫We will walk side by side♫

580
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:30,670
♫As long as you always love me♫

581
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:38,320
♫Please don't let go of my hand♫

582
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,090
Type.

583
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,460
What happened?

584
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,250
Why did you come out with your bag?

585
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,900
I broke up with him.

586
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,670
How can I stay here any longer?

587
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,710
Hey, calm down.

588
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,360
You're in a fit of anger right now.

589
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:10,000
If you give it a thought,

590
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,000
you might forgive him.

591
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:14,870
No.

592
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,110
Sooner or later,

593
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,250
I'm going to break up with him.

594
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,790
So, maybe it is better

595
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,690
to break up with him now.

596
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,950
In case I don't want to let go of his hand later.

597
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,690
What happened to Tharn?

598
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,490
I don't know.

599
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:47,090
Please take care of him.

600
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,710
Are you sure?

601
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,970
Yes, I'm sure.

602
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,870
If you've made up your mind,

603
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,930
I'll take care of him.

604
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,700
You idiots!

605
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,760
[I did as you said.]

606
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,780
[Give those videos back to me.]

607
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:06,210
Okay.

608
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,580
I'll send you the original file.

609
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:12,020
Thank you for your hard work.

610
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,970
[Brother Tharn will never be interested in you.]

611
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,530
What are you talking about?

612
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,900
[I know who you are.]

613
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,630
[You've been silent for a year.]

614
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,920
[But I know it was you.]

615
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:26,810
[Lhong.]

616
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,280
[No matter how hard you try,]

617
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,950
[Brother Tharn won't like you.]

618
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,760
Do you think you have a chance, then?

619
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:37,240
Will he fall for someone

620
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,860
who causes him to break up with the person he loves the most?

621
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,650
Not to mention

622
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,140
that 'someone'

623
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,100
was having sex with 3 men at the same time.

624
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:55,740
[You sent them to rape me.]

625
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,420
[Go to hell, you jerk!]

626
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,300
I won't die so easily,

627
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,770
unlike you.

628
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,490
Even if you cry to death,

629
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,620
Tharn won't come back to you.

630
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,720
Keep that in mind.

631
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,400
Brother Tum.

632
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,260
Brother Tharn.

633
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,170
I'm sorry.

634
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,280
Tar!

635
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,130
Tar, what happened?

636
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,530
Tar!

637
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,310
Are you okay?

638
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,970
What happened, Tar?

639
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,080
What's going on inside?

640
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,040
Tar.

641
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,230
Open the door!

642
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,290
Tar.

643
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,670
Tell me if you need anything.

644
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,050
Why don't you tell me anything?

645
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,700
Can't I help you?

646
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,240
I'm sorry.

647
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,380
I'm the one who never left him behind.

648
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,000
I'm the one who never betrayed him.

649
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:56,600
