1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,960
Conspiracy

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,800
is when you and I are involved from the very beginning.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,520
The person you trust the most

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,400
and the one you think is least likely

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,920
will both end up being the ones who deceive you.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,400
Perfect World

7
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:34,080
is the oasis for humanity's future.

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,760
Tormented by pain.

9
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:39,120
What is this?

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,280
It's such a mess.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,280
What is it?

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,160
Lao Xiao

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,840
Where's the thing I left here last time?

14
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:48,240
W-what thing?

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,360
You didn't lose it, did you?

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,640
Hurry and look for it.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,160
Here, here, here it is.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,880
Give it to me.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,440
What's wrong?

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Perfect World

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,840
The oasis for humanity's future.

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,400
It's also the hope for those who have suffered.

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
See, I've already been influenced and matured by you.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,040
Lao Xiao

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,920
I can't explain it to you right now.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,720
I'll tell you when I have time later.

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,160
Lao Song

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,320
You were right.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,440
Wu Tian disappeared a year ago.

30
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,280
I guess

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,400
he's probably not in good shape.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
What about Qian Boen?

33
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,920
Shang Wei

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,800
Chen Rui

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
Lao Song

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,320
Say something.

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,600
Qian Boen hasn't come back from Jinchuan Industries yet?

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
It's fine.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,680
Why does this look a bit like Shang Wei?

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm here to ask you for a favor.

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,440
List of personnel with military prosthetic installations.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,720
Back then, only your Imagawa Group

43
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,920
was making military prosthetics.

44
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,120
I want to know

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,240
what exactly was mixed in with these.

46
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,040
I... I don't quite understand.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,280
More than ten years ago,

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,760
to enhance combat capabilities,

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,920
I underwent partial organ modification.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,520
But now I've found out

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,080
that Huang Hai is secretly collecting

52
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,960
the things mixed into these prosthetics.

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,120
Are you suspecting

54
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,120
that Imagawa Group did something to the prosthetics?

55
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
I'm afraid

56
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,440
someone, more than ten years ago,

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,640
was already plotting something.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,760
I'm not sure what I can help you find.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,640
But the prosthetics produced by Imagawa Group,

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,920
as long as there's a batch,

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,400
we can definitely find the person in charge of the process.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,600
You can rest assured about that.

63
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,720
Even though it was more than ten years ago,

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,760
the relevant data and records are still there.

65
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,360
Come with me.

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,960
This document and the list I received

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,080
from the military prosthetic installation personnel

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,400
match the prosthetic models.

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,720
But there are still three suspicious points.

70
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,720
What suspicious points?

71
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,240
Qian Boen.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,240
How could he be on this list?

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,360
Am I being too suspicious?

74
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
How could it possibly be him?

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,040
Where is Qian Boen?

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,200
He disappeared early this morning.

77
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,560
I thought he went to see you.

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
He was an intern at Imagawa Industries.

79
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,480
He left the internship in less than a month.

80
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,240
His resignation date was May 12, 2049.

81
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,600
He should have been a student at the time.

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,440
Imagawa Group offers

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,200
some internship positions to students every year.

84
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
I remember the time of Chen Rui's death

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
was May 11, 2049.

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
It's the same as the production date of my prosthetic.

87
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,120
It was the same day.

88
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
So,

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
the day after Chen Rui died,

90
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,200
Qian Boen resigned.

91
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Is that a coincidence?

92
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,360
Qiu Hao.

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,120
Could this Qiu Hao

94
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,400
be the Mr. Qiu that Boss Bai mentioned?

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
What did you say?

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,360
Help me look into this Qiu Hao.

97
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,960
See if he is Lin Yongfu,

98
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,040
the technical director of Shell Replacement Lab.

99
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
Maybe he can reveal

100
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,800
the connection between Chen Rui and Qian Boen.

101
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,560
Okay.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Shang Wei.

103
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Besides these,

104
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,240
is there anything else suspicious?

105
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,240
There are discrepancies in the model of the military prosthetic.

106
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,440
This number isn't in the form I brought.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,560
For each of your numbers,

108
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,200
can you trace them to specific information?

109
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,640
Our records only go up to

110
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,080
before the equipment was shipped out.

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,080
CSHL-3 machine.

112
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,280
What is this?

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,080
It's a medical equipment serial number produced by Cold Spring Laboratory.

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,760
It's the one that Lin Yongfu

115
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,560
illegally modified into a shell-swapping machine.

116
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,000
When we previously investigated Boss Bai

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,280
and his call with White Boots,

118
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,480
we used information from this set of equipment

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,880
to track down the shell-swapping lab.

120
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,560
I didn't expect things to be this complicated.

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
It's more than that.

122
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
There are errors and omissions in the hospital records.

123
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,360
Errors and omissions?

124
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,760
Weren't these items already

125
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,480
sent to New Hope Hospital?

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,200
That day, Qian Boen

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
should have shipped out two batches of equipment.

128
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
One batch went to New Hope Civilian Hospital,

129
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
and the other batch went to

130
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
UN6570 Secret Military Hospital.

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
But in the end, the two batches got mixed up.

132
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
The ones meant for New Hope Hospital

133
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,000
were sent to the secret military hospital.

134
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,040
Otherwise, they wouldn't have gone to such lengths

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,280
to collect these items.

136
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,480
They're collecting this batch of equipment.

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,960
Hey, where are you going?

138
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,040
Wait for me, Song Xingye.

139
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,520
All of this is just my speculation right now.

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,600
I need to go to Lin Yongfu's shell-changing base.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,280
I want to check if this number is on the shell-changing device.

142
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,600
If it is,

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,560
then that day, Shang Wei

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,760
invited Qian Boen to the scene

145
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,800
was not a coincidence.

146
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Qian Boen was also capable

147
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,520
of stopping the machine.

148
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,200
The reason he didn't stop it

149
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,320
was because he was copying the program inside.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
Impossible.

151
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,680
My dad, he...

152
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,440
Qian Boen did it on purpose.

153
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,760
I want to go with you.

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,640
No need.

155
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
I need to confirm all of this first.

156
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,840
Help me look for him too.

157
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,200
How is it?

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Any clues?

159
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:27,960
I don't know.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
It's already at ninety-eight percent.

161
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,200
How is it?

162
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,360
Is there a way to stop it?

163
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,960
I'm constantly refreshing the backend code.

164
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,600
Hoping to find overlapping parts.

165
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
So I can reverse and shut down the system.

166
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,400
I've found it.
