1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,200
The madness and obsession of geniuses

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,120
are always hard for us to understand.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,000
They can scheme and deceive everyone

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,560
just to achieve their obsessive ideals.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,880
Those people are collecting those chip codes

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,320
for the purpose of consciousness uploading.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,360
This is the perfect world he described in his autobiography.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,400
No.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,960
I have to do it within two hours

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,000
to stop it.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,640
Who are you talking about?

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,800
What perfect world?

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,440
I can't explain everything from the beginning right now.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,640
Qingyun,

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,640
can you locate the signal source?

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
We've detected that Data Center No. 5,

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,080
which was abandoned, seems to have been restarted.

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,720
I've already sent someone to check it out.

19
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,320
But I haven't received any feedback yet.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,080
Okay.

21
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm heading over right now.

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,520
What's going on with this data?

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,640
Those people who collapsed

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,240
are having their consciousness uploaded.

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,200
We have to stop it.

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,720
This is bad.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,880
These machines have been locked down.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,080
We can't stop them.

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
You're here.

30
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,320
Qian Boen,

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,400
stop the machines now!

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,480
You sound like you're threatening me.

33
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,280
Qian Boen

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,480
You said collecting the code

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,480
was to destroy the shell-changing machine

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,600
and stop the shell-changing process.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
What are you doing now?

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,760
Qian

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,000
Bo

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,880
En

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,320
Do you not know my true identity

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,520
or have you not told her who I really am?

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,160
What true identity?

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,880
If you don't know,

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,320
it's better that you never find out.

46
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,320
Compared to what you're doing now,

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,480
do you not have the courage to tell her who you really are?

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,160
Song Xingye

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
What are you two talking about?

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,600
He is Chen Rui.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,200
He's an ambitious man who faked his death to deceive the world.

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,560
Impossible.

53
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
How could he be my brother?

54
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
He lied to you.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,840
No.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,440
Impossible.

57
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,080
My brother wouldn't lie to me.

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,960
He's not my brother.

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,120
He's not.

60
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
Now that things have come to this,

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,440
I don't need to hide anymore.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,880
But I hope you can understand that I had no choice.

63
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,080
I had no other choice.

64
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,240
That's the most shameless thing I've ever heard.

65
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,200
It seems only Huang Hai truly understands me.

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,320
Don't mention Huang Hai.

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,200
If it weren't for you,

68
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,920
he wouldn't have died.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,480
You don't understand Huang Hai at all.

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,440
He was a pure idealist.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,920
For all of us,

72
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,000
he sacrificed himself for our shared goal.

73
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,440
To him,

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,040
it was the highest honor.

75
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
Didn't you want to know the truth?

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,200
All the truth

77
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,160
is right here.

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,840
Lin Yongfu coveted the shell-changing technology.

79
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,720
While Zhao Qin Chuan was away,

80
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
he tried to force me to hand over the technology completely.

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,960
Helpless, I had no choice but to stage an escape.

82
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,960
Did you hear?

83
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,240
The chief jumped off the building.

84
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
The whole campus will be locked down tonight.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,080
No one is allowed to go out.

86
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Hey, Dr. Qian.

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,640
You have this book too?

88
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,160
Which book?

89
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Perfect World.

90
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
You've read this book?

91
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,680
Of course.

92
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
I know the contents of this book

93
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,720
like the back of my hand.

94
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,200
Chen Rui was truly remarkable.

95
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,440
If he could really create

96
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,600
what he described,

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
a perfect world without pain,

98
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
I wouldn't have to come to you for medicine every week.

99
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Do you believe Perfect World is

100
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,080
the future oasis for humanity?

101
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,360
The hope for those who suffer?

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,520
Of course.

103
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,240
It's just a pity

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,040
he's gone now.

105
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,480
You're Chen Rui's sister.

106
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,520
Who are you?

107
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
My name is Qian Boen.

108
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,960
I was your brother's colleague at Jinchuan Industries.

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,840
About your brother's death,

110
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,160
I think

111
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,480
I need to tell you the truth.

112
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
Why did you fake your death?

113
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,920
Why did you lie to me?

114
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,720
Because I had no choice.

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,320
What made you have to kill?

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,000
And what made you deceive everyone?

117
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,440
Was it all for your Perfect World?

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,800
Tell me.

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Before, you could think I was lying to you.

120
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,200
But not anymore.

121
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Suffering is not a treasure.

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,480
It only brings people deep pain.

123
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,520
And ultimately leads to despair.

124
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,880
I've always wanted to eliminate all suffering in the world.

125
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,160
So I

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,720
used the Super Eye HI Happiness Index as a reference

127
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,800
to create a perfect virtual world.

128
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,000
When people's pain level reaches a certain threshold,

129
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,880
their consciousness is uploaded into the system

130
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,680
and enters the virtual world.

131
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
From then on,

132
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,720
they are completely free from torment

133
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,000
and enjoy endless happiness.

134
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,520
Look,

135
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,799
No, you can't take your move back.

136
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,120
See how happy they are.

137
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
I won.

138
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,360
You must smile more, keep smiling.

139
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,680
You are the most unique person I've ever met.

140
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,680
Even though you are constantly suffering

141
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
from post-war trauma,

142
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,680
again and again,

143
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,080
you use your own willpower

144
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,640
to keep your pain index

145
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
at a certain level.

146
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,000
That's why I especially hope you

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
can help me

148
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,320
so we can perfect this world together.

149
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Let this world help even more people.

150
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,960
Impossible.

151
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,280
The progress of human technology

152
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
is always accompanied by misunderstanding and harm.

153
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
The suffering caused by the heliocentric theory

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
didn't stop technological progress either.

155
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,040
So why should you care about

156
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
a little moral flaw?

157
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,280
No matter what you do,

158
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,120
you have no right

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
to take away someone else's life.

160
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,360
Jenna

161
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,440
Jenna

162
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,640
Jenna

163
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,480
What's wrong with you?

164
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,960
Chen Rui

165
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,000
What did you do to Jenna?

166
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,880
The little monkey's life in the virtual world

167
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
had a huge impact on Jenna.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,240
It pushed her pain level to the limit.

169
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,920
Jenna, wake up!

170
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,160
Don't believe him.

171
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
It's all an illusion.

172
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,320
Jenna, Jenna!

173
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,160
Jenna

174
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,280
Jenna

175
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,400
If anything happens to Jenna today,

176
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,040
I will never forgive you.

177
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,240
Aren't you trying to save people?

178
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,000
Then I'll give you two choices.

179
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
Rescue the people inside the machine,

180
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,920
but Jenna will be uploaded into the system.

181
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,160
From then on, she'll be alone,

182
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,920
living in an empty virtual world.

183
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,360
But I can stop Jenna from being uploaded.

184
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:42,920
At the same time,

185
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,560
everyone inside the machine

186
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,560
will be trapped there forever.

187
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,280
What will you choose?

188
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,640
Chen Rui, you're despicable.

189
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,840
It's useless.

190
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,160
