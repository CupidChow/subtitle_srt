1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,120
I thought everything had finally settled.

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,120
But a sudden crisis

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,360
has thrown everything into turmoil again.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,560
Hey, Qingyun.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,400
Help me.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,200
Don't move.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,760
And don't speak.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,480
I need some information.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,280
First, look around at your surroundings.

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,640
It's best

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,440
if you can find a place with a window.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,720
See if you can spot any landmarks outside the window.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,840
Can you tell how many of them there are?

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,520
Send me your location.

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,599
I'll be there soon.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,800
Don't be afraid.

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,080
Where are they?

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,000
They've left.

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,600
Is it really necessary to be this nervous?

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,240
Didn't you say this place was very safe?

21
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,120
Stop talking nonsense.

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,080
Hurry up and pack your things.

23
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,040
Take Miss Zhao to find Jenna.

24
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,960
Hand her over to Jenna.

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,760
What about you?

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
I have to save my dad.

27
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,000
Right now, he's being—

28
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,760
controlled by Lin Yongfu.

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,600
I'm afraid it's just like the informant said.

30
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,240
Lin Yongfu wants to take over my father's body.

31
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,520
I'll help you deal with this.

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,320
But we can't stay here any longer.

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,480
Go with Lao Qian.

34
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,880
Take her and leave right away.

35
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,960
Listen to me.

36
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,120
Okay, okay, I'll do as you say.

37
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
Hurry up and go.

38
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,200
I promise I'll help you solve this.

39
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,080
Go quickly.

40
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,200
Let's go.

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,640
Hey, isn't this your place?

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,440
What's going on?

43
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,400
It's people from Imagawa.

44
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,200
Imagawa?

45
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,040
I have no choice but to use your place for now.

46
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
With our relationship,

47
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,880
you can use my place anytime.

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,400
Oh, right.

49
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,960
Please keep this safe for me.

50
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Old Song,

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
are you really planning to

52
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,560
take on Imagawa Industries by yourself?

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,520
Who said he's going alone?

54
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,200
If not you, then who?

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,160
My friend.

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,920
Jenna didn't suspect you?

57
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,800
Don't worry, my acting is solid.

58
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,960
But I don't know if Shang Wei suspects me.

59
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,840
Shang Wei?

60
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,800
Didn't I tell you to hand Miss Zhao over to Jenna?

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,200
Why did you...

62
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm confused too.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,960
Those two who were arguing,

64
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,720
how could they be having afternoon tea together?

65
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,520
Alright, forget about them.

66
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,040
Come on.

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
When I left,

68
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
I scattered some micro nano trackers.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,680
Now,

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,200
it's up to you.

71
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,760
If we had a T25 tracker,

72
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,280
it would be much easier.

73
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,280
Oh, I have one, I have one.

74
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,320
Let me look for it.

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,520
Here you go.

76
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,240
Done.

77
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,040
I've already put the tracking program

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,200
into your Super Eye.

79
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,840
This way, you'll know exactly

80
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,920
where they're going.

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,720
Thanks.

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,120
It's getting late.

83
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Go back and rest early.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,200
Be careful, Jenna might get suspicious.

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm not going with you.

86
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
This is between me and Imagawa.

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't want anyone else involved.

88
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,640
Go back.

89
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,320
Let's go.

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,480
Remember to help me take care of them.

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,360
Go ahead.

92
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,160
When are we heading out?

93
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,440
Take a break.

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,400
Why are you here?

95
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Do you want to face

96
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,000
Lin Yongfu and his whole group alone?

97
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,080
Why are you looking at me?

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,280
You know how temperamental those two are.

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,000
My acting can fool one person.

100
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,320
But if there are more, I can't do it.

101
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,880
Why are you trying to play the hero?

102
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,040
We've lost our home.

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,120
Our savings are gone too.

104
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
And we're still wandering the streets.

105
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,000
Can I ask everyone for a favor?

106
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
Can you help save my dad?

107
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,680
Before I escaped, I heard them say

108
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,200
Lin Yongfu wants to take over my dad's body.

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
If he succeeds,

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,480
who knows what he'll do with Imagawa Industries

111
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,680
and how much evil he'll create.

112
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
If you can save my dad,

113
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,760
I'll do anything.

114
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,440
I'll even build the shelter.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm begging you, Song Xingye.

116
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
But no matter what,

117
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,800
I just want you to be safe.

118
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,520
Jenna.

119
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,400
I know you're worried.

120
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,320
We can always earn more money.

121
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,720
But if we don't resolve the Huang Hai situation,

122
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,240
I won't be able to eat or sleep in peace.

123
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,080
Alright.

124
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
We'll do as you say.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,600
But safety comes first.

126
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll go too.

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,040
That works.

128
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
You're the only one who understands the shell-switching technology.

129
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,880
I'll protect you in the name of the Security Bureau.

130
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,320
I can't guarantee the shell-switching technology.

131
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,440
But I'll do my best.

132
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,600
Qingyun.

133
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,440
The location I sent you earlier—

134
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,760
Are you familiar with it?

135
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,840
It's the old site of Jingchuan Industries.

136
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,600
Lin Yongfu probably wants to avoid attention.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,640
That's why he put the shell-switching machine there.

138
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,360
There's no time to lose.

139
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,920
Let's go.
