1
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,160
Go in!

2
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,800
Wait.

3
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,800
What are we waiting for?

4
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Huang Hai.

5
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,840
Good morning, esteemed premium user.

6
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,160
Your health index is good.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,320
Happiness index: 58.3 HI.

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,640
Sleep quality: 47 points.

9
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,600
My name is Song Xingye.

10
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,560
Someone trapped in the past, unable to move on.

11
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,520
A retired special forces soldier.

12
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,880
Using my past investigative experience

13
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,720
to assist the Public Security Bureau as an investigator.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,600
Hey, why isn't Old Song answering my call again?

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,720
Did you have another nightmare?

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Just say it.

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
There's a job.

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,160
Not answering.

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,640
Just listen first.

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,640
The old street's grocery store.

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,080
There was a murder there last night.

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,520
The reward for clues is three times the usual.

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,640
We haven't solved the previous case yet.

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,920
Besides, what kind of case pays triple the reward?

25
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,520
I didn't ask for the details.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,040
I was just thinking,

27
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,240
how much more do we need for the rent?

28
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,640
If we solve this case smoothly,

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,600
and add our previous savings,

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,160
plus borrow a bit from you,

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,960
I think that should be enough.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
The little monkeys and the others

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
are still waiting for the new shelter to open.

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
They're moving to a new place, right?

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,840
But you should assess

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,080
the risk of the case first.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,880
If it's especially dangerous,

38
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,120
take it.

39
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,040
Old Song is awesome.

40
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,200
If there's any danger, I'll protect you.

41
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,320
For those homeless kids wandering the streets,

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
thank you.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,200
I'm hanging up now.

44
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,800
I'll come pick you up.

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,560
See you downstairs.

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Open the door, you rascal!

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,360
I know you're in there.

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,240
Open the door.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,120
Do you know what time it is?

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,920
Grandpa Zheng.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,080
You came so early.

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,800
The weather forecast says

53
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,400
it's going to rain soon.

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,000
It's all because of this rascal.

55
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,760
Every time I ask him to play chess,

56
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,280
he stands me up.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,560
Xiao Song,

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,720
Where are you going?

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Next time, next time.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Wishing you prosperity!

61
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,120
Xiao Song.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,520
Third Sister.

63
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,320
Where are you going?

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,440
Work has started.

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
You look so beautiful today.

66
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,440
Slow down, slow down.

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,720
Xiao Song, why are you running so fast? Where are you going?

68
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,800
Work has started, work has started.

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,160
Old Song.

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Get in the car.

71
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,560
Okay.

72
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,240
You appeared in the surveillance footage last night.

73
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,960
What were you doing?

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,120
I was at home at that time.

75
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
At home.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,720
Yes.

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,480
And then?

78
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,760
Then I got a bit hungry late at night.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,160
I went downstairs to buy something.

80
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,840
I don't smoke.

81
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
I didn't notice anything unusual.

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
I went back after buying things.

83
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,080
If you remember anything else,

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,240
any information related to the shop,

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,040
contact us.

86
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,760
Okay.

87
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,320
Let's go.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Captain Wu.

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,840
There's a lot of commotion about this case today.

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm busy, you go by yourself.

91
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Is Shang Wei here?

92
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
She'll be here soon.

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,120
Then I need to hurry.

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,160
See you later.

95
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
And here.

96
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,840
You need to compare this.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Here they come.

98
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
The suspect is pretty strong.

99
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah.

100
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
This wound was caused by some kind of blunt object.

101
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,960
But it's not a fatal injury.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,080
In several other places,

103
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,880
similar wounds were also found.

104
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
The regular shape suggests they were made by the same blunt object.

105
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,960
The wound is at the heart.

106
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,880
The wound is small but very deep.

107
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,880
It's very likely it pierced the heart.

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
It seems this is the fatal wound.

109
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,520
However,

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,360
the shape of this wound

111
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,080
makes me wonder what kind of weapon was used.

112
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,960
The fight was intense.

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,840
But the victim didn't die from the fight.

114
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,320
And the body was arranged in that way.

115
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,760
That makes it even stranger.

116
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,240
So this is the blunt object.

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,800
The weapon came from the crime scene.

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,560
Using the blunt object was probably a spur-of-the-moment decision.

119
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,120
But it wasn't the fatal blow.

120
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,360
That means it was just a way to control the victim.

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
The killer's real goal

122
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,320
was the stab to the heart.

123
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
Besides the killer,

124
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,840
someone else was at the scene.

125
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,360
But this was clearly a one-on-one fight.

126
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,400
What were the others doing?

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,280
The killer moved from the front hall to here.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,320
Attacked the shop owner with an iron.

129
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,600
Then used another method

130
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,520
to kill and leave the scene.

131
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,800
The shop owner had a mechanical heart.

132
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,760
How does that relate to the fatal stab to the heart?

133
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
Is there a connection?

134
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,000
Coolant stabilizer.

135
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,240
Any new developments with the clues?

136
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,000
Shang Wei, you're here.

137
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,960
Captain Wu.

138
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,120
The captain has a good temper.

139
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you all just wasting time here?

140
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
Waiting for the culprit to come back?

141
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,920
Do you expect the culprit to appear in your dreams?

142
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,040
Have you found any hair evidence at the scene?

143
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,280
Not yet.

144
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,840
Have you analyzed the traces?

145
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,080
Not yet either.

146
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,040
Then hurry up and get it done.

147
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,640
On it.

148
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,840
Let's go, let's go.

149
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,160
Don't be too hard on the guys.

150
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,120
We've been swamped with missing person cases lately.

151
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,200
It's been overwhelming.

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,960
Captain, you're just too nice.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,240
If you don't push them a bit,

154
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
we won't even get first place this quarter.

155
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,240
You're just too competitive.

156
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,640
If I'm not, some people will just laugh at us.

157
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,960
Are you making fun of Wei?

158
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
Why are you making fun of Wei?

159
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
Wei, don't stoop to their level.

160
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,320
Look at how much you're worrying now.

161
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,000
You've lost weight.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,280
I remember the last time I saw you, your face was...

163
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,520
Such a smooth talker.

164
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,240
Move aside.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
Who told you to come?

166
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
No, I took this case.

167
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
You can go back now.

168
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
This case has been withdrawn from joint investigation.

169
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Withdrawn?

170
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,520
Wei.

171
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,960
Wei.

172
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,520
This isn't our first time working together.

173
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,040
You know my abilities.

174
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,120
Right?

175
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,400
This case,

176
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
is full of suspicious points.

177
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,880
I think

178
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,160
it's definitely connected to the underground forces.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
Snakes, bugs, rats, and ants can get into any crack in the gutter.

180
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,480
That's why you need people like us, the earthworms.

181
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,440
Right?

182
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
To dig into places you can't reach.

183
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,320
There are always gaps the Security Bureau can't get into.

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,760
So, tell me what you know.

185
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
If you don't have any useful clues,

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,760
you know what happens.

187
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
Based on the footprint size at the scene,

188
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,800
I deduce

189
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,520
the culprit's height should be

190
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,560
between 180 and 185 centimeters.

191
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,360
Judging by the force of destruction at the scene,

192
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,760
I think the culprit is burly.

193
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,840
That's it.

194
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,360
Wei,

195
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,640
um,

196
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,960
this reward is really important to me.

197
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,160
Wei,

199
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,080
Is that the victim's?

200
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
Could he be one too?

201
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,400
One day you'll see

202
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,440
even a humble fixer like me is useful.

203
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,560
If you don't want me to turn you in,

204
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
you'd better leave now.
