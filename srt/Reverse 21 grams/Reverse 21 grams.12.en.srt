1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,400
Be it corporations

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,600
or any large

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,760
and influential organizations that shape human development

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,040
once they lose their conscience

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,680
to human survival

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,720
they will become a destructive force

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,840
This party is really exhausting.

8
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,920
There's not even a place to catch your breath.

9
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,800
Yeah.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,160
Thank you.

11
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,000
Old Song, we can't get through here.

12
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,120
Got it.

13
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,400
You know.

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,240
Otherwise, that guy just now

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,280
wouldn't have gotten through so easily.

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,000
Sir.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,920
Guests are not allowed beyond this point.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,560
Today's guests are only allowed

19
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,040
to stay within the birthday party area.

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm looking for your young lady.

21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
She seems to have gone upstairs.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,040
Sorry about that.

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,840
Sir,

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
if you are a guest,

25
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,960
you'll need to take the guest elevator by the banquet hall.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,920
This is a staff-only elevator.

27
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,360
Wait, that's not right.

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,120
Look at them.

29
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,760
Wushan

30
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,640
It's a swapped surgical gown.

31
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,840
You're not Huang Hai.

32
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
You swapped bodies.

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
You killed Huang Hai.

34
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
It was you.

35
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,640
You've ruined my business over and over again.

36
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,400
We

37
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,240
Yes

38
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,160
You

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,320
And him

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
Aren't you the ones who hijacked my goods?

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,880
I don't even know if you

42
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,720
are secretly

43
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,440
doing something shady behind the scenes.

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,240
Which one of you

45
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
is conducting body-swapping experiments here?

46
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,160
Nonsense.

47
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,000
Take him away.

48
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,360
Wait.

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,400
Why did you come here?

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,800
Go inside and you'll see.

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,000
You

52
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,080
Go take a look.

53
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,760
Let him go.

54
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,680
Are you okay?

55
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,800
Do you think I would believe

56
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,040
the nonsense you said at the press conference?

57
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,120
For the sake of our years of friendship,

58
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,640
after the meeting ends,

59
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,840
I hope you'll turn yourself in.

60
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,080
Instead of me handing over this evidence

61
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,040
to the authorities.

62
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
We will now proceed

63
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,960
with the vote to remove Afu from the board.

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,200
Those in favor,

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,720
raise your hand.

66
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
You've been with me for so many years.

67
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,680
You should know me.

68
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,400
Using force to threaten

69
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,280
With me,

70
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,040
you won't get anything.

71
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,800
Mr. Zhao is tough.

72
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,440
I know.

73
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,520
But after all these years,

74
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
you know me too.

75
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,520
What do you want?

76
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,320
Threats and bribes

77
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,440
are not my style.

78
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,360
Lin Yongfu, you—

79
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,320
Sit down.

80
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Who just raised their hand?

81
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,720
Who were you messaging?

82
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,200
According to an insider,

83
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Yesterday, Imagawa Group used their heir's birthday party

84
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,920
to launch the Super Eye V12.0 system.

85
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
During the event, a guest

86
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,040
accidentally entered Imagawa Industries' secret lab.

87
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,640
They exposed their sinister body-swapping experiment.

88
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
The suspect is on the run.

89
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,280
Imagawa Industries is currently under lockdown.

90
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,400
Further details await the Security Bureau's

91
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,120
investigation and announcement.

92
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
What's left to investigate?

93
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,640
They have no regard for human life.

94
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,160
They're profit-driven capitalists.

95
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,760
You're oversimplifying it.

96
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,880
This could very well be covered up.

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
Big companies like them

98
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,640
can't allow such secrets to get out.

99
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
So they're still trying to cover up the truth?

100
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,360
Weren't there a lot of people at the party that day

101
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
who saw it all?

102
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
If you risk your life to investigate,

103
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,640
you might end up with nothing in the end.

104
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Why are you here?

105
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,400
Do you know what you're doing?

106
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
If the news hadn't broken out,

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,520
no one would know you had this ability.

108
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,160
Can you speak properly?

109
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,640
You came in shouting.

110
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,840
It's an emergency.

111
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,080
Why are you explaining to her?

112
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,960
Hey, stop arguing.

113
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,880
Look at the news.

114
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,280
This is my personal negligence.

115
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,600
I misjudged people.

116
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
I let Wu Shan and the others exploit the loophole.

117
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,280
Inside the company,

118
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
they carried out such illegal activities.

119
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,480
As the general manager of Imagawa Industries,

120
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,400
I have the responsibility

121
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,120
to submit a responsibility report to the board.

122
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,920
Hey, Lao Song.

123
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Does this mean it's all settled?

124
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,960
I contributed to this.

125
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,160
If it weren't for me,

126
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,760
neither of you could have entered Imagawa Industries.

127
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,120
Lao Song.

128
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,680
Stop overthinking.

129
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
It's all over now.

130
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,520
You know in your heart

131
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,280
that this is far from over.

132
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,680
The case is already closed.

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,880
What else is there to investigate?

134
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,000
You people who ask others to investigate cases,

135
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,000
do you even know how dangerous it is?

136
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,120
Others risked their lives to uncover the truth,

137
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,400
while you just reap the benefits.

138
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,760
I can't be bothered to argue with you.

139
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,240
Who are you calling unreasonable?

140
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,440
Lao Song.

141
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,200
Hello, Qingyun.

142
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,080
Help me.
