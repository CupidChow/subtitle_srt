1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
Imagawa Industries single-handedly created the Ultra-Eye Era.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,680
It is this century's leading Internet of Everything technology.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,200
The largest unicorn company.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,800
It's hard to believe

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,480
that this series of criminal activities is connected to it.

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,520
Old Song

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,400
There are sixteen security guards in total.

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
They are all armed.

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,320
Be careful.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,160
I forgot to bring it.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,400
You can't enter without an invitation.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,280
Please make an exception.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,760
It seems something important will be announced today.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,400
Even the exits are so strictly guarded.

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,680
That seems to be Ding Yi, the head of Imagawa Biotech.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Have you seen enough?

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,920
That's enough.

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,280
The light.

19
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,320
The third one from the left.

20
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,800
A little more to the left, a little more.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,240
A little to the left.

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:00,920
Okay.

23
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,240
Next month.

24
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,320
How about next month?

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,720
Lin Yongfu

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,479
The head of Imagawa Industries.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,080
It seems something is going on.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,760
Everyone,

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,680
I am very happy today.

30
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,320
Thank you all very much

31
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,880
for being here.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
at my daughter's birthday party.

33
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,000
Old Song

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
Before Zhao Qinchuan finishes his speech

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
make sure to install the sonic detector

36
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,080
otherwise, there won't be another chance later

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,440
As everyone knows

38
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,400
our Jinchuan Group

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,640
has always been dedicated to

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,640
the development of Super Eye

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,320
The new generation

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,400
of Super Eye will have

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
a revolutionary upgrade

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Its neural coverage

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,280
will exceed 90% for the first time

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,480
Its capture of brainwaves

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,600
will be even more precise

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,240
Our Super Eye

49
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,480
is committed to serving the public

50
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,800
and has always aimed to

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,520
improve the quality of human life

52
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,800
as our unwavering goal

53
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,480
As for me, Zhao

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,560
as a father

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,680
I have also prepared a grand gift for my daughter

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,280
as her twentieth birthday present

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Please welcome

58
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,400
Qingyun

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,960
Old Song

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Hurry up

61
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,760
This gift

62
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,520
is from Imagawa Group's subsidiary, Imagawa Industries

63
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,920
the newly developed next-generation Super Eye

64
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,000
V12.0 system

65
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,240
Old Song

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,600
You need to hurry

67
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
It's almost over there

68
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Qingyun

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,880
With the launch of the new system

70
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,840
I've made a decision

71
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,880
You will become

72
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,560
the sole legal heir of Imagawa Group

73
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,400
and also serve as CEO of Imagawa Technology

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,400
specifically responsible for operating

75
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
the Super Eye system

76
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,680
Thank you, Dad

77
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
Everyone

78
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,680
That's all for today

79
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,640
Please enjoy your meal

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Song Xingye

81
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,400
Come here

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,880
Come here

83
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm coming

84
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,640
Follow me

85
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,080
Hey

86
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,200
Song Xingye

87
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,000
Dad

88
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,440
This is Song Xingye, whom I mentioned to you

89
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
Hello, Mr. Zhao

90
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,160
Welcome to my daughter's birthday party

91
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,640
There's a strong sonic feedback on basement level three

92
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,440
It seems some high-powered equipment is running

93
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,880
The target appears to be on basement level three

94
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,960
But it doesn't seem to be on Imagawa Industries' map

95
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,800
this space

96
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,000
It looks a bit like a spiral corridor

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,320
The public elevator can't go there yet.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
There's a hidden entrance to the banquet hall.

99
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,000
But it's usually hard to find.

100
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,640
I heard you started an agency.

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,400
What kind of work do you do?

102
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,040
Just helping neighbors with small matters.

103
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,320
No matter how small the matter,

104
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,840
as long as it's meaningful, it's fine.

105
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,840
Don't think about

106
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,480
those things before you retired anymore.

107
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,600
Old Song,

108
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,760
Imagawa Industries' security is unusually strict.

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,000
There are multiple security doors.

110
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
If you want to get in,

111
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
you need top-level clearance.

112
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,160
It seems only Zhao Qinchuan and Lin Yongfu have it.

113
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,880
Qingyun told me

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,320
about what happened with you in the old city.

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,720
Sorry for causing you trouble.

116
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
Please don't mention it.

117
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,720
I hope

118
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
you come visit often.

119
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,679
Mr. Zhao,

120
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,200
Mr. Jiang and his son from Dingli Energy have arrived.

121
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,240
They'd like to meet you and Miss.

122
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm not going.

123
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
You go by yourself.

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,760
Old Song.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Hurry up.

126
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,800
Get their iris information at close range.

127
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,680
Don't act childish.

128
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,000
Uncle Fu, quickly take my dad.

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,880
This...

130
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,600
Old Song.

131
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,920
Don't let them leave.

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,360
You need to get at least one of their permissions.

133
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
You can avoid seeing others.

134
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,120
But you must meet the Jiang father and son.

135
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,680
I don't want to meet them.

136
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Spoiled rich kid.

137
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,440
Not a good person.

138
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
You...

139
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,040
President Zhao.

140
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,000
You've raised Qingyun so well.

141
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,000
Maybe some of her judgments

142
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,440
aren't just baseless guesses.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,800
Don't worry.

144
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,080
The Jiang father and son

145
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,440
will help you control Jinchuan in the future.

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,800
It's just to say hello.

147
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,600
No one is forcing you

148
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,960
to do anything you don't want to do.

149
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,640
After all,

150
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,760
in this world,

151
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,800
no one can force

152
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,040
my daughter, Zhao Qinchuan.

153
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,800
It's settled.

154
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,960
Of course.

155
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,960
This is...

156
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,080
Hello, President Lin.

157
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm Song Xingye.

158
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,520
Hello.

159
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,280
Jinchuan welcomes you.

160
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,440
Done.

161
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,800
Please feel free.

162
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,960
If you need anything, ask the staff.

163
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,760
Qingyun and I will step out for a moment.

164
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,480
Wait for me.

165
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
I'll be right back.

166
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,120
Old Song.

167
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
How do you plan to get to basement level three?
