1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,840
Nowadays, humans can not only

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,640
modify their bodies however they want

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,800
to make themselves stronger,

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,280
but some people

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,440
prefer unmodified,

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,240
fresh, original human bodies.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,880
This has led to

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,880
criminal activity at Baifeng Dock.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
That imaging module you mentioned—

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,200
isn't a resolution of 500 enough?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,400
Does it really have to be over 3000?

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,320
Unless you want to walk around with a face like the King of Spades

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,480
and pretend to be Jin Peter.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
It's already bought.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,720
You can't avoid spending the money.

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,240
Alright, I've bought it.

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,160
I'm heading home now.

18
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,960
It's very dangerous over at Old Song's place right now.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,880
Little Monkey said

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,960
the group chasing us has been looking for you.

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,080
You have to be careful.

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,760
Ugh, so annoying.

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,360
You already told me before I left.

24
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,480
Alright, I got it.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,360
Don't be fooled by its low version.

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,000
It has all the features you need.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Boss.

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,880
All of these are old versions.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,600
Are you sure you have the latest version?

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,960
Imagawa Industries' Super Eye.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,360
Look over here.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,520
Come, take a look.

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Look at each other.

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,560
In the old city, sheep without fine feed aren't led during the day.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,600
Isn't that breaking the rules a bit?

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,280
Young man.

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,560
Keep your eyes sharp.

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,160
This is a stray sheep without an owner.

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
Everyone does their own thing.

40
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,240
Everyone minds their own business.

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,800
Excuse me.

42
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,080
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,200
I'm talking about you.

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,440
Are you stupid?

45
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,520
Can't you see this is dangerous?

46
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,240
Can you run?

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,600
Wait, when I count to one,

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,840
run to the back alley.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
Don't look back.

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay.

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
Three, two,

52
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,240
one.

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
Sorry.

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,000
I misunderstood you just now.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,720
It's okay.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,920
The exit to the old town is just ahead.

57
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
Don't come here again if you don't have to.

58
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,760
This isn't a place for someone like you,

59
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,680
a rich young lady.

60
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,960
I'm not here to have fun.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
I came here to...

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,120
Let's go.

63
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,760
Go inside.

64
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,920
Hold this for me.

65
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,720
Stay here and don't move.

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,480
Hey, no!

67
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,760
They're carrying weapons.

68
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll say this one last time.

69
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,760
Stay here and don't move.

70
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,680
It's you.

71
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,800
Where is Huang Hai?

72
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,520
Are you okay?

73
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,600
Are you alright?

74
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,840
I'm fine.

75
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,680
Who were those people?

76
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,240
Those people have nothing to do with you now.

77
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,320
Sorry about that.

78
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,400
I dragged you into this.

79
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,800
Hey.

80
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,440
Is this your first time here?

81
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,440
Why do you seem to know nothing?

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,040
I heard

83
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,040
they sell the new Imagawa Industries Super Eye here.

84
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
So I thought I'd come and check it out.

85
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Imagawa Industries hasn't even released it yet.

86
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,120
Can what they're selling here be real?

87
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
Are you stupid?

88
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,159
You should hurry home.

89
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,400
Will we meet again?

90
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,520
Oh.

91
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,560
Knowing me is trouble.

92
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,520
It's better if we don't meet again.

93
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,160
Hey.

94
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,480
At least let me know your name.

95
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,480
Thank you.

96
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll find you.

97
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,560
Hoshino.

98
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,600
Heading to work?

99
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,720
Good morning. Your physical indicators are generally normal.

100
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,600
But the Super Eye's emotion monitor shows

101
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,240
your happiness index is 50.5 HI.

102
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,280
Happiness index 50.5 HI.

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Are you getting tired of life?

104
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,440
As long as I'm alive, there's still hope.

105
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,120
You're really tough.

106
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,760
If an ordinary person had

107
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,280
a happiness index like yours,

108
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,480
they'd be depressed by now.

109
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,320
So?

110
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,640
Any flaws?

111
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,600
You'll know if you try.
