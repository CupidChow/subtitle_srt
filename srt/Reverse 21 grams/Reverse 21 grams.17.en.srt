1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,080
Bad people always disguise themselves as angels.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,640
They pretend to protect us.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,080
Blind trust and blind love

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,400
both end up hurting us.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,920
Qian Boen

6
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,440
If it weren't for me,

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,000
whether you even woke up would still be a question.

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,120
I was the one who fixed all your military super-eyes.

9
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,520
Where are you?

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,440
I'm at the cemetery.

11
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,160
Brother.

12
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,160
It's because I wasn't capable.

15
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
It's because I wasn't able to make

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,720
those people kneel before you

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,960
and clear your name.

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,640
They're all dead.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,320
But darn it, they deserved it.

20
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,200
They deserved it.

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Brother.

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,160
Can you come back?

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,040
Xiaowei.

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,440
I'm here.

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,160
As long as you—

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
Someone's coming.

27
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,000
Bye.

28
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,440
Chen Rui

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,200
your brother

30
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,920
You deliberately deceived everyone

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,760
just for him

32
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,960
Using your investigation into the shell-changing incident

33
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,800
was my mistake.

34
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,360
Just because you suspect they murdered your brother.

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,600
I know my brother.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,720
It's not a suspicion.

37
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,480
It's a certainty.

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,320
All of this is just to fight for

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,800
the justice my brother deserves.

40
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
But unfortunately,

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,520
I didn't get Lin Yongfu and the others

42
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,040
to confess their crimes in person.

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,120
Justice,

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,160
or ulterior motives?

45
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
I really didn't expect

46
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,320
someone like you, who has been through war,

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,600
would be unable to understand

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
the pain of losing the only family member in the world.

49
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,200
Or do you think, as an officer of the Security Bureau,

50
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,200
I shouldn't eliminate threats for the people?

51
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,360
That I can't avenge my brother?

52
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,080
I know you carry a lot on your shoulders.

53
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,640
But now, a lot of information suggests

54
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,640
that things are far from over.

55
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,400
In fact, something even bigger is about to happen.

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,680
Everything you're doing now

57
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
might actually be helping the wrong side.

58
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,280
What do you mean by that?

59
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,520
Wasn't the shell-changing machine already destroyed?

60
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
Did Qian Boen tell you that?

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,080
What's your relationship with Huang Hai?

62
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,680
The grocery store owner, Boss Bai.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,160
The things on Wu Tian,

64
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,720
who are you collecting them for?

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,920
Qian Boen.

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,080
Huang Hai killed to get the chip code.

67
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,480
And I narrowly escaped.

68
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,680
But my prosthetic eye chip

69
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
was quietly taken away.

70
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
The only person who ever touched my prosthetic eye

71
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,880
was Qian Boen.

72
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,320
This was found at the Qianboen Clinic.

73
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,560
He used to be a researcher under my brother.

74
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,400
We collected those chip codes

75
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,000
to completely destroy the shell-changing machine's program.

76
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,360
Otherwise, even if we destroy the machine,

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,960
the shell-changing system

78
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,920
will still exist on the network servers.

79
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,480
He told you

80
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
he was a researcher under your brother.

81
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
You don't need to doubt

82
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,080
a police officer's investigative abilities.

83
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,240
Have you ever thought

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
about the shell-changing technology

85
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,680
that still breathes

86
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,320
but has no reaction

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
at all to external stimuli?

88
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,960
Sir,

89
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
Sir,

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,080
Boss, come back quickly!

91
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,320
Little Monkey and the others are in trouble!

92
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,560
Did they suddenly collapse?

93
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
No response at all?

94
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,760
Their cyber-eyes are flashing red.

95
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,160
How do you know?

96
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,200
How much time is left?

97
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,440
Wake up.

98
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,120
Wake up.

99
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
Mom.

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,120
Mom, what's wrong?

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,160
Wake up.

102
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,880
Wake up.

103
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,680
Wake up.

104
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,000
Wake up.

105
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,160
Old Zheng.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,080
Mom.

107
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,640
Wake up, Mom.

108
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Help me.

109
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,960
Mom.

110
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,080
Little monkey.

111
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,400
Why did they all faint?

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,760
What's going on?

113
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,560
You don't know?

114
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,200
I don't know.

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
What exactly is happening?

116
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,320
Hello, Qingyun.

117
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,200
Someone has gained access to my permissions.

118
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,480
He connected back through the data center.

119
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,679
He completely hacked the Imagawa Group's Super Eye system.

120
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,880
And through the Super Eye,

121
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,680
he affected the brain's brainwaves.

122
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,160
I found in the Imagawa Group's files

123
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,280
that Chen Rui mentioned in a previous research project

124
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,760
that this is a complex consciousness transfer project.

125
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,440
The shell-switching machine

126
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,640
is actually version 1.0 of this technology.

127
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,440
And this

128
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,000
seems to be the consciousness extraction 2.0 he mentioned.

129
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,280
Then how can I save them?

130
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,400
There's no way.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,760
Their consciousness is being uploaded.

132
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,240
If we don't find a solution in time,

133
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
not only will these people not be saved,

134
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,240
but there will be even more victims.

135
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,280
And the first batch of uploaders,

136
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,360
if there's no way

137
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,840
to rescue them within two hours,

138
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,040
they will truly die.

139
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
Die.
