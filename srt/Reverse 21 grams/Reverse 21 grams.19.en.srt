1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,280
Why do we live?

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,120
Is life supposed to be painful

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,760
or joyful?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,400
How should I accept the gift of life?

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,920
Don't waste any more time.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
Hurry up and make a choice.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,080
It seems you've already made your choice.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,960
Jenna

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Jenna, wake up.

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,440
Jenna

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,920
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
Song Xingye

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,760
What should I do?

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,000
Why be sad?

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,960
That world is the most beautiful one.

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,080
You gave her the best.

17
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,200
Let the others go.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
You can't feel

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,120
their pain and illness.

20
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,240
So don't stop them

21
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,160
from choosing a better way to live.

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,520
Sometimes death doesn't mean

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
true death.

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,280
It can be a better beginning.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,200
I killed you.

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,000
Come on.

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
Kill me.

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
I've already done what I needed to do anyway.

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,840
Do you know

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,920
that every life deserves respect?

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,720
Even if pain torments me to death,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,280
even if I need sedatives to ease it,

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,840
I face the pain head-on.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,840
That's what it means to truly live.

35
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,480
What a pity.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,800
I thought we were on the same path.

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,400
But I didn't expect you to be so stubborn.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,240
But it doesn't matter.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,840
You can't stop me.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,240
Qingyun

41
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,040
He can't.

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,800
What about me?

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
I didn't expect you to react so quickly.

44
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,560
You don't really think

45
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,600
that our Imagawa Group is so incompetent, do you?

46
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,680
Qian Boen

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,760
Qiu Hao

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm giving you a chance now.

49
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,240
As long as you can stop all this from happening,

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,120
the things you did under Lin Yongfu before,

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,520
I won't hold them against you.

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,080
Make your choice.

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,520
It's too late.

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,680
We have to stop this program immediately.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,760
Go help Song Xingye, quickly.

56
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,360
Qiu Hao

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,680
Qiu Hao

58
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Qiu Hao

59
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,080
Don't move.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,800
I really should have caught up and finished him off back then.

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,920
Keep a close eye on him for me.

62
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,320
That's enough.

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,760
Just give up.

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Stop being so stubborn.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,040
This is already enough.

66
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,840
You think bringing in a bunch of nobodies

67
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,480
can destroy all of this?

68
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,480
You might be able to save everyone,

69
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
but you can't save her.

70
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,240
What do you mean?

71
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,400
Even if you can cancel the base upload command,

72
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,600
Jenna's command isn't for a collective upload,

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,280
but a point-to-point upload.

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
What a pity.

75
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
Only she

76
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,760
can see that world

77
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,560
and feel its beauty.

78
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
Bastard.

79
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,240
Is there any other way?

80
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,960
Try again.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
I can only stop the shell-switching experiment program.

82
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,560
But this is a new sequence.

83
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,400
I've never seen it before.

84
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,840
If we use a key, it will definitely be too late.

85
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,280
But the way this program is built

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,000
is very similar to my teacher's style.

87
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,240
Chen Rui.

88
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Your teacher?

89
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,680
Chen Rui.

90
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,760
Could it be a birthday or something?

91
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
I'll try it.

92
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,080
No, that's not it.

93
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,360
I've tried everything I could think of.

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,240
Sometimes death

95
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,080
doesn't mean true death.

96
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,760
It's a more beautiful beginning.

97
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,600
Let me try.

98
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,120
20490511.

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,720
Chen Rui's date of death.

100
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,800
It's open.

101
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,720
Don't move! What are you doing?

102
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,320
You're stopping the progress of human technology! Don't move!

103
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,080
Get out of the way.

104
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,240
One day,

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,440
someone will prove

106
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,760
that everything I've created is real.

107
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Greatness always needs time to be proven.

108
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,680
No.

109
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,240
Jenna

110
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
Jenna

111
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
Is perfection always a good thing?

112
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,760
I heard your office has reopened.

113
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Why are you here?

114
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,280
From now on,

115
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,600
I'll be counting on your support.

116
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,640
I caught you, didn't I?

117
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,760
Jenna, you're looking energetic.

118
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,480
Yeah.

119
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,680
Sister Shang Wei,

120
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,480
Don't secretly steal our Lao Song behind our backs.

121
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,760
If you want to steal, do it openly.

122
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Jenna's right.

123
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,160
Song Xingye,

124
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,280
Congratulations on your grand opening!

125
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,440
Thank you.

126
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,640
Are we eating or not?

127
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,400
Dinner's ready! Dinner's ready!

128
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Why aren't you eating yet?

129
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
I'm coming, I'm coming.

130
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,200
Come on, come on, I'm here.

131
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,000
Here comes the food!

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,160
Wow, so much delicious food!

133
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,040
I washed all of it.

134
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,520
Sit down, sit down.

135
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,520
This is...

136
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,560
It's really tasty.

137
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,160
Isn't this your favorite?

138
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,360
Sit down.

139
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,520
I'll hand out bowls and chopsticks for everyone.

140
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,960
This must be delicious.
