1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,560
How much does a person's soul weigh?

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,640
They say it's only twenty-one grams.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,760
And these twenty-one grams

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,160
have become a commodity with a clear price for some people.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,920
No.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,240
Your own dog.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,120
Handle it yourself.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,440
You have to deal with it.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,760
Is it really necessary?

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,720
The case about competing with Sanxin Group for the mine.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,680
I suppose it's to be discussed with Mr. Bai.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,600
It's not a big deal.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Old Jin is holding back today because I'm here.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,360
He doesn't want to play these games with you.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,920
Old Jin knows my temper.

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,160
Since Mr. Bai doesn't welcome me,

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,800
I'll leave now.

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,840
No, no, no.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,880
It's a misunderstanding.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,400
It's all a misunderstanding.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,840
It's all because of him.

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,200
He caused the unpleasantness.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
It's our first meeting.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,600
Just joking around.

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,080
You aren't angry, are you?

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,200
Are you really angry?

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,160
Why would I be angry?

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,160
Baby.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,640
Old Bai just likes to joke.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,040
Nice to meet you.

31
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
Take good care of your wife tonight.

32
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,440
All expenses are on me.

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,320
Oh, right.

34
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,080
Come see me after the auction.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,120
There's something to discuss.

36
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,080
Alright.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,880
Have fun.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,040
Sorry

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,120
I had no choice

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,120
Song Xingye

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,400
You kept saying you'd share clues with me

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,000
but you came to investigate alone

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
You're such a two-faced man

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
If it weren't for me,

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
this so-called two-faced man,

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
you might not have made it just now

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,200
Since we're already in,

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
we should focus on the mission

49
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,560
Stop meddling in other things

50
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,800
I saw you were in danger

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,760
How could I not help?

52
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,640
I don't need your help

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,800
Fine

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,080
Then let's see together

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,000
what he's really up to

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,920
Congratulations to our Mr. Number Four for winning the item

57
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,960
Wishing you a long life

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,640
Alright

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,760
Next up is item number three

60
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,960
a very outstanding young woman

61
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,080
Walls have ears

62
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,920
She has no physical defects

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,560
Most importantly,

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,120
she is still a virgin

65
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,840
It's her

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,840
You know her?

67
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,120
Please raise your paddle

68
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
so I can see it

69
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,760
I saw her at Baifeng Wharf

70
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,680
She's one of the people who were kidnapped

71
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,920
Number ten, three and a half million.

72
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,440
Alright, number seven, four million.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
It seems that behind Boss Bai

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,520
there really is a complete industry chain.

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Number seven, four million, first call.

76
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,560
Number seven, four million, second call.

77
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,400
Alright, number six, four and a half million.

78
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,720
Number seven, five million, even better.

79
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,240
That's so expensive.

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,400
In the cases you've investigated before,

81
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,320
human trafficking,

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,000
have you ever seen prices this high?

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,400
No.

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,200
It's like they're buying a life.

85
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,840
What about organ trafficking?

86
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,800
Imagawa Group's prosthetics are efficient and reliable.

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,600
Who still uses human organs?

88
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,080
Number seven, five million, first call.

89
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,840
Five million, second call.

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,040
Anyone else interested over there?

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,040
Number seven, five million, third call.

92
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,920
Sold.

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,760
Congratulations to our number seven lady for winning the item.

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,720
Wishing you eternal youth.

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
A quick announcement.

96
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Item number nine has been withdrawn from the auction due to unforeseen circumstances.

97
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,720
Next, we'll present even better items.

98
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,800
What the hell is going on?

99
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,000
Sorry, boss.

100
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
Let me explain.

101
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
Don't get angry.

102
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Calm down.

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,520
Sorry, I need to step out for a moment.

104
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
You're acting alone again.

105
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,560
Attorney Jin

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,440
The boss is inside having a meeting with an important client.

107
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,120
Please wait a moment.

108
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,040
Why should I wait?

109
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,360
I'm here to talk to him about this client.

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,280
Wasting time.

111
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,880
Lao Bai is looking for you.

112
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,840
You’re responsible.

113
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,200
Baby’s not angry anymore, okay?

114
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,640
I’m not angry anymore.

115
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,600
I can’t keep dealing with Bai Gui anymore.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,560
Otherwise,

117
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,160
I’ll definitely get exposed.

118
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,520
Go keep watch for me.

119
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,560
I’ll go eavesdrop.

120
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,920
We still don’t know the details about the person who intercepted us last time.

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
I’m still sending people to track them down.

122
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,000
I’ll report the situation to the boss.

123
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,720
Tell the client to hurry up.

124
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,520
Change all the recent covers.

125
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,720
Don’t let your guard down.

126
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,280
Look at the mess you’ve made of yourself.

127
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,400
And you’re so badly injured.

128
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,840
I’m telling you,

129
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,120
Don’t block my way of making money.

130
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,360
That Number 9 you transferred from me

131
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,960
was the strongest in this batch—you got a bargain.

132
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
Huang Hai

133
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,720
There’s something up with the boss.

134
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
The old lady who just bought item number one

135
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,040
should have already left.

136
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
We still don't know

137
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,480
what the real purpose

138
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
of this auction is.

139
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,640
So what exactly did you see just now?

140
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,040
I just saw a man

141
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
wearing silver shoes.

142
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,000
He should be one of Boss Bai's men.

143
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,480
And the two of them are probably

144
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,640
partners in this auction.

145
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,920
As for the rest,

146
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,760
I have a new idea.
