00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,434
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
HWANG DO-HEE

2
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,942
INTRANET NOTIFICATION

3
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,988
LETTER OF DISMISSAL, HWANG DO-HEE
CORPORATE STRATEGY TEAM

4
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,048
What's this? Am I being dismissed?

5
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,217
Well, I don't know
exactly how that happened.

6
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:54,929
And…

7
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,765
What is it?

8
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,187
You won't get your severance pay.

9
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,818
-We're firing you due to disciplinary--
-Stop parroting company policy and move.

10
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,696
Whether I resign or clear my name,
it's my decision.

11
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,666
On your way to see Ms. Son?

12
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,755
Or do you want to call
an HR committee meeting?

13
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,299
You…

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,718
You may leave.

15
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,651
You went too far.

16
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,904
Stiletto heels with glitter.

17
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,491
That's a world you're not ready to enter.

18
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,871
I'd like to think
that I went for something big.

19
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,499
I'll completely remove any traces of you

20
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,085
and rise higher than you.

21
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,256
Keep telling yourself that.

22
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,466
Is this about your severance pay?

23
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,719
Or

24
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,639
your pride?

25
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,602
Maybe you can't accept
being dismissed after ten years here?

26
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,235
Do you think you can
cover everything up by firing me?

27
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,778
Don't tell me

28
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,449
that you consider yourself
a beacon of justice.

29
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:43,121
You plan to reveal the truth
behind I-seul's death?

30
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:46,583
This pen

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,170
contains the audio recording
of the final meeting

32
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,629
you had with I-seul.

33
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,756
Once made public,

34
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,634
I-seul's mother will learn everything.

35
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,597
Her dead daughter's shameful past,

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,266
how you blackmailed her using it,

37
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,727
and how she lied
about being sexually assaulted.

38
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,854
-Guk Ji-yeon!
-That's not all.

39
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,482
The whole world will call I-seul
a gold-digger who deserved to die.

40
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,984
If you want to go that far--

41
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,124
"Attack your target's weakness
to rattle them,

42
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,918
and make them destroy themselves."

43
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,299
Look at me using the method
you've taught me.

44
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,064
That greed will turn you into a snake.

45
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:07,830
A monstrous beast
that bites off its own tail

46
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,375
to survive.

47
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,378
Return the company car
by the end of the day,

48
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,007
and vacate the company residence
by the end of this week.

49
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,933
FOR A BETTER FUTURE

50
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,607
What happened?

51
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,235
You didn't answer your phone,

52
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,821
so I had to call the next person
on the contact list.

53
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,823
It was an urgent matter.

54
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,494
What's going on?
Why is he being discharged?

55
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,471
Sir.

56
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,892
What are you talking about?

57
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,939
My father's kidney transplant
has been canceled?

58
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,361
The kidney donor has retracted his offer.

59
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,036
Are you sure that's what happened?

60
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,290
Yes, I am.

61
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,296
You have two days to take him home.

62
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,470
He's a gravely ill patient with dementia
and needs daily dialysis.

63
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,559
And you're giving us two days to leave?

64
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,353
We were notified that

65
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,357
he has lost his Eunsung Group VIP status
as of today.

66
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,653
We can no longer offer him
a room at our hospital.

67
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:45,298
This beef practically melts in my mouth,
but I'm not sure if I should eat it.

68
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,219
I'm afraid I might end up like Sa Jae-gon,
feasting on a meal Ms. Son prepared.

69
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,390
Mr. Kim.
How timid you've grown over the years.

70
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,809
Mr. Sung.

71
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,521
What are we going to do
about the upcoming by-election?

72
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,150
Who to send to the mound?

73
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,992
Leave that to me.

74
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,135
The player I chose has stepped down,

75
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,680
so it's my duty to fill that vacancy.

76
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,267
Ms. Son.

77
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:42,146
Do you have anyone specific in mind?

78
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,593
I don't think he's half bad.

79
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,470
Ms. Son.

80
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,641
The entire country knows what a great man

81
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,726
your-son-in-law is, but--

82
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,022
And with that,
we're already halfway to victory.

83
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,443
But…

84
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,654
He may lack political experience,

85
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,741
but I'm sure
you supreme members of the party

86
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,579
are more than capable of guiding
and leading him in his endeavors.

87
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:51,674
Haven't you guys been saying you need
libraries in your electoral districts?

88
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,554
With one for each neighborhood,

89
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:00,474
you'll have your next election in the bag.

90
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,812
Ms. Son.

91
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,026
Can we trust you this time?

92
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,654
If you change your mind
like you did with Sa Jae-gon--

93
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,822
Don't you worry.

94
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,535
I won't be pulling any tricks
with my own family member.

95
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,247
-Sure.
-Mr. Sung.

96
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,999
You can rest easy.

97
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:30,713
With Ms. Son's charisma
combined with Mr. Baek's fresh blood,

98
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,175
no one in this country can beat us.

99
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,092
Here!

100
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,261
Cheers!

101
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,805
Cheers!

102
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,605
Are you trying to kill my father too?

103
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,752
He's your father.

104
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:56,132
He should pay
for raising a beast like you.

105
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,049
Ms. Son.

106
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,720
The reason I tried
to spare your father's life was…

107
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,558
because I trusted you.

108
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,144
I never thought

109
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,065
you'd do something that would offend me.

110
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,908
Ending my father's life…

111
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,163
will make you feel better?

112
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,673
I'll feel somewhat refreshed.

113
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,345
I took in an ungrateful beast like you

114
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,559
and gave you the finest things in life
only to be betrayed.

115
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,521
Don't I deserve some consolation?

116
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,530
Are you trying to turn me
into an actual beast?

117
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,202
Even if you started crawling
on all fours right now,

118
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,162
I wouldn't care.

119
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,208
I shouldn't have…

120
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,047
let you stand on your own two feet
in the first place.

121
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,053
Contact me when your father passes away.

122
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,890
I'll send you a wreath.

123
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,103
Do you have any idea

124
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,397
how many people's blood
have stained my hands

125
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,442
getting your beast-like son-in-law
to walk on two feet?

126
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,446
In order to protect the beasts
that you harbor,

127
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,491
I had to stab, kill,
and bury so many innocent people.

128
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,122
So?

129
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,422
I'll destroy it.

130
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,970
That world of yours,

131
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:11,183
built on the blood and bones
of the people I've buried.

132
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,771
Everything you love…

133
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,819
I'll grind to dust

134
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,239
before your eyes.

135
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,206
Just like my father,
trapped in his sick body,

136
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,296
I'm going to make you feel…

137
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,467
the pain of being buried alive.

138
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,892
Bring your A-game.

139
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,953
HAN I-SEUL, DECEASED

140
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,702
Watch me.

141
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,290
I'll make that animal beg you

142
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,711
for forgiveness on his knees
like I am now.

143
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,239
Only then…

144
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,788
will I stand on my feet before you.

145
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,480
Residents of Sangah-dong!

146
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,733
You've all been through a lot.

147
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,737
Your sweat and tears

148
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:38,534
paved the way
for this glorious moment today.

149
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,914
A world where honest
and hardworking people

150
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,333
can reap the just rewards
of their efforts.

151
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,294
Right here where we stand,

152
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,256
that world begins.

153
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,884
My sincerest congratulations

154
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,512
on the redevelopment

155
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,348
of the Sangah District.

156
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:10,023
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

157
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:15,988
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

158
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,905
And

159
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,783
I promise you this.

160
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,870
I, Baek Jae-min,

161
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,205
will serve you,

162
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,749
the citizens of Seoul

163
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,086
who are living in fear

164
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,797
in these uncertain times,

165
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:37,050
just as I have cried
and laughed alongside you!

166
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:43,140
Mr. Baek, can we consider that
a formal announcement of your candidacy?

167
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,229
Yes.

168
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,858
I'm running for mayor of Seoul.

169
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,946
-What made you--
-Which party will you represent?

170
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,698
Does the Eunsung Group know?

171
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,741
Everyone!

172
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,163
I first need to take care of myself

173
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,708
to be able to offer
a helping hand to others.

174
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,837
When we have stability and prosperity,

175
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,592
we can work hard
and dream of raising a family.

176
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,222
Wouldn't you like to live
in a world where this is possible?

177
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,477
Seoul is the heart of Korea's economy,

178
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,438
but what use is a rich city
with poor citizens?

179
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,024
I, Baek Jae-min, will make Seoul

180
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:38,904
a city where its citizens prosper!

181
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:46,787
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

182
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,375
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

183
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,590
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

184
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,968
Look at that.

185
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,177
He's tearing up.

186
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,597
You can tell he used to be a news clown.

187
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,642
That's a master actor right there.

188
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,395
Mr. Ma.

189
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,981
Don't you think we should start preparing?

190
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,484
He already has great brand value,

191
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,404
and his campaign will be loaded
with his in-law's money.

192
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,323
We might end up losing
if we just sit by and watch.

193
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:28,036
Our candidate's served three terms.
Three terms in a row in the Gangdong area.

194
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,039
She's a pro. In the last 12 years,
she's been through it all.

195
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,127
She's on a different level
to an amateur like him

196
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,045
who puts on a show for sympathy votes.

197
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,384
You think all it takes
to win an election is money?

198
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,469
I'm sorry.

199
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,515
All right. Enough with the serious talk.

200
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,142
Let's plan our campaign.

201
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,980
So, as our policy director,

202
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,984
we want you to keep tabs
on Baek Jae-min's election camp.

203
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,904
Right. Your wife is
in the Eunsung Group's inner circle.

204
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,406
Mr. Kim.

205
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,242
Mr. Ma has been divorced
for some time now.

206
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,952
That's all in the past.

207
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,662
My goodness, you're right.

208
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,331
Mr. Ma, I'm sorry.

209
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,541
It's fine.

210
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,876
But still,

211
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,921
isn't your wife in charge of
Son Young-sim's political donations?

212
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,966
-If you could just get us some intel--
-She quit.

213
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,804
My ex-wife, Hwang Do-hee,
is no longer a part of the Eunsung Group.

214
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,142
ATTORNEY OH KYUNG-SOOK
LABOR LAW SPECIALIST

215
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,189
Ms. Oh, have some coffee.

216
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,941
Oh, I love your hair.

217
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,986
-See you around.
-Ms. Oh, hi!

218
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,404
-Hi.
-Ms. Oh!

219
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,537
Hello, Ms. Oh.

220
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,580
Oh, hi.

221
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,832
-Is everything okay?
-Sure.

222
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,751
-Take care.
-Bye.

223
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,315
What do you want?

224
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,734
It's been a while, Oh Kyung-sook.

225
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,152
I mean,

226
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,197
Attorney Oh Kyung-sook.

227
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,408
Yes, Toilet Hwang.

228
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,660
You're still alive.

229
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,540
I'm pretty hard to kill.

230
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,918
Don't mention the word "kill"
in front of me.

231
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:44,089
Not when I was almost killed
because you pushed me off that building.

232
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,550
Thanks to you, I've suffered a lot.

233
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,428
I see.

234
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,850
It seems we have quite a few
misunderstandings to resolve.

235
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,893
Misunderstandings, my butt.

236
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:58,728
Forget it!

237
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,107
I'm here just as Hwang Do-hee.

238
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,946
As a free woman who has
nothing to do with the Eunsung Group.

239
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,494
"A free woman"?

240
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,706
So you were fired.

241
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,043
Have you had breakfast?

242
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,089
I saw a soondae-guk place
at the entrance of the market.

243
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,049
Soondae-guk?

244
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,052
I'm good.

245
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:34,347
I don't have any business
with Eunsung for now.

246
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,765
Just leave.

247
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,561
If you're that hungry, here.

248
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,023
You can have that.

249
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,158
You're here.

250
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,290
Thank you, all.

251
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,917
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

252
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,461
We can do it!

253
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,339
REJUVENATE SEOUL
BAEK JAE-MIN, DREAM MAKER

254
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,007
Thank you for your hard work.

255
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:10,967
Hello, everyone.

256
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,429
Let's go.

257
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,014
I like the energy.

258
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:16,932
Thank you.

259
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,894
I need to step up here.
I'm counting on you guys.

260
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,188
Shall we start?

261
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,233
Let us begin the first campaign meeting.

262
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,403
We have exactly 85 days
until the by-election.

263
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,280
Our priority during the campaign

264
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,950
is to have Mr. Baek
rub elbows with the citizens.

265
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,788
We'll finalize the list of mentors
and have them accompany Mr. Baek.

266
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:44,376
I want the mentors to be people
who regular folks can relate to.

267
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,505
The kind of people
no one has ever seen in a campaign.

268
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,423
Someone like Oh Kyung-sook.

269
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,592
Yes. We're already in contact with her.

270
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,428
Hurry up.
Before some other candidate snatches her.

271
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:59,558
Above anyone else,
I absolutely need Ms. Oh to work with me.

272
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,018
We'll get it done as soon as possible.

273
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,145
My present…

274
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,690
Is it on its way?

275
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,590
Who the hell is it?

276
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,092
It's me, you idiot!

277
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,678
Hello, Ms. Oh.

278
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,639
Why would you spend the night here?

279
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,683
What did I tell you?

280
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:46,521
If you get in the habit of sleeping away
from home, it'll ruin your life. Idiot!

281
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,439
Goodness.

282
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,400
Keep living the life of a nomad,

283
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,987
and the life of a bum
will be all to be had.

284
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,199
Ms. Oh.

285
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,494
Don't call me a bum.

286
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,622
I slept here after working all night.

287
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,460
Here are the new cases
we received this week.

288
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,005
All of them?

289
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,215
There's more.

290
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,263
Your popularity is skyrocketing lately,

291
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:22,766
so you're getting high-profile cases.
Hold on.

292
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,353
This one here.

293
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,855
We're getting clients

294
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,024
all the way from Gangnam.

295
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,777
The client's husband
is a former prosecutor--

296
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,694
Yoon Dong-joo?

297
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,659
Don't get too ahead of yourself.

298
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,664
The workers at the department store
got their jobs back.

299
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,041
So we'll be quiet for a while.

300
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:48,958
You should

301
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,294
find something to do.

302
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,047
There's lots to do here.

303
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,382
-Ms. Oh!
-Ms. Oh!

304
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,509
Come on out! Quick!

305
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,219
-What?
-Everyone's waiting.

306
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,679
Come on out! Hurry!

307
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,682
FUN TIME WITH SANGAH MARKET
AND EUNSUNG

308
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,599
Look at this.

309
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,768
Ms. Oh, this way!

310
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,230
Oh my!

311
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,314
Hi, how are you?

312
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,982
-Kyung-sook!
-Hey!

313
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,901
Ms. Oh! Dong-joo!

314
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:15,819
Dong-joo!

315
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,613
-On-sil, the uniform suits you.
-Right?

316
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,075
But why would Mr. Baek do
something like this?

317
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,244
It's all thanks to Ms. Oh here.

318
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,497
She joined hands with Mr. Baek

319
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,874
and got on board.

320
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,711
I'm just an old granny in a market,

321
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,463
but I'll get rich soon
with Eunsung's redevelopment.

322
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,173
Auntie, come quick.

323
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,258
What is it?

324
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,468
Ms. Oh!

325
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,555
-Hey, Hwa-soo!
-Dong-joo, come here!

326
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,348
This is our bestseller. Come on.

327
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,851
-On-sil, bring this to them.
-Yes, ma'am.

328
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,024
EUNSUNG DEPARTMENT STORE

329
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,067
EUNSUNG GROUP

330
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,072
Thank you.

331
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,449
Ms. Oh, take this.

332
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,159
What's all this?

333
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,953
Mr. Baek Jae-min ordered yours separately.

334
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,580
Right.

335
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,006
I wanted to treat you to a meal
on a nice day like this.

336
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,300
I can't be there because of my schedule,

337
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:24,596
but I'll be having the same thing
for lunch, cheering you on from afar.

338
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,891
Give me a call anytime.
Regards, Baek Jae-min.

339
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:30,268
This looks like a signal
from Baek Jae-min.

340
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,396
What signal?

341
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,815
That he's wooing you

342
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,859
for his campaign?

343
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,243
Dong-joo.

344
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,328
-Yes.
-Hold this.

345
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,510
You're wrong.

346
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,515
It wasn't me who brought
those cheerleaders here.

347
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,776
You really were fired.

348
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,695
Look at you day drinking.

349
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:26,074
You look like a mutt
abandoned by its master.

350
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,578
Should I call you Mutt Hwang
instead of Toilet Hwang?

351
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,872
-Want one?
-I'm good.

352
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,793
Why did you do that, that day?

353
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,254
What?

354
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,799
On that day, on the rooftop
of Eunsung Department Store…

355
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,595
Why did you come up there at night
and pull that stunt?

356
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:52,475
I wanted to protect
what little conscience I had left.

357
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,396
Conscience?

358
00:30:58,815 --> 00:30:59,899
I mean it.

359
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,154
I wanted to wash off…

360
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,325
the blood I had on my hands.

361
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,960
What a load of crap. You make me sick.

362
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,838
Get to the point so I can leave.

363
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,133
Why did you come to see me today?

364
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,015
Oh Kyung-sook.

365
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,603
You could be mayor.

366
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,482
What?

367
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,402
The mayor of Seoul.

368
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,039
The Eunsung Group fired you,

369
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,627
so you got pissed off,
and now you want to use me?

370
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,672
You're furious because their son-in-law
is running for mayor,

371
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,841
and now you want your bloody revenge?

372
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:11,012
Wow. You really are
the nutcase of the century.

373
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,600
I heard this market's being redeveloped.

374
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,394
The good shepherd, Baek Jae-min,

375
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,606
seems to have sent his many sheep.

376
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,691
Yes, he sure did.

377
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:27,487
If it's a lamb chop you're after,
go ahead and join them.

378
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,908
The redevelopment is a scam.

379
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,744
The people here will lose everything.

380
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,037
Listen here.

381
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,832
By telling me
the redevelopment project is a scam,

382
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,878
did you think I'd go, "Aw, really?
I had no idea. Those bastards!"

383
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,922
Did you think I'd take your side? Huh?

384
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,342
Are you expecting me
to set myself on fire, screaming,

385
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,552
"Be gone, oppressors of the common folk"?

386
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,764
Go peddle your snake oil elsewhere!

387
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,186
Bank workers will come this afternoon.

388
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,690
With seemingly great loan offers
to tempt the merchants.

389
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,609
Sangah Market
will be the most searched term,

390
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,154
and articles about the market
and Baek Jae-min will flood the Internet.

391
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,866
The people here will be ecstatic.
And at that moment,

392
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,494
the press will come.

393
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,329
Sure, whatever.

394
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,748
Get a crystal ball,

395
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,501
and work as a fortune-teller.

396
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,174
Okay. Please come this way.
We'll explain it to you in detail.

397
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,095
SINWOO BANK
LOAN RECEPTION DESK

398
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,440
How many cameras are there?

399
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,692
One, two, three.

400
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,278
Bank workers will come this afternoon.

401
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,865
With seemingly great loan offers
to tempt the merchants.

402
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,076
It was my scenario.

403
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,915
The goal is to dazzle the people
so they'll agree to the redevelopment.

404
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:07,545
This soondae-guk is amazing.

405
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,172
Have a nice, spicy bowlful,

406
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,091
and come to your senses.

407
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,930
Open it when you're free.

408
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,516
I'll wait here in case you have questions.

409
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,487
Why? What is it?

410
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,656
What's that?

411
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,995
LAYOFF PLAN FOR EUNSUNG
DEPARTMENT STORE WORKERS

412
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,959
"Plan to remove Sa Jae-gon,
Mayor of Seoul, from office"?

413
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,961
DRAFTED BY HWANG DO-HEE

414
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:57,011
There are rumors about illegal slush funds
that Mayor Sa had been keeping.

415
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,306
He was given cash
totaling 600 million won…

416
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,892
Moon Yong-soon, the wife of Mayor Sa,

417
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:06,521
was spotted wearing 300 million won
worth of jewelry…

418
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,398
I hereby resign
from the position of mayor.

419
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,026
EXPECTED TO COST TWO BILLION WON

420
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,987
This is how they did it?

421
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,366
Ms. Oh.

422
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,493
Where did you get this?

423
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,620
This is ridiculous--

424
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,836
There were more cameras than I expected.

425
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,255
Is this the Rhino syndrome?

426
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,384
Who do you think you are? How dare you…

427
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,095
Ms. Oh, why is this woman here?

428
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,763
You seem pretty shocked.

429
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,350
What are you trying to do?

430
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:45,768
Show off?

431
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,771
"I'm the Great Toilet Hwang."

432
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,315
"This is how hard I worked
for Eunsung's owners."

433
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,317
Is that what this is?

434
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,070
No. I wanted to tell you.

435
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,491
How Eunsung's owners manipulate the world.

436
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:06,789
The merchants have already been taken in.

437
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,253
We'll give you detailed explanations.
Come.

438
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,964
They're hypnotized by Baek Jae-min's show.

439
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:21,929
Not knowing this redevelopment project
is just a trick to pad Eunsung's pockets.

440
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,770
And you, Oh Kyung-sook…

441
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,985
were the cameo that completed their show.

442
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,695
What are you talking about?

443
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:41,115
He was able to enter this market
without any resistance

444
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:45,536
because you took his hand
and shouted hurrah with him.

445
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,998
The people will shed bloody tears,

446
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,001
and you're partially responsible.

447
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,560
GIVE ME A CALL ANYTIME
REGARDS, BAEK JAE-MIN

448
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,439
Shit.

449
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:15,942
Get out.

450
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,904
Don't spew your nonsense here.
Go to a news channel!

451
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,572
Did you leave your brain at home?

452
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,950
What?

453
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,160
Fine.

454
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,372
Let's say I use the media to expose them.

455
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,667
Then Eunsung would sue me.

456
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,545
For violating my terms of employment
and my NDA.

457
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:39,674
They'll throw in slander
and libel for spreading falsehoods,

458
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,385
and the lawsuit will last over five years.

459
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,887
The election is less than 100 days away.

460
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,098
While we throw mud at each other in court,

461
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,226
Baek Jae-min will become the mayor
and destroy this market.

462
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,062
It'll already be too late.

463
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,272
Enough.

464
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,276
So, what?

465
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,361
What do you want?

466
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,449
Let's bring it down.

467
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,369
The world of Son Young-sim.

468
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,122
Let's end her for good.

469
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:15,001
So she can never get back up again.

470
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,628
Why does it have to be me?

471
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,171
With you at that?

472
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,840
Why me?

473
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,303
To bring about the better world
Oh Kyung-sook dreams of.

474
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,850
Just leave, okay?

475
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,312
Pretend to have a conscience all you want,

476
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,773
but I'm not buying it even one bit.

477
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,359
Leave.

478
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,323
Dong-joo.

479
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:47,950
Let's go home.

480
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,789
Come on.

481
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,207
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,127
A person died.

483
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,847
I killed her.

484
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,687
I, Baek Jae-min,

485
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,440
have a lot to learn.

486
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,028
However, I dared
to jump into this heart first.

487
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,281
To make this city

488
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,743
a place where citizens
are well off and respected,

489
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,496
I started on this path.

490
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,581
But I'm not alone.

491
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,958
I have esteemed friends

492
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,628
who've joined this journey with me.

493
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,755
With them by my side,

494
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,840
I, Baek Jae-min,

495
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,720
vow to be victorious
with every step I take.

496
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,487
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

497
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,702
We've prepared snacks at the back.
The interview will take place later,

498
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,081
so enjoy yourselves. See you later.
Thank you for coming.

499
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,082
Thank you.

500
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,794
Mr. Kim, it's an honor.

501
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:24,338
-Mr. Baek, you have my support.
-Thank you.

502
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,591
Mr. Jang, I'm a big fan.

503
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,261
I've read all your books.

504
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:36,267
I drove her to death to hide…

505
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,480
the blood on Baek Jae-min's hands.

506
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,733
Thanks to that,

507
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,029
he managed to keep himself spotless…

508
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,034
rising up higher than ever.

509
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,424
I finally found my favorite mentor.

510
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,011
-Me?
-Yes.

511
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,600
Boy.

512
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,561
You feel awkward being here as well?

513
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,481
Strange is more like it.

514
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,610
The girl's family
must still be wailing at her grave.

515
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,446
But here, the trumpets sound…

516
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:37,286
Are they so loud because they're meant
to drown out the wails of her family?

517
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,667
What do you mean?

518
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,044
You know I-seul, right?

519
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,514
Ms. Han I-seul

520
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,392
made the choice to end her own life.

521
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,235
I never said anyone killed her.

522
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,238
Oh!

523
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,828
Did some bastard kill her?

524
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:26,877
I'm telling you this
because Ms. Han and I seem to have

525
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,712
a lot in common.

526
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:33,384
As you know, I've also fallen from the top
of Eunsung Department Store.

527
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,177
Practically pushed off there.

528
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:39,598
Ms. Han could have suffered
the same cruelty

529
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,643
I experienced, but you know,

530
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,813
if I'm wrong about this, I sincerely

531
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,315
apologize.

532
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,777
Come on.

533
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,364
We're family now. No need to apologize.

534
00:42:55,447 --> 00:43:00,619
I'll think of it
as concern from a well-fed cat.

535
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,955
What?

536
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,999
Whatever made you jump from the roof,

537
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:09,753
you survived, and helped
500 people get their jobs back.

538
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,798
Now that you're a hero
and your life has improved,

539
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:15,050
you can look back
on those who have passed.

540
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,345
It's better to be alive than dead.

541
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,015
I feel bad for I-seul.

542
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,934
Right.

543
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,897
They say that the true hell is here
on earth, not below us.

544
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,190
Do you want to

545
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,777
drive them back to hell, by chance?

546
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,415
Look over here please.

547
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,585
Ms. Oh, smile please. Now both of you.

548
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,211
Thank you.

549
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,345
We're so happy to see you two
on the same team like this.

550
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,182
Mr. Baek, as long as Ms. Oh
is here with you,

551
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,643
we the workers will always support you.

552
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,395
-Here's to Baek Jae-min!
-Let's go!

553
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,521
Go Baek Jae-min!

554
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,777
Thank you.

555
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,362
Thank you so much.

556
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,821
Ms. Oh Kyung-sook.

557
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:22,076
What is your reason behind joining
Mr. Baek's Campaign Mentors?

558
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,830
I don't have one.

559
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,291
I'm not doing it.

560
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,296
I'm withdrawing my decision

561
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,549
to join Baek's campaign.

562
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,097
For what reason?

563
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,557
Are you sure you're not being let go?

564
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,851
Why did you change your mind
all of a sudden?

565
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:53,899
I don't think he's a suitable candidate
for mayor of Seoul.

566
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,695
Then who do you think is suitable?

567
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:00,531
Anyone as long as it isn't him.

568
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,535
Are you thinking about running, Ms. Oh?

569
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,293
There's nothing I won't do to stop him.

570
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,629
Sure. Why not? Let's give it a go.

571
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,423
Ms. Oh!

572
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,637
Mr. Baek! Was this discussed before?

573
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,046
Stupid. I must've gone crazy.

574
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,799
What am I going to do now? God!

575
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,555
This damn mouth of mine. What do I do now?

576
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,684
Oh Kyung-sook.

577
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,689
I'm impressed.

578
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,234
TRENDING SEARCHES
OH KYUNG-SOOK

579
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,737
As a PR expert, I'd say

580
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,740
you were born with it.

581
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,241
OH KYUNG-SOOK NEVER DIES

582
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,953
OH KYUNG-SOOK ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY

583
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,541
I'm done for.

584
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,880
You're a natural
at grabbing the public's attention.

585
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,469
You have an instinct
for creating dramatic moments

586
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,931
by spewing things without a filter

587
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,769
and have this defiant look,
perfect for leading a coup.

588
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,648
From a show business standpoint,

589
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,150
you're a desirable talent.

590
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:04,154
"Show business"? What are you on about?

591
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:07,366
Do you have any idea
what a fool I made of myself there?

592
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,996
Oh Kyung-sook, get out here!

593
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,040
We know you're in there.

594
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,210
Come out! Quick!

595
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:19,878
Ms. Oh!

596
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:22,172
-Ms. Oh!
-Come on out now.

597
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,841
-Come on out!
-Seriously.

598
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,553
Ms. Oh hasn't come to work yet.

599
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,179
She might not come in today.

600
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,932
Where did she run off to, then?

601
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,768
Where did she go after upending

602
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,854
the entire marketplace?

603
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:41,692
-Sir, what do you mean by "upending"?
-Okay, why don't you tell us Dong-joo?

604
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,736
Baek Jae-min said
he'd redevelop our market.

605
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,906
So, why did she stab him in the back?

606
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,575
Come on, sir. That's not it.

607
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,618
She must've had her reasons.

608
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,662
What reasons?

609
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,253
Ms. Oh!

610
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,465
-This is crazy.
-What are you up to?

611
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,175
Go out and do something.

612
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,553
They seem quite upset.

613
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,139
Do what?

614
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,432
Sit them down,

615
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,642
and explain everything? One by one?

616
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,935
The whole truth?

617
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,813
Reveal everything about I-seul
and the real Baek Jae-min?

618
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,441
You can at least offer them
a sincere apology.

619
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,029
-Just to calm them down a little.
-Calm them down?

620
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,074
Riling them up I can do,
but there's no calming them down.

621
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,328
So many rich people
have sweet-talked them into things

622
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,830
that they won't bat an eye
even if I apologize.

623
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,957
Don't act like you know stuff
when you don't.

624
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,292
Get out here!

625
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,170
This is driving me crazy.

626
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,715
Whatever! What do they want me to do?

627
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,344
I don't care.

628
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,724
There was an unexpected turn of events

629
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:00,395
at Candidate Baek Jae-min's Campaign
Mentors Inauguration Ceremony yesterday.

630
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,772
Mr. Baek.

631
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,359
I'm incredibly disappointed.

632
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,403
The election hasn't even started,

633
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,615
and you let that woman stir things up.

634
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,702
I thought you would handle
Oh Kyung-sook easily.

635
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,665
Don't worry too much.

636
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,210
We'll publish our press release
through our outlets.

637
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,004
It'll all blow over
after I give them a few interviews.

638
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,464
My loyal supporters--

639
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,257
Elections are about momentum!

640
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:33,512
Temporary measures won't work.
You have to clip her wings.

641
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:38,392
Yes. I'll take your advice to heart.

642
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,230
Mr. Baek, don't let this get you down.

643
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:46,817
I bet our opponent is
much more anxious than we are.

644
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,487
"The People's Servant."

645
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:56,410
An unexpected incident took place
last night during Candidate Baek's

646
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,704
announcement of his Campaign Mentors.

647
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,290
With about 80 days remaining
until election day,

648
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,377
the Seoul mayoral election
has taken an interesting turn.

649
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,713
We have Assemblywoman Seo Min-jung

650
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,758
of the Reform Party of Korea with us
for a few words today. Ms. Seo.

651
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:15,303
I hope you are doing well.

652
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,515
I'm the People's Servant, Seo Min-jung.

653
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,144
I believe Ms. Oh's unexpected announcement

654
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,188
could also be considered
as her challenging you

655
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,607
since you're also a mayoral candidate

656
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,318
in the upcoming Seoul by-election.

657
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:32,654
Me?

658
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,948
You have served three terms already,

659
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,534
and you're the face
of the Reform Party of Korea.

660
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:42,289
Not only that, you've made your mark
as an irreplaceable female politician

661
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,958
who is much loved by everyone.

662
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,588
But I think she might take
your political position.

663
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,924
You're saying Ms. Oh could replace me?

664
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,092
Yes.

665
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:56,720
I don't know.

666
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:01,641
I think I'm the only servant
the Korean people need.

667
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,395
Dear viewers, what do you think?

668
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,942
-Great work.
-Thank you.

669
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,360
-Take care.
-Thank you.

670
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,197
-That was wonderful.
-Great job.

671
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,532
Joong-seok, let's go to Mt. Jirisan.

672
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:18,909
Pardon?

673
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:22,329
We'll be busy
with your campaign announcement speech--

674
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,540
Should we let Oh Kyung-sook steal
my supporters and replace me?

675
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,336
I need a loud announcement ceremony
to draw attention.

676
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,713
Do I have to provide all the plans?

677
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:33,799
I'm sorry.

678
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:38,303
If you're really sorry, get Oh Kyung-sook
and stuff her in a coffin for me.

679
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,842
I'm sorry I'm late.

680
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,057
Don't touch that.

681
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:35,402
I trusted you.

682
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:41,491
If I set the board, you said you'd push
king, queen, or bishop out of the way

683
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,743
and rise to the top.

684
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,873
You're ruining everything
because of some woman

685
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,709
who isn't even worth using as a pawn?

686
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:54,588
Did you drive Do-hee
out of the company for this?

687
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,591
I apologize.

688
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,969
Leave.

689
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,223
You've brought enough shame
to my husband's memorial.

690
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,618
If you have time to bow to him…

691
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,540
go to Do-hee and beg her
on your knees instead.

692
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,376
Ask her to save you.

693
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,250
-Stop Hwang Do-hee this instant.
-Stop her?

694
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,169
How exactly…

695
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,302
You said

696
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,973
you could do better than Hwang Do-hee.

697
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:32,477
Would she have asked me
something like that?

698
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:35,272
Guk Ji-yeon!

699
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,733
You said you wanted to rise
higher than her.

700
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,153
If we lose the election
and upset my mother-in-law,

701
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,321
that'll be the end.

702
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,365
You and I

703
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,119
will both be dumped in the gutter.

704
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,165
Get it together.

705
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:25,780
Jeez.

706
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,459
Whoa.

707
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,128
Stop trying to be so chummy.

708
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,549
And the market people?

709
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,593
Still mad.

710
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:49,179
Asking how you could do such a thing.

711
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,641
So, what are you going to do?

712
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,644
What do you mean?

713
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,899
You might as well run
now that this has happened.

714
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,446
If you don't after everything you've said,
you'll look so lame.

715
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:09,491
We could gather your supporters
and run a campaign--

716
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,825
Yoon Dong-joo.

717
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:12,952
Cut it out.

718
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,623
Yoon Dong-joo, was it?

719
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,460
You seem resourceful.

720
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:23,963
I could use you as a mid-level manager.

721
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,592
Use me? Who do you think you are?

722
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,806
Chairwoman of Oh Kyung-sook's
Mayoral Campaign Committee.

723
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,016
Seriously?

724
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,267
Too old-fashioned?

725
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,978
All right, then.

726
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,273
Campaign Manager.
That has a nice ring to it.

727
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,984
Call yourself whatever you want.

728
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:47,487
Let's do this.

729
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,990
It won't be easy to work under me.

730
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,953
Why am I working under you?

731
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,789
I'll lead Ms. Oh's campaign myself.

732
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,875
I will make Ms. Oh the mayor of Seoul
with these two hands.

733
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,461
Come here, you idiot.

734
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:05,922
Why are you only picking on me?

735
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,715
She started this nonsense.

736
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:09,926
So unfair.

737
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,095
Unbelievable.

738
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:13,888
Jeez.

739
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,350
Gosh, when will that punk grow up?

740
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,660
Did you check?

741
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,350
Anyway,

742
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,563
this is as far as I go, yeah. I…

743
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,025
will stop here.

744
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:10,528
Stop provoking me.

745
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,698
You saw for yourself
what kind of monster Baek Jae-min is.

746
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,950
-That's why you--
-Went off.

747
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,286
I looked so cool doing it.

748
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,788
"Baek Jae-min shouldn't become mayor."

749
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:22,040
"I won't stand by

750
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,542
if you make someone like him
the mayor of Seoul."

751
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,045
Then why stop now?

752
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,427
If you live your life
only doing what looks cool…

753
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,224
you end up an empty shell.

754
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,269
I've spent all my life fighting

755
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:47,732
an endless battle
to make the world a better place,

756
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:53,530
and I ended up becoming a bad wife
and an even worse mother.

757
00:58:54,697 --> 00:59:00,703
Abandoning my family and being a busybody.
Saying I'll make the world better.

758
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,375
I've done enough of that already, okay?

759
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,418
I almost…

760
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,090
died once. That's more than enough for me.

761
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:15,760
-But--
-Honestly…

762
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,598
I was pushed

763
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,561
from Eunsung Department Store's rooftop.

764
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,062
You know that, right?

765
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:30,733
That's how I got caught up in this mess
and got this far.

766
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,654
But people call me
the godmother of workers and a hero,

767
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:36,489
not knowing the truth.

768
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,244
That's too much pressure.

769
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,249
I feel guilty.

770
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,172
Let's end it here.

771
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:54,716
I'm off.

772
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,162
Quit smoking, you idiot!

773
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,874
Let's go.

774
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,460
Call me.

775
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:40,011
Let's go.

776
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:59,155
Hello, Joong-seok.

777
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,783
-Yoon Dong-joo.
-Yes, ma'am.

778
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:06,079
Let's stop chasing rainbows
and live quietly.

779
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,916
Let's take better care
of our families. Okay?

780
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,169
We'll start.

781
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,142
Hwang Do-hee!

782
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,939
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS

783
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,732
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS
