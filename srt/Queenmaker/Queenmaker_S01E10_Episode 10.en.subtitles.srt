1
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,678
FOR THE 39TH SEOUL CITY
MAYORAL BY-ELECTION D-5

2
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,347
Candidate Baek is alleged to have
an illegitimate child.

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:19,185
His partner in this affair
is reported to be his closest aide, G.

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:23,440
G, currently pregnant, was a member
of the Corporate Strategy Team at Eunsung.

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,235
Even more shockingly, she was once
the personal secretary of Baek's wife,

6
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,945
adding fire to the controversy.

7
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,948
Baek has been known
as a loving father and perfect husband,

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,452
receiving overwhelming support
from female voters.

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,080
People are now turning their backs
on Candidate Baek in disappointment.

10
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,582
Have you all lost it?

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,170
The election is right around the corner,
and you let this scandal surface?

12
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,299
Why haven't you kept the press in check?

13
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,717
We're flustered as well.

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,511
Until yesterday, they printed
what we told them to.

15
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,597
But they suddenly
turned on Candidate Baek.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,223
Who released this story first?

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,392
Kim Cho-rong from IBC's City News team.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,352
I think their director is protecting her.

19
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,772
It seems Oh Kyung-sook
made a deal with him--

20
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,023
God damn it!

21
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,319
Stop this story from spreading
at all costs.

22
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,114
Take legal action against everyone
from Kim Cho-rong to the director of IBC!

23
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:17,077
Deny the rumors
using all of Eunsung's news outlets.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,621
Oh Kyung-sook's son's case and the affair.

25
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,665
Cover both up by day's end, at all costs!

26
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,709
They'll never be able to do that.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,922
Because the press can't help
but side with whoever's winning.

28
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,090
I do love winning.

29
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,675
Ms. Hwang, what should we do next?

30
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,012
From now on, let's shape this election
as a showdown…

31
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,558
between the heartbroken mother,
Oh Kyung-sook,

32
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,395
and the despicable cheater, Baek Jae-min?

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,776
The war of narratives begins.

34
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,651
Oh Kyung-sook!

35
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,153
-Hello.
-Oh Kyung-sook!

36
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,988
SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE OH KYUNG-SOOK

37
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,198
The Good Parents Association

38
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,659
wholeheartedly supports Candidate Oh…

39
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,412
I, Yook Seung-cheol, ask
that you all support Oh Kyung-sook

40
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,790
with the same motherly love
that you embraced me with!

41
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,129
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

42
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,842
Triple the campaigners and rent
ten more campaign cars for each district.

43
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:00,388
Fill all the empty walls in Seoul
with posters of Oh Kyung-sook.

44
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,766
We need to dominate public opinion.

45
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:09,606
"The Rhino has taken over this city
and is already the mayor of Seoul."

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,901
Make the ten million citizens of Seoul
believe that.

47
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,154
I am candidate number two, Oh Kyung-sook!

48
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:20,658
Please cast your precious vote
for candidate number two!

49
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:31,753
Baek has been caught in an affair
and even has an illegitimate child!

50
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:37,175
Yet, he shamelessly accused
Oh's innocent son of being a sex offender!

51
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,595
I ask, what kind of hypocrisy is this?

52
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,599
Candidate Baek Jae-min plunged
this election into chaos and corruption!

53
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,435
If you have any shame, withdraw!

54
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,062
-Withdraw!
-Withdraw!

55
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,564
CHANGE IN SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE
APPROVAL RATING

56
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,526
Don't lose your nerve.

57
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,029
-The game isn't over yet.
-Game?

58
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
Is this a game to you?

59
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,411
Does it look like I'm doing this
just for the hell of it?

60
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,748
If you were desperate to win,
you should've been careful.

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,251
Guk is pregnant with your child--

62
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,168
And how

63
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,170
did I not know about it?

64
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,839
That's what I want to ask you.

65
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,801
You said you'd get me elected.

66
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,054
Then you should've known
every single thing about me!

67
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,475
You let Hwang Do-hee
go on a rampage like this,

68
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,394
so this is your fault.

69
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,607
Don't you ever order me around again.

70
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,278
I'll run in the election my way
and get rid of Guk Ji-yeon myself.

71
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,613
Get rid of her?

72
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,115
How?

73
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,326
Put her six feet under?

74
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,206
The press, the public, and everyone
in politics have their eyes on her.

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,666
If she suddenly disappears,

76
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,085
everyone will suspect you.

77
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,254
From Han I-seul to Guk Ji-yeon.

78
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:59,090
Are you going to say
you've gotten rid of all your mistresses?

79
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,259
Are you going to admit to it all?

80
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,764
The biggest ticking bomb

81
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,101
in this election is Guk Ji-yeon.

82
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,354
Rein in your emotions

83
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,357
and get her on your side.

84
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,776
Your fate depends on

85
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,571
the stance she takes.

86
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,617
Candidate Baek is facing the worst crisis

87
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,620
due to rumors about his affair
and an illegitimate child.

88
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:33,416
Candidate Baek's campaign is actively
fighting these allegations,

89
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,504
saying they will take legal action against
those who initially spread the rumors.

90
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:43,343
It seems his supporters' anger
and disappointment will not abate

91
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,387
until the truth regarding this scandal
is revealed.

92
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,646
You won't believe me,

93
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,233
but I never planned to get pregnant
or do anything--

94
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,446
How did you hold it together?

95
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,616
You must have been so stressed by it

96
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,951
as well as the campaign work.

97
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,336
Are you feeling all right?

98
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,757
Candidate Baek.

99
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,675
Yes.

100
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,387
As Seoul's mayoral candidate,

101
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,807
this election means the world to me.

102
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,724
But

103
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,228
you're just as important to me.

104
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,940
I couldn't have made it this far
without you.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,945
So you're telling me

106
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,490
to keep making sacrifices for you.

107
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,118
Is that it?

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,663
You want me to lay low

109
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,918
like I don't exist in this world
until the election is over?

110
00:06:59,001 --> 00:06:59,961
No.

111
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,380
Don't go into hiding.

112
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,551
Come stand beside me,
and let's get through this together.

113
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,806
From now on, we have to keep it together.

114
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,518
If we lose this election,
Chairwoman Son won't leave us unscathed.

115
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,436
Not you, me…

116
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,440
or our unborn child.

117
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:27,488
It's true that we used each other
for our own survival,

118
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,701
but you can't say
we have no feelings for each other.

119
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,661
Don't you agree?

120
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,332
So let's get through this

121
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,794
together to the end.

122
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,008
As for today,

123
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,844
don't worry and get some rest.

124
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,223
The security team will help you
get to work from tomorrow, so relax.

125
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,106
One more thing.

126
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,984
I saw these.

127
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,612
Aren't they cute?

128
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,119
Don't worry too much.

129
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,015
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

130
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,227
Candidate number two, Oh Kyung-sook!

131
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,982
Number two!

132
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,987
How much is this? 5,000 won?
Give her 5,000 won.

133
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,531
Sure. Here's 5,000 won.

134
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,907
-No.
-You have to take it.

135
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,078
Dear citizens.

136
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,872
We've been fooled so many times

137
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,209
by the promises
of real estate policies and tax reforms

138
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,921
that always pour out
during election campaigns, right?

139
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,381
Yes!

140
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:12,134
And all those campaign promises
and policies that divide us into sides,

141
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,596
the ruling party or the opposition,
liberal or conservative, and lately,

142
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,641
even women or men, employer or employee,
Gangnam or Gangbuk.

143
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,685
Aren't you tired of it all?

144
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,396
I, Oh Kyung-sook, promise to build a Seoul

145
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,899
of harmony and coexistence!

146
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,236
You can put your faith in me!

147
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,738
I will make it happen!

148
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,700
Candidate Oh seems to be moving up.

149
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,785
Since her son's name was cleared,

150
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,454
Candidate Oh has been expanding
her scope of campaign,

151
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,500
actively promoting her campaign in person
and communicating with citizens.

152
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,627
Oh Kyung-sook, the Rhino, has transformed

153
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,756
from an activist for minorities
to a politician that leads the masses.

154
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,384
She is rising to the top,
gaining the favor of people

155
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,303
disappointed by Candidate Baek.

156
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,151
Are you pregnant
with Candidate Baek's child?

157
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,361
-Do you admit to the affair?
-Is the rumor true?

158
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,613
Can we have a comment?

159
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,073
When did this affair
with Candidate Baek start?

160
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,408
You evil bitch!

161
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,493
How dare you ruin things
for Candidate Baek?

162
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,454
How dare you seduce him!

163
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,123
Come here, you bitch!
I'm going to kill you.

164
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,458
Please stop!

165
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,459
Please calm down!

166
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,211
-Stop this!
-Move aside!

167
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,214
Are you all right? Let's go.

168
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,720
You owe us an explanation.

169
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,019
From now on, we have to keep it together.

170
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,522
If we lose this election,
Chairwoman Son won't leave us unscathed.

171
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,732
Not you, me,

172
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,400
or our unborn child.

173
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:02,912
I'll do it.

174
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,122
The press conference.

175
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:12,838
KOREAN REPUBLICAN PARTY CANDIDATE
BAEK JAE-MIN'S URGENT PRESS CONFERENCE

176
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,756
They're here.

177
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,799
They're coming.

178
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,737
First,

179
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,074
I'd like to sincerely apologize

180
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,245
to all the citizens
that I've caused discomfort to…

181
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:48,749
due to the recent scandal.

182
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:54,171
But I promise you the rumors
about my affair and the illegitimate child

183
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,507
are completely untrue.

184
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,135
Ms. Guk was victimized

185
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,304
by filthy political machinations

186
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,683
and smear campaigns,

187
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,227
simply because she's a woman

188
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,604
and my aide.

189
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,025
I feel deeply sorry for her.

190
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,875
From now on,
you're no longer a home-wrecker.

191
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,545
You're a victim of fake news.

192
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,681
Read exactly what I prepared for you

193
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,975
word for word.

194
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,646
We'll put an end to this messy scandal

195
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,025
with this press conference.

196
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,445
I am Guk Ji-yeon,

197
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,697
Candidate Baek's aide.

198
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,825
I swear before you all

199
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,205
that I have never harbored
romantic feelings for Candidate Baek

200
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,042
or had an inappropriate relationship
with Candidate Baek.

201
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,462
Above all else,

202
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,883
I'm in love with someone else.

203
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,389
I am

204
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,975
Guk Ji-yeon's boyfriend,

205
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,186
Cha Jin-hyeok.

206
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,191
I work for a subsidiary of Eunsung Group,

207
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,861
and we've been dating
for the past two years.

208
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,073
We're planning to get married this fall…

209
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,787
and my girlfriend is currently

210
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,373
pregnant with my child.

211
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,341
My name is Guk Ji-yeon.

212
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,052
I am not "Mistress G."

213
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,556
I am just an ordinary woman…

214
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,018
who wants to start a family
with the man I love--

215
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,436
-Look at this.
-What is it?

216
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,857
Was it just uploaded?

217
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,442
-Whoa. Unbelievable!
-It's Baek Jae-min, isn't it?

218
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,152
What in the world?

219
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,827
BAEK, DESPITE HAVING DENIED THE RUMORS,
SPOTTED AT AIDE G'S HOUSE AFTER TRYST

220
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,246
Ms. Guk Ji-yeon!

221
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,208
Have you seen the article
that was just released online?

222
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,168
Ms. Guk.

223
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,631
Did you really spend time alone at home
with Candidate Baek at such a late hour?

224
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,051
No.

225
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,266
The campaign staff was there with me.

226
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,853
We had an urgent meeting regarding
a canvass for the next day,

227
00:14:55,936 --> 00:15:00,149
and Mr. Baek's final appointment
happened to be near my house, so--

228
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:05,070
So, he visited your home secretly,
alone without his driver?

229
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,449
-That's--
-The photos showed

230
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:12,286
Candidate Baek entering the entry code
to your apartment himself.

231
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,705
Do you share private information with him?

232
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,751
What do you think, Mr. Cha?

233
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,715
This is a case of horrific sexist abuse!

234
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,177
They went and installed a camera

235
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,889
in front of her house so they could
fabricate this so-called affair.

236
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,267
Would this have happened
if Ms. Guk were a man?

237
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,268
I don't think so.

238
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,564
Then why did you visit the home
of a female aide who's soon to be married

239
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,733
-like it was your own apartment?
-That day--

240
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,235
Isn't that the sexual abuse
you're speaking of?

241
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,947
Let me ask you again, Ms. Guk.

242
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,326
Did you spend time alone
with Candidate Baek at home that night?

243
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,419
This is clearly political slander!

244
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,338
-Ms. Guk!
-It's political terrorism!

245
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,381
Ji-yeon!

246
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,507
Wake up, Ji-yeon!

247
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,467
This is political slander!

248
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,094
Baek's aide, Ms. Guk Ji-yeon,

249
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,514
who has denied all allegations
of an extramarital affair

250
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:17,059
with Candidate Baek, collapsed
during a live press conference.

251
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:18,727
Ms. Hwang.

252
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,356
We seem to have really gotten to them
with this attack.

253
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,900
It looked like Guk Ji-yeon
was extremely startled,

254
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,903
fainting like that
at such a crucial moment.

255
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,488
She must've been stunned.

256
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,409
Because she couldn't have had any idea
there'd be photos of their rendezvous.

257
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,954
But aren't we backing her
too far into a corner?

258
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,373
She's pregnant, after all.

259
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,545
We're not backing her into a corner.
We're protecting her publicly.

260
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,881
Because now
that the whole country knows about her,

261
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:51,218
the reporters will be keeping tabs
on her every move.

262
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,928
Yeah. Well, then,

263
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,141
this means that she'll be safe,
at least until the election is over.

264
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:02,396
So save the pointless sympathy,
and keep the attacks going.

265
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,856
Yes, ma'am.

266
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,194
"Candidate Baek frequents
his aide's home like it's a hotel."

267
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,157
"The epitome of sexual exploitation
using power imbalance."

268
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,661
"Is Candidate Baek Jae-min really fit
to be mayor?"

269
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,583
"A man who wants to get married
and a man who wants to get elected."

270
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,420
"Which of the two is the real father?"

271
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,049
"Only Aide G knows the truth."

272
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,595
Get these headlines
delivered to the press,

273
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,806
and start uploading posts online.

274
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,772
THE EPITOME OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION
USING POWER IMBALANCE

275
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,484
"The epitome of sexual exploitation."

276
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,451
THE EPITOME OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION
USING POWER IMBALANCE

277
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,454
IS CANDIDATE BAEK JAE-MIN
REALLY FIT TO BE MAYOR?

278
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,806
You should relax.
You must be tired after the day you had.

279
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,140
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,061
I tried to keep it together
at the press conference.

281
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,522
I don't mean to,

282
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,983
but I keep getting in your way.

283
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,277
Hwang Do-hee's getting in the way.

284
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:33,821
Not you.

285
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,284
You didn't know how far she'd take things.

286
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,494
If you had,

287
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,122
you would have told me.

288
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,795
Do-hee came by my place once.

289
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,090
Really?

290
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,884
About what?

291
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,179
She asked about I-seul.

292
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,225
She already knew that
all of Eunsung headquarter's CCTVs

293
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,477
had been replaced
the day after I-seul fell.

294
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,772
So she's been working hard,
digging up dirt on me.

295
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,817
You knew, but you didn't tell me about it?

296
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,485
Why?

297
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,113
I wasn't sure…

298
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,908
that I wouldn't end up like I-seul.

299
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,168
I-seul was my mistake,
from start to finish,

300
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,005
but with you, it was my choice.

301
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,091
You have to know that
even if everyone else--

302
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,009
I do.

303
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,679
You never planned

304
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,724
or intended for I-seul

305
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,226
to end up like that.

306
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,856
I only came this far with you
because I believe that about you.

307
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,613
You said you chose me, right?

308
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:00,657
I did.

309
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,744
And all choices come
with responsibilities.

310
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,413
If you say you'll guarantee my safety…

311
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,417
I will forget everything that happened

312
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,086
on the day that I-seul died.

313
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,887
Ji-yeon.

314
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,559
Even if you don't promise anything…

315
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,146
I'm going to protect you.

316
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,530
Get some rest.
I'll drop by again tomorrow.

317
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,555
I went over her call history,
search history, and her email.

318
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,890
Did anything stand out?

319
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,810
We found this in her recent call history.

320
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,455
Yes, hello.

321
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,583
I took the prenatal DNA test
the other day.

322
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,003
When will I get the results?

323
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,104
That Guk Ji-yeon is quite clever.

324
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,151
Knowing she may get cornered
like she did today,

325
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,070
she dug herself an escape route.

326
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,453
Looks like she had a prenatal DNA test.

327
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:22,466
Let me know when the results are in.
As quickly as possible.

328
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:29,681
Guk Ji-yeon…

329
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,770
We should let her go now.

330
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,692
To heaven.

331
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,031
Life must be hell for her right now.

332
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,493
Desperately using her unborn baby
for her survival,

333
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,037
she cannot live with that.

334
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:55,957
It's too dangerous.

335
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,877
Her face is known
from the press conference.

336
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,253
If we keep her alive,

337
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,465
how will you handle the I-seul incident?

338
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,550
Hwang Do-hee went to Ji-yeon's apartment

339
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,761
to question her about I-seul.

340
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,764
We'll wait for the time
to deal with her quietly.

341
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,265
Instead of doing it quietly,

342
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,394
we should give her a dramatic

343
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,105
and somber farewell publicly.

344
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,607
By making her a martyr.

345
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,571
Instead of a home-wrecking witch,

346
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,368
she'll be a victim who took her own life
because of the false accusations.

347
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,288
Wouldn't that be more honorable for her…

348
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,626
than being denounced as a mistress?

349
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,800
A martyr who dies after exposing
the cruel slander of the political world.

350
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,056
And Hwang Do-hee is the very person
who fabricated this filthy scandal,

351
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,268
framed Ji-yeon as a mistress,
and drove her to death?

352
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,769
And Oh Kyung-sook

353
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:02,441
let Hwang do the unspeakable
so that she could be elected.

354
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,526
This will absolutely

355
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,573
destroy Oh Kyung-sook
right before the election.

356
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,041
They say the student becomes the master.

357
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,086
Thanks to you, I have learned many things…

358
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,215
about the cutthroat world of politics.

359
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,219
It's good to learn things.

360
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,765
But there are lines
that should never be crossed.

361
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,101
And the moment you cross one,

362
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,646
you lose your humanity forever.

363
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,907
I already crossed that line

364
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,744
the day my father passed away.

365
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,381
We'll christen the martyr
the night after tomorrow.

366
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,261
The two days before the election
are our last chance to come back.

367
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,400
ADULTERER BAEK JAE-MIN

368
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,318
WITHDRAW

369
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,908
Withdraw, you scumbag!

370
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,118
Get lost, you bastard!

371
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,036
Withdraw!

372
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,711
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

373
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,350
BAEK JAE-MIN WILL MAKE SEOUL
THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY

374
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,357
Beloved citizens of Seoul.

375
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,860
I mustered the courage
to stand before you today

376
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,072
not to prove my innocence

377
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,491
but to make you an offer.

378
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,244
I will share with you

379
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,455
the stakes in Asia's highest skyscraper,

380
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,958
Eunsung Duty-Free Shop.

381
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,044
I promised you, didn't I?

382
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:33,258
That I'd share Eunsung Group's wealth
with the citizens of Seoul.

383
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:38,221
I now plan to put forward a policy
that will make my promise come true.

384
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:39,723
I, Baek Jae-min,

385
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,934
will donate half
of the Eunsung Duty-Free Shop's shares

386
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,270
to the Seoul Metropolitan Government

387
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:50,817
and distribute them to each and every one
of you, the citizens of Seoul!

388
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,947
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

389
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,661
KRP Candidate Baek has announced
an unprecedented campaign pledge.

390
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,874
He's pledged to distribute half the shares
of Eunsung Duty-Free Shop to citizens.

391
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,043
The offer's been met
with great enthusiasm.

392
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:18,053
How dare you sell off Heaven
without my permission?

393
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,222
I didn't sell it off.

394
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,224
I'm using it as bait.

395
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,644
I'll withdraw it when the election--

396
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,354
Whether you withdraw it or not!

397
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,192
You should have asked for my permission

398
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,570
if you were going to use
the duty-free shop.

399
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,366
Mom. The election is only three days away.

400
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,534
Once he's elected,
I'll manage the duty-free--

401
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,661
Shut your mouth.

402
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,084
You can't even keep your man in check,

403
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,503
and you'll manage what?

404
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,554
Do you know how many people
are involved in this duty-free shop?

405
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,308
From the government to the prosecution
to the National Assembly,

406
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,687
the interests of dozens of people
are at stake here, and what?

407
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,231
Distribute the shares?

408
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,111
Retract the offer immediately.

409
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,696
I can't do that.

410
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,243
From now on, I'll be in charge,

411
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,662
so you can just stay quiet and--

412
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,171
Ma'am.

413
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,966
The tables have turned.

414
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,845
I have to become mayor

415
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,931
to be able to save your little neck

416
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,350
and protect Eunsung Group.

417
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,729
And those two daughters
who sponge off of you

418
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,231
can go on with their lives

419
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,109
and keep their stinking money.

420
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,902
-Baek Jae-min!
-That's why!

421
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,909
You need to show me respect.

422
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,124
I have to become mayor…

423
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,211
for all of you

424
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,924
and your precious company to survive.

425
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,344
So stop racking
those empty brains of yours,

426
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,014
and start helping me!

427
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,081
HWANG DO-HEE

428
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,195
Baek Jae-min has gone totally nuts.

429
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,615
It was a clever move.

430
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,829
Covering up his affair
with the duty-free shop shares.

431
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,082
He isn't completely incompetent.

432
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,000
You'll be fine

433
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,586
in the election, right?

434
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,131
Nothing is for certain.

435
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,678
Because he's played a card
that people can't help but be tempted by.

436
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,517
Do you need more funds?

437
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,187
Thanks, but I'll pass.

438
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,234
We're past the point
where your pocket money can solve things.

439
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,320
This is getting more interesting.

440
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,575
What could you possibly need from me
other than money?

441
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,706
The Corporate Strategy Team has assigned
some staff to you, right?

442
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,461
Position them around Guk Ji-yeon, quietly.

443
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,673
Baek Jae-min can't find out about this,

444
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,134
so use only your most loyal people.

445
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,844
Keep tabs on everything about her,

446
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,763
including her whereabouts, her health,
and who she meets.

447
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,600
And keep me updated every second.

448
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,435
What for?

449
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,979
Does Baek Jae-min want to kill her?

450
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,735
He won't be able to take things that far.

451
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,532
The election is only three days away,
and there are too many eyes on them.

452
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,452
So, you're preserving the evidence?

453
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,791
Baek is on a rampage, to the extent
that he's even using the duty-free shop.

454
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,420
So, no matter what crazy things Baek does,

455
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:07,759
we can turn the tide
as long as we keep Guk Ji-yeon safe,

456
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,346
even if the worst comes to the worst.

457
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,851
Anything else?

458
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,523
Maintain a poker face.

459
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,611
Don't let your mom find out.

460
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,666
Do-hee will be blamed for everything?

461
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,000
Yes, ma'am.

462
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,170
We'll turn Hwang into an evil witch

463
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,547
who turned an innocent woman
into a home-wrecker

464
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,675
and drove her to suicide.

465
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,136
And Oh Kyung-sook?

466
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,430
The thread must follow the needle.

467
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,643
You can just sit back and watch

468
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,853
how a woman falls to her knees
in elections

469
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,023
for offering up a fellow woman
as a sacrifice.

470
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,737
I know you are angry with Jae-min,

471
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,865
but now is not the time to punish him.

472
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,119
Please put your anger aside
and focus on the election.

473
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:20,331
-If this election goes wrong--
-Then Jae-min will find out.

474
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,419
Everything.

475
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,715
Even that you are the one
who caused his father's death.

476
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,722
It won't just be Jae-min
who'll be punished

477
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:38,850
if we don't win this election.

478
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,022
Deal with this quickly

479
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,316
and make no mistakes.

480
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,861
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,870
Let's get started.

482
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,005
Have the test results come in?

483
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,841
No, don't email them to me.

484
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,093
Don't send them by post, either.

485
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,929
I'll come and pick them up right now.

486
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,024
Ma'am, stop. You should be resting.

487
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,860
Oh, I just need to get something
from home.

488
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,195
Right now?

489
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,446
Yes, it will be quick.

490
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,115
Why don't you go after this shot?

491
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,909
It won't take long.

492
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,328
It's time for your shot.

493
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:55,945
GUK JI-YEON

494
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,699
We're ready.

495
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,744
Buy a used car under Guk Ji-yeon's name.

496
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,998
Book a self-check-in vacation rental
in the Gangwon-do area.

497
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,542
And pack some of her belongings
in a travel bag.

498
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,673
USED CAR

499
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:18,926
PURCHASE COMPLETE

500
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,226
YOUR ROOM IS RESERVED

501
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,230
It's done.

502
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,733
Any further orders, sir?

503
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,027
Hwang Do-hee visited
Guk Ji-yeon's house once.

504
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,780
Contact the security team,
and get the CCTV footage from that day.

505
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,749
Now,

506
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,919
only the last step remains.

507
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,464
We need a tear-jerking suicide note.

508
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,551
So people will mourn Guk Ji-yeon's death

509
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,554
and despise the two evil witches

510
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,890
who drove the poor woman
to take her own life.

511
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,269
It'll be a dramatic reveal
during the debate

512
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,189
with Oh Kyung-sook tomorrow.

513
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,240
Releasing this during the debate?

514
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,452
Tomorrow is our last chance
for a comeback.

515
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,330
Someone of your talent

516
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,958
can cook up something good

517
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,585
with info like this.

518
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,586
Hwang Do-hee.

519
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,798
Why do you keep putting yourself
in danger?

520
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,219
Is it not enough
that your father lost his life?

521
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,772
Of course it's enough.

522
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,902
You know better than anyone
how much I loved my father.

523
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,029
And that's why I'm doing this.

524
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,240
What?

525
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,993
Joong-seok.

526
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,081
In over a decade
of working under Eunsung's owners…

527
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,088
I was never once honest with my father.

528
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,887
"I have a good job at a big company.
That's why I get paid a lot."

529
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,682
I always lied to him like that.

530
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,354
But now, I feel so relieved.

531
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,692
I don't have to hide anything
from my father.

532
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,864
Do-hee.

533
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,948
Later,

534
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,035
after all this is over,

535
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,495
I'd like you to go see Dad

536
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,208
and tell him
that he can be proud of his daughter.

537
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,989
Do-hee. I think Baek Jae-min

538
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,659
will emphasize the duty-free shop shares
to no end tomorrow.

539
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,912
We'll stop him. With this.

540
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:38,292
EUNSUNG DUTY-FREE SHOP PERMIT LOBBY LIST

541
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,924
What's this list?

542
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,219
It's not just any list. It's a memorandum.

543
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,931
A list of people
who have received bribes from Son

544
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,726
in the process of issuing the permit
for Eunsung Duty-Free Shop.

545
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,690
Former and current ministers of MOLIT,
prosecutors,

546
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,568
Seoul City officials,
and even safety inspectors.

547
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,154
I delivered the money myself

548
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,532
under Chairwoman Son's orders.

549
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,744
You did it yourself?

550
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,376
It is a highly classified document
that was never supposed to be leaked.

551
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,754
Even her daughters don't know about it.

552
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,423
In other words…

553
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,262
this duty-free shop has been
full of problems right from the start.

554
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,141
From choosing the plot of land
to construction and safety inspections,

555
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,436
Eunsung bribed all those people
to keep the problems under wraps.

556
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,399
So,

557
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:48,279
why did you keep this silver bullet
hidden all this time?

558
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,536
Because they'd just cover it up
if we aren't fully prepared.

559
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,248
Those who accepted the bribes

560
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,377
will vehemently deny everything,

561
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,714
and Eunsung Group

562
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,885
will use its connections in the Blue House
and the prosecution to stop us.

563
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,348
What use would this memorandum be, then?

564
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,602
So?

565
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,359
So I've waited…

566
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,327
for someone to blow the whistle

567
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,205
on this unstoppable chaos
and reveal the truth

568
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:41,957
in all its clarity.

569
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,964
And that's me, Oh Kyung-sook?

570
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm 200% certain.

571
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,517
Gosh.

572
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:12,863
Bury it.

573
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,493
Just bury it.

574
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,206
If we expose this,

575
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,377
Son Young-sim will retaliate,
and we don't know what she'll do to you.

576
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,090
How am I supposed to reveal that
when the consequences are obvious?

577
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,093
-Oh Kyung-sook.
-Fine!

578
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:40,266
I said I'd do it your way
so we could win the election, but…

579
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,019
that doesn't mean
I'll let you sacrifice yourself

580
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,229
for my victory.

581
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,108
-I can't let you take the fall alone--
-Then you should win!

582
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,031
You can win the election

583
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,742
and protect me with your power, right?

584
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,578
Do-hee!

585
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,166
Tell me.

586
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,880
You won't abandon a woman
who bet her life on you, will you?

587
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:35,946
The duty-free shop

588
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,950
is the final card
Baek Jae-min has up his sleeve.

589
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,035
If we take that away…

590
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,874
you'll be the real queen of this election.

591
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,594
With two days to go until the election,

592
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,347
the final debate
will be aired live tonight.

593
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:05,809
Candidate Baek was caught up in a scandal
that could've ensured his defeat,

594
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,978
but he managed to consolidate
his supporters

595
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,938
with his duty-free shop campaign pledge.

596
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,441
And we also have Candidate Oh, the Rhino,

597
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,611
who has dramatically turned the tables,
time and time again.

598
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:18,364
Can she turn the tables
in the debate against Baek

599
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,282
and make a miracle happen?

600
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,453
Now, it's time

601
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,998
to start the last rites for our martyr.

602
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,893
You want me…

603
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,398
to take Guk Ji-yeon home
from the hospital?

604
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,489
You called me over here to escort
your pregnant mistress home?

605
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:04,618
Yes.

606
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:12,710
How far…

607
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,547
are you going to take things?

608
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,884
Was defying Mom not enough?

609
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,931
Do you have any idea how much humiliation
you've put me through?

610
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,558
Pull yourself together!

611
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,895
For God's sake…

612
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,190
Chae-ryoung.

613
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,694
I'm doing you a favor right now.

614
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,320
All right?

615
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,740
What?

616
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,450
Do you think your mom

617
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:49,371
would give you her approval
if I told her that you were useless to me…

618
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,083
in this election?

619
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:59,214
You should be using me
for your survival too.

620
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,050
I know you've gone through

621
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,555
worse than me
living with your horrible family.

622
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,017
Do you want to give up now?

623
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,270
You need to survive to the end.

624
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,486
Go there

625
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,071
and hug her like this.

626
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,242
This will be the last farewell
she receives

627
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,703
in this world of the living.

628
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:34,958
With that,

629
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,629
you will become the Virgin Mary…

630
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,382
who endured excruciating pain…

631
00:46:54,269 --> 00:46:55,729
and forgave her enemy.

632
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,581
Director Eun is going to visit
Ms. Guk at the hospital.

633
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,417
Chae-ryoung is visiting her?

634
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,377
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:22,673
She just left Mr. Baek's campaign office
for the hospital.

636
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,144
The protocol team. Here, this way.

637
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,857
-Did you get the cue sheet?
-No.

638
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,525
You didn't get it yet?

639
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,193
Hey, did you get the cue sheet?

640
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:51,869
The hospital?

641
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,124
-Please read it through.
-Okay, I got it.

642
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,547
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

643
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,932
You should go to Ji-yeon.

644
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:14,850
Right now?

645
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,476
But the debate is

646
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,562
less than three hours away.

647
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,647
That's why you should go.

648
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:25,152
If Chae-ryoung shows up there,
people's attention will shift to her.

649
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,697
It's strange that they'd do this
right before the debate.

650
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,158
Hurry.

651
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,576
Yes, ma'am.

652
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,081
Don't get up.

653
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,086
You've grown quite haggard.

654
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,422
This must've been very hard on you.

655
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,927
Why are you here?

656
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,768
To give you this.

657
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:05,460
THE PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY
OF THE SAMPLE YOU'VE REQUESTED IS 0.01%

658
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:10,465
What's wrong?

659
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,094
Are you disappointed

660
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,930
because it wasn't what you expected?

661
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,810
How could this happen?

662
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,354
What do you think?

663
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,815
Baek Jae-min fabricated it.

664
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,901
And he will now get rid of you,

665
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,070
along with your unborn child.

666
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,955
And you expect me to believe that?

667
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,417
It's up to you
whether you believe it or not.

668
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,836
But think about it.

669
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,548
Baek Jae-min is so desperate
to become mayor

670
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,800
that he's even trampling
all over my mother.

671
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,303
Do you think he'll keep you alive?

672
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,474
Especially after you took this DNA test
to stab him in the back?

673
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,854
And why are you telling me all this?

674
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,992
Because I need to survive.

675
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,997
I have to make that bastard mayor,
no matter what.

676
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,792
But if you die…

677
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,671
Baek Jae-min's only weakness
would end up disappearing.

678
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:38,095
I don't want him to be mayor
without having a way to control him.

679
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,724
Are you asking me

680
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,186
to become your secret weapon?

681
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,938
Yes.

682
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,567
Then I'll do whatever it takes
to protect you.

683
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:56,863
So…

684
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,993
help me out, just this once.

685
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,416
If I make Baek Jae-min mayor
and inherit Eunsung,

686
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,169
I'll raise…

687
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,423
your child as my own.

688
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,801
Just like my mom did.

689
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,558
My father had me out of wedlock too,

690
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:30,772
but I grew up as a legitimate member
of the family, raised by my mom.

691
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,274
I can do the same…

692
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,279
for your child.

693
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,086
Here.

694
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,841
I've recorded everything
I've said up to now.

695
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:02,554
Now, you have

696
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,057
my weakness in your hand.

697
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:12,981
So, please…

698
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,402
help me out, just this once.

699
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,751
What do you want me to do?

700
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,881
-There she is.
-They're here!

701
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:42,135
Ms. Eun, is the rumor of the affair
between Candidate Baek and Ms. Guk a lie?

702
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,721
-Whose child are you carrying?
-How do you two feel?

703
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,890
Ms. Eun, have you forgiven Ms. Guk?

704
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,185
She's a pregnant woman
who's just been discharged!

705
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,522
If you have any questions, you can ask me,
instead of bothering my employee.

706
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,816
What show is she putting on now?

707
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,320
I know she's desperate
to get her husband elected,

708
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:04,866
but is Eun Chae-ryoung someone
who can put on a show like that?

709
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,536
Definitely not. Never.

710
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:14,417
…showed strong trust in her,
referring to her as "my employee."

711
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,335
That's right.

712
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,213
Ms. Guk Ji-yeon

713
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,260
was one of my employees,
who worked for us for five years.

714
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:27,639
And she was our most capable employee
in the Corporate Strategy Team.

715
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,266
And that was why

716
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,060
I strongly recommended her to my husband.

717
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,608
I only feel terribly sorry
that something like this happened.

718
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,195
It's okay, ma'am.

719
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,949
Ms. Eun, then are you saying
you forgive Ms. Guk Ji-yeon?

720
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,952
Do you acknowledge the affair she had
with your husband?

721
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,955
They say only those in a relationship
know its nature.

722
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:56,251
However, whatever may or may not have
happened between her and my husband,

723
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,627
I have

724
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:01,256
absolute trust in Ms. Guk Ji-yeon.

725
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,594
Care to comment, Ms. Guk?

726
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,642
It's time, Ms. Oh. We should get going.

727
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,060
Okay.

728
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,153
We'll talk more on our way there.

729
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,118
-Go ahead with Ms. Oh.
-Yes, ma'am.

730
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,078
Let's go.

731
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,003
This is the latest footage we acquired

732
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:43,089
from a camera on one of the main roads
surrounding Eunsung HQ.

733
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,934
Baek Jae-min was at the headquarters
the day I-seul died.

734
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,150
This is when I-seul fell to her death.

735
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,531
They're running,
startled by what they saw?

736
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,449
Right.

737
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,416
A person fell from a 40-story building,

738
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,294
and Baek Jae-min just left the scene

739
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,505
without any signs of shock.

740
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,010
As if he knew she was going to fall.

741
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,224
I doubted it, but…

742
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,668
It was Baek Jae-min who killed I-seul.

743
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,588
-Ms. Eun!
-Give us a comment, Ms. Guk.

744
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,341
Do you have any comment for us, Ms. Guk?

745
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,801
-Ms. Eun Chae-ryoung.
-Ms. Eun.

746
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,719
Ms. Guk, how are you feeling right now?

747
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,763
Thanks for hanging in there.

748
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:15,974
Thank you.

749
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,663
It's over for you now

750
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:40,707
completely.

751
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,225
Cha-sun.

752
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,771
This is a setup.

753
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,858
Just like they staged I-seul's death
as a suicide…

754
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:12,113
they'll make it look
like Ji-yeon killed herself.

755
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,658
Chae-ryoung just lied to the press,
knowing full well what's going on.

756
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,119
What?

757
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,713
Dong-joo. Where are you?

758
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,256
I'm on their tail.

759
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,513
Ms. Hwang.
Something's up with these bastards.

760
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:39,849
There are all these cars following them,
and they're exchanging signals.

761
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,226
You can't lose them.

762
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,771
If you lose that car, there's no telling
what will happen to Guk Ji-yeon.

763
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,326
We'll hold on to your phone for you.

764
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,051
What the hell?

765
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,472
Let go!

766
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,030
Give us some privacy.

767
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,533
Great job, everyone.

768
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,625
There will be a news flash
during the debate.

769
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,598
Do-hee.

770
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,100
Where are you now?

771
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,018
Kyung-sook.

772
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,729
Listen carefully.

773
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,441
I think Baek Jae-min
is trying to kill Guk Ji-yeon.

774
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,321
What's it about?

775
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,239
We'll reveal everything live on air.

776
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,950
From Guk Ji-yeon's
handwritten suicide note

777
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,536
to the evidence proving
that it was suicide.

778
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,664
Then Oh Kyung-sook and Hwang Do-hee

779
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:29,667
will be buried alive
during the live debate.

780
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:34,005
When they find Guk's body,
that'll be the end of this election.

781
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,257
Game over.
