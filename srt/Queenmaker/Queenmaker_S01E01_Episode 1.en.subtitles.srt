1
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,971
-Arrest her!
-Arrest her!

2
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,515
Arrest Eun Chae-ryoung!

3
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,392
-Arrest her!
-Arrest her!

4
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,021
Eun Chae-ryoung, the managing director
of the Eunsung Group

5
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,691
who sparked public criticism
for assaulting her employees and driver,

6
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,361
will arrive at the prosecutors' office
to answer questions.

7
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,865
Currently, the Eunsung Group
Labor Union and various civic groups

8
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,742
have gathered at the prosecutors' office

9
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,370
to protest and demand punishment
for Eun Chae-ryung.

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,708
Immediately following the incident,
the Eunsung Group Union asked Ms. Eun

11
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,294
to publicly apologize
to the victims several times,

12
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,962
but their demands were ignored.

13
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,172
Are you mere couriers?

14
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,967
Why did you bring things
without thinking it through?

15
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,720
We need eye-catching items.

16
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,190
This shoe came off at the prosecutors'
office during the secret fund case.

17
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,611
This jacket, made in Switzerland,
that the daughter was wearing.

18
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,574
And this purse that she carried
during the ownership transition scandal.

19
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,286
These items were most searched online,
soon selling out.

20
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,413
This is how you distract people.

21
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:06,417
We get people to focus
on what the family is wearing and using,

22
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,379
instead of whatever crimes
they may have committed.

23
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,676
Do you realize
how important your jobs are?

24
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,593
Huh?

25
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,220
Take some pride.

26
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,764
Start over.

27
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,057
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

28
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:29,274
We have footage of Ms. Eun's misdemeanor
provided by the victims.

29
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:33,611
My appointment was at three o'clock,
and you failed to show up.

30
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,905
Can't you do a simple task, you moron?

31
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,740
I'm working my ass off.

32
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,326
You should be thankful and work harder.

33
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,288
Including assault,
repeated assault, aggravated assault,

34
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,748
blackmail, and verbal abuse,
she was charged with seven…

35
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,384
Ms. Eun, what's going on?

36
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,138
It was cold and noisy.

37
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,600
She woke me up.

38
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,646
You've got this bald spot
on top of your head,

39
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,607
so I was trying to fill it in.

40
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,739
-Just leave it.
-Do-hee.

41
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,659
You asked me to bow deeply
in front of the reporters.

42
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:27,373
Do you want photos of my bald spot
all over the Internet?

43
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,958
Let me handle it.

44
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:34,255
I'll do everything I can to make this
as hassle-free as possible.

45
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,266
What should I wear?

46
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,185
Arrest Eun Chae-ryoung!

47
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:50,563
-Arrest her!
-Arrest her!

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,107
Dissolve the Eunsung Group!

49
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,693
Ms. Eun, what's your take
on this incident?

50
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,862
Do you realize
how authoritarian your actions were?

51
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,739
-Do you admit it?
-And your side of the story?

52
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,658
-Ms. Eun.
-A word, please.

53
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,160
-Any comment at all?
-A word, please.

54
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,913
-Do you deny everything?
-Do you admit to everything?

55
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,416
-Resign!
-Resign!

56
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,090
-Resign!
-Resign!

57
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,137
Ms. Eun. Do you have anything
to say to the public?

58
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,307
Any comments
for the victims you assaulted?

59
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:30,478
I apologize for my behavior.

60
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:37,860
-Why did you assault your employees?
-Did you harass them to vent your anger?

61
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,404
I apologize

62
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,948
sincerely for my behavior.

63
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:42,865
Ms. Eun.

64
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,119
Is it true that you have
intermittent explosive disorder?

65
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,957
Intermittent explosive disorder
is a serious mental disorder.

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,210
Do you think you're capable
of running a big company?

67
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,258
Ms. Eun.

68
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,261
Ms. Eun Chae-ryoung.

69
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,723
Do you admit to having mental issues?

70
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,727
Take this, you bitch!

71
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,192
The egg throwers?

72
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,819
As you instructed, I paid them generously.

73
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,574
Make sure they keep their mouths shut.

74
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,786
If anyone finds out that we hired them,
we're done for.

75
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,454
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,164
Articles?

77
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,583
We distracted them with her outfit.

78
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,127
This item hasn't been released
in Korea yet,

79
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,129
so the interest is pretty high.

80
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,340
Open up boutiques at our flagship store,

81
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,177
as well as the Gangnam, Gyeonggi,
and Busan branches today.

82
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,180
Start selling the items

83
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,391
Ms. Eun was wearing.

84
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,936
Flood the press with "sold-out" articles
until the questioning.

85
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:35,978
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:42,068
By the way, that reporter is with IBC.

87
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,827
How many commercials
are we running on IBC now?

88
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,831
Five during the morning news,
three in the afternoon,

89
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,417
and seven during prime time,

90
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,085
so 15 altogether.

91
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,211
Cancel them.

92
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,754
All of them?

93
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,300
Guk Ji-yeon.

94
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:09,887
Should I cancel you too?

95
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,390
Don't make me repeat myself. Just do it.

96
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,724
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,691
Oh my, sorry I'm late.

98
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,985
I was so nervous about meeting a VIP.

99
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,445
I needed a cigarette first.

100
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,322
I'm Gi Joon-tae,
a Seoul Central DPO prosecutor.

101
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,788
I'm Hwang Do-hee, general manager
of Corporate Strategy for Eunsung.

102
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,707
Right, it's you.

103
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,586
The fixer who cleans up all the shit
the Eunsung family causes.

104
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,380
She'll be out soon, right?

105
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,133
She didn't commit a serious crime,

106
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,635
and the victims agreed to settle.

107
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,556
That's rather disappointing.

108
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,810
You've been cleaning up their shit
for the past ten years.

109
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,897
I expected more from you.

110
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,027
I'll give you cause.

111
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,989
You won't need to prosecute her.

112
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,166
What?

113
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:25,463
Are you asking me
to pump breast milk here?

114
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,724
Just do what comes naturally.

115
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,685
They'll question you all night,

116
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,731
but your babies need milk
for breakfast tomorrow morning.

117
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,891
-Yes, ma'am.
-Kang.

118
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,019
I just uploaded some pictures
to the cloud.

119
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,689
Put them in a press release
and distribute it to garner sympathy.

120
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,110
Ms. Eun Chae-ryoung returned to work

121
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,696
less than two months after giving birth.

122
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,199
She is experiencing
some postpartum hair loss

123
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,202
and suffering
from severe postpartum depression

124
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,704
due to her heavy workload.

125
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,249
And yet, she's still pumping
breast milk for her babies.

126
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,166
However…

127
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,966
the prosecution's harsh investigation
is interfering with her motherly duties.

128
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,099
HER MOTHERLY DUTIES WERE HINDERED
DUE TO THE HARSH INVESTIGATION

129
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:03,352
HOW MUCH WILL WOMEN'S RIGHTS SUFFER?

130
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,896
MS. EUN COOPERATES WITH INVESTIGATION
DESPITE POOR CONDITIONS

131
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,691
PICTURES OF MS. EUN PUMPING MILK

THE PROSECUTION'S HARSH INVESTIGATION

00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,244
DID YOU SEE THE PHOTO OF MS. EUN?
I'M ALSO A MOTHER AND IT BREAKS MY HEART

136
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,788
YOU TREAT MOTHERS LIKE THIS
AND BLAME LOW BIRTH RATES ON WOMEN?

137
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,958
REGARDLESS OF HER WEALTH,
SHE'S STILL A MOTHER AND WOMAN

138
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:26,959
SUCH A LOVING MOTHER

139
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,754
INTERNET USERS FOCUS ON HER FASHION
A RUNWAY IN FRONT OF REPORTERS?

140
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,255
HOW MUCH ARE ALL HER ITEMS WORTH?

141
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,215
HER FASHION ITEMS DREW ATTENTION

142
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,301
WHEN WILL THE COAT BE IN STOCK?

143
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,387
DID YOU SEE EUN CHAE-RYOUNG'S PHOTOS?
ALL HER ITEMS ARE SOLD OUT

144
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,680
MY GIRLFRIEND WANTS IT ASAP

148
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,751
3RD GENERATION CHAEBOL
EUN'S FASHION DRAWS ATTENTION

149
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,217
-I've got something for her.
-You can't see her without an appointment.

150
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,678
But she's not answering her phone.
Just a minute, okay?

151
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,597
-Make an appointment first.
-Can't you cut me some slack?

152
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,265
Is she…?

153
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,017
Hey, Miss!

154
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,063
Unbelievable!

155
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,653
I finally get to meet
Eunsung's Go-To Lady.

156
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,782
Wow!

157
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,867
This is definitely a killer heel.

158
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,330
Thank you for bringing it back to me.
I'll reward you generously.

159
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,332
Whoa.

160
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,960
Miss, not so fast.

161
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,503
Just a sec.

162
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,297
First things first.

163
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,176
Can you deliver this
to Ms. Eun Chae-ryoung?

164
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,053
What is this?

165
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:04,640
Do you know of Ms. Oh Kyung-sook,
the labor rights lawyer?

166
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,143
I've never heard that name.

167
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:11,981
This is footage of Attorney Oh Kyung-sook,
who's been protesting for 78 days

168
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:15,359
on the rooftop
of the Eunsung Department Store.

169
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,777
So?

170
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,864
Ms. Eun is the owner
of the department store.

171
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,910
She notified
500 female part-timer food court workers

172
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,079
that they'd be unilaterally terminated.

173
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,249
When they protested,
she sued them for damages incurred.

174
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,418
That's why
Ms. Oh's protesting on the rooftop--

175
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:36,672
I'm sorry, but it isn't my job
to negotiate with the labor union.

176
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:39,967
Bullshit.

177
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,975
You're happy
to just ignore the workers' plight

178
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,978
while you live it up
in fancy designer shoes.

179
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:56,108
Wait. It's not that you ignore it.
You don't even know.

180
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,238
Because you live extravagantly.

181
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,961
I run around

182
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,298
for ten hours a day in those heels.

183
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,805
Don't tell me
I don't understand the workers' struggle.

184
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,517
I'll pass this along to Ms. Eun.

185
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,228
Is that a promise?

186
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,481
If you don't give it to her,
you'll regret it.

187
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:36,398
Okay?

188
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,734
WOMEN'S RIGHTS POOR EVEN FOR THE CHAEBOL

189
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,110
Ms. Hwang nailed it again.

190
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:45,074
How does she always turn things around
by provoking the wild public responses?

191
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,828
That's why the owner's family
loves her to death.

192
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,498
At 40, she became a general manager
and earns more than all her peers.

193
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,125
A little manipulation is fine,
but going this far?

194
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,460
Is Ms. Eun a cow?

195
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,711
Cow?

196
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,964
Staging a milk-pumping scene
was a tad cringe-worthy.

197
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,382
Then get your shit and go.

198
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,886
I'll pluck every hair
from you stupid cows if I have to

199
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,430
in order to protect the owner's family.
That's our job.

200
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,309
Protecting the owner's family
is protecting this company.

201
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,146
That way, we can protect the jobs
of thousands of employees.

202
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,609
How dare you gossip about me?

203
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,486
I'm sorry, Ms. Hwang.

204
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,113
I'm so sorry.

205
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,783
Ms. Hwang.
Did you see the latest top searches?

206
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,202
From one through ten, we have dominated--

207
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,120
Enough.

208
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,040
Take care of these ungrateful bitches.

209
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,563
GENERAL MANAGER
HWANG DO-HEE

210
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,368
You can't do this.

211
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,370
-Arrest her!
-Arrest her!

212
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,749
ARREST THE LAWBREAKING OWNER'S FAMILY

213
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,667
-Fight!
-Fight!

214
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,755
Under the flag of the democratic union

215
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,383
Gather round, and protect what's ours

216
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:30,304
If we unite, we will survive

217
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:34,141
That's how workers survive

218
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,392
ROOFTOP STRIKE
DAY 78

219
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,855
I'll die of hunger.

220
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,066
PLEASE HELP THE WORKERS

221
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,704
Water!

222
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,581
Water!

223
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,167
Water!

224
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,101
Eureka!

225
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,822
Let's go!

226
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,992
Here we go!

227
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,082
WORKERS NEVER DIE

228
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,291
Oh Kyung-sook.

229
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,421
"She was born in 1976,
has a law degree from Hanmin University,

230
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,798
and passed the 47th bar exam."

231
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,717
"Labor rights lawyer."

232
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,344
"The head of the Female
Laborers Representatives."

233
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,805
"Councilor of
the 18th Seoul City Council."

234
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:59,059
"Nickname: Mad Rhino, Game Cock."

235
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,396
Respected members of the council.

236
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,939
OCTOBER 18, 2015
STATE AUDIT

237
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:08,777
Do you know the average size
of a break room for workers in Korea?

238
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,281
It's 0.3 pyeong.
You can't fathom that, can you?

239
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,074
TEN TIMES FASTER

240
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,411
MAD RHINO IN ACTION

241
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,829
COUNCILOR OH KYUNG-SOOK'S DEMO

242
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,206
This is definitely
a human rights violation.

243
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,708
NOVEMBER 03, 2017
STATE AUDIT

244
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,501
Teenage girls in need use

245
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,212
these unsanitary insoles
instead of tampons and pads.

246
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,797
During their periods,

247
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,800
women suffer from severe pain
and discomfort--

248
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,177
Hey, excuse me.

249
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,845
CHOI CHEOL-GI
SEOUL CITY COUNCILOR

250
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,180
With all due respect,

251
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,640
aren't you old enough
to have reached menopause?

252
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,976
To discuss such pain,

253
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,978
in my humble opinion…

254
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:43,937
BOILING WITH ANGER

255
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,024
…your body has already
lost its female aspect--

256
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,525
Councilor Choi Cheol-gi.

257
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,778
As we speak, your statement

258
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:54,531
is being streamed live on social media.

259
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,242
I already see the comments.
Should I read them?

260
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,537
"Wow, Choi Cheol-gi.
You're an obnoxious, sick pervert."

261
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,705
"Pervert"?

262
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,332
Not just a pervert.

263
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,084
"A sick pervert." Let me show you.

264
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,502
Yes, it's right here.

265
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,296
Read it yourself. "Choi Cheol-gi."

266
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,924
"You're a sick pervert."

267
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,134
"Asshole."

268
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:17,930
Hey!

269
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,056
What?

270
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,767
What's that? Move your damn finger.

271
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,936
Move it!

272
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,192
-Call an ambulance.
-Hurry!

273
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,117
Deliver this to the labor union.

274
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,203
Make sure this she-devil
doesn't get near Ms. Eun.

275
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,204
Yes, ma'am.

276
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,554
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,448
Hello. Have you eaten?

278
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,869
Yes, I have. Thank you for asking.

279
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,122
You did well today.

280
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,168
If it weren't for you,
it could've been a disaster.

281
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,336
I'm flattered.

282
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,054
Don't you need a new car?

283
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:46,268
I'm going to visit the new duty-free shop
to see the progress in a few days.

284
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,521
-You should pick me up.
-Thank you.

285
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,940
Get me some clean water.

286
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,328
Ms. Son, you must feel reassured

287
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,123
having a smart girl like her at your side.

288
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,376
Well, even a mutt who ate anything
and pooped everywhere

289
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,338
thinks it's got class
once we let it run around in the house.

290
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,259
She had some class
even when I first found her.

291
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,971
Don't fully trust her.

292
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,599
A mutt is a mutt by nature.

293
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,562
2008 EUNSUNG GROUP
NEW RECRUITS ORIENTATION

294
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,026
HWANG DO-HEE

295
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,496
Thank you.

296
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:31,957
Ms. Hwang Do-hee.

297
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,599
Ms. Son got me the same scarf.

298
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,312
Because you were exactly
what she was looking for.

299
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,317
Someone who'd do anything
to prove their loyalty.

300
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,861
She was impressed.

301
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,655
I just did

302
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,366
what I had to do.

303
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,246
Your audacious actions

304
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,625
have brought you an opportunity
in the form of this scarf.

305
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,211
You didn't attend a top-three university.

306
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,298
You're not a prodigy
of the Eunsung Scholarship Foundation.

307
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,216
You have no connection
to company executives.

308
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,719
You're basically a nobody
with no presence,

309
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,637
but you'll serve the owner's family.

310
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,105
I'm serving the owner's family?

311
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,441
You must be thrilled.

312
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,485
I was too.

313
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:45,572
Being singled out by the owner's family
makes you feel successful.

314
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,450
And you expect your life, your status,
and your social network

315
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,410
to improve as well.

316
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,291
Am I wrong?

317
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,128
It depends.

318
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,966
You've worked your ass off
to get where you are now.

319
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,345
Give 100%, and don't be afraid
of Eunsung's owners abandoning you.

320
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,404
Don't fully trust her.

321
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,656
A mutt is a mutt by nature.

322
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,968
Director Baek Jae-min
of the Greenpeople Foundation,

323
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:52,848
and the husband of Eun Chae-ryoung,
has hurried back to Korea this morning.

324
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:56,601
Director Baek has been helping people
through his non-profit foundation,

325
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,521
and people are wondering
how Director Baek feels

326
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,358
about the prosecution's investigation
of his wife, Ms. Eun Chae-ryoung.

327
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,570
Welcome back. Everything's ready
for the press conference.

328
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:07,988
Thank you.

329
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,786
I apologize to all those
invested in the Eunsung Group

330
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,789
who must be deeply disappointed,

331
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:21,877
and fellow citizens
who are offended by this incident.

332
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,380
I offer you my most sincere apology.

333
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,799
To be honest, to this point,

334
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,510
I thought it was my duty as a husband

335
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,598
to admire her ability
and give her the support she needed

336
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,933
instead of getting involved
in her business.

337
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,311
I thought

338
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,063
I was being considerate,

339
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,817
but I was actually being incompetent.

340
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,991
From this moment on, instead of
turning a blind eye to the situation,

341
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,243
I'll do everything I can

342
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,913
to resolve this,

343
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,166
along with my wife.

344
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,544
My sincere apologies.

345
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,058
You handled it well.

346
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,018
Please stop.

347
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,271
You handle this type of thing
all the time.

348
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,608
I know my family members
can be quite a handful.

349
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,362
How's Chae-ryoung?

350
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,113
She'll be out soon.

351
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,158
While all eyes are on you,

352
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,953
the prosecution will drop
the charges quietly

353
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,913
and even escort her out.

354
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,416
It must've been a hard night for her.

355
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,752
She can't sleep a wink in a new place.

356
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,754
First off,

357
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,715
put all the media's attention on me.

358
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,301
Protect Chae-ryoung at all costs.

359
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,305
Understood.

360
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,438
Gosh.

361
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,067
You're on your way to Ms. Son's.

362
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,281
I should smarten myself up with a tie.

363
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,824
She thinks

364
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,660
that a man without a tie

365
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,288
or a woman without stockings

366
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,165
is the same as being naked in public.

367
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,544
You're missing a cuff link.

368
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,255
Christ, you're right.

369
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,507
Why didn't you check?

370
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,260
Oh…

371
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,763
Please. I'm the slob here.

372
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,432
This is so uncomfortable.

373
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,059
-It's fine.
-I'm sorry.

374
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,978
Where did it go?

375
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,606
Is it in my bag?

376
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,044
What happened to your handsome face?

377
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,670
You look terrible.

378
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,880
Don't worry about me.

379
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,134
I feel terrible.

380
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,888
Chae-ryoung's suffering,
but I can't do anything for her.

381
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,642
You need to focus on something bigger.
Don't waste your energy.

382
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,311
-Let's eat.
-Yes, ma'am.

383
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:38,531
I heard that the White House sent
quite a few people to the forum.

384
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:42,535
Yes, one of them was the advisor
for East Asian Affairs.

385
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:46,122
He was a Stanford alumnus,
so we discussed many issues.

386
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,459
Really? That's good.

387
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,961
It's not his money he's spending.

388
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,385
Listen.

389
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,430
This is the first time he's eaten
with us in three months.

390
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,100
Do you have to bring that dog
to the table?

391
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,228
Mom, she's a dog with superpowers.

392
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,272
She's been picking out those jerks

393
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,233
who approach us to mooch off of you.

394
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,029
See?

395
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,532
She's been barking at him
for seven years non-stop.

396
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,785
Mary Poppins, sic 'em.

397
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,957
I'm sure you already know,

398
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,377
but the only person in this family
that I can rely on

399
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,171
is you, Jae-min.

400
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:41,845
Who else would even try to fix
Chae-ryoung's bad temper?

401
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,556
He's not fixing it. He puts up with it.

402
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,601
That way, he can use your money
for these so-called good causes

403
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,187
and travel all over the world
feeling important.

404
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,733
I feel sorry
for my poor little sister Chae-ryoung.

405
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,946
Director Eun will be here shortly.

406
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,751
I'm sorry I couldn't pick you up.
The prosecution told me not to.

407
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,761
Honey.

408
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,846
You poor thing--

409
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,140
You apologized to the public?

410
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:29,392
You even bowed to those fucking reporters?

411
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,351
Chae-ryoung!

412
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,312
What does that make me?

413
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,148
"I'm a gentle and decent human being,

414
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,734
and it's killing me
to live with such a crazy bitch."

415
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,527
You wanted to defend yourself.

416
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,571
-That's not it.
-That's exactly it.

417
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,699
You admitted that I'm a lunatic,
you bastard!

418
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,867
Don't lie to me.

419
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,787
How dare you lie to me?
You worthless shit!

420
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,704
Huh?

421
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,752
Stop lying to me. How dare you…

422
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,548
-Ms. Eun.
-Ms. Eun.

423
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,384
Get an oxygen mask, and call a doctor.

424
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,220
Hello?

425
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,105
Ms. Eun.

426
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,328
Luckily, the cut isn't too deep.

427
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,291
Ms. Hwang.

428
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,211
It's so unfair, isn't it?

429
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,174
You've been through a lot worse than this.

430
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,386
Right. It's been like this all along.

431
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,139
In seven years living with Chae-ryoung,

432
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,142
we've never had a proper conversation.

433
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,939
When she vents at me, I just take it.

434
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,861
I'm not even done processing it,

435
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:07,156
and she throws another tantrum,
and I have to take it again.

436
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:13,788
You've managed to pace yourself
and haven't gone off the deep end.

437
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,293
If it weren't for you,

438
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,296
I wouldn't have made it.

439
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,092
Actually, it goes both ways.

440
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,677
Right.

441
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,013
Anyhow,

442
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,182
of all the outsiders
involved in this family,

443
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:34,767
you and I are the only ones

444
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,312
who are still here.

445
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,397
Let's keep it that way

446
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,191
for a long time.

447
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,615
Ms. Son is leaving for work.

448
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,789
Okay.

449
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,049
Ms. Eun has gone home.

450
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,843
Don't worry about her.

451
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,014
Make sure
that Jae-min's face heals nicely.

452
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,184
The store's anniversary event
is just days away.

453
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,644
If he shows up with a scar,

454
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,896
it would be embarrassing.

455
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:21,940
I understand.

456
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,362
The media will try to stain
Jae-min's reputation

457
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,490
with Chae-ryoung's issues.

458
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,411
I picked the reporters
who are on our side.

459
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,164
Mr. Baek has maintained a good reputation,

460
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,999
and the media likes him.

461
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,877
Despite Ms. Eun's scandal,

462
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,213
they'll write positive articles about him.

463
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,052
I know.

464
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,435
Seven.

465
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,982
Eight.

466
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,120
RHINO

467
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,249
Over here!

468
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,001
CHEER UP, MS. RHINO!

469
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,795
Gotcha! Gosh!

470
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,012
Ramyeon.

471
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:35,930
Portable battery.

472
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:37,932
Water!

473
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,937
Thank you.

474
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,983
Thank you, everyone.

475
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,577
How do you feel?

476
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,709
You're on the top floor
of Asia's biggest duty-free shop.

477
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,046
The view is amazing, no doubt.

478
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,299
When I come up here,

479
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,177
I feel like I can recreate the world

480
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:18,056
and all of Seoul city
is crawling under my feet.

481
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,395
I greased the mayor's palm
to get this building going.

482
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,400
I know you worked so hard.

483
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:35,406
The mayor also agreed to give us
the Sangah District Redevelopment Project.

484
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,245
That ungrateful prick asked me

485
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,165
for his share of the Sangah District.

486
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,336
He wants me to split the land
and give 20% to him.

487
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,006
Crazy bastard.

488
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,635
Should I talk to him?

489
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,932
Don't waste your time
on that ungrateful beast.

490
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,267
If I want to,

491
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,895
I can drag him down anytime.

492
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,355
But

493
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,527
if you get rid of him
without a replacement, it could hurt you.

494
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,529
We don't need a replacement.

495
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,282
We have Jae-min.

496
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,077
Mr. Baek?

497
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,583
If the mayor was a family member,
things would be a lot easier.

498
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,463
There's nothing I can't do
in this tiny land.

499
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:38,386
What do you have in mind?

500
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,724
Do-hee, I need you.

501
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:49,981
Work hard until we take down the mayor
and get Jae-min nominated as a candidate.

502
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,401
When that's done,

503
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,821
you can take a break
and do whatever you want.

504
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,739
How about a year off?

505
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,080
I'll think it over.

506
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,636
Breaking news.
A large group of people are protesting

507
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,389
in front of the Eunsung Department Store.

508
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:28,060
They're asking for the decision to lay off
female part-time workers to be reversed.

509
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,730
What's with this insolence?

510
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,858
I'm sorry. I'll deal with it immediately.

511
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,697
Women's organizations,

512
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,534
citizens' alliances, workers' coalitions,
and a number of people have gathered

513
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,913
in front of the department store,
causing traffic congestion.

514
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,040
They're demanding the reinstatement

515
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,084
of the laid-off female workers
from the department store.

516
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,503
They're also supporting
Attorney Oh Kyung-sook.

517
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,714
Female workers, rise!

518
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,467
Hello, my dear subscribers.

519
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,135
It's so good to see you.

520
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,513
Yes, this is a YouTube Channel
for women who take action,

521
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,767
Oh Kyung-sook's Woman Power.

522
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,646
Yes, I'm Oh Kyung-sook,
and I'm still alive.

523
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,274
I'm not dead yet,
and I'm not dying anytime soon.

524
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,234
That's right.

525
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,239
Guys, do you see this shoe?

526
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,951
A pair of these shoes costs a lot more

527
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:28,246
than the monthly income of a part-timer.

528
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,872
They're designer brand shoes.

529
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,458
Do you know who wears

530
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,335
these luxurious shoes?

531
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,629
Her name is Hwang Do-hee.

532
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,422
This woman, Hwang Do-hee,

533
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:43,552
takes care
of all the Eun family's corruption.

534
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,013
Is she just a toilet
for the Eun family to dump in?

535
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,935
I'm going to call her
Toilet Hwang from this moment on.

536
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,353
We're--

537
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,358
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,193
What's gotten into IBC?

539
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,779
Why is this lunatic live on air?

540
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,156
I think it's payback
for canceling our commercials.

541
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,076
-Director Ham, that jerk.
-What should we do?

542
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,830
They said if we don't give the ads back,
they'll fly a drone over the store and--

543
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,999
-Give them back. Twice as many slots.
-Pardon?

544
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,752
But if this news is still on the air
by the time I get there,

545
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,212
the deal's off.

546
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,381
I'm 100 meters away.

547
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,365
Ms. Hwang!

548
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,411
This is the company's union negotiator.

549
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,079
Are you out of your mind?

550
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,165
The anniversary event
is less than three days away.

551
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,834
How could you let that get news coverage?

552
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,587
-Drag her down.
-Ms. Hwang.

553
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,297
We've tried everything we could.

554
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,342
She said she'd jump
if we don't reinstate the workers.

555
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,634
Tell her to jump.

556
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,137
If she actually jumps, by chance,
things will get out of hand.

557
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,222
That Oh Kyung-sook woman
is a complete lunatic.

558
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,891
Oh! Cinderella Lady.

559
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,143
You got here quickly.
You want your shoe back?

560
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,188
See? I told you that you'd regret it.

561
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,315
That's not cute. Stop it immediately.

562
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:22,109
If you make things complicated,
it'll be your loss.

563
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,903
Why is it our loss?

564
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,155
The entire nation is watching us.

565
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,616
This is a huge pub--

566
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,951
Seven hundred thousand viewers!

567
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,382
Wow! How long has it been?

568
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,553
This is amazing.

569
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,639
Hi, guys.

570
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,226
Ramyeon is the best.

571
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,019
It sure is, guys.

572
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,397
Wow! This hits the spot.

573
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,195
Okay.

574
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,491
By the way, I scarfed it down,

575
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,534
and I feel…

576
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:14,453
Yes, I'm a human,
and I can't resist the call of nature.

577
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:18,499
I'll take a short break
and be back with Part 2.

578
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,128
You're watching
Oh Kyung-sook's Woman Power.

579
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,424
My tummy…

580
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,681
Darn, it hurts.

581
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,445
You're quite a performer.

582
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,281
I can see you clenching
your butt cheeks from here,

583
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,657
yet you gave them a preview?

584
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:03,586
Oh my! Look who's here. Hello.

585
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,088
You're A-Toilet Hwang, right?

586
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,341
I'm Attorney Oh Kyung-sook,
AKA Attorney Oh.

587
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,636
You're also known
as the Eun Family's go-to gal

588
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,263
AKA, Toilet Hwang.

589
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,186
Ms. Oh Kyung-sook.

590
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,647
Do you know
how many charges you're facing?

591
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:27,735
Obstruction of business,
unlawful occupation,

592
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,696
making threats, blackmail,
violation of anti-protest acts.

593
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,742
I'm all for workers' and women's rights,

594
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,453
but you have to abide by the law.
You're an attorney.

595
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,707
Hey, Toilet Hwang.
You want to tell a lawyer

596
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,337
how the law works, huh?

597
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,839
You know what?

598
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:52,885
Let me list your illegal activities
one by one. Okay?

599
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,802
First.

600
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,723
You violated the Labor Standards Law
by laying off your employees.

601
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,682
Second.

602
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:03,103
You violated their right
to demonstrate freely.

603
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,315
Third, you violated the antidiscrimination
law against laborers

604
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,359
and threatened your workers--

605
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,779
You're smarter than I thought.
I should offer you a job.

606
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:16,659
By the way, why do you live like this?

607
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,204
You really think
the Eun family will appreciate you

608
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,249
if you loyally devote yourself
to the company, Toilet Hwang?

609
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,584
That's not how things work.

610
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:30,464
Wait. Are you playing a naive girl
so that the Eun family will like you?

611
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,091
Stop putting on a show.

612
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,387
You're the one
who's putting on a show here.

613
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:40,391
You want to make a name for yourself
and to be reelected in the next election.

614
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,689
Until the next election,
we'll give you ten million won a month

615
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:50,234
and 300 million to your district
to help you save face.

616
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,612
A library and a sports center
could guarantee you a spot

617
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:56,073
in the National Assembly
in the next election.

618
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,575
I'll make it happen.

619
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,124
Well, I say, Ms. Hwang.

620
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,085
Now we're getting somewhere.

621
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,254
You didn't know what I wanted

622
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,339
and started spewing verbal diarrhea.

623
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,968
I was a little worried for a second. Gosh.

624
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,433
Is this the reaction you wanted?

625
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,730
Stop bullshitting me.

626
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,857
Who do you think I am?

627
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,818
Someone who'd fall for any old crap
that comes out of your trap?

628
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,280
Then why are you doing this?

629
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,409
To make a better world.

630
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:45,289
A better world where a bitch like you
can't get ahead, got it?

631
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,754
Every night you spend on this rooftop
will cost you 5.8 million won in fines.

632
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,673
That's exactly 458,200,000 won as of now.

633
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,511
If we file a lawsuit,
you won't be protected.

634
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,805
Even worse,
you'll end up hurting the union.

635
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,434
Because they brought in an outsider
and obstructed business.

636
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,735
What a load of crap.

637
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:18,405
Fuck off!

638
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:21,909
My tummy.

639
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,835
Ms. Oh Kyung-sook.

640
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:35,089
The longer you fight, the more you lose.
Stop being stubborn.

641
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,049
-The reality is--
-For crying out loud!

642
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,094
The reality, my ass. Hey!

643
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,596
Reality?

644
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,556
This is your reality.

645
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:54,108
Next, on choosing the general maintenance
contractor for the duty-free shop.

646
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,275
The HR Department

647
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,570
will give public notice of a bid
on January 14, 2023.

648
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,281
The Planning Department has already
chosen two or three candidates

649
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,449
and contacted them.

650
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,493
What about the store's anniversary event?

651
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,454
It's all set, and they're rehearsing
at the Gyeonggi Branch as we speak.

652
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,540
The press release about Ms. Eun?

653
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,457
As you instructed,

654
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,377
it'll go out when we host
the opening event for the food section.

655
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,839
-How many?
-Across TV, print and online media, 26.

656
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,967
-Pay extra attention to online media.
-Yes. On it.

657
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,677
What about IBC?

658
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,430
We'll meet Director Ham
to discuss extra ads tomorrow.

659
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,348
Was the director of news fired?

660
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,059
Sorry. We haven't gone that far.

661
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,147
We're not just giving away commercials
after what they've done to us.

662
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,941
Tell Director Ham.

663
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,862
If he wants our money
and to keep his position,

664
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,572
he should give us his right arm.

665
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,198
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,125
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes, ma'am.

667
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,880
Drag her down from the rooftop.
Use Ms. Son's method.

668
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,049
But that's not the method you approve of.

669
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,676
Do you have a better idea?

670
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,180
The anniversary event is soon.
I have no time to be civil with her.

671
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,476
She's a mad dog,
and the only thing she knows is to bite.

672
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,562
I understand, but if anything goes wrong--

673
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,981
Be extra careful with security

674
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,234
until the moment you drag her down.

675
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,028
Yes, ma'am.

676
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:00,067
DIRECTOR BAEK JAE-MIN:
CAN WE CHAT?

677
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,054
The traffic was heavy.

678
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,097
Hey.

679
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,058
I'm sorry.

680
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,854
I know you have a lot on your plate
without me bothering you.

681
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,771
It's okay.

682
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,403
I started without you.

683
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,906
It's too early to go home.

684
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,869
I don't think I can sleep if I'm sober.

685
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,167
Drinking alone can be dangerous
on a day like this.

686
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,545
With spiraling thoughts,

687
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,339
you'll lose control.

688
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:07,843
I know.

689
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:19,396
Did you want to discuss something?

690
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,357
Ms. Hwang.

691
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,528
You know…

692
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,368
I think I'm being blackmailed.

693
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,382
SECRETARY HAN I-SEUL

694
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,227
Mr. Baek.

695
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,730
Your speech was excellent today.

696
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,192
It still lingers in my heart so strongly.

697
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:08,320
I don't think I can sleep tonight.

698
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,948
Would you go for a walk with me?

699
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,711
Do you have any cup noodles laying around?

700
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,006
It was a formal occasion,
and I didn't eat much for dinner.

701
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,342
Sure. I'll bring some right over.

702
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:42,980
Mr. Baek.

703
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:46,358
Can I come to your room
later this evening?

704
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,200
Mr. Baek.

705
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,995
I'm at your door.

706
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:17,639
I-seul.

707
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,268
You don't need to accompany me anymore.

708
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,064
I don't want to change roles.

709
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,358
I want to keep accompanying you.

710
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,407
I feel so humiliated as a woman right now

711
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,659
that I can't even breathe.

712
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,164
You'll pay the price for rejecting me.

713
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:47,210
I'll Me-too you when I get back to Seoul

714
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:50,047
and tell them

715
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,008
that you sexually assaulted me.

716
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,562
Which part is a fact,

717
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,940
and which is a threat?

718
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,486
For a short period…

719
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,449
I gave her my heart. I'll admit that.

720
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,872
Giving your heart can be more cruel
than the physical act of sex.

721
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,086
I know

722
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,338
that you're disappointed in me.

723
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:37,677
Mr. Baek.

724
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,096
But…

725
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,099
this is so unfair.

726
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,187
You know what
I've had to put up with all this time.

727
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,439
Sexual assault?

728
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,818
Isn't it too harsh a punishment

729
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,904
for giving her my heart?

730
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,750
You didn't cross the line, did you?

731
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,379
No.

732
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,715
I swear on my daughters' lives.

733
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,240
Get up.

734
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,370
Don't waste your time
when it wasn't even a one-night stand.

735
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,295
If you have nothing more to say,
I'll excuse myself.

736
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,046
I've got work to do.

737
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,424
Thank you.

738
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,261
For trusting me.

739
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,046
Have some tea.

740
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,475
Sorry about nagging you yesterday.

741
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,979
I heard that you did a great job
on this trip.

742
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,232
I forgot to mention that.

743
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:56,858
It's okay, ma'am.

744
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,986
Thank you for your kind words.

745
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,864
Is everything okay?

746
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:11,873
I'm asking you as a fellow woman,
not as your boss.

747
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,626
Is there anything I can help you with?

748
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,726
Is it about Mr. Baek?

749
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,912
Did he do it against your will?

750
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,166
He wanted some cup noodles,
so I brought them to his room.

751
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,796
He threw me on the bed…

752
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,012
Pull yourself together.

753
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,807
Think of your mother.

754
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:17,022
She must've gone through a lot
to raise three children on her own.

755
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,442
I'm sure it hasn't been easy for you.

756
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,238
You had to pay
expensive university tuition

757
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,200
while working part-time to pay the bills.

758
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,455
Yet you got into this company

759
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,707
without anyone's help.

760
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,918
I'm so proud of you. Better yet,

761
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:42,088
I respect you, as a fellow woman.

762
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,225
But from this moment on,

763
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:59,064
I'll talk to you as your boss.

764
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,869
SECRETARY HAN I-SEUL

765
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,289
This…

766
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,041
It wasn't me.

767
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,003
Are you saying
these texts were fabricated?

768
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,340
Your name, phone number,
and the times you sent them are all here.

769
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,718
No, I didn't send any of these.

770
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,262
-I was the victim.
-Did you work at a hostess bar?

771
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,353
#TALKINGBAR

772
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,941
How did you find this?

773
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,568
I stayed up all night
doing my homework on you.

774
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,571
I was curious

775
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,533
where you got the guts
to threaten Mr. Baek.

776
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:52,992
And…

777
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,079
I found my answer.

778
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,623
You were a girl

779
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,877
who took advantage of men
using your pretty body.

780
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,878
No.

781
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,047
I worked there during breaks

782
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,258
to earn college tuition.

783
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,886
And it was just a regular bar.

784
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,181
Let's say all you did was smile at guys.

785
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,854
With the money you made
serving men at a hostess bar,

786
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:24,899
you got a degree from a prestigious school
and landed a job at Eunsung.

787
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,986
And now you're accusing Mr. Baek Jae-min,

788
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:32,365
Eun Chae-ryoung's husband,
of sexually assaulting you.

789
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:37,036
If this story gets out,
do you think people will believe you?

790
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,955
I have no intention of exposing it.

791
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,208
-I don't have the courage.
-Of course not.

792
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,003
You made all this up to blackmail him.

793
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,130
You just admitted it yourself.

794
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,681
Resign.

795
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,267
Then I'll let it slide.

796
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,404
You need your severance pay
to support your mother, right?

797
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,822
Ms. Hwang!

798
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:17,327
Do you want me to expose this story
and take legal action?

799
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,580
False accusations, blackmail,
your past work in a hostess bar.

800
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,753
Can you handle it?

801
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,221
I won't raise an issue

802
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,390
about what happened abroad.

803
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,769
I'll leave it in the past…

804
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,733
and pretend that I'm a dead woman.

805
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,777
You don't need to pretend.

806
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,614
You are now dead

807
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,950
to this company.

808
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,911
Pack your things by the end of the day.

809
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,557
Ji-yeon.

810
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,474
I'm sorry.

811
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,685
I have a meeting.

812
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,905
This is the material you asked for
about getting rid of Mayor Sa.

813
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:49,502
Did you find all the dirt
on Mayor Sa Jae-gon?

814
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,503
Yes, ma'am.

815
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,297
What about his family?

816
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,631
Working on it.

817
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,676
There are lots of rumors about his wife.
I'll crosscheck the facts.

818
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,928
Let me decide
what are facts and what aren't.

819
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,513
Gather as much intel as possible.

820
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:02,015
Yes, ma'am.

821
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,854
By the way, Ms. Hwang.

822
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:09,981
About I-seul…

823
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:32,670
Yes, ma'am.

824
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,256
Yes. I'm on my way.

825
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,261
Get the car ready.

826
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,688
MS. HWANG DO-HEE, THIS IS HAN I-SEUL

827
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,055
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS

828
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,598
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS
