1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:16,599
Excuse me. Hold on.

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,559
What's this?

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,519
I'm sorry, but visitors aren't allowed.

4
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,479
We rented the entire second floor.

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,314
-For security reasons--
-Whatever.

6
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,191
Did you get Ms. Kim Hwa-soo's consent?

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,359
This area is--

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,694
-Move.
-This is restricted.

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,487
-You can't come in.
-I said, move!

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,364
-You can't come in!
-Hey!

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,282
Let go!

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,034
You can't come in.

13
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,163
Divided, we die

14
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:42,000
To waver is to die

15
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:45,295
We go forth as one

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,049
Until the day of victory

17
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:51,384
I will keep the promises

18
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,261
I made to my comrades

19
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,848
Even if my skull is split in half

20
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,477
United under the union's flag

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,147
We overcame the violence of the thugs

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,692
United through strikes and fights

23
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,071
We will go forth
Under the flag of liberation

24
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,950
To waver is to die

25
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:19,120
We go forth as one

26
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,373
Until the day of victory

27
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,131
Even if my skull is split in half

28
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,259
United under the union's flag

29
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,097
We overcame the violence of the thugs

30
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:42,268
United through strikes and fights

31
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,855
We will go forth
Under the flag of liberation

32
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,068
Even if my skull is split in half

33
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,613
United under the union's flag

34
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,574
We've got each other's back

35
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:01,746
To waver is to die

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,166
We go forth as one

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:45,498
Brave fighters who fought for the cause

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,422
We shall survive in the end

39
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,428
Workers with one heart

40
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,683
Ms. Oh, you should stop.

41
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,897
Hwa-soo must be scared.

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,526
Hearing my voice might comfort her--

43
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,861
I believe

44
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,281
Do-hee needs your voice as well right now.

45
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,564
What were you thinking, huh?

46
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,360
Come on, are we strangers to you?

47
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,156
How could you go through this alone?

48
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,867
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,623
Don't be.

50
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,669
We got here too late.

51
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,463
We're sorry.

52
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,284
Are you sure it was just an accident?

53
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,036
Huh?

54
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,793
Yes.

55
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,885
Tell me the truth.

56
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,310
Even white lies can become a sin
if you stray…

57
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,980
too far from the truth.

58
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,281
It's nothing like that, so--

59
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,074
Let's not talk

60
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:27,994
about the election

61
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,747
until the funeral is over.

62
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,333
The world won't end

63
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,501
just because we press pause on it.

64
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,427
I thought it would

65
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,388
if I stopped.

66
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,938
That's why I didn't visit my father often.

67
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,733
But you showed him…

68
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,489
you were fiercely pursuing a goal

69
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,867
and on the path to justice, at that.

70
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,791
I'm sure he was proud of you.

71
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,921
He must've thought,
"My precious, darling girl

72
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,049
is living a good life."

73
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,218
"Goodness!"

74
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,387
"She's working so hard

75
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,681
to do the right thing."

76
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,694
You're not alone, okay?

77
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,364
Okay?

78
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,361
Sir, can't you just let me go home?

79
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,322
My husband

80
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,408
is so seriously ill

81
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,828
that he can't feed himself
and has to wear a diaper.

82
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:42,170
Ms. Seo is on her way to see you now.
If you could hang in there--

83
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,337
I did everything

84
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,507
you people told me to do.

85
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,844
I made Oh Kyung-sook
a despicable bitch today.

86
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,014
What more do you want from me?

87
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,731
Sir, I promise never to see
Oh Kyung-sook again.

88
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,276
I won't even look her in the eyes

89
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,529
or say another word to her.

90
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,491
So please just let me go home.

91
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,440
Hwa-soo.

92
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,489
We need to talk.

93
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,040
Are you never going to see me again?

94
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:06,712
Okay, I'm here.
What are you going to do? Huh?

95
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,383
You're a smart attorney.
Are you going to sue me? Go ahead.

96
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,010
Sue me. What did I do wrong?

97
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,472
Do you know what you're doing?

98
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,183
Do you?

99
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,602
What did I do?

100
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,771
Huh?

101
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,189
Hwa-soo,

102
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,733
we made a promise

103
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,612
to rely on each other
when things got tough

104
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,908
and to stick together until the end,
no matter what happened.

105
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,247
We women protect each other as sisters
and make this world a better place.

106
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,124
We promised, didn't we?

107
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,628
But you're breaking that promise right now

108
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,630
with your words.

109
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,425
I had to survive!

110
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,344
I did it because I wanted to survive.
So what?

111
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,054
Hey.

112
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,100
Fine, I went on TV,
caused myself to lose face

113
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:03,936
and I shit all over
the Women's Alliance's reputation.

114
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,063
What about you? Are you that innocent?

115
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,816
You came to us so you could use us.

116
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,235
What are you talking about?

117
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,153
You…

118
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,032
You were the one
who taught us about workers' rights.

119
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,825
We were clueless before!

120
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,994
You taught us about them!

121
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,705
You used feminism on us
and became famous, right?

122
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,082
So that you could get into politics.

123
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,125
Am I wrong?

124
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,879
I know your true colors, so I thought
I'd look out for myself too!

125
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,715
Hwa-soo.

126
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,683
It's cold.

127
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,313
It's so cold today. There.

128
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,984
I know how you feel.

129
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,280
Why are your hands so cold?

130
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,783
You always suffer from frostbite.

131
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,869
Where are your gloves?
Did you lose them again?

132
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,206
Gosh, you're a handful.

133
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,917
I've got more gloves. Take these.

134
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,628
I know where you're coming from,

135
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:12,922
but, Hwa-soo…

136
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,511
Kyung-sook.

137
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,224
Kyung-sook, I used it.

138
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,478
Okay?

139
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,271
I used the money.

140
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,025
Kyung-sook, I used that money.

141
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,781
I used it to pay for Gi-hoon's tuition.

142
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,242
What do I do, Kyung-sook?

143
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,953
I screwed up, didn't I?

144
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,955
Oh God. What should we do?

145
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,456
-What should I do?
-Hwa-soo.

146
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,670
What do we do now, Kyung-sook?
What should I do?

147
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,338
Hwa-soo.

148
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,507
Oh God, Kyung-sook.

149
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,301
I ruined everything for you. What do I do?

150
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,345
Hwa-soo.

151
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,263
Huh?

152
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,723
It's okay.

153
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,016
Kyung-sook, what am I supposed to do?

154
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,934
-Hwa-soo.
-Huh?

155
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,769
It's okay.

156
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,897
As long as you know how I feel,

157
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,733
nothing matters.

158
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,319
It's going to be fine.

159
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,697
Kyung-sook, I've ruined everything.

160
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,366
-No.
-What do we do?

161
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,870
Oh God, what should I do?

162
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,371
Oh no, what have I done?

163
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,290
What do we do, Kyung-sook?

164
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:51,103
HWANG JOO-IL

165
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,987
This was a happy memory for you, Dad.

166
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,963
What do we do now?

167
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,800
Ms. Hwang.

168
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,551
Ms. Hwang.

169
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,261
Are you all right?

170
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,679
Approval ratings?

171
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,139
Sorry?

172
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,352
We dropped to 20%.

173
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,940
We're in for a crushing defeat
if this continues.

174
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,903
No more discouraging words from now on.

175
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,157
Ms. Oh is talking to Ms. Kim Hwa-soo,

176
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,159
so we'll prepare our next plan
around that.

177
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,621
-We'll fight with our transparency.
-I'm all for fighting.

178
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,373
Shall I set up a press conference?

179
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,168
Oh Kyung-sook and Kim Hwa-soo
will appear together.

180
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,004
-Make as much noise as you can.
-Yes, sir!

181
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,507
I'll check the reporters' schedules first.

182
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,634
-Okay, get a list of reporters.
-Yes.

183
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,929
Get the material ready,
and prepare for the press conference.

184
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,409
I'm sorry for being late.

185
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,538
I'm just grateful that you could make it
on such short notice.

186
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,039
Shall we?

187
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,457
Yes.

188
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,672
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

189
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,471
This is a new item
that'll be released this season.

190
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,308
It's not available yet,
but I thought it'd suit you.

191
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,352
My goodness,
that must have been so hard to get.

192
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,064
You've worked so hard to make
your husband the Minister of MOLIT.

193
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,566
You deserve this much.

194
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,692
Goodness.

195
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,153
I don't deserve the credit.

196
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,697
It's all thanks to Chairwoman Son.

197
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,868
I've always known you were a woman
with your head screwed on right.

198
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,710
Goodness.

199
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:28,052
You know that Oh Kyung-sook is stirring up
trouble about Leah Company, right?

200
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:34,141
Mom is worried that she might end up
causing an issue with the permit

201
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,936
that we have for our duty-free shop.

202
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,147
The money we've been sending your husband

203
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,984
all came out of
Leah Company's account as well.

204
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,197
Could you please put in a good word
to the minister for us?

205
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,741
No matter what happens,

206
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,578
he should protect the duty-free shop.

207
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,082
Gorgeous.

208
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,250
It looks great on you.

209
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,395
I appreciate the gesture,
but I cannot accept this.

210
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,271
It's true

211
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,859
that my husband became a minister
thanks to Chairwoman Son,

212
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,654
but you never know what might happen--

213
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,864
So you're afraid that if you take this,

214
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,035
it might become an issue
once Oh Kyung-sook becomes mayor.

215
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,215
Then I'll bring Oh Kyung-sook
to our side too.

216
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,551
Just in case.

217
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,473
Is that even possible?

218
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,686
In the end,
an election is a battle of wealth.

219
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,982
Think noble Oh Kyung-sook
could prevail without money?

220
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,693
Things are getting worse for her.

221
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,243
Since you've understood our intentions,
I'll just take this back with me.

222
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,124
Dig in.

223
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
All right.

224
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,124
Let's sue them.

225
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,751
What?

226
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,838
Wait. You want us

227
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,425
to fight Eunsung Department Store?

228
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,678
I'm not asking you to fight.

229
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,014
I'm saying we should sue them
for wrongful dismissal.

230
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,019
Since this case concerns the head
of Sangah-dong's Women's Society,

231
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,356
I will defend you free of charge.

232
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,820
It's just…
I don't think suing them is necessary.

233
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,574
Actually, our contract expired,

234
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,535
so I think they have
the right to dismiss us.

235
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,121
But it's just that everything happened
so suddenly,

236
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,998
and we can't make ends meet.

237
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,084
We were hoping
we could receive some compensation.

238
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,461
-That would be nice.
-Compensation would be enough.

239
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,630
Why would you ask for compensation

240
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,716
when you should be asking for a salary?

241
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,384
You have no reason to be fired.

242
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,429
Not at all?

243
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,807
What about the backlash we'll get
for going against a big company?

244
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,103
Ladies.

245
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,983
What's even scarier than violence itself

246
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,444
is being tamed to accept that violence.

247
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:01,116
Did you even ask the department store
why you can't become permanent employees?

248
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,286
You should've asked them.

249
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:09,541
You should be the ones
to decide the value of your labor.

250
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,713
But I'm still scared.

251
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,881
-Let's go.
-I'm sorry.

252
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,466
-Let's go.
-It won't work.

253
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,508
Let's do it.

254
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:20,969
Come on.

255
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,432
Everything she said is absolutely right.

256
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:31,688
After 15 years at a construction company,
my husband had an accident

257
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:33,565
and was fired.

258
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,444
They didn't cover his hospital bills
as he was a contract worker.

259
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,491
His life was always unstable
as he was uneducated and poor,

260
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,409
and now he's crippled and bedridden.

261
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,456
I would like to ask them for once

262
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,625
why we can't become permanent employees.

263
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,919
Hwa-soo.

264
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,257
Hey, we've been fired.
We don't have anything else to lose.

265
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,260
Let's work together and give this a go.

266
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,428
Come on.

267
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,390
Ms. Oh. You'll really work for free?

268
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,892
We're all unemployed right now.

269
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,478
Don't worry about that.

270
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:19,278
I promise to look after you
until the very end.

271
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,282
Trust me. Now.

272
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,372
All right. Do you see
your employment contract here?

273
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,541
Let me take it from the top.

274
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,835
The first article…

275
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,600
PRESS CONFERENCE STATEMENT
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME…

276
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,407
OH KYUNG-SOOK

277
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,087
I used to smoke like a chimney.

278
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,842
I went through hell to quit smoking. Jeez.

279
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,802
I just can't help it today.

280
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,014
And why is that?

281
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,641
Do-hee.

282
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,360
Why don't we stop here?

283
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,583
You're giving up on the election?

284
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:00,837
Yes.

285
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,424
Just because of Ms. Kim Hwa-soo?

286
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,808
I'm sorry.

287
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,607
She embezzled the money.

288
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,653
Then she should pay for what she did.

289
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:29,282
Why should you give up the election?

290
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,464
Because I'm the one who made her

291
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,509
take that money.

292
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,391
What?

293
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,984
If it weren't for me,

294
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,946
Hwa-soo could've been much happier,

295
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,074
oblivious to such fights in this world.

296
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,828
She could have led an ordinary life,

297
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,581
but I dragged her into this.

298
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,337
She protested with me,
so she got her job back too late.

299
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,632
And that completely justifies her
stealing the donation money?

300
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,642
Attorney Oh Kyung-sook.

301
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,603
Snap out of it.

302
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,231
Why should you exonerate her at your whim?

303
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,067
You're right.

304
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,905
Everything you said is right.

305
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,201
But still,

306
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,205
I can't bring myself
to hold Hwa-soo accountable.

307
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,334
I can't do that.

308
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,960
What about the others?

309
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,632
They came to you
hoping for a better tomorrow.

310
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:12,260
Will you stomp on those people's happiness
just because of Kim Hwa-soo?

311
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:15,931
Then…

312
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:22,062
is it okay to trample
over the minority's livelihood

313
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,980
for the happiness of the majority?

314
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,570
Oh Kyung-sook.

315
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,324
You're not a philosopher.

316
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:39,329
You're an actual politician who has
an election right around the corner.

317
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,042
Not giving up on even one person…

318
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,464
and protecting the people

319
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,511
who trusted me and followed me…

320
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,724
even if I lose everything.

321
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,775
That's what politics is to me.

322
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,991
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,539
I don't need your apology.

324
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,375
I won't give up on the election.

325
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,696
"Women's Power Drives the World."

326
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,283
Today, we have Candidate Baek Jae-min,
who's running for mayor of Seoul.

327
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,035
-Welcome.
-Hello.

328
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,328
Nice to meet you.

329
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,788
Okay, I have a few questions for you.

330
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,541
What kind of husband are you at home?

331
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,168
That's a pretty scary question

332
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,254
right out of the gate. Okay.

333
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:13,798
Well, it's hard to be a good husband.

334
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,135
Before I decided to start working
for you all,

335
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:22,807
I don't know, I thought I could be
considered a good husband at the time.

336
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,225
But now,

337
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,062
I'm afraid I come up a little short.

338
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,731
Why did you make me come here
just to parade me around?

339
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,484
You should've made up
a plausible reason to decline.

340
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,738
They weren't the ones that invited us.

341
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,115
It was Mr. Baek
who wanted to be on the show.

342
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,660
Those women

343
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,871
used to be ardent supporters
of Oh Kyung-sook.

344
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:49,417
There's a great symbolic significance
to embracing them.

345
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,712
I feel great.

346
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,676
Mr. Baek's becoming
a better showman each day.

347
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,470
Being a good friend
to all the husbands of this country

348
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,097
is my biggest goal right now.

349
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,723
Then we'll stop here

350
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,184
and return after our 60-second ad break.

351
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,602
Yes, see you again soon.

352
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,398
-Mr. Baek.
-Yes, hello.

353
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,315
I'm a huge fan.

354
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,983
You didn't have to. Thank you.

355
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,029
These are ripe persimmons
from my family out in the country.

356
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,533
They're very sweet. You should try one.

357
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,123
The show will resume soon.
Could you return to your seats?

358
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:34,295
Yes, we're here after the ad break.

359
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,463
During the break,

360
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,967
your fans brought you
some ripe persimmons.

361
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,138
Do you not like ripe persimmons, Mr. Baek?

362
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,057
To be honest…

363
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,437
I have trouble eating persimmons.

364
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,771
Well,

365
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,190
to tell you the truth,

366
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,568
I can't stomach them anymore.

367
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,947
Oh, could I ask you why,
if it's not too personal?

368
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,909
When I was young,

369
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,829
we had a huge persimmon tree in our yard.

370
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,706
My father, grandfather, and I

371
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:14,461
would eat ripe persimmons
and leave some for the magpies.

372
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,798
From what I've heard so far,
it sounds like a happy story.

373
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,468
Those years…

374
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,140
were the most perfect time of my life.

375
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,684
But then…

376
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,521
my father passed away

377
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,442
the very day we'd promised
to pick them together.

378
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,998
Dad!

379
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,837
I think that was

380
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,674
when my family began to fall apart.

381
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:02,759
Dad!

382
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,093
We moved out of that house,

383
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,680
practically kicked out,

384
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,226
and my grandfather
passed away from the shock.

385
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:13,478
My mother

386
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,606
developed a mental illness

387
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,317
that she still struggles with.

388
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:23,196
Yeah. I think persimmons…

389
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,867
remind me of my family.

390
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,829
They fill me with nostalgia…

391
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,124
and sorrow…

392
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,129
and I don't know how to swallow them…

393
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,192
Is the press conference ready?

394
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,945
We've set everything up
except Ms. Kim Hwa-soo's consent.

395
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,615
I'll deal with that myself.
Just keep everyone on standby.

396
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,451
-What if Ms. Oh refuses--
-Don't you worry about that!

397
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,203
Whatever she says,

398
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,331
I'll bring Ms. Kim Hwa-soo in
and prove Ms. Oh's innocence!

399
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,147
Why didn't you tell me?

400
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,404
Tell you what?

401
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:33,618
You just said you didn't like them
because of how mushy they are.

402
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,413
Well…

403
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,208
That's…

404
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,671
That's also one of the reasons.

405
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,826
REFORM PARTY OF KOREA'S PRIMARY ELECTION

406
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,163
FOR THE 39TH SEOUL CITY
MAYORAL BY-ELECTION D-1

407
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,958
Take special care today.

408
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,170
This is for the presidential election.

409
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,758
What's wrong?

410
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:15,845
The mayoral election of Seoul is
practically the presidential election.

411
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,181
-You're right.
-You're right.

412
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,106
Kim Hwa-soo

413
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,192
attempted suicide?

414
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,737
Thankfully, she survived,
and she's in recovery.

415
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,411
Joong-seok.

416
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,664
Heaven must be helping me.

417
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,417
What do you mean?

418
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,213
Oh Kyung-sook went to see her yesterday.

419
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,048
Everything fits perfectly.

420
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,969
Oh Kyung-sook forced Kim Hwa-soo
to retract the statement she made.

421
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:01,099
Kim Hwa-soo felt threatened
and drank poison to try to kill herself.

422
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,268
-You got a photo of the two together?
-Ms. Seo.

423
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,647
Someone's on the verge of death.

424
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,317
Just let her die, then.

425
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,736
If she kicks the bucket now,

426
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,572
everything from Oh's embezzlement

427
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,908
to her threatening Hwa-soo
will become facts.

428
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,246
So,

429
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,792
you want to kill two innocent people?

430
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,755
Joong-seok.

431
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,468
Human lives aren't worth a penny
in politics.

432
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,889
Would you give up a game of chess
because you lost a single piece?

433
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,601
Get the car ready.

434
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,813
I should get to the hospital
before Oh Kyung-sook.

435
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,280
How is Ms. Kim Hwa-soo doing?

436
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,658
Luckily, she isn't in critical condition.

437
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,327
She's regaining consciousness as we speak.

438
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,499
Do we know why Ms. Kim attempted suicide?

439
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,626
I suspect that she received some threats

440
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,338
regarding her statement
in the press conference a few days ago.

441
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:23,556
I'm sorry,
but she cannot have visitors right now.

442
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,807
Cut the crap and move.

443
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,392
We're family to the patient.

444
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,811
I said move.

445
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,374
Hwa-soo.

446
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,050
Why did you do it? Why?

447
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,385
This isn't worth dying for.

448
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,016
You've fought so tenaciously to survive.

449
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,978
Why would you die
over something like this?

450
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,733
Hwa-soo.

451
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,694
I told you.

452
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,156
I didn't care

453
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,869
as long as you knew how I felt!

454
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,332
I don't have to become mayor of Seoul.

455
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,168
Do you think

456
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,048
I want to become mayor
seeing you sacrificing your life?

457
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,343
I don't need any of that, you idiot.

458
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,389
I couldn't understand
Oh Kyung-sook before.

459
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,394
It seemed so foolish

460
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:38,274
that she'd pass up an opportunity
because of a nobody like Hwa-soo.

461
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,277
And?

462
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,449
Now I agree with her.

463
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,578
Her stubbornness to protect
that one person…

464
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,958
could be what we need
to make this world a better place.

465
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:02,673
Didn't you have fantasies like that too
when you entered politics?

466
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,304
A fantasy is just that, a fantasy.

467
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,141
A politician who chases impossible ideals…

468
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,854
is just a hypocrite.

469
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,055
Do-hee.

470
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,189
Let's stop.

471
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,360
It all started with my own agenda.

472
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,905
I wanted to have

473
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,283
my revenge on Eunsung's owners.

474
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,789
I wanted to atone
for what I did to I-seul…

475
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,547
so I clung to you, Oh Kyung-sook.

476
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,803
But there was more to it.

477
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,229
I've changed a lot along the way,
haven't I?

478
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,399
Thanks to you,

479
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,236
I have opened my eyes to a new world.

480
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,199
A world where it's natural
to protect the weak.

481
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,704
A world run by common sense
I'd forgotten about

482
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,373
for so long.

483
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,961
I am grateful for even becoming part of…

484
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,592
such a world.

485
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,022
I lost…

486
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,443
this round.

487
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,905
I did.

488
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,118
You did your best to fight.

489
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,704
You fought with all your heart.

490
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,540
Even I-seul would've rooted for you.

491
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:45,461
But we lost.

492
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:51,884
I'm…

493
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,596
really sorry, Do-hee.

494
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,164
But we still had fun, right?

495
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,629
Totally.

496
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,760
I've never met anyone as weird as you,
Hwang Do-hee.

497
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,304
It's been really fun.

498
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,695
Oh Kyung-sook.

499
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,577
You've done well.

500
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,750
Thanks, Do-hee.

501
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,133
Thank you.

502
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,604
THREE HOURS TO THE PRIMARY ELECTION

503
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:30,608
We've received news that Candidate Oh
will soon be holding a press conference.

504
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,694
Inside sources say
Candidate Oh will be withdrawing

505
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,614
from the election to accept
responsibility for the accusations

506
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:40,200
that she was embezzled donations
for Soom, the Women's Alliance.

507
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,749
Everyone.

508
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,210
You've been through so much.

509
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,507
Thanks for giving me,
Oh Kyung-sook the Rhino, a great makeover

510
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,593
and supporting me through the campaign.

511
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,386
Ms. Oh.

512
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,848
Are you really going to give up like this?

513
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,725
Ms. Oh.

514
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,394
We know you're innocent.

515
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,066
Thank you.

516
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,613
I am so grateful

517
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,452
that you had faith in me and helped me
despite all my shortcomings.

518
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,829
I will remember and cherish

519
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:27,915
each of you

520
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,043
and your kindness…

521
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,090
and faith.

522
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,386
And let's all

523
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,138
meet again…

524
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:46,934
in a better world.

525
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:49,103
Everyone.

526
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:51,730
Thank you.

527
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,443
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Ms. Oh.

528
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,862
-Ms. Oh, we love you!
-Be strong, Ms. Oh.

529
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,197
-Keep it up!
-Thank you.

530
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,573
You're the best!

531
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,783
You did great.

532
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,412
Don't cry. We'll see each other again.

533
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,997
Thank you for everything.

534
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,086
-Let's meet again someday!
-Thank you.

535
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,463
You did well.

536
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,048

537
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:25,180
You've got a candidate number.
You really look like a mayoral candidate.

538
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:29,143
Sure, Oh Kyung-sook is finished now.
Let's move on to the main race.

539
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,854
You're right. Let's get right into it.

540
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,648
To the mayor of Seoul!

541
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,442
-To the mayor!
-To the mayor!

542
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,821
-Seo Min-jung!
-Seo Min-jung!

543
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,907
PRESS CONFERENCE
ACCUSATIONS OF EMBEZZLING SOOM DONATIONS

544
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:09,808
THE REFORM PARTY OF KOREA SEOUL MAYORAL
PRELIMINARY CANDIDATE OH KYUNG-SOOK

545
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:21,987
My fellow citizens,

546
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,573
I'm Oh Kyung-sook.

547
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:30,245
The last few weeks
have been truly wonderful,

548
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,164
thanks to your fervent support

549
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,126
and kind words.

550
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,755
However,

551
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:42,049
I stand here today

552
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,302
because I felt

553
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,766
I didn't deserve such happiness anymore.

554
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,477
My fellow citizens.

555
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,938
I, Oh Kyung-sook,

556
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,483
take full responsibility

557
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,361
for the embezzlement of the donations

558
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,363
for the Women's Alliance, Soom,

559
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,033
and announce

560
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,702
that from the 39th Seoul Mayoral--

561
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:14,748
Kim Hwa-soo

562
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,875
attempted suicide?

563
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,753
Thankfully, she survived,
and she's in recovery.

564
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,466
Joong-seok.

565
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,594
Heaven must be helping me.

566
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:29,596
What do you mean?

567
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,433
Oh Kyung-sook went to see her yesterday.

568
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,768
Everything fits perfectly.

569
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,565
Oh Kyung-sook forced Kim Hwa-soo
to retract the statement she made.

570
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:43,986
Kim Hwa-soo felt threatened
and drank poison to try to kill herself.

571
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,906
-You got a photo of the two together?
-Ms. Seo.

572
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,617
Someone's on the verge of death.

573
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,871
Just let her die, then.

574
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,415
If she kicks the bucket now,

575
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,750
everything from Oh's embezzlement

576
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,420
to her threatening Hwa-soo
will become facts.

577
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:06,133
So, you want to kill two innocent people?

578
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:13,056
Ms. Oh, is that recording real?

579
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,225
Did Candidate Seo fabricate all of this?

580
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,728
Ms. Oh, how did you get this file?

581
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,063
Is that Candidate Seo on this recording?

582
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,569
My fellow citizens.

583
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,697
I, Oh Kyung-sook,

584
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,700
will not withdraw

585
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:36,455
no matter what happens!
No, I can't withdraw.

586
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:37,873
I promise

587
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,876
my fellow citizens of Seoul,

588
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,421
here and now, that I shall fight

589
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:46,924
until the very end.

590
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,135
I'm Oh Kyung-sook, the Rhino.

591
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,971
I will march on toward a world

592
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,098
where justice and truth prevail!

593
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,225
I will keep on going.

594
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,522
My fellow citizens,
please continue to watch me.

595
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,400
Did you know about the recording?

596
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,447
Hey! Excuse me! Come on.

597
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,157
What just happened?

598
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,118
I mean, I was in there
adjusting the audio,

599
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,038
and this guy barged in
and pushed me aside…

600
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,123
Dang it. Hey!

601
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,631
What…

602
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,762
Ma Joong-seok.

603
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,391
You bastard.

604
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:23,353
How…

605
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,313
How dare you!

606
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,774
You know the saying.

607
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,945
You lie with a dog and wake up with fleas.

608
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,616
I didn't know it…

609
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,829
but my body was covered in fleas.

610
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,753
You!

611
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,796
You little...

612
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,797
Withdraw.

613
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,178
Before you give fleas
to someone like Oh Kyung-sook.

614
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,921
There are now only 45 days to go
until the 39th Seoul Mayoral Election.

615
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,299
Candidate Oh has been chosen
to represent the Reform Party of Korea

616
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:37,594
following Candidate Seo's withdrawal
after her scandal.

617
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:41,723
We now have four final candidates
running in the election.

618
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,226
The former anchor
who rose to the top from the get-go,

619
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,645
Candidate Baek Jae-min of the KRP,

620
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,898
The Rhino of Justice,
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook of the RPK

621
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:51,775
The elder of Jongno,

622
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,027
Candidate Yook Seung-cheol
of the People's Central Party,

623
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,655
and Candidate Na Jin-guk
of the Patriots' Hope Party.

624
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,073
The fierce race

625
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,742
between the four candidates
with unique careers

626
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,620
is setting Seoul's days and nights
ablaze with passion.

627
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,500
OH KYUNG-SOOK, THE RHINO OF JUSTICE,
FROM THE REFORM PARTY OF KOREA

628
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,669
WILL CHARGE FORWARD
TOWARD A JUST SEOUL

629
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,130
We ended up making it this far.

630
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,426
It feels like a very vivid dream, huh?

631
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,348
I never thought this day would come.

632
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,603
I guess dreams

633
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,189
actually do come true.

634
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,737
I will make those who hurt my people

635
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:42,534
and sullied the time I spent with them

636
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,912
pay for what they did.

637
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:54,296
And

638
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,340
for what they did

639
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,761
to your father.

640
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,560
Dong-joo told me…

641
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,607
that Chairwoman Son Young-sim

642
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,694
came to see you
before your father passed away.

643
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,536
Do-hee.

644
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,707
Let's never stop.

645
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,877
Let's fight until the end

646
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:38,131
and teach them how valuable people's lives

647
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,675
actually are.

648
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,556
Right.

649
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,643
We'll keep going.

650
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,154
I'm going to charge forward, okay?
No brakes.

651
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,573
You okay with that?

652
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,744
That's what I wanted.

653
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:11,790
Deal.

654
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,501
Let's go!

655
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:23,278
Oh Kyung-sook ended up
making it after all.

656
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:28,116
You were sure that would never happen.

657
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,994
My two least favorite things
have happened.

658
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,412
Losing

659
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,707
and being faced with something unexpected.

660
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,335
Right.

661
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,837
Well, even the most seasoned strategist

662
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,173
has trouble predicting everything

663
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,176
that might happen. I understand.

664
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,137
That's just the nature of elections.

665
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:50,555
Fine.

666
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,476
I like your self-confidence,

667
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,480
but from now on,
I'd like you to be more modest

668
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,025
and more meticulous in your support of me.

669
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:08,865
Well, at least we managed to damage
Oh Kyung-sook's reputation for integrity.

670
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:13,578
Integrity is the most valuable virtue
of any candidate.

671
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:15,997
Is that why…

672
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,918
you didn't tell me about Han I-seul?

673
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,254
Didn't I tell you?

674
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,217
You must tell me everything there is
to know about you.

675
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,388
Did Han I-seul die because of you?

676
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,394
That's--

677
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,313
Did she kill herself
because you messed with her?

678
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:43,274
You want to get into politics,

679
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,902
but couldn't even keep
some little chick in check?

680
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,445
On top of that,

681
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,491
you don't even know exactly
how much Hwang Do-hee knows about that.

682
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,661
Do you think you're in a position
to evaluate my performance?

683
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,123
That is no way to treat
a precious helper like me

684
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,333
who entered this race for you.

685
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,086
I'll dig further into Hwang Do-hee.

686
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,046
You should focus on Oh Kyung-sook.

687
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,048
An election is never over…

688
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,383
…until it's over.

689
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,888
From now, we'll be on the offensive,
ignoring all strategies and planning.

690
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,600
Taking down Baek Jae-min
will be our only concern.

691
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,520
Ms. Hwang, where should we start?

692
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,439
People's emotions.

693
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,150
We'll shake up the emotions
of Baek Jae-min's supporters.

694
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:29,654
Just like what he did to us
using Aunt Hwa-soo?

695
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,406
-Just like that?
-What?

696
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,660
Was Baek Jae-min behind Aunt Hwa-soo?
Not the People's Servant?

697
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:39,456
Seo Min-jung received the ball
from Baek Jae-min.

698
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,667
To anger the female voters,
our key supporters.

699
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,295
We'll direct it
at the Korean Republican Party.

700
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,089
Until women's fury

701
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,884
turns into vengeance

702
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,679
and shows Baek Jae-min hell.

703
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,863
Admit what?

704
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,908
Admit

705
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,035
what you did to me.

706
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,330
Ms. Han I-seul.

707
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,832
What are you talking about?

708
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,336
Ms. Hwang told me to resign.

709
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,882
I'm so angry and frustrated,
but there's nothing I can do.

710
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,802
Should I at least get my severance pay,
or should I just kill myself?

711
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:39,307
I've had so many thoughts cross my mind,
but this just isn't right.

712
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,266
And?

713
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,060
The wrongdoer…

714
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,231
should pay for what they did.

715
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:50,777
Yes.

716
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,154
You're right, I-seul.

717
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,451
I admit that I made you feel bad.

718
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,537
Feel…

719
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,623
bad?

720
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,668
I can see why you feel that way.

721
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:12,173
I'll do whatever you want
as a token of my apology,

722
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,967
so ask for anything.

723
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,514
I'll transfer you if you feel uneasy
in your current team.

724
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,351
If you want to see a wider world,
I'll transfer you to our overseas--

725
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,310
Fine.

726
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,691
I'll do as you say.

727
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,906
But on one condition.

728
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,951
Tell the world

729
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,079
what you did

730
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,207
and publicly apologize to me.

731
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,003
Then I'll forgive you.

732
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,463
-Hey, Han I-seul--
-Don't you dare say my name!

733
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,384
Not until I forgive you.

734
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,828
I made sure the CCTV recordings

735
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:09,248
for that day were deleted.

736
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,169
Don't worry.

737
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:26,409
Hello, Angela.

738
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:52,518
Did she swear at you?

739
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,647
I deserve it.

740
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,901
She became an illegal immigrant
because of me.

741
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,407
She was Chae-ryoung's twins' nanny.

742
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,576
To be precise,

743
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,954
she was in charge of nursing them.

744
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,084
It's no mystery why Eun Chae-ryoung
hired a foreign nanny.

745
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:23,174
She needed a young English-speaking woman
who'd work hard for low wages.

746
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:26,344
Angela was perfect in every aspect.

747
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,515
So, why was she fired?

748
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,311
That's all for now.

749
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,814
You've had too much.

750
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,107
Because she spoke Korean to the baby.

751
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,400
You must be full.

752
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,111
That's enough.

753
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:33,411
Eun Chae-ryoung, the wife
of Seoul mayoral candidate Baek,

754
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:37,206
has been accused of illegally hiring
a nanny of foreign nationality.

755
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:42,211
The nanny, Ms. A, confessed
that she was a slave to the Baeks.

756
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,715
Eating, sleeping,
even going to the bathroom.

757
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:49,468
They constantly monitored everything.
We weren't people to them.

758
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,012
THE BAEKS' TRUE COLORS REVEALED

759
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:57,226
USES ONLY OVERSEAS LUXURY ITEMS
BAEK IS PART OF THE EUN FAMILY

760
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,646
#BAEKJAE-MIN #EUNCHAERYOUNG
#LUXURYNURSING

761
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,733
SEOUL MAYORAL BY-ELECTION
APPROVAL RATE POLLING

762
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:07,111
His wife is a slave to money.

763
01:05:08,237 --> 01:05:11,490
She's a horrible monster,
completely incapable of understanding

764
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,869
how ordinary women live.

765
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,582
Could Candidate Baek
have been oblivious to all of this?

766
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,169
And we return from Candidate
Oh Kyung-sook's campaign site.

767
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,922
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook AKA the Rhino
openly criticized

768
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:29,300
the extravagant spending habits
of Baek Jae-min and his wife.

769
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:32,428
Many women's rights activist groups
and online mothers' communities…

770
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:35,056
Why the long faces, everyone?

771
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,267
Has Oh Kyung-sook given
her victory speech?

772
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,772
We have been plummeting in the polls.

773
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,568
And rumors regarding Ms. Eun
are spreading like wildfire online.

774
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:52,031
Their anger against the rich

775
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,577
can be soothed by the promise
of making them rich as well.

776
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,164
This is a fail-proof counterattack

777
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,334
when it comes to elections.

778
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,423
In for a penny, in for a pound.

779
01:06:11,759 --> 01:06:14,595
Could we call
the world we live in now just?

780
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,681
You work tirelessly day and night

781
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:20,059
but still can't buy a house
to afford you stability.

782
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,352
Aren't you sick of it?

783
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,520
So, what?

784
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,522
If you could buy a home,

785
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,316
would you gladly shake hands with Satan?

786
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,612
We must not fall for the sweet lies
that come from the devil's black tongue.

787
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:32,530
You're right.

788
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,534
You are all being lied to.

789
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:40,913
Because they can't do it,
they put a halt to redevelopment

790
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,582
and put forth regulations
by telling you they're unfair.

791
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,793
I, Baek Jae-min, promise you this.

792
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,253
The Eunsung Group's safe!

793
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,463
I will open it.

794
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:50,881
It's not a safe.

795
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,050
It's your gateway to hell.

796
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,220
They're leading you into the sewers
using wealth as bait.

797
01:06:56,303 --> 01:07:00,766
You must not let them deceive you
into the gates of hell, the sewers!

798
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,810
Justice? What is your plan to achieve it?

799
01:07:02,893 --> 01:07:05,354
Are unrealistic ideals like justice
more important

800
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,817
than the dreams of ordinary folks
who only wish to become homeowners?

801
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,152
Dear citizens.

802
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,696
Seoul is still bursting
with lands of opportunity.

803
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:17,616
And I, Baek Jae-min, will make
those opportunities a reality for you!

804
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,869
SOONJUNG DISTRICT REDEVELOPMENT CONFIRMED

805
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:21,787
It's utter nonsense!
They say words can kill!

806
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,330
The dream to own your own homes…

807
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:24,999
…the wholesome dream of Seoul citizens

808
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:25,916
I will

809
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,752
make that dream come true!

810
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:30,046
He is using it
for his political aspirations!

811
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,548
A rich homeowner in Seoul!

812
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:34,592
I'll make that dream come true!

813
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:36,677
Do not let yourself be deceived.

814
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,096
Do not be tempted by lies.

815
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,349
I look forward to the wise decisions
of the citizens of Seoul.

816
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:46,479
Politics for the common people!
I, Oh Kyung-sook, will make it happen.

817
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,942
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

818
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,862
You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!

819
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:56,655
Let go of me!

820
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:07,666
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

821
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,128
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

822
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:08,037
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS, LOCATIONS,
INSTITUTIONS, AND EVENTS

823
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,747
IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS
