1
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,094
Cut the bullshit, you son of a bitch!

2
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,763
My own home? Get rich?

3
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,682
I spent everything I had
just to buy an apartment in this area!

4
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,226
What seedy things did you do
to stop the construction?

5
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,144
Let go!

6
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,190
Let go of me, you bastards!

7
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,107
I said let go!

8
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,111
The Korean Republican Party's
Seoul mayoral candidate Baek Jae-min

9
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,699
was attacked near the Soonjung District
Redevelopment Union Office.

10
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,660
Candidate Baek has been taken
to a nearby emergency room

11
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,287
and is receiving treatment.

12
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,039
Ji-yeon,

13
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,333
go to the office…

14
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,342
Hey.

15
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,303
Are you all right?

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,930
Sorry to shock you.

17
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,559
Don't worry.
I'm lucid enough to recognize you.

18
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,228
Let me see.

19
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,108
Sir, you should lie back down.

20
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,151
You need to get some rest.

21
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,868
Deliver the materials I told you about
to Reporter Kim Beom-seok

22
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,246
and get feedback from the team leader.

23
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,580
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

24
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,375
We are now at the residence of Kang,

25
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,253
the man who assaulted Candidate Baek
with a deadly weapon.

26
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:14,217
As you can see, Kang
was Candidate Oh's loyal supporter.

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:18,513
Kang was revealed
to have served time a few years ago

28
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,391
after attacking the foreman
of the construction site he worked at.

29
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,434
What's even more surprising is

30
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,980
that Candidate Oh Kyung-sook
defended Kang in his trial back then.

31
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,439
Make it look more lurid.

32
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,317
Move Kang Cheol-jin from the back
to the front.

33
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,405
Make this cold-blooded criminal look
as if he's very close to Oh Kyung-sook.

34
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,866
And have this as tomorrow's headline.

35
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,450
"Is she really

36
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,164
the right person to have
as the defender of the Seoul citizens?"

37
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,623
And the details?

38
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,173
"Including murderers, rapists,
drug dealers, and assailants,

39
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,968
all the criminals
who've committed violent crimes in Seoul

40
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,511
support Oh Kyung-sook."

41
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,723
"Therefore, the moment Oh Kyung-sook
becomes mayor,

42
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,185
Seoul will become a hotbed of crime."

43
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,104
They got Mr. Kang too.

44
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,148
Those bastards!

45
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,902
IS OH KYUNG-SOOK
BEHIND THE "BAEK JAE-MIN ATTACK"?

46
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,696
But is it true
he was previously charged with assault?

47
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,492
He did what he had to do.
It was a desperate attempt to survive.

48
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,370
The foreman withheld Mr. Kang's wages
for three months.

49
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,040
Ms. Oh. There's an article
about your resignation.

50
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,002
Those low bastards.

51
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,130
They're launching
an indirect attack on us.

52
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,885
If Baek Jae-min actively tries to smear
Ms. Oh's image or attack her directly,

53
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,137
his own image
will end up taking a hit too.

54
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,808
Ms. Oh.
Why don't we go meet Mr. Kang first?

55
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,228
He's currently being investigated
by the police--

56
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,229
No.

57
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,314
I should meet Baek Jae-min first.

58
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,567
Whether he orchestrated this attack
on himself to get rid of me,

59
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,027
or…

60
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,241
this was just a perfectly-timed
legitimate attack…

61
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,451
We should confirm that first,
shouldn't we?

62
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,328
Huh? Here she comes.

63
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,371
There she is.

64
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:10,166
Ms. Oh, did you order the attack?

65
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,293
Ms. Oh, do you intend to resign?

66
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,711
How about an apology?

67
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,214
I never ordered him to do anything.

68
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,383
And I don't intend to resign either.

69
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,718
As for the incident,

70
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,597
Candidate Baek and I will form
a joint investigation team

71
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,517
to get to the bottom of it.

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,851
Give us a comment, please!

73
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,771
-When will this joint team be formed?
-Any other comments?

74
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,157
It's fine. Give us a moment.

75
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,709
You're hanging on longer than I expected.

76
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,388
Hello, Ms. Oh. To what do I owe the honor?

77
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,766
I had to come. Of course.

78
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,478
As cutthroat a battle as elections are,

79
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,606
a fellow candidate has suffered
a terrible accident,

80
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,693
and it's common courtesy
to visit you in the hospital.

81
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,196
You know, my philosophy in politics

82
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,409
is that people come
before ideology or beliefs.

83
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,493
That's admirable.

84
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,454
I agree.

85
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,081
Regardless of the outcome,

86
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,376
let's work together
to make your philosophy come true.

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,794
But…

88
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,674
it's strange, isn't it?

89
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,012
It's odd that you ended up being attacked

90
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:50,350
as soon as the main race began.

91
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,018
The timing's so perfect

92
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,645
that it just doesn't seem
like a coincidence.

93
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,774
It's almost as if it was planned.

94
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,700
Even Jesus Christ

95
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,662
became the Almighty
the very moment he was crucified.

96
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,956
Excuse me?

97
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,169
Maybe the creator has given me
this chance to become

98
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,257
an important figure like Jesus
so that I may go on to serve this country.

99
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,977
You've made someone who was already
struggling to make ends meet a convict,

100
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,271
and all you can say is

101
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,440
that it's a chance?

102
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,820
I thought you were a human being,

103
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,364
but you're a monster.

104
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,201
I'll become a monster
if that's what this nation wants.

105
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,956
I lost a lot of blood today.

106
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,208
I think I should rest now.

107
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,513
Mr. Baek Jae-min.

108
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,640
All right.

109
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,228
Let's see this fight through to the end.

110
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,399
Even if I have to peel off
your shameless mask,

111
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:27,029
I'll expose how despicable you really are
on the inside to the world.

112
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,366
Get well soon.

113
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,088
Ah, that's good.

114
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,100
Thank you for your hard work.

115
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,354
Nonsense. Mr. Baek should get the credit.

116
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,275
A much more comfortable life awaits you

117
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,738
as long as you stay here and remain quiet
until the election ends.

118
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,785
Candidate Oh's team
has requested to see you.

119
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,538
Show her in.

120
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,456
All right.

121
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,404
You look better than I expected.

122
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,252
My father died in the street like a dog
because of you.

123
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,922
And what did you say?

124
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,176
The sad thing is
that he was only scapegoated

125
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,804
because he was your father.

126
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,224
Of course,
if you had stopped a little earlier,

127
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,810
this tragedy could've been avoided.

128
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,730
Murderer!

129
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,278
You murdered an innocent old man.
How dare you!

130
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,154
The word "murder"

131
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,449
is not appropriate
in the world of politics.

132
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,578
People don't exist.
Only ideals exist in this world.

133
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,458
What?

134
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,211
And…

135
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,923
I didn't kill anyone.

136
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,552
I simply removed an obstacle

137
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,096
that got in the way of my ideals.

138
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:03,978
I'll kill you.

139
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,319
You…

140
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,364
I'll kill you with my own hands.

141
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,743
Listen carefully, Hwang Do-hee.

142
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,496
Due to your own personal vendetta,

143
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,499
you brought Oh Kyung-sook in
to disturb the election…

144
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,629
and made her go up against Chairwoman Son.

145
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,214
Do you think it's going to work out?

146
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,137
We'll wait and see.

147
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,726
You'll see when the moment comes
for me to end your life.

148
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,589
You look terrible.

149
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,429
Look who's talking.

150
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,519
I met

151
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,314
a truly evil man today.

152
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,026
I could've beaten him to death
on the spot.

153
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,197
But I let him live for strategic reasons,

154
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,408
and I'm boiling with rage.

155
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,205
Funny you should say that. Same here.

156
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,418
I met the beast

157
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,420
who killed my father.

158
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,964
But instead of an apology,

159
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,050
he gave me a rubbish lecture on ideals.

160
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,515
Why is this world so full
of these sons of bitches? God.

161
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,145
What should we do, huh?
How should we teach them a lesson?

162
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,274
To give a lesson would be too generous

163
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,026
for trash like them.

164
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,030
Do-hee.

165
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,789
Have you eaten?

166
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,417
What do you want?

167
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:32,835
Tell me.

168
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,797
I'll get you anything you want
tonight, okay?

169
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:43,804
First things first.

170
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,349
Let's deal with those beasts.

171
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,309
After that…

172
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,229
you can buy me a proper drink.

173
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,443
Sure.

174
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,620
Baek Jae-min orchestrated the whole thing?

175
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,998
Seriously. He really is unbelievable.

176
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,503
How crazy is he? He had someone
slash his face to win the election?

177
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,087
I told you,

178
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,465
we're not fighting against a human being.

179
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,508
It means

180
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,720
they don't deserve
even a shred of our compassion.

181
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:29,558
We'll go after Baek Jae-min
without any mercy.

182
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,476
First,

183
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,646
we should go after his personal life.

184
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,856
Everyone knows

185
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,610
he's a notorious womanizer.
It just hasn't been discussed openly.

186
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,113
And we're the best ones
to dig into his personal life.

187
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,367
Cha-sun and I were
in the Corporate Strategy Team,

188
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,827
and you, the Secretary Team.

189
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,246
If we total all the years
we worked for Eunsung,

190
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,122
it would be over 40 years.

191
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,332
If we do some digging,

192
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,085
I'm sure we can find some dirt on him.

193
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,006
Any women
Baek Jae-min was especially close to?

194
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,052
His secretaries, foundation employees,
and female university student volunteers?

195
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,805
His secretary recently killed herself.

196
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,557
That might lead us to something.

197
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,225
I-seul did kill herself.

198
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,520
There isn't any evidence
to suspect otherwise.

199
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,193
Anyway,

200
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,737
let's dig deeper into Baek Jae-min.

201
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,201
SINCE 2015
KIM EUN-HYE, BAR MANAGER

202
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,411
2019 COMPANY WORKSHOP?

203
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,079
WOO HYEON-JI
ASPIRING JOURNALIST

204
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,166
If even one person here
offered to testify…

205
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,795
it would give the others

206
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,131
the courage to come forward too.

207
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,053
SONG YE-NA - ACTRESS
KM MANAGEMENT

208
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:52,808
Ms. Song Ye-na?

209
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,184
Who is this?

210
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,103
Ms. Kim Eun-hye.

211
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,608
We have some questions to ask you
about Candidate Baek Jae-min.

212
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,029
A-yeong, let's talk.

213
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,157
Yoon A-yeong.

214
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,576
A-yeong.

215
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,787
I don't know anything. I don't.

216
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,874
Thank you! I appreciate it!

217
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,252
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

218
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,170
Thank you.

219
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,548
SEOUL, WHERE WOMEN ARE HAPPY AND RESPECTED

220
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,804
I said I don't know anything!

221
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,433
Please, if you could just…

222
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,560
I didn't see anything, so don't bother me.

223
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,071
I promise to devote every resource
and dedicate my sincere heart

224
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,781
to making Seoul a city

225
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,034
where women are happy and respected!

226
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,723
Hello. Thank you.

227
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,641
I hope you win!

228
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,434
She's the head of your fan club.

229
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,186
Oh, thank you for your work.

230
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,029
She's six weeks pregnant.

231
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,615
GUK JI-YEON
PREGNANT, SIX TO NINE WEEKS

232
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,127
Nice to meet you.

233
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,129
I'm always rooting for you. Thank you.

234
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,131
-Thank you.
-Baek Jae-min!

235
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,300
Thank you.

236
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,219
Thank you!

237
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,733
We've contacted every last one of them.

238
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,900
Has anyone replied?

239
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,902
No.

240
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,405
They all say, "Never contact me again."

241
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,781
"It didn't happen to me."

242
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,950
"I'll take legal action if you continue."

243
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,202
Something like that.

244
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,039
Jeez.

245
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,082
Honestly.

246
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,336
This Carl Yoon is a piece of work.

247
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,547
How did he manage to send

248
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,883
all these women into hiding?

249
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:46,231
Thank you for honoring us
with your presence.

250
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,150
Please have a seat.

251
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,781
You have this great vision, Ms. Son.

252
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,657
Being here is our top priority.

253
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,117
Oh, thank you.

254
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,748
What we, the members of Eungyeongwon,
want is a country

255
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,542
run by a grand coalition.

256
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:11,381
There's nothing we want more
than a new leader

257
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,467
who can lead us into a new era of unity,

258
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,637
where political and economic circles,

259
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,515
the judicial system,
and the press work together

260
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,517
to govern the people.

261
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,935
This election will lay out

262
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,938
the groundwork for that coalition.

263
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,444
With the most capable people in Korea
working together,

264
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,406
shall we see where our precious fate

265
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,951
will lead us?

266
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,799
Welcome.

267
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,807
So,

268
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,270
do you see good fortune ahead for us?

269
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,815
Mother…

270
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,615
I see the mother of a king.

271
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,955
The mother of a king?

272
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,055
Are you saying

273
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,725
that my son-in-law

274
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,896
will govern the whole country too?

275
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,232
Spread gold.

276
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,693
If you spread gold,

277
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:59,198
that great energy will come flowing back
to you, ma'am.

278
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,793
Well…

279
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,295
Mr. Yoon.

280
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,132
Do you have any great ideas?

281
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,719
My Lord, our father in heaven!

282
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,891
Our country is mired
in a swamp of desperation.

283
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,478
An ungodly and despicable stench

284
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,941
spreads through Seoul,
the capital of Korea.

285
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,693
But I

286
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,029
will not be swayed.

287
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:40,489
Amen.

288
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,659
-I won't back down.
-Amen.

289
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:49,206
With the blood of Christ,
crucified on the cross,

290
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,500
I was born again.

291
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,043
Amen!

292
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,629
I, Na Jin-guk,

293
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,130
will rebuild

294
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,387
Seoul to become
a city of peace and eternal life!

295
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,847
Hallelujah!

296
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,307
Hallelujah!

297
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,850
Hallelujah!

298
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:09,768
Hallelujah!

299
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,645
Hallelujah!

300
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,272
Hallelujah!

301
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,065
Sir, your prayer

302
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,776
was as passionate as ever.

303
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:22,447
I'm sure you didn't visit me
on this holy day

304
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,533
just to evaluate my prayers.

305
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,494
You should

306
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,038
form a coalition with us.

307
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,839
Do you think
you're the only player in politics

308
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,757
to come to me with such an offer?

309
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,969
There are at least 500,000 members

310
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,347
in the churches I'm in charge of.

311
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:52,811
And I won't sell out those innocent lambs
to just anyone.

312
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,479
Yes. You're right.

313
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,316
If you were to send over

314
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,361
your innocent lambs, whom you
have tended to with love and grace,

315
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,155
you must be justly compensated.

316
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,534
I am not a slave of Mammon!

317
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,162
I am aware of that.

318
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,042
I'm earnestly begging you

319
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,462
to bring the lambs who've fallen
for Mammon's temptation

320
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,131
back to their caring nation.

321
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,804
Eunsung has many plots of land
all over the city

322
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,806
waiting for redevelopment permits.

323
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,642
How wonderful would it be
if Candidate Baek got elected,

324
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,103
redeveloped those areas,

325
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,815
and built the Lord's holy temples
all around the city of Seoul

326
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,567
to welcome the lambs?

327
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,487
Don't you want to accomplish

328
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,572
your dream of building

329
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,616
Asia's largest

330
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,243
vision center?

331
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:56,708
Hallelujah.

332
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,590
Our Lord spoke to me.

333
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,635
I, Na Jin-guk, shall follow his orders

334
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:11,515
and announce that I shall unify in souls
with Candidate Baek Jae-min…

335
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:15,852
The Patriots' Hope Party's Na Jin-guk
announced that he would unify camps

336
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,230
with Baek Jae-min
of the Korean Republican Party.

337
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,192
As a result, Candidate Baek has risen
to over 50% in the polls,

338
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,236
putting him in the lead, unrivaled.

339
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,738
They say an election is as good as over

340
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,199
if the majority supports
a candidate in the polls.

341
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,910
It looks as if this will soon come true.

342
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,162
Baek Jae-min! Baek Jae-min!

343
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,297
Father.

344
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,301
I'm almost there.

345
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:54,433
Those who betrayed you
to rise to where they are.

346
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,185
I will…

347
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,690
bring them all down myself.

348
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,026
Please wait a bit longer

349
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,862
until then.

350
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,534
I'll be back soon.

351
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,678
BAEK JOONG-DO

352
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:54,117
BAEK JOONG-DO

353
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,749
The times have changed, sir.

354
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,504
How could clowns such as myself
survive this cutthroat world of politics

355
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,465
if we didn't follow the beat of the drum?

356
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
Yoon Dae-cheol…

357
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,512
How could you do this to me?

358
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,849
You only have two choices.

359
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,977
You either die like this

360
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,396
or survive

361
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,274
to pass this hell onto your children.

362
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,518
CANDIDATE BAEK TAKES LEAD
BY AN ENORMOUS MARGIN

363
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,770
SEOUL MAYORAL BY-ELECTION
PUBLIC OPINION POLL

364
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,987
He's getting too far ahead.

365
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:17,117
With the coalition,
it won't be easy to catch up to him.

366
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,327
And the PR battle?

367
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,788
Frankly, we're no match for him.

368
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,457
They're moving money with a forklift,

369
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,585
but we've reached the bottom of our funds.

370
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,003
The bottom?

371
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,923
With billboards, signs, flyers,

372
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,634
we need 400 million won
to make offline press materials,

373
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:37,220
a hundred million
for campaign promotion cars,

374
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,599
and another 250 million won
to run an online PR team.

375
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,518
All we have is the funding
we received from the party,

376
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,937
and that won't get us anywhere.

377
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:49,274
It's not like we can start
collecting funds from the citizens now.

378
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,152
Get the car ready.

379
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,779
I'll be taking Ms. Oh
to her evening schedule.

380
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,379
Goodness, Hwang! Come on in, welcome.

381
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,840
Come on, take a seat.

382
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,511
Hello.

383
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,475
Ms. Oh, you know who this is, right?

384
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,644
Chairman Ko Gwang-pil of the Mosun Group.

385
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:29,939
He's a long-time sponsor and supporter
of the Reform Party of Korea.

386
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,943
I heard you were facing difficulties,
Candidate Oh.

387
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:38,323
It seems Chairwoman Son is giving her all
to make her son-in-law mayor.

388
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,241
Oh, don't you worry about them, sir.

389
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:44,537
Hwang Do-hee here used to be
Chairwoman Son's right-hand woman.

390
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,708
So,

391
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,544
why did you want to see us here?

392
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:58,134
Mr. Ko here has promised to offer
your campaign financial and moral support.

393
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:06,893
Candidate Oh!

394
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,770
Sir, I apologize.

395
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,356
Candidate Oh!

396
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,275
Candidate Oh!

397
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,739
How could you be so disrespectful?

398
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,949
Sir.

399
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,619
How could you be so rude
and pull this kind of crap?

400
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,870
What?

401
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,497
You're trying to persuade me

402
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,333
to take money from a conglomerate
for my campaign.

403
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,421
This is coercion to make me accept
illegal campaign funds, isn't it?

404
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,506
Listen, Oh Kyung-sook.

405
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,427
Sir, don't cross the line.
Focus on your goals instead.

406
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,349
Candidate Oh.

407
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,477
Elections are all about money.

408
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:54,107
Baek Jae-min is practically swimming
in the money Eunsung gave him.

409
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,609
-Shouldn't we at least acquire--
-Yes.

410
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,445
You are right, sir.

411
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,114
I'll accept the money.

412
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,031
I'll do it.

413
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,535
But I'll do it fairly and transparently

414
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,581
within the National Election Commission's
political donation guidelines.

415
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,833
Yes. And reveal the names of our sponsors.

416
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,962
You're driving me crazy here!

417
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,716
Who in their right mind would sponsor
campaign funds

418
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,718
under their real names in this country?

419
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,554
Sir.

420
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,809
That's one of the biggest problems
with Korea's political system.

421
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:35,190
They worry if they support the red team,
the blue team might attack them.

422
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:39,235
But if they support the blue team,
the red team might come after them.

423
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,613
Just go and tell him

424
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,073
to drop it if he's so scared. Yeah.

425
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,493
I will not tolerate something like this.

426
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,077
I'll be off, then.

427
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,122
Hey! Oh Kyung-sook!

428
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,333
You…

429
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,429
We need to talk.

430
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,229
What is this?

431
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,025
Are you going back
to your old habits, huh?

432
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,486
Things are tough now,

433
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,030
so you want to fix it with chaebol money?

434
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,199
It's the party who's behind this, not me.

435
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:29,202
Mosun's been supporting
the party for so long.

436
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,871
So you're hiding behind the party

437
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,832
and trying to suggest

438
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,085
that I accept that money
and turn a blind eye. Am I wrong?

439
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:43,174
I'm all for fighting fair
and keeping the funds transparent,

440
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:46,177
but we have no other choice
in this situation.

441
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,684
So, you're saying that we should use
the old Hwang Do-hee's dirty methods?

442
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,729
Would you rather hold out like this
and die?

443
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,147
Do you want to starve

444
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:01,234
those who joined the campaign
just because they believed in you?

445
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,945
They won't starve, don't worry.

446
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,530
They won't die either.

447
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,867
I'll keep doing things my way
until the end.

448
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,078
Right.

449
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,124
And from now on, I'd appreciate it

450
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,586
if you could screen these things
and refuse them without telling me.

451
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,478
No good comes
from drinking when you're angry.

452
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:00,710
Take it slow.

453
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,838
I get that you're dying to win

454
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,506
and get your revenge,

455
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:10,345
but you keep running ahead so fast
on your own that you end up stumbling.

456
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,599
I'm not worried that we might not win.

457
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,269
The world may not recognize

458
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,022
the true value of Oh Kyung-sook.

459
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,150
That worries me.

460
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,631
I'm not here to thank you.

461
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,591
Nor did I come all this way,

462
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,636
taking time out of my busy schedule,
to get rejected.

463
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,721
I would like you

464
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,598
to take charge

465
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,893
of the policy-making team in my campaign.

466
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,648
The party's power isn't
what's important to me.

467
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,484
Having comrades is.

468
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,656
I want people of my own,
not those seeking chump change.

469
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,075
People who will follow

470
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,536
the Oh Kyung-sook vision.

471
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,665
I'm sorry.

472
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,002
Are you refusing

473
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,170
because of Ms. Hwang?

474
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,176
I don't think I saw you
at her father's funeral.

475
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,722
Funeral?

476
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,731
Then you must still be in the dark
about how her father

477
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,316
passed away.

478
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:08,296
HWANG JOO-IL

479
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,419
So you came.

480
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:53,174
I was upset that I'd been stood up,
so I was going to buy a painting.

481
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,384
What do you want?

482
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,847
I heard you've been having
a hard time lately.

483
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,351
That you're struggling
to get campaign funds.

484
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:04,811
Is it true?

485
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,943
I'll give you the money.

486
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,154
Make Oh Kyung-sook mayor with my money.

487
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,369
Finding just any sponsor
won't be enough to go against Mom.

488
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,288
And you'll hurt Oh's image
if you accept the wrong money.

489
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,374
I've been sticking

490
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,503
close to Mom recently,
watching how things are going.

491
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,923
I realized
Baek Jae-min shouldn't become mayor.

492
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,927
If he does, he'll dig his claws
into Mom's weaknesses

493
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,639
and try to exploit the duty-free shop
and our family for his own benefit.

494
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,933
I can't let that happen.

495
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:49,147
Chae-ryoung and Mom will never see this
because they chose him themselves,

496
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,773
so I need to stay alert

497
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,401
and do my duty as the eldest.

498
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,695
Grow up.

499
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,326
This isn't a battle someone
as childish as you can handle.

500
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,504
Call me if you change your mind.

501
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,902
I visited the Greenpeople Foundation.

502
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,989
I talked to the university girls
who went volunteering with Baek Jae-min.

503
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,532
They were all scared stiff.

504
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,576
Baek's campaign team must've told them,

505
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,162
"Take the money and keep quiet
unless you want to die."

506
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,208
We knew there would be threats involved.

507
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,920
It might not be an idle threat.

508
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,220
I-seul really died.

509
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:05,848
Cha-sun.

510
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,601
I-seul even left me a suicide note--

511
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:13,231
But the Corporate Strategy Team
would do anything for Eunsung's owners.

512
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,525
And you were at the center of it all.

513
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,907
Maybe the Great Hwang Do-hee
missed something very important,

514
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,744
blinded by the guilt
of causing I-seul's death.

515
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,343
Ms. Hwang!

516
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,103
It was Guk Ji-yeon
who sent you here, right?

517
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:55,398
Just the thought of her makes
my blood boil.

518
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,318
She swooped right in for your position
and immediately started firing people.

519
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,782
She must have wanted to erase
all traces of people who worked under me.

520
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,619
You're right. I'm very interested myself
in why she's trying so hard

521
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,080
to erase all trace of you.

522
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,915
Any luck?

523
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,555
The security camera footage you requested

524
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,516
of Eunsung's headquarters
on December 7th was wiped clean.

525
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:32,893
The rooftop too?

526
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,312
Yes.

527
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,398
I heard they had
the entire security system replaced.

528
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,280
Management of the security system
is handled by the head of security, right?

529
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,197
Yes.

530
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,993
And the Corporate Strategy Team manager
oversees the head of security.

531
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,997
Something's fishy, right?

532
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,624
The security cams were replaced

533
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,085
on the day I-seul jumped from the rooftop.

534
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,297
And it was Guk Ji-yeon
who removed all traces.

535
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,430
Should I dig deeper?

536
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,104
Your wife gave birth last month,
didn't she?

537
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,815
Yes.

538
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,362
Then stay put. Stick to the "facts."

539
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,491
Don't get involved in things
that might put your child in danger.

540
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,409
Bye.

541
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,164
Ms. Hwang.

542
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,754
Why don't you check
the CCTV from the street?

543
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,425
The Eunsung headquarters building's
in such a crowded area.

544
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,220
There must be dozens
of CCTV systems installed nearby.

545
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,813
THE EUNSUNG DUTY-FREE SHOP TO BE COMPLETED
EXPECTATIONS ON THE RISE

546
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,152
Cha-sun, did you check?

547
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,115
There are three right across from Eunsung
and four at the entrance of the subway.

548
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,409
Including the ones in the streets,

549
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,161
there are 14 cameras in total
with a view of Eunsung.

550
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,913
Please get the footage from them.

551
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,959
Every piece of footage they have
from the day I-seul died.

552
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,299
MY OWN HOME?
WHY SHOULD IT BE JUST A DREAM?

553
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,094
MAKE SEOUL
THE NUMBER ONE ECONOMIC HUB OF ASIA

554
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,012
MAKE SEOUL THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY!

555
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:39,437
FOR THE 39TH SEOUL CITY
MAYORAL BY-ELECTION D-14

556
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,732
Oh Kyung-sook, right now!

557
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,445
Number two!

558
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:54,452
Who can revive the economy
And win people's hearts?

559
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,705
Our devoted worker Baek Jae-min can

560
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,166
Devoted worker, Baek Jae-min!

561
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,627
The Korean Republican Party can

562
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,005
My love, Baek Jae-min

563
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,425
They're straight-out
flaunting their money.

564
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,678
Campaigns aren't run with money,
but with passion!

565
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,430
Don't mind them, Ms. Oh.

566
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,684
Huh? Didn't she work for our campaign?
Do you see her?

567
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,853
-She did.
-What are they doing there?

568
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,855
They were bought out.

569
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,567
They promised that girl an internship
in a Eunsung subsidiary.

570
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,778
The other one will be the youth leader
of the Republican Party.

571
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,697
-Those snobbish pricks…
-Stop it!

572
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,115
All right, now. Come on.

573
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,285
We should still wish them the best.

574
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,496
There are 300,000 unemployed young people.

575
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,248
We should be happy
that their futures are set up.

576
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,458
-Right?
-Yes, ma'am!

577
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,127
-Let's keep our spirits high.
-You're right, ma'am.

578
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,630
-Number one, you can do it!
-You can do it!

579
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,798
We can do it better!

580
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,884
Vote for candidate number two!

581
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,177
Thank you.

582
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,553
Number two!

583
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,482
I got the CCTV footage from the building
across from Eunsung.

584
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,985
Neither the district office or Seoul Metro
will share their footage,

585
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,154
so I'm looking for a way to access it.

586
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,197
Thank you.

587
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,824
Let's see.

588
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,595
Can we find anything?

589
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:38,806
We have to try.

590
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,269
Even the slightest trace of Baek Jae-min

591
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,398
could become the spark
that ignites a bonfire.

592
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,327
A fight seems to have broken out today.

593
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,914
Whoa!

594
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,962
Look how well he's growing.

595
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,340
I heard Hyun-woo lost his shit today.

596
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,217
He completely flipped out.

597
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,595
Those assholes messed up
his mom's campaign posters

598
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,471
and trolled her articles.

599
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,889
But something feels off.

600
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,809
They'll try to get back at us
after being humiliated like that.

601
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,227
Hey, what if they do?

602
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,104
Hyun-woo will get back too.

603
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,608
Hyun-woo will beat them up
like it's nothing.

604
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:31,984
You're right.

605
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,946
Hey, follow me.

606
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,623
Come on, hold on to this.

607
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,252
-Hey, straighten it out.
-Okay.

608
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,590
Hey, I'm glad we put this back up.

609
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,593
I know. Your mom looks good in the photo.

610
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,179
You're right. I totally agree.

611
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:02,431
SEOUL MAYORAL CANDIDATE
REFORM PARTY OF KOREA

612
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,933
-Let's go.
-Where?

613
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,310
Pool hall's on me today.

614
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,561
-Seriously?
-Really?

615
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,646
-Yeah.
-Let's go!

616
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,688
-You mean it?
-Yeah.

617
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,023
Eunsung Group

618
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,818
collected the items

619
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,653
left behind by I-seul?

620
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,322
I've read the police report of that day

621
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,324
through my contact in the force.

622
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,704
Everything from her work phone
to her ID card

623
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,708
was taken by Guk Ji-yeon
from the Corporate Strategy Team.

624
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:21,468
With two weeks to go
until the 39th Seoul Mayoral By-election,

625
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,096
the candidates have begun
their campaigns in earnest.

626
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,515
After a dramatic primary election,
the People's…

627
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,534
Not as glamorous as you thought, right?

628
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,411
Being Eunsung's hunting hound.

629
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,789
You're always sleep-deprived,

630
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,961
and you have no spare time
to think about decorating this place.

631
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,842
The biggest luxury you enjoy
in this apartment

632
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,761
is the night view.

633
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,390
Please get to the point.

634
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,520
You are sad that you were abandoned
by your master and lost your apartment.

635
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,522
I already got that.

636
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,650
It's strange.

637
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:24,782
The security contractor was replaced
a day after I-seul died,

638
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,117
and the one who chose the new company…

639
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,455
was you.

640
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,086
Did you have something to hide in a hurry?

641
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,090
Not at all.

642
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,136
Then why did you smuggle away

643
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,640
everything from I-seul's cell phone
to her employee ID card?

644
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:53,018
When someone who used to serve
under the Eun family quits,

645
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,271
all items used by that employee

646
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,858
are collected
by the Corporate Strategy Team.

647
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,736
You taught me to do that.

648
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,469
You have a strong stomach.

649
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,142
Seeing how you made it up here
holding onto Baek Jae-min's topknot.

650
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,438
It wasn't that bad.

651
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:42,150
It was much better
than groveling under you.

652
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,905
Once his head is severed,

653
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,743
the topknot
is just a useless piece of burden.

654
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,873
Are you threatening

655
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,459
to sever Baek's head?

656
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,255
Your head will go down.

657
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,009
Once I make your relationship public,

658
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,722
Baek Jae-min will use you
as a human shield.

659
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,474
That's where you stand.

660
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,896
No matter how hard you serve that beast,

661
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:23,775
you're just a disposable item,
to be discarded in the end.

662
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,069
I don't know.

663
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:32,075
I believe I've become far too valuable
to be simply discarded.

664
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,914
Baek can't get rid of me that easily.

665
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:42,878
Why?

666
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,924
Do you have leverage over him
that makes it impossible

667
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,675
for him to abandon you?

668
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,263
Would you be keeping, say, a secret

669
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,099
that the world cannot find about,

670
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,977
like what Jae-min did to I-seul?

671
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,899
Do you really think
Baek made advances on I-seul?

672
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,736
Why would he go after a cheap girl

673
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,988
who couldn't even value her own life?

674
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,699
-Baek couldn't possibly--
-You!

675
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:28,006
That was the last chance you had
for your redemption.

676
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,929
I won't be treating you
like a human being from now on.

677
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,521
I'll do everything I can to find out

678
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,524
what you know about I-seul.

679
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,577
MULTIVITAMINS FOR PREGNANCY

680
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,349
Hello.

681
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,852
Hi, I'm so sorry.
An urgent meeting came up.

682
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,772
But what about Bin?
He must have cried a lot.

683
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,818
No, not at all. He's there having fun.

684
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,336
So, she didn't make any progress?

685
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,257
We tried to talk to all the women
that Baek has ever worked with

686
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,551
in an attempt to get them to testify,

687
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,386
but we had no luck.

688
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,639
I was able to get ready thanks to you.

689
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,309
How did Hwang Do-hee react?

690
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,436
She seems to want to put it on hold.

691
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,523
She stopped there
instead of going any further?

692
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:11,818
Um…

693
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,113
You said I'd be the manager

694
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,658
of the Eunsung Duty-Free Shop's
cosmetics department.

695
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,536
Can I trust you on that?

696
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,832
How could I play tricks on a single mother

697
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,417
working as a spy

698
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,587
so she could survive
in this nasty world of politics?

699
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,922
I promise you

700
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:34,841
a bright future.

701
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,810
Hwang Do-hee…

702
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,396
is digging into Han I-seul's case.

703
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:59,157
So, two days have passed
since the mayoral election campaign began.

704
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,244
Candidate Baek has been continuously
leading the race,

705
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,079
gathering more supporters by the day.

706
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,791
But Candidate Oh's approval ratings
seem to have stalled.

707
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:11,253
If there's a reversal coming,
now would be a great time for that.

708
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,340
Now, what if Candidate Oh
has a hole card that would destroy

709
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,591
Candidate Baek in this race?

710
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,887
That would be an amazing
come-from-behind victory for her.

711
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,849
I wonder if Candidate Oh has found
the card she needs.

712
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:33,859
I don't know.

713
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,656
I believe I've become far too valuable
to be simply discarded.

714
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,995
Baek can't get rid of me that easily.

715
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,330
MULTIVITAMINS FOR PREGNANCY

716
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,760
Were you up all night?

717
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,764
I got started late.
I had to go see Guk Ji-yeon.

718
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:07,350
What did she say?

719
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,436
She looked so confident.

720
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,231
She denied everything about I-seul

721
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:18,028
and claimed that Baek Jae-min
would never be able to throw her away.

722
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:23,033
She definitely has
something good up her sleeve.

723
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,253
Ms. Hwang.

724
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:39,257
I think I found that cheat code.

725
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,305
Today, at 1:30 a.m.,

726
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,392
Baek Jae-min was seen
visiting Guk Ji-yeon's apartment.

727
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,438
There were no bodyguards,
and he drove there himself.

728
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:58,401
And on the same day at 6 a.m.,
Baek left Guk's house.

729
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,739
He spent five hours alone
with his female aide at night.

730
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,368
This isn't just a call for resignation.
It's a death sentence.

731
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,038
Ms. Hwang.

732
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,415
If we send this footage to the press--

733
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,875
Hold on to it for now.

734
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,294
What?

735
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:17,879
Hold on to it?

736
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,506
But, Ms. Hwang,

737
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,008
Baek's ratings will drop if we release--

738
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,678
I'm telling you, it's not that simple!

739
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,223
I'm sorry.

740
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:30,725
Let's take a break.

741
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:47,951
Hwang Do-hee.

742
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,499
It's not like you
to put the brakes on a situation.

743
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:58,461
Cha-sun.

744
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,555
I think Guk Ji-yeon is pregnant
with Baek's child.

745
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,896
She's playing a really dangerous game,
isn't she?

746
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,941
The truth about I-seul, and now a child.

747
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,194
I mean, what is she trying to do,
holding swords in both hands?

748
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,156
She's delusional.

749
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:32,454
She believes
that those swords will protect her.

750
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,877
If this scandal breaks,

751
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,129
she won't escape unscathed.

752
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:45,175
With the election around the corner,
if the Eunsung owners find out…

753
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:47,844
It will be over for us too.

754
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,974
We'll lose the key that can lead us
to the truth about I-seul's death.

755
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,396
So we should protect Ji-yeon
for the time being.

756
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,608
For now, yes.

757
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,862
Until we find any trace
of Baek Jae-min in that footage,

758
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,991
everything must be kept under control.

759
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,292
Hwang Do-hee
is digging into I-seul's case.

760
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,712
Didn't she attempt to contact you at all?

761
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,426
No, sir.

762
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,393
It's hard to end things
on a good note, right?

763
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:42,607
I was hoping I could end this election
without getting any blood on my hands.

764
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,985
But if she insists on swinging her sword,

765
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,321
we'll have to play along

766
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,699
and show them what we're made of.

767
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,328
We'll go after Oh Kyung-sook's jugular
so quickly

768
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,082
that she won't even have time to scream.

769
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,634
That's where you stand.

770
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:54,804
No matter how hard you serve that beast,

771
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,684
you're just a disposable item,
to be discarded in the end.
