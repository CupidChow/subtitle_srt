1
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,149
Who are those psychos?

2
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,943
Did you catch the license plate?

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,241
Can you move?

4
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,162
Those sons of bitches. Damn it.

5
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:56,973
Who are you?

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,684
I should be asking you that.

7
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,394
Were you part of the hit-and-run?

8
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,482
I knew it. Bastards!

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,288
Hey, get him out of here.

10
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,562
Are you sure?

11
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,273
All right.

12
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,068
Thanks.

13
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,617
These bastards are
Eunsung's security guards.

14
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,078
They guard the owners.

15
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,981
Come on now, the sausages are burning.
The sausages…

16
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,860
Done.

17
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,280
Oh. Good morning.

18
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,407
Come on.

19
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,577
Come take a seat,
my treasures, my princes.

20
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,831
Oh Kyung-sook's signature doenjang stew!

21
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,960
It might not look all that great,

22
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,421
but it tastes amazing.

23
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,839
Okay, what is it?

24
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,800
You're making me nervous.

25
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,511
Oh, it's just…

26
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,389
I'll be going on a trip soon.

27
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,641
-A trip?
-Yes.

28
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,102
Around the world in 80 days?
Or something like that.

29
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:52,857
It will be a perilous journey.
There's no telling what dangers lie ahead,

30
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,779
but it's a journey that only I can make.

31
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,780
Whatever.

32
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,157
Hyun-woo.

33
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:05,828
Honey.

34
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,833
I…

35
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,213
decided to run

36
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,882
for mayor of Seoul.

37
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,721
Hyun-woo, it will just be
for the next 80 days.

38
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,474
I don't care if it's 80 days or 80 years.

39
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,643
Since when do you care about my opinion?

40
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,146
Don't act like you're consulting me
when you've already decided.

41
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,385
She's in the hospital?

42
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,178
Yes, sir.

43
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,098
They had to leave
because there was someone else,

44
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,058
but this will keep her quiet for now.

45
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,436
I'm sure she's scared,

46
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,397
and she got the message loud and clear.

47
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,277
I was

48
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,656
a little on edge yesterday. I'm sorry.

49
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,408
It's fine, sir.

50
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:30,955
I'll work harder to make sure
Do-hee can't get the better of us.

51
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:41,132
So, you want to go after Baek Jae-min?
That chaebol's son-in-law?

52
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,469
The reason he's running for mayor is--

53
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,304
It's obvious. To satisfy their greed.

54
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,058
But why do you have to be

55
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,477
the one who stops them?

56
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,272
There are more powerful
and capable politicians than you.

57
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,567
So, why do you have to follow

58
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,488
this path, knowing the dangers?

59
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,407
Why my wife, of all people?

60
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,242
Because in politics,

61
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,580
I'm the only one who has nothing to lose.

62
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,001
Who else in that sleazy world
would be stupid enough

63
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,339
to fight to the death, risk being trampled

64
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,259
by Baek Jae-min,

65
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,013
and turned into a laughingstock,

66
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,185
ruining their political career?

67
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,525
Honey.

68
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,568
I promise

69
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,447
I'll win the election.

70
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,617
I'm going to give it everything I've got

71
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,036
until I find the sword

72
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,290
that will slay that bastard Baek Jae-min.

73
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,834
This won't do.

74
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,753
Honey.

75
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,551
You shouldn't be back in the kitchen.

76
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,179
This soup is too bland,
and you made too much.

77
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,809
So go find the sword you need
to slay those beasts

78
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,062
and destroy their world for good.

79
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,875
It's too early for this.
Stop suffocating me, silly.

80
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,483
Hey, are you hurt?

81
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,985
I'm fine. Morning, Ms. Oh.

82
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,197
Go grab some breakfast.

83
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,281
Good idea.

84
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,381
You're alive.

85
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,554
Now you're not so venomous.
You look more human.

86
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,057
I'm glad I look presentable.

87
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,560
Answer me this.

88
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:25,231
Are you confident?

89
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,317
What do you mean?

90
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,779
Are you confident
that you can bring Baek Jae-min down?

91
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,158
Only if you

92
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,661
put your trust in me.

93
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,084
No way. How can I trust you?

94
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,919
I'll never trust you.

95
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,048
Fine.

96
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,844
Let's consider this
a strategic partnership, then.

97
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,556
Wow. Seriously.

98
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,142
You sure are a smooth talker.

99
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,812
You know what I think?

100
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:09,025
That eloquent tongue of yours
will be the death of you one day.

101
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,152
Or see me rise from the ashes.

102
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,280
If I can convince you with my tongue

103
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,908
and see the demise of Baek Jae-min.

104
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,369
Promise me

105
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,415
that you won't force your ways on me.

106
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,501
Dirty money, dishonest schemes,

107
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:32,423
and your disgusting connections.
I refuse to be a part of any of them.

108
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,466
Fine.

109
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,637
But you'll do as I say

110
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,265
once you agree to my plan.

111
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:42,683
Remember this.

112
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:48,397
The moment you resort to the methods
you used under Eunsung's owners,

113
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,733
we're done.

114
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,443
Don't worry.

115
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,445
The old me is dead.

116
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,157
What? What are you doing?

117
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,161
Let's get started.

118
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:07,667
My method is to repay a blow
by hitting back twice as hard.

119
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,880
Do you agree?

120
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,217
I do.

121
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,400
OH KYUNG-SOOK, A NEW BEGINNING

122
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:38,864
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

123
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,450
Hello, everyone.

124
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,037
It's me, Oh Kyung-sook the Rhino.
How's everyone doing?

125
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,331
INDEPENDENT CANDIDATE
SEOUL MAYORAL ELECTION

126
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,208
ONLY YOU SHINE IN MY EYES

127
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,377
THE MIRACLE OF THE RHINO
WILL CHANGE SEOUL

128
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,713
Dear citizens of Seoul.

129
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,758
Justice without power is useless,

130
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,303
and power without justice
is mere violence.

131
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,807
Seoul is currently suffering
from violence.

132
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,769
The citizens of Seoul are being trampled

133
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,564
under money and power.

134
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,235
The chaebols live like kings,
and their lies

135
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:20,072
turn into prophecies
in the ridiculous world we live in now.

136
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,701
It is to correct such wrongs

137
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,995
that I, Oh Kyung-sook the Rhino,

138
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,747
who never dies,

139
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,459
announce my candidacy
to become mayor of Seoul!

140
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,338
Thank you, everyone.

141
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,514
Attorney Oh Kyung-sook announced
her candidacy for mayor of Seoul

142
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,768
in front of the Eunsung Group’s
office building today.

143
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,937
Many people are showing
their support for Ms. Oh,

144
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,315
who threw herself from the rooftop

145
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,776
of the department store owned by Eunsung

146
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,069
while defending the rights
of temp workers.

147
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,282
Thus, it looks like the upcoming election
will be a fierce battle

148
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,659
between Baek Jae-min and Oh Kyung-sook,

149
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:10,623
one representing the conglomerate world
and the other the working class.

150
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,589
Oh Kyung-sook!

151
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,303
How did it go?

152
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,140
We've sent more security guards,
and we have our employees on standby.

153
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,017
-We'll immediately--
-Leave her be.

154
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,811
Mom!

155
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,897
She's throwing a party in my front yard.

156
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,858
I applaud her courage.

157
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,444
Enough is enough.

158
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,073
She's challenging us to our faces.

159
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,574
Let's bring some thugs--

160
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,077
Treat them like beasts and stomp on them?

161
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,454
While everybody's watching?

162
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,457
They're bound to get burned

163
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,086
if they continue to dance
so close to the fire.

164
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,046
And that will be our chance

165
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,300
to step on their necks
and teach them a lesson.

166
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,890
That's how grown-ups handle things.

167
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,270
Not just as the servant
of the working class

168
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,649
but as the trustworthy servant
of all citizens of Seoul,

169
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,318
I embark on this great journey!

170
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,198
-Seo Min-jung!
-Seo Min-jung!

171
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,826
-Did you see this?
-I think it just came up.

172
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,037
-Seo Min-jung!
-Seo Min-jung!

173
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,790
Okay now, let's get moving!

174
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,208
All right, let's move.

175
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,881
OH KYUNG-SOOK DECLARES HER CANDIDACY

176
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,262
She announced her candidacy
in front of the Eunsung Group?

177
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,597
What a brilliant move.

178
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,516
She must have someone smart in her camp.

179
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,270
Find out who it is so I can scout them.

180
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:57,980
Let's do it!

181
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,443
-Seo Min-jung!
-Seo Min-jung!

182
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,411
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

183
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,081
You clearly laid out
the contest between the two.

184
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,542
I should thank you

185
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,171
for giving me, a no-name reporter,
an exclusive.

186
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,132
I've had my eye on you
since my days at Eunsung.

187
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,717
I know how ambitious you are.

188
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,845
But

189
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,973
what are you really up to?

190
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,726
The Ms. Hwang I know isn't someone

191
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,938
who would ever side with Oh Kyung-sook.

192
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,316
Good hearts have…

193
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,946
a way of influencing others.

194
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,198
I find that hard to believe.

195
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,328
If you're that curious,

196
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,581
dig into it like a good reporter should

197
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,376
while staying close to me.

198
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,587
"Hwang Do-hee"?

199
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,674
So, the brains behind Oh Kyung-sook

200
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,718
is the former head of Eunung's
Corporate Strategy Team?

201
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,431
Mr. Baek, you've been getting chewed on
by your own guard dog?

202
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,106
From this moment on,
you need to take a step back.

203
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,112
To save Chairwoman Son's face,
I'll let you give the winning speech,

204
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,571
so don't make a peep--

205
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,614
Mr. Sung!

206
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:34,410
No matter how many people believe
Korean politicians are scoundrels,

207
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:39,248
to be played by a chaebol family's
guard dog is simply unacceptable

208
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,166
and cannot be allowed--

209
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,710
Watch your mouth!

210
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,586
She never played me.

211
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,463
Just wait and see.

212
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,884
I promise I'll become mayor,

213
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,512
and make sure no one calls you

214
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,724
a scoundrel who grows fat
on chaebol money.

215
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,766
What?

216
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,978
Schedule a broadcast.
A one-on-one debate with Oh Kyung-sook.

217
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,942
How dare he!

218
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,622
Be careful. You'll break it.

219
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,792
Do I look like a mover?
Are you even paying me?

220
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,795
Why did you move to my hood and bother me?

221
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,964
Ms. Oh showed me the house,

222
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,466
so blame her if you have to.

223
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:35,012
You won't be able to wear those here.

224
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,516
This neighborhood
has steep hills everywhere.

225
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,311
It's fine. I have you with me, don't I?

226
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,605
Hey, am I your bodyguard?

227
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,273
Why would I tag along with you?

228
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,319
You can't save someone's life
and then abandon them.

229
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,945
Be a man.

230
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,583
You can go. I need to rest.

231
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,005
Call me if you need me.

232
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,306
SEOUL CITY MAYORAL ELECTION
MARCH 15, 2023

233
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,565
WE HOPE FOR OH KYUNG-SOOK'S VICTORY
IN THE ELECTION

234
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,236
Ms. Oh!

235
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,411
Oh, ma'am.

236
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,456
Thank you so much.

237
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,752
I've always been grateful for the support
you've shown me over the years.

238
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,506
Now you've lent us this great office
to use in our campaign too.

239
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,217
I can't thank you enough.

240
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,344
I'm the one who should thank you.

241
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:01,640
When we were being sued by the press
after we started this publishing company,

242
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,185
you stepped forward
to defend us in court free of charge.

243
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,565
Right. Then I'll use this space
as a stepping stone

244
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:15,779
to soar as high as I can
on the wings of justice.

245
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,322
Thank you.

246
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,792
Did I miss anything?

247
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,506
Let me introduce her to you, everyone.

248
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,551
She will be our campaign manager.

249
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,263
The one who planned
the candidacy announcement?

250
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,057
-And used to work for a big firm.
-I'm Hwang Do-hee.

251
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,145
I may have walked a different path
from you thus for,

252
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:52,691
but I've been learning that there are
other ways to life since meeting Ms. Oh.

253
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,152
I'll give this all I've got.

254
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,653
Help me out.

255
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,160
-And these people…
-Right.

256
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,120
They're here to volunteer.

257
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,874
They're experts in fashion, beauty,
and schedule management,

258
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,376
so I've gratefully accepted
their offers to help.

259
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,504
Welcome aboard.

260
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:16,965
Thank you.

261
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,509
-Nice to meet you.
-Ms. Oh.

262
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,471
How about a photo
to commemorate our first day together?

263
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,388
Shall we?

264
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,973
Okay. Gather round, everyone.

265
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,600
-Join in, everyone.
-Okay.

266
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,685
Move in closer.

267
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,272
One, two, three.

268
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,233
Oh Kyung-sook! Let's go!

269
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,150
Let's go!

270
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,073
The by-election for the 39th mayor
of Seoul is only about 80 days away.

271
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,492
We have the greatest candidates,

272
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,328
each with an impressive career
and a unique personality,

273
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,497
Korea's most successful female politician,

274
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,333
Seo Min-jung of the Reform Party of Korea.

275
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,710
And Baek Jae-min,
a former anchor and a member

276
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,337
of the Korean Republican Party.

277
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,257
The elder of Jongno,
the capital of Seoul's political scene,

278
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,218
the People's Central Party's
Yook Seung-cheol.

279
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,304
The rhino for justice, Oh Kyung-sook,
an independent candidate.

280
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,723
The Patriots' Hope Party's Na Jin-guk.

281
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:11,436
Assemblywoman Seo Min-jung is
currently leading in the polls.

282
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,023
Attorney Oh, despite her appearance
in the news lately,

283
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:18,902
is relatively unknown to voters,
contrary to people's expectations.

284
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,905
What strategy will the Rhino employ

285
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,659
to gain an advantage
over her impressive competitors?

286
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,911
It's simple.

287
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,997
We'll start with her.

288
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,833
We're going against Seo Min-jung first?

289
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,128
We're not going against her.
We're going to push her out.

290
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,213
What did you say?

291
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,215
39TH SEOUL MAYOR ELECTION CANDIDATES

292
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,634
BAEK JAE-MIN
THE KOREAN REPUBLICAN PARTY

293
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,552
Money.

294
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,096
Manpower.

295
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,099
Star quality.

296
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,893
These three are essential for politics,

297
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,896
but we only have one.

298
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,940
So, what are you suggesting we do?

299
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,654
We'll beat her in the primary election.

300
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,912
This is the "Servant of the People,"
and she's already served three terms.

301
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,583
She's the queen and the star
of the Reform Party of Korea.

302
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,421
Her highness would never agree
to such a thing. Jeez.

303
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,882
And the Reform Party isn't stupid.

304
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,886
They're leading. Why would they do that
with a nobody like me--

305
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,679
Because they have to win.

306
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,477
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook.

307
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,233
I will make you the biggest hurdle
in the way of Seo Min-jung's victory.

308
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,527
A hurdle so high
it may damage the Reform Party

309
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,613
unless it's dealt with
in a primary election.

310
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,198
And through that race,

311
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,826
we'll obtain the funds and the manpower,

312
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,204
and go against the Republican Party, no,

313
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,457
I mean Baek Jae-min.

314
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,218
REFORM PARTY OF KOREA
BAEK JAE-MIN CAMPAIGN SCHEDULE

315
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:16,353
-How are things at the Republican Party?
-They seem to be working closely with CBC.

316
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,564
Those Republican pricks
are so predictable.

317
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,734
They're preparing a TV debate
since Baek used to be an anchor.

318
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,113
What next? Will he be on variety shows
together with his wife?

319
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,240
No signs of a smear campaign against us?

320
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,534
-Not yet.
-Keep an eye on them.

321
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,576
Yes, sir.

322
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,580
-And the other candidates?
-Not much to say about them.

323
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,916
They're testing the waters
to gain popularity,

324
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,168
hoping someone will start poking them.

325
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,753
Any other interesting issues?

326
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,756
Sir. You should look at this.

327
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,469
This is hilarious.
Where did you find this?

328
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,720
Is the sweat for real?

329
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,180
Wow. I can't believe this.

330
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,015
Hey. Look at the comments here.

331
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,645
-Gosh, this is funny.
-Hey.

332
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,314
I told you to cut the childish jokes.

333
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,359
-Do you think the election is a joke?
-My gosh.

334
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,654
Looks like the sap's flowing free
from Ms. Grassroots Democracy.

335
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,907
You have such a way with words, ma'am.

336
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,576
We might be onto something.

337
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,912
Try adding some grass to her armpit
in that photo of her sweating.

338
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,873
Have party members post it,

339
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,417
and flood online comment sections
with it. It might work.

340
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,003
-Hey.
-I think it's a great idea.

341
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,756
It's in-your-face and easy to understand.
Voters these days dig that.

342
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,842
I know what you mean,

343
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,345
but it might not be a good idea
to go after her appearance or image.

344
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,265
Ms. Oh will be well-prepared
against such attacks, we might--

345
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,224
What?

346
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,562
Are you worried that your wife,
the smear campaign expert,

347
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,731
might outsmart us again?

348
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,153
Proceed. Spare no pesticide.

349
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:51,239
We should weed out the likes of her.

350
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,157
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,620
THIS IS GRASSROOTS DEMOCRACY

352
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,747
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE ARMPIT FARMS

353
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,124
CONGRATS
LINE UP FOR THE ARMPIT WATER PARK!

354
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,298
Ms. Oh.

355
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,759
Seen this?

356
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,971
Look how they photoshopped your photo.
Bunch of childish pricks!

357
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:15,972
Damn it!

358
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,561
-It wasn't photoshopped.
-What?

359
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,276
That's the original photo.

360
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,530
I have hyperhidrosis.

361
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:35,075
I didn't get the proper postnatal care,

362
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,911
and I've been sweaty ever since.

363
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:38,912
Right.

364
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,873
Postnatal…

365
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,333
I'm sorry.

366
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:51,132
Where's Manager Hwang?
She's nowhere to be seen.

367
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,475
A TV debate?

368
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,565
Sure. It's doable.

369
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,067
But…

370
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,988
we want you to invite another guest.

371
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,532
Invite Seo Min-jung.

372
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,117
Seo Min-jung?

373
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,620
It's not even an official election debate.

374
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,583
With Oh Kyung-sook and Baek Jae-min,

375
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,168
you're going for entertainment value

376
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,421
by having
the most controversial candidates,

377
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,381
and I'll make it even more interesting.

378
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:36,553
You know from experience
that I don't kid around.

379
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,098
Oh, I know how good you are,

380
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,102
but it was Baek Jae-min's camp
that wanted to make it one-on-one.

381
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,067
How's your daughter
in that Ivy League school she got into?

382
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,071
I know she got in

383
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,408
because Eunsung built
a fountain on the campus.

384
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,580
Do your colleagues know?

385
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:11,755
I'm no longer with the Eunsung Group,
so I have no reason to hide it for you.

386
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,761
If such an issue were to arise
before the election, don't you think

387
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,681
the Eunsung Group would blame you?

388
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,238
Hey, it's me.

389
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,783
Add another guest to the TV debate.

390
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,876
I'll be back to thank you
after we've won the election.

391
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,130
With Mayor Oh Kyung-sook.

392
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,013
I know, right?

393
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,648
Separate all your vertebrae,
elongate your body…

394
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,069
She doesn't have a single wrinkle
around her eyes or her mouth.

395
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:02,240
Get me the names of plastic surgeons
that perform AHA peels in Cheongdam-dong.

396
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:06,244
A few peels there
would get you skin like this.

397
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,998
-How much does it cost per procedure?
-Around ten million won.

398
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,751
Who paid for hers?

399
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,504
LEE CHA-SUN

400
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,139
What's this?

401
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,891
I need you to write me a story

402
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,311
using that with the files
I'm sending via email.

403
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,314
Do-hee, have you really decided to do it?

404
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,441
It was you who told me

405
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,195
that I can't change anything on my own.

406
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,948
So I'm going to do it together

407
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,117
with Oh Kyung-sook.

408
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,834
To protect everything the Reform Party
of Korea and I have achieved,

409
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,128
I will blast through
that old glass ceiling

410
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,465
to enter the National Assembly once again.

411
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,300
Or perhaps I already have.

412
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,094
I wonder what the male candidates think.

413
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,889
You can see how eloquent a public speaker
Seo Min-jung is.

414
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,058
She's not just good at putting on a show.

415
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,936
She also has strong principles
as a three-time winner.

416
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:19,150
You should go after her in this debate,
establish a rivalry between the two--

417
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,152
I understand that she's a big threat,

418
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:22,862
but

419
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,367
what about Oh Kyung-sook?
Can we just let her run about like that?

420
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,661
She might go off the rails
during the debate.

421
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:33,540
The rhino might be stomping around now,
but she's still new to elections.

422
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,999
And it's going to be live.

423
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,254
Just insult her lightly
right before the cameras turn on--

424
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,804
I can't believe that you're still using
that ancient strategy.

425
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,139
Is it from the 1960s?

426
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:55,270
Are you planning to let the press cover
a story on the personal insult?

427
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,938
I am, but who are you?

428
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,524
Attention.

429
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:05,446
An election is all about fieldwork,
but instead of sending him to the field,

430
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,033
you'll put him in front of a camera
and make him dance like a clown.

431
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:14,664
You're going to use those old methods
to try to upend this election?

432
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,332
And then what?

433
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,043
Will you take responsibility if he loses?

434
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,338
Every time you lose an election,

435
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,966
you lose ten years
of your political lifespan.

436
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,011
Then what should we do?

437
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,264
Boycott the TV debate.

438
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,893
I mean, think about it.

439
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,229
With two such strong-willed women,

440
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,024
he'll only be sidelined
to a supporting role.

441
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,193
And once you get relegated,

442
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:49,782
you can never go back to playing the lead.

443
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,870
Nice to meet you, Candidate Baek.

444
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,955
I'm Carl Yoon.

445
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,417
The gift that Chairwoman Son
prepared for you.

446
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,296
I'm Baek Jae-min.

447
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,383
You need to learn
a proper handshake first.

448
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,888
It should let people know
how fierce you are.

449
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,604
Who's she?

450
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,774
She's our campaign manager.

451
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:24,484
I'm Guk Ji-yeon.

452
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:31,616
See you around.

453
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,254
So, that's the notorious Carl Yoon?

454
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,465
I guess so.

455
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,511
I've only heard about him. This is
my first time seeing him in person.

456
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,057
But is he even allowed in Korea right now?

457
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,936
So, how was your stay in Long Island?

458
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,146
It was perfect.

459
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,898
I'm all recharged now

460
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,152
after that comfortable vacation
you were kind enough to give me.

461
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,905
I've been on pins and needles
hoping you'd call me in.

462
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,454
When my husband died at a young age

463
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,123
and I was left to run Eunsung alone,

464
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,462
if it weren't for the roadmap
that you created for me,

465
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,006
I would have been lost.

466
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,721
We would've been robbed
every time a new party came into power,

467
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,849
and I would've been walking
on eggshells around politicians.

468
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,436
I was just repaying
the late chairman's generosity.

469
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,275
So, what do you think
of my greedy son-in-law

470
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,860
now that you've met him?

471
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,612
His facade is faultless,

472
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,406
but I don't know what lies within him

473
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,535
or what his potential is.

474
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:46,000
He'd completely change himself,
even sell his soul,

475
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,128
to rise to the top.

476
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,800
A nasty predator or a gentle sheep,

477
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,470
he's yours to shape, Mr. Yoon.

478
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:03,976
I've heard that Oh Kyung-sook
has someone interesting on her team.

479
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,996
Seriously, I mean.

480
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,457
Can you believe all of this?

481
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,459
She was elected to represent the people,

482
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,922
but all she's done in the last 12 years
is treacherously leech off the taxpayers.

483
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,133
Tax money alone wouldn't have been enough.

484
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,970
This outfit alone

485
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,141
is worth at least 30 million won.

486
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,268
30 million just for the one?

487
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,105
Thirty, sixty, ninety…
I can't believe this.

488
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:53,943
The People's Servant? What kind
of servant lives in luxury like that?

489
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,321
That's why you need to push her out
in the upcoming debate.

490
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,199
Use your unique charms, Rhino.

491
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,581
Wait, wait, just…

492
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,460
Wait, no, hey, hold on.

493
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,045
I can't do this.

494
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,799
I can't breathe.

495
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,342
Suck it up.

496
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,680
Suck it up?

497
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,723
Listen.

498
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,517
I'm the Rhino, okay?

499
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,977
Oh Kyung-sook the Rhino!

500
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,397
What kind of a rhino wears
spandex like this?

501
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,236
Come on, picture me fighting
for female workers' rights in this.

502
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,323
What would my sisters in arms
think of me then?

503
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,116
They'd think you'd become a pro.

504
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,452
If I have to wear this to look pro,

505
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,622
I'd rather run around naked
and be called insane.

506
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,373
Ugh, I'm just…

507
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,418
I'm taking this off. Come on, let me go!

508
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,502
Oh no, you can't.

509
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,841
Seo Min-jung and Baek Jae-min are pros.

510
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,259
They're grade-A clowns.

511
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,762
They know what cameras and lights
can do for them.

512
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,640
With every single move
that's been perfectly calculated,

513
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,183
they'll fool the public.

514
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,647
You, on the other hand,

515
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,025
will be meeting each attack
with bloodshot eyes,

516
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,611
shouting, burning with a sense of justice.

517
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,656
Then your posture will slip,
and your look will fall apart,

518
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,115
making you look even worse

519
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,118
while Seo Min-jung and Baek Jae-min
still look perfect.

520
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,704
The viewers at home will remember

521
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,916
how ugly you were while ranting,
not your sincerity.

522
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,045
It'll be season two
of the armpit sweat incident.

523
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,678
Think of it as your armor. Accept it.

524
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,514
You don't have the skills yet
to fight without it.

525
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,770
Why are you looking at me like that?
Looking good isn't dishonest.

526
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,068
This isn't a debate, but a political show.

527
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,363
You need to be bursting with energy.

528
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,658
You need vibrant and intense colors

529
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,202
that make viewers remember
the uniqueness of Oh Kyung-sook.

530
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,580
No more of that long mane you can't tame.

531
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,457
Cut it shorter.

532
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,002
More.

533
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:18,921
Shorter!

534
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,217
A boyish look might suit you
with your sharp chin.

535
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,559
She uses her facial muscles a lot,
so focus on her eyes and lips.

536
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,797
Candidate Baek Jae-min
of the Korean Republican Party,

537
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,633
who is running in the mayoral election,

538
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:09,263
has announced his intention to boycott
the upcoming live TV debate.

539
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:14,393
Baek Jae-min's campaign office only said
Candidate Baek decided this himself.

540
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,189
With Candidate Baek Jae-min stepping back,

541
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,567
it seems the upcoming debate
will be a head-on collision

542
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:24,612
between two outstanding women,
Seo Min-jung and Oh Kyung-sook.

543
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,614
SEO MIN-JUNG VS OH KYUNG-SOOK
D-3

544
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,587
Did you not like what was on the news?

545
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,049
I never said that I'd step away.

546
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,887
Furthermore, I never agreed
to have a stranger run my campaign for me.

547
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,430
I never needed your approval.

548
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:57,353
The fact that Oh Kyung-sook
is running amok has already proven

549
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,979
how incompetent you are.

550
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,359
We haven't even begun
the election campaign yet.

551
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,654
This election will be won
with my own strength--

552
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,947
Your own strength?

553
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,783
What have you achieved

554
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,452
on your own so far?

555
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,706
What are you without Eunsung?

556
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,543
What can you do?

557
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,671
Your background,

558
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,006
your job,

559
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:27,800
your image…

560
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,139
Aren't those shells
that Chairwoman Son created for you?

561
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,310
You want to leave all of that behind
and make something of yourself?

562
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,855
Without any help?

563
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:49,780
I've been through 12 elections
and made two candidates president.

564
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,910
Even if my candidate was a beast
who would eat their own kids,

565
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,663
I guaranteed victory
but under one condition…

566
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,792
They must do exactly as I say.

567
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:08,299
You must reveal your true self,
including your vulgar and arrogant nature.

568
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,383
Only then can I

569
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:13,596
protect you, disguise you,
and make you a winner.

570
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,851
You think Baek Jae-min's campaign
has a new expert?

571
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,103
What do mean?

572
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:25,566
The Baek Jae-min I know
would never refuse to be on TV.

573
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:30,196
Someone who knows this game inside out
planned this scheme.

574
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,865
He should save his energy
while the two women fight

575
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,159
and wait for the victor in style.

576
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,745
And avoid Seo Min-jung in a debate,
at which she excels.

577
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,163
Seo Min-jung.

578
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,167
She is good indeed.

579
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,921
Come on, Ms. Oh.
You're stronger than this.

580
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,842
She has no weak points.
Her policies, campaign promises,

581
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,219
they're all perfect.

582
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,514
There's no chink in the armor

583
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,599
I can attack.

584
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,559
Even if there were, she wouldn't show it.

585
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:04,063
Her weakness is
the Reform Party of Korea's weakness.

586
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,983
She's using her party's assemblymen
as a shield to maintain her strength.

587
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,362
So what, do we try
to tear down those shields?

588
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,364
No need.

589
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,575
We're already attacking a weaker spot.

590
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,029
You're still an amazing masseuse.

591
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,867
Chairwoman Son must be missing your touch.

592
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,079
How unfortunate.

593
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,332
I may have two hands,

594
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,877
but I only want to serve one master.

595
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,525
I heard you got into politics.

596
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,694
You've become more daring.

597
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,488
She's rubbing off on me.

598
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:41,368
The candidate I'm helping
can be quite reckless.

599
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,203
So,

600
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,959
is it the funds for your campaign
that you want from me?

601
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,339
This is more of a business proposal.

602
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,091
I want you to invest in my candidate.

603
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,928
But you must know
who I'm currently supporting.

604
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:02,765
Of course.

605
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,852
You're the mountain
behind Assemblywoman Seo Min-jung.

606
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,313
You were the one who saw her potential

607
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:13,776
and made her
the irreplaceable servant of the people.

608
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,778
And?

609
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:21,116
The chemical plant in Hayu-dong.

610
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,661
Doesn't that belong to you?

611
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,375
I've heard that Ms. Seo Min-jung
is looking to propose

612
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,169
a bill to demolish that plant.

613
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,132
If you didn't know about that,

614
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,635
I'd say that your support for her

615
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,179
through her three terms
has all been in vain.

616
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:52,606
Do-hee, you really are the best
out of all the hunting hounds.

617
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,027
You fetched me
something quite interesting.

618
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,909
Your father was a successful politician
who served three terms,

619
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,871
but he was removed from office
in the midst of party struggles.

620
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:14,294
That caused your family to go under.
That must have upset you.

621
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:18,090
You knew what power could do
at a very young age,

622
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,759
so you want it back so badly.

623
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,387
You became an anchor

624
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,641
as a stepping stone
to rise up to where you used to be.

625
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,730
Were you the main anchor for four years?

626
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,444
It was four years, three months,
and nineteen days to be exact.

627
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,376
Your studio in Yeouido.

628
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,629
Did you ditch it?

629
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:06,472
Did you take the late Han I-seul
to that place too?

630
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,311
Answer me.

631
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:13,854
Did you?

632
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,239
That never happened.

633
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,284
Come in.

634
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:34,333
Here's the info
on Oh Kyung-sook's son that you requested.

635
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,918
What about her?

636
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,509
Does your wife know
you're having an affair with her?

637
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,726
She doesn't.

638
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,396
That's a relief.

639
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,400
I'm preparing a show
featuring you and your wife as a couple.

640
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,111
Be careful not to get caught until then.

641
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,799
Mom, what are you talking about?

642
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,552
Step away from the department store?

643
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:32,766
Your husband is running in the election,
and all you care about is your business?

644
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,061
So…

645
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,733
you want me to not only give up the tittle
bu stop working altogether?

646
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,027
Then who'll run it?

647
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,989
You're too busy
just with the duty-free shop.

648
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,574
Seo-jin will take over.

649
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,411
Oh my God. Mom, are you serious?

650
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,085
So you just focus on the election
for now, Chae-ryoung.

651
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,088
Do exactly as Mr. Yoon tells you.

652
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,006
Mr. Yoon?

653
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,426
Mom, did he join the campaign?

654
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,388
We can win this if you don't mess up.

655
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,399
Mom.

656
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,776
Not the department store.

657
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,697
I gave up my share
of the duty-free shop to build it up.

658
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:32,701
The election and the department store,
I can manage both on my--

659
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,119
When have you ever

660
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,914
done anything on your own?

661
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,921
Do-hee was the one who paved the way,

662
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,631
wheeled you down the road,

663
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,342
and even cleaned up after you.

664
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,385
What can you manage on your own?

665
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,723
Are you going to let Do-hee

666
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,101
walk all over your husband?

667
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,066
Support your husband.

668
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:09,112
Don't expect anything from me
until Jae-min becomes mayor.

669
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,345
You said, "Let's have a steak,"

670
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,222
so I thought it'd be beef.

671
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,224
But it's fish.

672
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,227
It's better for your health.

673
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,364
Well, ma'am.

674
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:57,369
I was thinking I'd expand my campaign
during this election.

675
00:49:57,452 --> 00:50:02,541
We'll get some grade-A help
and increase our spending on PR

676
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,252
to get a head start
before candidate registration.

677
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,212
You'll help, right?

678
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:14,136
The salmon steak here is pretty good.

679
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,227
Salmon has a nasty habit.

680
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:28,233
They could just follow the river
down the stream, lay eggs there,

681
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,487
and just spend the season there
as befits them,

682
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:37,034
but they insist on
going back upstream to lay eggs

683
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,327
and end up dying.

684
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,249
I don't think I understand.

685
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:47,210
Ms. Seo, I heard you're proposing a bill

686
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,422
to demolish a factory of mine
in Hayu-dong.

687
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,760
My gosh, ma'am.

688
00:50:56,553 --> 00:51:00,766
It's all just a show
to rally my electoral district.

689
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:06,146
As soon as the mayoral election's done,
the area will go to my trusted men,

690
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,775
and I'll delay the bill
from being passed as the mayor--

691
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,777
You should have told me first.

692
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,071
What if an article were released?

693
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,865
Ma'am. That won't ever happen.

694
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:21,536
So, you don't care if you bring me harm
as long as you can win the election?

695
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:25,499
That's not wise when it was my money
that got you this far.

696
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,461
Unless you want to die
before laying your eggs.

697
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,559
What's gotten into that old snake?

698
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,728
I heard she had a meeting recently.

699
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,646
What?

700
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,780
They're going after my wallet?

701
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,076
-Call a meeting right now.
-Sorry?

702
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,495
Get the cue sheets for the debate,

703
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,206
and get me every fault you can find
on Oh Kyung-sook,

704
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,999
down to moles on her body. Now!

705
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:13,421
This shows you
the target's history and MO.

706
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,423
She has a tendency to frame workers

707
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,343
as this passive group
that can do nothing for themselves.

708
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,434
It seems that many people think

709
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,854
that you could help the citizens of Seoul

710
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:32,649
better as an activist instead of a mayor.

711
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,151
What do you think about that?

712
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,987
Isn't that your personal opinion?

713
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,406
Citizens of Seoul!

714
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,325
We must all unleash our anger!

715
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:45,579
All this is
due to the greed, recklessness,

716
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,290
and illegal activities
of the conglomerates.

717
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:52,210
Their greed knows no bounds,

718
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,547
and they will soon get
what's coming to them.

719
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,719
When overdone, body language
will ruin a good speech.

720
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:04,306
Stay composed. Be calm and polite.

721
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,600
That makes you look impenetrable.

722
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,106
And stop sticking your chin out.

723
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:25,202
Citizens of Seoul, the issue
I'd like to bring to your attention today

724
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:30,332
is the uneven distribution
of income and wealth in Seoul.

725
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:34,502
What do you think about the disappearance
of the middle class in Seoul?

726
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,141

729
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,464
All right.

730
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,257
Let's go!

CREATE A NEW TOMORROW FOR SEOUL TOGETHER

732
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:56,121
Today is the first live TV debate
between the mayoral candidates.

733
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,082
For the first time in history,
two women candidates

734
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:02,794
will face off head-to-head live on air.

735
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,629

741
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,849
Hello.

742
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,559
-Hello.
-Good morning.

743
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,312
-Thank you. I'm a little late.
-Oh, hello, sir.

744
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,648
Are you done already?

745
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,526
I guess there's not much to do
with such flawless skin.

746
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,444
You're right.

747
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:31,531
We just brightened her skin tone a little
to better fit today's event.

748
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,783
Sounds good. You look lovely.

749
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,250
Why waste my time
with the anniversary of your foundation?

750
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,378
You can go.

751
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,135
Well.

752
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:57,182
It'll raise the spirits of the employees
before the election campaign begins.

753
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,857
Do you really have to run for mayor?

754
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,073
I can make things easier for you
with this new title.

755
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,910
The same goes for our twins.

756
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,414
Why did you fire Do-hee?

757
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,001
Wasn't that your mother's decision?

758
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,879
Did you harass Do-hee?

759
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,054
Then it must be her. The dead girl.

760
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,683
Chae-ryoung.

761
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:45,688
You will soon become
the first lady of Seoul.

762
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,943
There's no need to be jealous
of a dead servant--

763
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,196
You…

764
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,032
better become mayor.

765
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,009
Ms. Seo, how do you think
today's debate will go?

766
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,804
I think it will be friendly.

767
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,766
Today's debate isn't to review
each other's policies.

768
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,560
It's more like a meeting.

769
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,895
Does that mean you'll go easy on her?

770
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,774
It seems that Oh Kyung-sook's
campaign team is very worried.

771
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:32,068
About losing face, you know.

772
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:36,072
Oh, come now. There's no need for that.

773
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:41,035
I'll just give her a taste
of what it's like to be a politician.

774
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,538
You never cease to impress, ma'am.

775
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:07,103

Don't worry about it.

01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,465
I'm not.

788
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,553
