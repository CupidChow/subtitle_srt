1
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:17,350
Are you sure?

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:22,355
My gut tells me they'll try to end it all
during the debate

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,607
by turning Ji-yeon's death into a suicide.

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,693
They're insane. They really are.

5
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,653
God, those sons of bitches.

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,988
Oh Kyung-sook.

7
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,614
You trust me, right?

8
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,992
I'm going to save Guk Ji-yeon.

9
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,369
Do-hee, what do you mean?

10
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:37,954
I mean, what if you…

11
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,500
Where are you right now?

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,752
I'll bring her to you

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,796
before the debate ends, at any cost.
Stall as long as you can.

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,758
If we lose here, it's over for us.

15
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,360
What the hell?

16
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:10,779
Jeez.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,618
Yes, Dong-joo.

18
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,996
Ms. Hwang. I'm sorry.
I just lost those bastards.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,955
Shit.

20
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,077
2023 SEOUL MAYORAL BY-ELECTION
CANDIDATE DEBATE

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,454
We will now begin
the final candidate debate

22
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,581
of the 39th Seoul Mayoral By-election.

23
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,709
This debate is being broadcast live
on five TV channels

24
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,920
and web portals.

25
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:12,882
Candidates, could you each begin
by greeting the citizens of Seoul?

26
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,886
Esteemed citizens of Seoul,

27
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,307
I am standing here today
with a solemn heart.

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,729
I won't be swayed by the malicious rumors
and allegations against me

29
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:32,527
and will only focus on sharing with you
my visions and policies

30
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,404
as an administrator.

31
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,573
Let me prove myself.

32
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,702
Truth doesn't bend or break,

33
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,581
no matter how much pressure
is applied to it from outside.

34
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,541
I, Oh Kyung-sook the Rhino,

35
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,628
will do my best today so that
what is said today can be the final cry

36
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,840
that marks the beginning of a world

37
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,801
where truth prevails.

38
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,011
Thank you.

39
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,638
Today's debate will have
no rules or time limits.

40
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,807
It will be a free-form debate.

41
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,186
I look forward to a fair
and insightful debate

42
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,770
between the two of you.

43
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,689
Ms. Hwang.

44
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:12,609
Those bastards
got on the Chuncheon Highway earlier.

45
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,652
They should be exiting near Hwacheon soon.

46
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,570
Hwacheon?

47
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:19,866
Yes. There are a lot of reservoirs there
but not a lot of foot traffic.

48
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,035
I'll keep you updated on their location.

49
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,203
All right.

50
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,748
Can I go first?

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,667
Sure. Go ahead, Candidate Oh.

52
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,627
Thank you.

53
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,670
Candidate Baek.

54
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,926
I'd like to begin the debate
on the topic of Eunsung Group.

55
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,387
So, the construction of the duty-free shop
has been completed, right?

56
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,140
Yes, everything has been completed.

57
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,726
And we've already held a soft opening.

58
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,604
From what I've learned,

59
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:53,233
there seems to be
some pretty uplifting news.

60
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,070
I was told that there were zero casualties

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,075
during the construction
of what is now Asia's highest skyscraper.

62
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,285
That's right. Thank you.

63
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,873
I believe it's due to our dedication
to upholding safety standards.

64
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,667
Perhaps,

65
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,586
but I beg to differ.

66
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,800
I believe you dedicated your efforts
not to safety

67
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,388
but to maintaining your connections.

68
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,228
Excuse me.

69
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,399
Are you referring to this?

70
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,069
EUNSUNG DUTY-FREE SHOP PERMIT LOBBY LIST
DISINFORMATION

71
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,660
Mr. Ma, what just happened?

72
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,037
Why is our silver bullet

73
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,081
in the hands of those bastards?

74
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,834
It must have been leaked

75
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,711
by an inside source.

76
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,923
We came across
this baseless disinformation

77
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,885
and are conducting an investigation
to find out who created this list.

78
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,928
What did you say?

79
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,055
Did you call it baseless disinformation?

80
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,142
Does this list make
any sense to you, then?

81
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,810
If you look here,

82
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,145
from the Blue House

83
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,315
to the prosecution to National Assembly
to civil servants of Seoul,

84
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,860
it lists countless people
who work for the government.

85
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,781
On top of that, it even reveals
the amount with which they were bribed.

86
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,825
Yes. So, all of those people--

87
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,743
Could it be

88
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,246
that your campaign office

89
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,582
fabricated

90
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,584
this fake list?

91
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,585
Fabricated?

92
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,337
Why would we do such a thing?

93
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,089
If you brought this list here tonight
knowing it was fake,

94
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,801
it would be a clear violation
of the election law.

95
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,656
I'm going to save Guk Ji-yeon.

96
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,408
I'll bring her to you

97
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,453
before the debate ends, at any cost.
Stall as long as you can.

98
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,127
Candidate Baek.

99
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,045
Yes?

100
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,006
You just claimed
that the list was fabricated.

101
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,092
Even if the list really were fabricated,

102
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,761
just the fact that such rumors
are circulating in Seoul

103
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,971
causes great anxiety to Seoul citizens.

104
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,266
You promised to share the duty-free shop
with Seoul citizens,

105
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,979
but shouldn't you first resolve
these sources of anxiety for the citizens?

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,481
Indeed, you're right.

107
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,153
So I'd like to make a suggestion
to Candidate Baek Jae-min.

108
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,620
Let us form a safety inspection team
made up entirely of citizens of Seoul

109
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:57,041
and have them double-check everything
from the duty-free shop's safety

110
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,462
to how its permits were issued
through a fair and transparent process.

111
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,631
What do you think?

112
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,656
Candidate Baek?
Are you refusing to give an answer?

113
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:33,119
You think it's okay to disregard
the opinions of Seoul citizens?

114
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,289
Of course, I'd love
for the citizens of Seoul to--

115
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,206
Excuse me.

116
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,084
Well,

117
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,962
we have breaking news
for our two candidates

118
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,630
and the voters watching at home.

119
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,469
It seems that Ms. Guk Ji-yeon,
Candidate Baek's aide,

120
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,970
just posted a suicide note

121
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,473
on her social media account.

122
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,810
It's on the screen as we speak.

123
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,779
I'm Guk Ji-yeon.

124
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,783
The rumor about the affair
between me and Mr. Baek is entirely false.

125
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:18,122
It was fabricated by Campaign Manager
Hwang Do-hee, my former boss.

126
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,627
I no longer have the courage to live
in this hell I am trapped in.

127
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,378
Candidate Baek,

128
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:29,008
my last wish is that you create a world
where truth always prevails.

129
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,636
Attorney Oh.

130
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,306
Yes.

131
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,268
Is what is said on that note true?

132
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,650
Hwang Do-hee,
the manager of your campaign,

133
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,530
fabricated the rumor about an affair
between Ms. Guk and me

134
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:54,033
and drove this innocent woman to suicide.

135
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,911
Someone in your own campaign did this,

136
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,080
and you didn't know anything?

137
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,042
That's right. I knew nothing.

138
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,002
No.

139
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,548
I couldn't have known

140
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,636
because our campaign office
never fabricated such--

141
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,137
Enough of your wordplay!

142
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,100
Covering up the misdeeds of people
who work for you

143
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,310
is justice to you?

144
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,187
Is that your definition of justice?

145
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,108
You start a witch hunt against
a pregnant woman to win an election--

146
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,025
Stop!

147
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,737
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,865
Start a witch hunt? Who did that?

149
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,701
I did no such thing!

150
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,411
How do you explain this?

151
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,538
My aide

152
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,250
decided to take her own life
because of you.

153
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,005
Whether she decided to take her own life,

154
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,882
or she was forced to take her own life,

155
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,428
we don't know yet, do we?

156
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,850
Let's change the perspective here.

157
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,852
If the rumors about your affair

158
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,938
and the illegitimate child are true,

159
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,566
who would be the most relieved

160
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,069
by Ms. Guk Ji-yeon's death?

161
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,492
Wouldn't it be you, Candidate Baek?

162
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,038
Is that why

163
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,792
you're claiming that she's already dead
when we still don't know

164
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,128
whether she's alive or not?

165
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,505
Is that it?

166
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,513
Even at this moment,
Ms. Guk could be struggling

167
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,059
with every ounce of her strength
to survive.

168
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,245
Dear citizens.

169
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,083
In the impossible scenario that
Candidate Baek's scandal is revealed

170
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,794
to have been fabricated
by people in my camp,

171
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,754
I will…

172
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,926
withdraw my candidacy
and take full legal responsibility

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,720
for all that's happened.

174
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,765
But if it's proved otherwise…

175
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,233
you will have to pay the price…

176
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,820
for your crimes.

177
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,863
Candidate Oh.

178
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,994
With all this happening…

179
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,166
is the election all you care about?

180
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,544
Absolutely not.

181
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,089
It's not the election I care about.

182
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,425
It's the truth.

183
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,470
Okay.

184
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:03,431
All right.

185
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,392
I'll give it all up.

186
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:11,522
What could be more important
than Ms. Guk's well-being right now?

187
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,192
So, Ms. Guk,

188
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,945
I beg of you.

189
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,533
It's okay. It will all pass in due time,
so please…

190
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,246
do not give up on your life.

191
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,129
From this moment,

192
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,298
I will stop

193
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,426
participating in this pointless debate

194
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,096
and put all my efforts
into finding Ms. Guk.

195
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,890
Dear citizens.

196
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,019
Please help Ms. Guk Ji-yeon

197
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,147
return to us alive.

198
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,398
Guk Ji-yeon!

199
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,192
Wake up!

200
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,715
Sir, we have a problem.

201
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:27,097
25 HOURS UNTIL THE 39TH
SEOUL MAYORAL BY-ELECTION

202
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,772
Traces of Ms. Guk Ji-yeon,
who left behind a will and disappeared,

203
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,483
have been found in a reservoir
in the Chuncheon area.

204
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,360
It seems that Ms. Guk attempted suicide

205
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,154
by burning a coal briquette
in a rented vehicle,

206
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,366
and she was not at the scene
when her vehicle was found.

207
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,536
The police have reported
finding two men in their late twenties

208
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,706
at the reservoir
where Ms. Guk's vehicle was found.

209
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,792
They were both unconscious
and are being transported to a hospital.

210
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,753
One was identified as a member
of Candidate Oh's campaign staff.

211
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,380
Oh my God.

212
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,675
Dong-joo! Dong-joo! Can you hear me? Hey!

213
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,719
Do you recognize me?

214
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,762
What about Do-hee? What happened to her?

215
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,514
Dong-joo!

216
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,442
You son of a bitch!

217
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,698
Are you all right?

218
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,616
Yes.

219
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,701
Ji-yeon.

220
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,086
Jackass!

221
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,556
Get the door!

222
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,062
-Hurry!
-Hey!

223
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,147
-Stop!
-Get in!

224
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,778
-Open the door!
-You bastard!

225
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,617
Go on without me! Hurry!

226
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,160
Hey, get out of there!

227
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:35,744
Ms. Guk Ji-yeon's whereabouts
are still unknown.

228
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,329
What happened?

229
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,456
Hwang Do-hee must've followed them.

230
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,334
There's only a day to go
until the election.

231
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,670
Even if Guk Ji-yeon resurfaces alive,

232
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,298
we just need to pull the wool
over the voters' eyes

233
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,551
until the election is over.

234
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,137
So, it will all go away

235
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,347
the moment I'm elected?

236
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,558
The winner takes all?
Because that's what elections are?

237
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,226
Absolutely.

238
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,022
Guys. It's now one day to D-day.

239
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,525
Start a full-blown witch hunt on Oh
using all legacy media.

240
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,987
Gather our most loyal supporters
and start bombing her.

241
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,783
We'll back her into a corner
until the very end. Understood?

242
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,993
-Understood!
-Yes, sir!

243
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,411
-Kim.
-Yes, sir.

244
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,709
Footage released of Candidate Oh's
General Campaign Manager, Hwang Do-hee,

245
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,878
visiting Ms. Guk Ji-yeon's home

246
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,296
has shocked many.

247
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,507
The footage lends further credibility
to Ms. Guk's suicide note,

248
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,426
which claims that Hwang blackmailed her.

249
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,388
The public is incensed, saying
that Candidate Oh must've known about this

250
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,266
and is demanding her withdrawal.

251
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,603
Oh Kyung-sook the murderer must withdraw!

252
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,563
-Withdraw!
-Withdraw!

253
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,816
Arrest the witch, Hwang Do-hee!

254
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,610
-Arrest her!
-Arrest her!

255
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,572
Everyone.
Let's bring Oh Kyung-sook down ourselves!

256
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,164
A great number of citizens gathered

257
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,417
in front of Oh's campaign office,
demanding her withdrawal.

258
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,963
She fabricated the rumor about an affair
between Candidate Baek and Ms. Guk,

259
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,215
and threatened Guk…

260
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,176
Ms. Oh. Don't let this get to you.

261
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,678
You must stay strong to the end.

262
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,473
…is currently in hiding,
refusing to give any statements.

263
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,562
Hey!

264
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,357
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,234
How dare you cause mayhem here!

266
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,902
-Let's get in there!
-Move!

267
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,795
Divided, we die

268
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:54,091
To waver is to die

269
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,803
We go forth as one

270
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,473
Until the day of victory

271
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,019
I will keep the promises
I made to my comrades

272
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,857
Even if my skull is split in half

273
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,443
United under the union's flag

274
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,072
We overcame the violence of the thugs

275
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,285
United through strikes and fights

276
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,425
United through strikes and fights

277
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,970
We will go forth
Under the flag of liberation

278
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,555
Hwa-soo.

279
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,268
Hwa-soo.

280
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,481
Kyung-sook. Let's fight until the end.

281
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,358
We'll protect you.

282
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,527
Hwa-soo.

283
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,114
I will keep the promises
I made to my comrades

284
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,326
Even if my skull is split in half

285
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,413
United under the union's flag

286
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,292
We overcame the violence of the thugs

287
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,049
OH KYUNG-SOOK'S WOMAN POWER

288
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,217
Welcome.

289
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,886
You're watching
Oh Kyung-sook's Woman Power.

290
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,846
I'm Oh Kyung-sook the Rhino.

291
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,767
It's been a long time
since I've greeted you on my channel.

292
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:32,356
I intend to resume Woman Power again,
along with my comrades.

293
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,444
As I mentioned in the live debate,

294
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:43,075
I still believe that Ms. Guk Ji-yeon
was forced into attempting suicide.

295
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,618
But

296
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,247
I have not yet given up hope

297
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,582
that she is still alive.

298
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,002
Through this live stream,

299
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,757
I'd like to prove our innocence
and reveal the truth, reveal everything

300
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,302
about this incident.

301
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,362
Are you feeling okay?

302
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,784
Why did you save me?

303
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,621
Why did you save me?

304
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,917
Is it so that you could make me

305
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,212
stand in front of everyone again

306
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,090
and tell them the truth your way?

307
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,511
You saved me to make Oh Kyung-sook mayor.

308
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,888
Do you want the sympathy vote

309
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,850
by portraying me as a helpless woman…

310
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,187
who fell victim to Baek Jae-min?

311
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,125
I didn't save you.

312
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,337
I saved myself.

313
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,715
You're another victim of Baek Jae-min.

314
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,511
I couldn't allow you to die because of me.

315
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,434
Like I-seul did.

316
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,479
If

317
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,899
Ms. Guk does not come back to us alive

318
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:43,987
and this whole tragedy is revealed to be
my and Ms. Hwang Do-hee's fault,

319
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,073
I'll go to the authorities

320
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,075
for my punishment.

321
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,620
I will gladly accept any punishment
they decide to give me.

322
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,038
Dear viewers.

323
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,583
The truth will prevail.

324
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,670
Please put your trust in me,
Oh Kyung-sook,

325
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,882
and show me your support

326
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,344
so that the truth may prevail.

327
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,181
With a day to go
until the Seoul Mayoral By-election,

328
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:15,477
the final campaigns that will decide
the candidates' fates are in full force.

329
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,771
First, Candidate Baek Jae-min of the KRP

330
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,107
is giving a speech
in front of his supporters,

331
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,900
who have gathered outside City Hall.

332
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,360
Dear citizens of Seoul.

333
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,280
Seoul is our home and our dream.

334
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:32,411
How can we let a woman
who tried to scapegoat another woman

335
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,164
for her own electoral gains
take charge of our dreams?

336
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,458
-We must not!
-We cannot!

337
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,796
I, Baek Jae-min,
will protect Seoul, your dream.

338
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,758
I will do everything I can
to protect Seoul,

339
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,888
our dream, from those vicious people!

340
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,059
Meanwhile, Candidate Oh
has chosen live stream

341
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,104
as the last push in her campaign
instead of taking to the streets.

342
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,772
Speculation is rife that this is due to

343
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,359
Oh being aware of public sentiment
around the Guk Yi-Jeon incident.

344
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:05,861
Dear citizens.

345
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,822
The truth cannot be washed away.

346
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,867
The waves of our faith in each other
and our solidarity

347
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,036
will make the truth surface again.

348
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,542
And it will be the foundation
upon which we can build a better world.

349
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,714
Excuse me.

350
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,550
I'm sorry. Coming through.

351
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,469
Make way, please!

352
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,220
Make way!

353
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,307
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

354
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,017
Please, if you could move aside.

355
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,857
She's alive!

356
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,025
My goodness.

357
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:46,735
She's alive.

358
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,739
She's not dead. Oh my goodness.

359
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,365
Dear citizens.

360
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,787
The person we've all been

361
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:02,334
desperately waiting for
has just arrived at our office,

362
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,171
safe and sound.

363
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,025
Everyone. It's Ms. Guk Ji-yeon.

364
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,283
Have a seat.

365
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,582
First of all…

366
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,170
I'd like to express
my sincere gratitude to everyone

367
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,715
who has been worried about me.

368
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:55,929
I…

369
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,142
was involved in an affair…

370
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,604
with Candidate Baek Jae-min.

371
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,694
And…

372
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,573
the biological father of my child

373
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,201
is Mr. Baek Jae-min.

374
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,874
Candidate Baek Jae-min

375
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,044
didn't want the truth to come out.

376
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,966
So he kidnapped and tried to kill me…

377
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,887
and attempted to frame my death
as a suicide.

378
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,327
I…

379
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,873
want to live.

380
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,879
The wrongs I committed in the past

381
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,757
have put me in a hell
that I'm struggling to get out of.

382
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,551
But I was the one who made those choices,

383
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,180
so I will pay the price for my wrongdoing…

384
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,475
no matter how harsh it is…

385
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,395
for the rest of my life.

386
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,110
Are you all right?

387
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,326
Ms. Guk.

388
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,537
Thank you for your…

389
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,916
courageous confession.

390
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,126
And above all,

391
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,128
I want to thank you…

392
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,799
for coming back to us alive.

393
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,512
If you have anything else

394
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,264
you'd like to tell the world,

395
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,975
please feel free.

396
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,984
I would like to thank…

397
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,823
my former boss, Ms. Hwang Do-hee.

398
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,412
She rescued me from the web of lies

399
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,832
that was my own creation.

400
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,123
Ms. Guk Ji-yeon's confession
has shocked the entire nation.

401
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,001
She confessed that she did have an affair
with Candidate Baek

402
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,712
and that Candidate Baek
attempted to murder her.

403
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,547
The public is appalled by this.

404
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:22,218
With Ms. Guk's reappearance, the results
of this election are once again in doubt.

405
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,492
SECRETARY HAN I-SEUL

406
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,994
HAN I-SEUL

407
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,257
Your first time here?

408
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,928
I should've invited you sooner.

409
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,140
But I was waiting for the right time.

410
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,060
Right time?

411
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:12,977
No.

412
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,606
Chance is more like it.

413
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,155
The last chance for you to give I-seul…

414
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,493
a sincere apology.

415
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,665
Fine, I get it.

416
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,000
I will…

417
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,213
apologize to her sincerely,

418
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,132
so give me I-seul's cell phone.

419
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,181
Don't tell me you still haven't given up.

420
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,352
Are you going to say
that I blackmailed Ji-yeon into making

421
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:56,729
a false confession?

422
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,273
That's none of your business.

423
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,150
Regardless, it'd still be best for us

424
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,987
if I become mayor.

425
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,281
For us?

426
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:11,160
We were both unwelcome additions
to Eunsung, and we went through so much.

427
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,371
If I become mayor,

428
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,126
I'll compensate you for all the hard years
you had to endure. So--

429
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,378
You want to keep I-seul suffering in hell?

430
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:27,135
It's not like exposing this
will bring her back.

431
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,532
It's shocking how your kind never changes.

432
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,994
You shamelessly deny your crimes,

433
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,623
offer a price, and say
you'll do anything when you're cornered.

434
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,417
It's despicable.

435
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,588
Admit that you were wrong

436
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,300
and sincerely apologize for your sins.

437
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,845
That should be enough.

438
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,806
Sincerely?

439
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,810
Dear citizens.

440
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,854
Unfortunately,

441
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,608
I have the voice of another woman

442
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,361
whom we couldn't save.

443
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,157
The wrongdoer…

444
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,078
should pay for what they did.

445
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,041
I admit that I made you feel bad.

446
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,168
Feel…

447
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,129
bad?

448
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,549
I can see why you feel that way.

449
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:54,138
I'll do whatever you want
as a token of my apology,

450
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,140
so ask for anything.

451
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,686
I'll transfer you if you feel uneasy
in your current team.

452
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,983
If you want to see a wider world,
I'll transfer you to our overseas branch.

453
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,611
If you're short of money,
I can offer financial--

454
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,529
Fine.

455
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,909
I'll do as you say.

456
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,625
But on one condition.

457
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,795
Tell the world

458
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,881
what you did

459
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,010
and publicly apologize to me.

460
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,763
Then I'll forgive you.

461
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,182
-Hey, Han I-seul--
-Don't you dare say my name!

462
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:42,395
Not until I forgive you.

463
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,578
Don't touch me!

464
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,663
Are you going to take this all the way?

465
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,581
Let go!

466
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:06,210
-If you do, it'll only hurt you! Got it?
-Let go! Let go of me!

467
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,296
-Let go!
-I'll make it up to you.

468
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,131
I'll compensate you for everything!

469
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,340
-So, please!
-Let go!

470
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,717
Stay still, for God's sake!

471
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,719
-Don't touch me!
-Stop wriggling!

472
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:50,546
When Candidate Baek was the director
of the Greenpeople Foundation,

473
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,425
a 27-year-old employee named Han I-seul

474
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:00,306
was thought to have committed suicide
due to stress from overwork.

475
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,686
But that was not the truth.

476
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,400
She was sexually assaulted
by Candidate Baek.

477
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,115
And in return for asking Baek
for a sincere apology…

478
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,952
she was murdered.

479
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,621
There was only a day left.

480
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,124
Do you know what you've done?

481
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,919
Yoon Dae-cheol.

482
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:35,424
Your father was a politician on track
to become the next president.

483
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,846
But that campaign master framed him
as corrupt, driving him to suicide.

484
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:40,763
What?

485
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,560
And Chairwoman Son
hired him as your handler,

486
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,687
knowing perfectly well what happened.

487
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,818
What are you talking about?

488
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:56,654
I've been keeping an eye
on this Carl Yoon for a long time.

489
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,615
The man never plays a game he might lose

490
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,035
and is the first to bail out
when the game turns sour.

491
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,122
Why would he stand by your side
despite all your weaknesses?

492
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,624
A promise to Chairwoman Son?
His desire to win?

493
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,253
I'm sure both played a part.
But the key reason

494
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,132
is the guilt he felt over your father.

495
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,843
He was using you

496
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,347
as a way of easing his remorse.

497
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,791
This is what people call comeuppance.

498
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,422
All you were is a puppet,

499
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:01,010
with your nemesis, the man
who killed your dad, pulling the strings.

500
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,649
When you wrong someone,

501
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,486
you should come clean and apologize.

502
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,489
Not cover it up

503
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,534
by committing an even worse sin.

504
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:17,795
Ms. Han I-seul

505
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,339
was our daughter,

506
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,927
our sister, and our friend,
and she wanted to live.

507
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,099
She never once gave in to injustice

508
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,019
or made compromises.

509
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,698
I'll do whatever you want
as a token of my apology,

510
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,366
so ask for anything.

511
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,911
Tell the world what you did

512
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,539
and publicly apologize to me.

513
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,750
-Hey, Han I-seul--
-Don't touch me!

514
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,544
-Are you going to take this all the way?
-Let go!

515
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,129
If you do, it'll only hurt you!

516
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,756
-Got it?
-Let go!

517
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,715
Let go of me!

518
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,342
Stay still, for God's sake!

519
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,384
Don't touch me!

520
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,263
I, Oh Kyung-sook, will win
and create a world

521
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,682
where truth prevails,

522
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,101
so Ms. Han will not have died in vain.

523
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,187
RECORDING OF BAEK'S MURDER
OF HIS SECRETARY

524
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,482
I sincerely hope the late Ms. Han I-seul

525
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,443
may rest in peace.

526
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,431
SEOUL MAYORAL BY-ELECTION REMAINS ON TRACK

527
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,558
Voting for the 39th
Seoul Mayoral By-election

528
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,143
is underway without any hitches.

529
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,562
VOTER TURNOUT 12.7%
4% HIGHER THAN THE LAST ELECTION

530
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,355
CHANGCHEON-DONG POLLING PLACE 2

531
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,233
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook showed up
to vote early,

532
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,570
accompanied by her husband,
the poet, Kang Moon-bok.

533
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,865
Perhaps the public's rage
over Candidate Baek's recording

534
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,117
is being transferred
to the polling booths.

535
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,661
As of now, voter turnout is the highest

536
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,580
in the history of local elections.

537
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,248
Okay.

538
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,675
Ma'am. Public opinion doesn't look good.

539
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,261
People are saying you had your son-in-law

540
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,307
enter the race
knowing he'd killed his secretary.

541
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,396
And the prosecution?

542
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,191
Things don't look so good
with them either.

543
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,818
A special prosecution is likely to begin

544
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,863
as soon as Oh is elected
to come after the duty-free shop.

545
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,115
What in the world are you saying?

546
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,414
Jae-min.

547
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,210
Because of that fool, Jae-min,

548
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,255
they're going after the duty-free shop?

549
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,217
Candidate Baek represents

550
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,886
the Eunsung Group, you know.

551
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,990
So far, about 50% of the votes
have been counted

552
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,619
in the 39th Seoul Mayoral By-election.

553
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,206
The Reform Party of Korea's Candidate Oh
is in the lead by a landslide,

554
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:25,751
taking 83% of the votes so far,
ensuring her victory.

555
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:30,047
Meanwhile, Candidate Baek
has not made any public appearances

556
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,091
since the recording was released.

557
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,263
Your father would have been proud

558
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,224
if he could see you right now.

559
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,644
You knew my father?

560
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,066
We could have become friends

561
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,069
if he hadn't passed away so soon.

562
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,139
I have no excuse, ma'am.

563
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,685
It's my fault.

564
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,230
I shouldn't have tried

565
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,819
to put him in a place of power
knowing he lacked what it took.

566
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,364
I overplayed my hand.

567
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,783
I'll clean this up and--

568
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,493
It's already underway.

569
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,665
Jae-min shall take all of the blame.

570
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,502
Ma'am.

571
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,901
A rock that rolled into the garden
of our home

572
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,362
had the audacity

573
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,199
to insist on becoming
the pillar of this family

574
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,700
and ended up making this mess.

575
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,504
Now, I must remove it

576
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,926
to keep my house intact, don't you agree?

577
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,304
It'll be as if nothing happened.

578
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:05,035
The ballot count
of the 39th Seoul Mayoral By-election

579
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,291
will now come to an end in
ten, nine, eight, seven, six.

580
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,921
-Five, four, three, two, one!
-Five, four, three, two, one!

581
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,507
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook
of the Reform Party of Korea

582
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,885
has won
the 39th Seoul Mayoral By-election.

583
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:26,807
After such a fierce
and controversial election campaign,

584
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,226
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook
of the Reform Party of Korea

585
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,061
has been elected as mayor of Seoul.

586
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,523
Congratulations, Ms. Oh.
I'm so proud of you!

587
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,152
I foresee another ten years for our party!

588
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,408
You did so well. Gosh, you worked so hard.

589
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,578
SEOUL MAYORAL BY-ELECTION
BALLOT COUNTING SITUATION ROOM

590
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,831
Oh Kyung-sook!

591
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,166
It really is over now.

592
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:55,669
I guess so.

593
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,257
I know I put you through a lot.

594
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:05,763
I thought you'd really
gotten yourself killed this time.

595
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:07,806
Thank you

596
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,267
for always caring about me.

597
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:15,856
Thank you!

598
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,298
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook
of the Reform Party of Korea

599
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,218
has won the Seoul Mayoral By-election.

600
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,471
Candidate Oh, who won
in a dramatic landslide victory,

601
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:50,057
taking 84% of the votes,

602
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,227
is celebrating this happy moment
in her campaign office,

603
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,979
accompanied by her husband,
the poet, Kang Moon-bok,

604
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,232
her campaign staff,
and her loyal supporters.

605
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,150
The whereabouts of Candidate Baek…

606
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,777
He's lost the election.

607
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,614
What more can he do
in the land of the living?

608
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,535
The police are trying
to locate Candidate Baek.

609
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,913
The enraged citizens of Seoul are waiting

610
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,623
for him to make his appearance,

611
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:17,751
as he has been accused of murder
and sexual assault.

612
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,577
Seoul Mayoral Candidate, Baek Jae-min,
has been found dead.

613
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,037
Having been suspected
of murder and sexual assault,

614
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,957
he seems to have taken
his own life last night.

615
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,626
A handwritten suicide note
was found at the scene.

616
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,921
In it, he wrote that the accusations
of sexual assault and murder

617
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,007
exposed by Candidate Oh are all true,

618
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,009
and apologized to his wife and her family

619
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,720
for having dragged their name
through the mud.

620
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:42,127
THE RHINO NEVER DIES
OH KYUNG-SOOK NEVER DIES

621
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,964
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

622
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,010
SEOUL, WHERE CITIZENS ARE HAPPY
OH KYUNG-SOOK

623
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,848
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

624
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:06,068
A NEW SEOUL BUILT TOGETHER
WITH THE PEOPLE OF SEOUL

625
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,403
CANDIDATE OH, CONGRATULATIONS
ON BECOMING MAYOR OF SEOUL

626
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,285
Dear citizens of Seoul.

627
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,163
Thank you.

628
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:23,168
My victory today

629
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:29,466
is a victory for you,
the citizens of Seoul.

630
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,428
From today, I promise you all

631
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,556
I'll become a worker

632
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:38,934
you can rely on.

633
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,771
A Seoul that is great to live in.

634
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,524
A Seoul that you want to live in.

635
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,361
A Seoul worth living in.

636
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:56,493
That's the Seoul I will build
together with you.

637
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,416
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

638
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,085
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

639
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,891
We will now accept questions
from the press.

640
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,522
I'm sorry to be such a downer, but…

641
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,482
It's fine. You can ask me anything.

642
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:30,777
There is a rumor that your campaign

643
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:35,198
received illegal campaign funds
from Eunsung Group.

644
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,453
I'm IBC's Kim Cho-rong, by the way.

645
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:43,248
Yes, Ms. Kim Cho-rong of IBC. Okay.

646
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:48,128
But this is the first time
I've heard such a thing.

647
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,380
Then someone within your campaign

648
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,550
must have completely covered
your eyes and ears.

649
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,468
Or

650
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:58,597
maybe you're lying
to the citizens of Seoul.

651
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:00,766
That's impossible.

652
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,392
May I get an answer

653
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,896
from the manager
of your campaign, Ms. Hwang Do-hee?

654
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,774
Of course, yes. Go on.

655
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,985
You can hear it
from Ms. Hwang Do-hee herself.

656
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,278
Ms. Hwang Do-hee.

657
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,141
Ms. Hwang Do-hee.

658
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:47,604
Did you really not accept
illegal campaign funds

659
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,440
from Eunsung Group?

660
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,413
I did.

661
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:22,597
I…

662
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,812
received illegal campaign funds…

663
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,734
from Eunsung.

664
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,496
So let's say

665
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,959
I inherit Eunsung, and Oh Kyung-sook
becomes mayor, as you said.

666
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,920
What about you?

667
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,507
What do you get out of it?

668
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,770
Have it ready by tomorrow.

669
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,234
How can I come up
with 20 billion won in cash overnight?

670
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,779
That's your specialty, not mine.

671
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,667
There's an accounting firm

672
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,504
called the Golden Crown
in the Cayman Islands.

673
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,133
They manage your mom's slush fund.

674
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,346
Only family members
can access that account.

675
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,976
Withdraw 20 billion from there

676
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,355
and wire it to an account under my name.

677
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,567
All that money in your account?

678
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,487
Then you'll be tracked.

679
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,079
I'm doing it so they can track it.

680
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:15,835
They have to find out that the manager
of Candidate Oh's campaign

681
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,631
has received illegal campaign funds

682
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:25,262
so that they can investigate
your mom's slush fund account.

683
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,430
Are you

684
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,227
telling me to stab my mom in the back?

685
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:39,401
How else will you become
the leader of Eunsung Group?

686
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,735
Chae-ryoung aside,

687
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,363
you have to remove your mom

688
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,033
to become the real owner of Eunsung.

689
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,124
It's not like

690
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,585
you guys care about…

691
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,089
familial love.

692
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,726
Manager Hwang Do-hee
of Candidate Oh's campaign was arrested

693
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:16,563
on charges of accepting 20 billion won
of illegal campaign funds.

694
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,398
Hwang admitted to the charges,

695
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,901
saying she was wired 20 billion won
in cash by the accounting firm

696
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,947
that keeps Chairwoman Son's books
and that she used the money personally.

697
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:28,867
The prosecution started
its investigation of the firm

698
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,619
after finding evidence
it handled Son's slush funds,

699
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,496
totaling hundreds of billions of won.

700
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,137
All right. Everything is ready.

701
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,145
We'll begin the investigation
and arrest Chairwoman Son soon.

702
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,731
We'll use this slush fund account

703
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,776
to look into the bribes she paid
for her duty-free shop too.

704
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,944
Thank you.

705
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,907
Oh, please. You were the one
who did all the work, Ms. Hwang.

706
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,827
If you hadn't sacrificed yourself
to turn Chairwoman Son in,

707
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,373
I would never have dared to go after her.

708
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,502
Mayor-Elect Oh won't be caught up

709
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,506
in any of this,
just as you promised, right?

710
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,757
Candidate Oh…

711
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,300
Right!

712
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,177
I mean,

713
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:34,516
the mayor just needs to testify
that she didn't know anything about this.

714
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,184
Why did you do that?

715
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:19,853
Why?

716
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,274
Why did you have to sacrifice yourself?

717
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:27,777
Why? Why do you have
to suffer through this alone…

718
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,404
Oh Kyung-sook.

719
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,239
How am I supposed to work as mayor

720
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,783
after what's happened to you?

721
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,079
How can I?

722
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,999
This isn't a victory.

723
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,500
Snap out of it, Kyung-sook.

724
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,253
I made a strategic retreat

725
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,630
so you could have full reign
over Seoul as mayor.

726
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:48,673
Hwang Do-hee!

727
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,514
Because I met you…

728
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,649
I learned of a new and wonderful world…

729
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,239
and met incredible people
that I don't deserve.

730
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:21,331
If it weren't for you, I would've died
without knowing such fortune.

731
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,336
Even after death, I'd never have known.

732
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,427
I want you…

733
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,436
to keep that good fortune alive for me.

734
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,602
The real fight's only just begun.

735
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,571
Take the sword I've given you
and wield it properly.

736
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,996
I'll keep watching you.

737
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,560
Evidence has been found that

738
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:08,229
Eunsung's Chairwoman Son
used her slush fund to obtain

739
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,897
duty-free shop permits illegally.

740
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,443
Following the search and seizure
of Eunsung and the indictment of Son,

741
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,279
the prosecution plans to investigate
Eunsung Duty-free Shop.

742
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:20,450
The city has issued administrative orders
to impose restrictions on the business.

743
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,577
DUTY-FREE SHOP PERMIT EVALUATION
DIVIDENDS

744
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,370
As you can see here…

745
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,835
it would be no exaggeration to say
that Eunsung's duty-free shop

746
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:36,049
is a hunk of steel that's been built on
the foundation of illegal and shady deals.

747
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:41,179
Considering that, it'd be only right
to demolish it immediately.

748
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,308
But I would like to give you,
Eunsung Group,

749
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,977
one last chance to redeem yourselves.

750
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,189
A chance?

751
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,692
I suggest you transfer 90%
of the Eunsung Duty-Free Shop shares

752
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,028
to the public-private company

753
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,531
that will be established
by the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

754
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,624
You want me to hand over
90% of the shares?

755
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:13,461
The land that Eunsung Duty-Free Shop
is standing on now

756
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:17,799
was supposed to be used to provide
housing for low-income families of Seoul.

757
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,802
It was land reserved for Seoul's citizens.

758
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,596
In the future,
Eunsung Duty-Free Shop's shares

759
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,849
will be distributed evenly
to the ten million citizens of Seoul

760
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:32,063
through a public-private enterprise
that will be established by the city.

761
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:40,905
Oh, ma'am.

762
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,034
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Here, please take a seat.

763
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:56,963
Mayor Oh.

764
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,968
You seem very miffed with me
for some reason.

765
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:07,598
But you only serve

766
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,600
two years

767
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:11,769
as mayor.

768
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,064
You shake things up
with the duty-free shop,

769
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:19,694
but after the next election,
everything that you worked on will--

770
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:20,611
Not return

771
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,613
to the way they were.

772
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,408
I will never

773
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,787
let that happen.

774
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,374
So?

775
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,294
What will you do?

776
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:40,757
Are you saying that you'll take me down

777
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,719
when you're only a mere mayor?

778
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:46,804
I'm not just any mayor.

779
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:50,016
I'm a mayor put here by Hwang Do-hee.

780
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,438
Hwang Do-hee, who knows

781
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,442
everything about all your corruption
and the filth of Eunsung.

782
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:00,985
She was the one

783
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,114
who made it possible for me to be here.

784
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,327
Do you not understand…

785
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:12,955
what that means?

786
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:20,671
The thing is…

787
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:28,054
I have inherited much from Hwang Do-hee.

788
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:32,266
Your crime of blinding your employees
with the false fantasy

789
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:37,772
that they are your family under Eunsung,
and using it to exploit them.

790
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,817
Your crime of misappropriating
the group's assets

791
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,237
through stock manipulation,
accounting fraud, and tax evasion.

792
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,155
And

793
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,491
your crime of crossing lines,

794
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:53,162
even murdering people
to maintain ownership of Eunsung.

795
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,210
That's right.

796
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,423
I plan to make full use of the inheritance
Hwang Do-hee left me

797
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,135
to completely destroy the world

798
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,429
that you've created.

799
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:15,893
Oh Kyung-sook.

800
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:18,563
Right.

801
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:24,318
Did you say that my time as mayor
will only be two years?

802
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:27,196
Don't worry.

803
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,324
The things I've told you today.

804
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,077
I'll have completed them

805
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,497
within the next two months.

806
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:38,875
Goodbye, then.

807
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,950
Eunsung Group has brought in
professional business managers.

808
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,620
Acting President Eun Seo-jin,
the eldest child of Son Young-sim

809
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,121
who is currently under arrest,

810
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:19,624
has handed over 90%
of the duty-free shop's shares

811
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,751
to Seoul City's public-private company.

812
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,045
She also decided to hire
professional managers

813
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:27,131
for Eunsung's improvement and growth,
and resign as president,

814
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:28,966
leaving all rights to the managers.

815
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,937
How have you not even visited Mom once
since her arrest?

816
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,189
I can see right through you.

817
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,401
What have you done?

818
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,530
I couldn't put up with Oh Kyung-sook's
constant nagging.

819
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:53,407
It was a headache too.

820
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,244
With the duty-free shop
in the city's hands

821
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,205
and Eunsung's image in the gutter,

822
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:02,708
what good will being greedy do
other than lay more blame on us?

823
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,168
And business…

824
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,131
should be left to business experts.

825
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,599
We might have a CEO position
at the logistics company.

826
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:20,893
Do you want it?

827
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,397
You might not be an expert,

828
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,692
but you've got more
management training than me.

829
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,780
I'm still your older sister.

830
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,658
This is the least I should do.

831
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,453
You've been through so much…

832
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,792
being born into this shitty family.

833
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:51,716
Give it some thought.

834
01:06:57,304 --> 01:06:58,139
Jae-min…

835
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,811
Mom killed him, didn't she?

836
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,080
Beloved citizens of Seoul.

837
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:06,832
I will now report
on the first quarter results

838
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:10,795
of Seoul City and Eunsung Duty-Free Shop's
profit-sharing system.

839
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:14,840
Eunsung Duty-Free Shop's total profit
for this quarter is

840
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,967
three trillion and 400 million won.

841
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:20,304
And the amount paid out
to each of Seoul's citizens

842
01:08:20,387 --> 01:08:23,182
through the public-private company
the city has established

843
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,810
is 273,000 won.

844
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:30,523
This is a four-percent increase
compared to last year's average.

845
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,859
The city is currently working
to amend laws

846
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,821
that will create new work opportunities,
protect subcontractors,

847
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:40,366
and stabilize employment conditions.

848
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,661
We will keep monitoring
Eunsung Duty-Free Shop

849
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:46,622
so that it will continue
to fulfill its role

850
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:51,377
as a public asset
that works for the citizens of Seoul.

851
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,592
Inmate 1228, you have a visitor.

852
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,222
Ms. Hwang Do-hee.

853
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,141
Right?

854
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:51,520
The one who made Oh Kyung-sook the Rhino
mayor of Seoul.

855
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:02,948
Yes.

856
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,411
I am.

857
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,044
But who are you?

858
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,512
It seems that…

859
01:10:28,474 --> 01:10:29,975
I may need your assistance.
