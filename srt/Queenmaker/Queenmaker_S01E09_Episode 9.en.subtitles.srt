1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,683
2 OH KYUNG-SOOK

2
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,060
The workers' friend, Oh Kyung-sook

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,439
Friend to women, Oh Kyung-sook

4
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,774
A better world to live in together…

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,569
Dear fellow citizens of Seoul,
this is Oh Kyung-sook.

6
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,032
New Seoul, new politics!

7
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,702
I, the new face, Oh Kyung-sook,
will make politics

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:40,040
serve the common people
and make Seoul a city for our children!

9
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,332
Oh Kyung-sook!

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,132
You can trust Oh Kyung-sook

11
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,760
Candidate Number two, Oh Kyung-sook!

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:57,932
Yes. I also have a son around your age.

13
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,311
I promised my son one thing.

14
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,564
That he would have a happy adulthood

15
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,817
in a better world built by his mother.

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,238
Dear teens, our future voters,
I love you all!

17
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,159
Have a great day!

18
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,411
-Hey! You'll kill him.
-Stop!

19
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:38,306
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

20
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,016
Look, do you have a grudge against my son?

21
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,560
Have you seen him?

22
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,479
Hyun-woo.

23
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,821
Oh my gosh.

24
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:38,992
Oh gosh.

25
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,077
You must be quite shocked.

26
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,705
Let's find out what happened exactly--

27
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,956
Isn't it obvious?

28
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,501
Oh Kyung-sook. Is your son a thug?

29
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,213
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, I really am.

30
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,631
What good is your apology?

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,050
You should educate your son

32
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,970
instead of gallivanting around,
playing politician.

33
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:02,432
Why not try being a decent parent
before meddling in politics?

34
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,520
How did this happen?

35
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,273
He beat me up. It was one-sided.

36
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,818
One-sided?

37
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,656
I didn't do anything, but Kang Hyun-woo
went nuts and started beating me up.

38
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,533
Do you see?

39
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:25,079
Oh Kyung-sook, your son beat up my child
on the street for no reason.

40
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,498
My son's so shocked that he doesn't think

41
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,959
he can go outside or go to school anymore.

42
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,503
Hyun-woo.

43
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,381
Tell me. Is all of this true?

44
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,717
Why won't you say anything?

45
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,804
How could you do such a thing?

46
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,350
Why? Are you scared?

47
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,435
That you'll lose the election
because of me?

48
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,103
Hey, Hyun-woo.

49
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,438
Hyun-woo.

50
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,773
Are you even worried about me?

51
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,568
You came because you're afraid
I might ruin the election!

52
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,529
You could be mayor if it weren't for me,

53
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,948
but I'm getting in your way.

54
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,575
How? How could you say such a thing?

55
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,828
How could you?
Is that how I taught you? Huh?

56
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,747
When did you ever teach me anything?

57
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,999
Tell me one thing you taught me.

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,460
Hey, Hyun-woo. Watch your tone.

59
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,128
Let's stop there.

60
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,384
I think Gyeong-min
should be taken to a hospital first.

61
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,595
We'll drive you to the hospital,
so tell us if you need anything--

62
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,932
Why? So you can settle
and make this go away with money?

63
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,600
Ma'am.

64
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,561
Are you trying to buy our silence
so he won't go to jail?

65
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,355
No, that's not it.

66
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,401
We don't have the slightest intention
of settling, so don't even dream of it.

67
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,365
We're done being questioned,
so we're leaving. Okay?

68
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,450
Let's go.

69
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,785
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,328
I'm so sorry.

71
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,372
Here. Take a seat.

72
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,128
This is all my fault.

73
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,757
How did I let that happen to him?

74
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,176
Don't say that. It's not your fault.

75
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,013
Has Hyun-woo had problems
at school before?

76
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,265
It doesn't make sense

77
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,893
that he'd beat him for no reason.

78
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,772
Well, I did notice something strange
a few days ago.

79
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,944
He had blood on his uniform.

80
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,197
I was startled.
I asked him what had happened.

81
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,409
He told me that he'd gotten
into a scuffle with his friends.

82
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:32,790
Honey. You should have told me then.

83
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,293
Why didn't you tell me, huh?

84
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,921
You're so busy with your campaign
that you don't even have time to eat.

85
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,007
When and how was I supposed to tell you?

86
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,719
Kyung-sook.

87
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,096
I know it's hard, but be strong.

88
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,433
I know this is hard as a mother,

89
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,270
but it might hurt you
on the political front too.

90
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,820
I'll settle with the parents
as quickly as I can,

91
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,072
so look after Hyun-woo.

92
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,616
And keep me updated on the investigation.

93
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,244
I'm sorry. You're busy enough already
without our son causing trouble.

94
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,579
We'll have to determine

95
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,831
whether he started this

96
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,334
or was unwittingly dragged into it.

97
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,586
Then I'll talk to Hyun-woo's
school friends

98
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,547
and find out exactly how this fight began.

99
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,050
Make sure it doesn't leak.

100
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,385
Especially

101
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,346
to Baek Jae-min's camp.

102
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,056
Never.

103
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,769
Wow, what a good boy!

104
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,814
Like mother, like son.

105
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,816
He charged headfirst into trouble.

106
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,860
We should start leading
the bull to its demise.

107
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,820
Ms. Guk.

108
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,038
In two days,
the blackout period will begin.

109
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,750
That's when official opinion polls
are no longer released

110
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:01,295
and most swing and shy voters
shift their support.

111
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,257
It also means if Oh Kyung-sook
is still in the race by then,

112
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,510
there's no telling how many of my votes
she'll chew through.

113
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,011
She'll pull out before then.

114
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:14,600
We'll smear her image
beyond the point of no return.

115
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,562
But she might dig her heels in
and refuse to withdraw.

116
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,564
That won't hurt us. All she'd do

117
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,818
is humiliate herself
for the remainder of the campaign.

118
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,695
Has there ever been

119
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,074
a politician elected after a controversy
about their family surfaced?

120
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:30,992
There hasn't.

121
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,289
And family issues can be fatal
for female politicians.

122
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,710
Whether she withdraws or decides to fight,

123
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,589
all that's left for us to do
is to sit back and watch

124
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,717
how Oh Kyung-sook falls.

125
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,803
-Ms. Guk, proceed.
-Yes, sir.

126
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,432
A rat in a trap.

127
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,561
It's been reported that the bully
assaulting a fellow student

128
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,980
in the video that surfaced online today

129
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,567
is actually the son of Oh Kyung-sook,
Reform Party of Korea's candidate,

130
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,860
shocking the public.

131
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,029
The victim was seriously injured

132
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,281
and is receiving treatment at a hospital.

133
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,241
He's experiencing severe mental trauma

134
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,495
that will require therapy.

135
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,581
Candidate Oh, loved for her righteous
and down-to-earth image,

136
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,293
was a strong candidate for the election,

137
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,671
but voters' anger and disappointment
are now on the rise.

138
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,798
It's too early to consider

139
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,842
her withdrawal.

140
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,261
The party is also looking into it.

141
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,223
We'll get to the bottom of this incident

142
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:39,101
and hold an official press conference,
so please be patient.

143
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,940
Oh, and please refrain from publishing
any speculative articles.

144
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,820
Call the camp and ask what happened!

145
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,947
Any comments for us?

146
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,864
Mr. Yang!

147
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,949
BEAT CLASSMATE MERCILESSLY

148
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,408
"Powergate"?

149
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,787
You've got to be kidding me.

150
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,165
This is just distorting the truth
beyond all plausibility!

151
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,959
They're trying to frame this issue,

152
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:07,338
deliberately using the word "power"
to make Ms. Oh look bad.

153
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,133
Ms. Hwang. Why don't we warn the press?

154
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,136
To stop posting clickbait news
on an ongoing investigation.

155
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,516
That's not the main issue here.

156
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,479
It's strange how this story is spreading.

157
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,691
This fight occurred spontaneously,

158
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:32,196
yet the footage was filmed meticulously
to show Hyun-woo's face.

159
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,366
The police showed up right away,
as if they were waiting.

160
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,620
And the footage went viral
abnormally fast.

161
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,913
It all fits too…

162
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,957
Too well to be a coincidence, right?

163
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,588
As soon as the footage spread,

164
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,091
media outlets favoring Baek Jae-min
began churning out articles.

165
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,678
They're trying to frame Ms. Oh
and smear her image to the voters

166
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,180
by making it seem like
her son's abusing her power.

167
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,685
This is the most popular tactic
during the blackout period.

168
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,315
They're using provocative black propaganda
to lure the swing voters

169
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,233
in a final volley.

170
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:14,739
So…

171
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:17,825
Hyun-woo was…

172
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,078
It's likely he was set up.

173
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,538
Highly likely.

00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,969
PUNISH THE AGGRESSIVE JUVENILE OFFENDER
HIDING BEHIND THE LAW'S PROTECTION

177
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:40,556
We will now begin
the press conference addressing

178
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,100
Candidate Oh's son's assault
on another student.

179
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,611
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook's son
beat up our son mercilessly.

180
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,531
The police treated my son as the assailant

181
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,243
and only seemed to care
about protecting Candidate Oh's son.

182
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,247
I begged them to at least let us
take him to the hospital, but…

183
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,628
Both the police and Candidate Oh

184
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,507
have been coercing us
into settling with them.

185
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,718
For our son, who fell victim
to this horrible school violence…

186
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,595
Ms. Hwang.

187
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,765
Are we just going to do nothing?

188
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,561
Shouldn't we also be publishing articles
and setting the record straight?

189
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,730
Ms. Hwang.

190
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,399
Look at this.

191
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,902
POLICE WORRIED ABOUT CANDIDATE OH

192
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,738
THE PROTECTORS OF THE PEOPLE
BECAME THE RHINO'S SHIELD

193
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,785
What's going on here?
Why is the press targeting us?

194
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,079
We're utterly bewildered as well.

195
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,124
The officers arrested him,
not knowing he was Oh Kyung-sook's son,

196
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,001
and they had only just begun
writing the report…

197
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,670
-Sir.
-What now?

198
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,004
There's a new article.

199
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,717
"Oh asked Commissioner General
Heo Cheol-gyun to cover up her son's case

200
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,678
as a favor by offering him
a free pass at the hearing."

201
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,595
What?

202
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,474
Who the hell's writing this bullshit?
Jeez.

203
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,608
Hand it over?

204
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,029
Our officers are doing fine. Why would
we give this case to the prosecution?

205
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,577
Do you think the police still
play the lackey for the prosecution?

206
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,456
The more you drag this out,
the worse things will get for you.

207
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,251
"The four-star commissioner general

208
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,880
abuses his power in order to protect
Oh Kyung-sook's son."

209
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,632
"Dirtiest election in history,
rigged by the police."

210
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,719
"The protectors of the people
reek of corruption."

211
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,514
You will be up to your neck
in disgusting headlines like those.

212
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,391
I'm the commissioner general!

213
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,519
Who do you think you are trying
to threaten? How dare you!

214
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,147
Doesn't your term end next year?

215
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,151
A minister from the police,

216
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,989
that's what the police need
to grow beyond its role

217
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,074
as the prosecution's lackey…

218
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,705
As soon as Candidate Baek
is elected mayor,

219
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,665
he'll be preparing the presidential race.

220
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,126
The president appoints
the Interior Minister.

221
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:19,089
I believe that position is open
and could be waiting for you.

222
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,551
Wait.

223
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,887
The prosecution?

224
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,350
They're still investigating.
Why would they be--

225
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,309
It's done.

226
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,479
This case has been transferred
to the prosecution.

227
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,733
It's a felony, and the victim
strongly wants to press charges,

228
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,068
so the prosecution should--

229
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:39,985
I've been

230
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,739
defending juvenile offenders pro bono
for about ten years.

231
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,742
I've seen many kids
who were charged unfairly

232
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,411
because of missteps
during police investigations.

233
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,165
Are you saying
your son is being accused unfairly?

234
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,422
I do not deny that what my son
did was wrong. Not at all.

235
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,217
He should pay for his crime. Of course.

236
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,180
But shouldn't his investigation be fair
and transparent for that to be possible?

237
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,182
Ending the investigation hastily

238
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,143
without telling his parents
and sending it to the prosecution…

239
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,812
Sir, you're violating regulations--

240
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,565
This isn't the time
to be nitpicking over regulations.

241
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:18,983
This is

242
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,861
an attempted murder case.

243
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,906
My gosh, attempted murder?
How could you say such a horrible thing?

244
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,368
Look here.

245
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,748
The victim was struck with a bag
filled with glass bottles.

246
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,668
This isn't just a common assault.

247
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,212
This is a aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon.

248
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,756
You're a lawyer, so you must know.

249
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,343
Aggravated assault cases are prosecuted
whether or not a settlement is reached.

250
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,055
Anyway, the prosecution
will be handling this case from now on,

251
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,225
so please talk to them
if you have any complaints.

252
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,269
-They're here!
-He's here!

253
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,395
How do you feel?

254
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,522
Did you mercilessly assault the victim?

255
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,691
Did you have a grudge against the victim?

256
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,293
Hyun-woo!

257
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,921
Move! Get those cameras away!

258
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,555
The Juvenile Act!

259
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,933
The Juvenile Act,

260
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,768
Article 68, Clause 1.

261
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,312
You can't broadcast juvenile cases.

262
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,898
For cases under investigation,

263
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,943
any fact or picture
that may identify the juvenile

264
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:48,238
concerned in the case shall neither
be published nor broadcast.

265
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,574
This is a clear violation
of the Juvenile Act.

266
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,535
A breach of human rights.
Get those cameras away!

267
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,246
Why? We're going to blur out
your son's face nicely.

268
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,332
Go on! Take the photos!

269
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,798
What do you think you're doing? Go inside!

270
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,301
Candidate Oh's son, Kang, is now being
investigated by the prosecution.

271
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,178
Kang, handed over to the prosecution,

272
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,347
on aggravated assault
and attempted murder charges,

273
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,557
stood in front of the prosecution
in cuffs…

274
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,493
Thank you, Chief Prosecutor.
Please see the case through until the end.

275
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,328
Yes, sure.

276
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,497
Okay, then, I have a meeting now.

277
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:44,128
I will leave you two
to talk as freely as you like.

278
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,591
You're late.

279
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,262
You must be upset.

280
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,848
The Hwang Do-hee technique
stopped working.

281
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,397
Stop trying to mimic me

282
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,983
and just get to the point.

283
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,611
There isn't much time

284
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,198
until Candidate Oh's son is indicted.

285
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,200
Twelve hours to be exact.

286
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,455
You know he can't avoid
criminal punishment if he is indicted.

287
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,082
His case will be sent to court,

288
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,544
and he will be incarcerated
in a juvenile detention hall

289
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,796
or a pretrial detention center
until he's sentenced.

290
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,756
Guk Ji-yeon!

291
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,924
It's a politician's son in a felony case,

292
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,218
so the court will not go easy on him.

293
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,221
And Hyun-woo will do serious time in jail.

294
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,640
If he gets ten years,

295
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,227
he'll be locked up in a juvenile hall
until he turns 18.

296
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,063
When he reaches legal age,

297
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,357
he'll serve his remaining sentence
in a prison

298
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,527
alongside the inmates
who've committed violent crimes.

299
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,449
Ji-yeon.

300
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,453
Do you realize
what you're doing right now?

301
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,454
How could I not?

302
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,957
The press in Eunsung's pocket

303
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,418
have published what we told them,
word for word,

304
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,338
and the prosecutors who work for us

305
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,715
soon had him standing
in front of the press.

306
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,136
We'll make him live out
the rest of his life as a convict.

307
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,852
It's unfortunate, but what can we do?

308
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,480
They're just getting their comeuppance.

309
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,148
What did you just say?

310
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,942
This is the price she needs to pay

311
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,402
for having raised her son wrong.

312
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,533
Have Oh Kyung-sook withdraw her candidacy.

313
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,911
Then we'll convince
the victim's parents to settle,

314
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,412
close the case,

315
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,832
and say it was a misunderstanding

316
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,001
and adults overreacting
about a minor squabble between kids.

317
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,671
We'll release a follow-up article
and let him off quietly.

318
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,596
Let him off?

319
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,056
I can't give you much time.

320
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,351
The clock is ticking as we speak.

321
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,441
Your motherly love makes me cry.

322
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,572
To protect the child you are carrying,

323
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,116
you're going to end the life

324
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,286
of another mother's child without remorse.

325
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,541
I wonder if Baek Jae-min knows

326
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,918
that you're going to such great lengths

327
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,130
to protect his child.

328
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,885
You're the one

329
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,470
who's gone to great lengths

330
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,015
to make up a story.

331
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,645
I'm disappointed.

332
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,357
Such a ridiculous answer
from a smart girl like you.

333
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,319
I at least expected a perceptive comeback

334
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,321
that would make me doubt myself.

335
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:04,203
Thanks to you, I'm more sure than ever
that we shouldn't withdraw at all costs.

336
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,954
We're going to fight until the end

337
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,583
and expose to the world
that you would sacrifice a child

338
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,752
to manipulate the election in your favor!

339
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,672
You'll regret it.

340
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,345
It seems you are the one who'll regret it.

341
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,642
Giving birth to a child no one wants

342
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,393
and seeing that child be crushed

343
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,314
by the Eunsung owners, just like Hyun-woo.

344
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,252
Open the photo file.

345
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,129
The one from Guk Ji-yeon's parking lot.

346
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,215
Ms. Hwang, why are you…

347
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,801
Get ready to expose
Baek Jae-min's scandal.

348
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,594
So, a full-on battle?

349
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,180
Cha-sun.

350
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,058
There's no turning back now.

351
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,562
No matter what happens,
we'll fight until the end and win.

352
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,439
That's the only way…

353
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,776
we can save Hyun-woo.

354
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,152
She won't pull out?

355
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,113
No.

356
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,323
She's more determined than expected.

357
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,076
It seems we'll have to speed up our plan.

358
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,578
We need to fan the flames.

359
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,125
They say a parent must live
for their child while alive

360
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,918
and protect them in death.

361
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,255
A mother
who couldn't even protect her child

362
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,050
shouldn't leave peacefully
for the afterlife, should she?

363
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,429
Oh Kyung-sook, the Rhino,

364
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,308
will choke on her own blood,
even in her grave.

365
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,603
Candidate Oh's son, Kang,
who is being investigated

366
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,106
by the prosecution on an assault charge,

367
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,443
is now facing allegations
of sexual harassment, shocking the public.

368
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,738
Kang is reported to have lured
female students from his school

369
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,533
to karaoke and private room cafes
to sexually harass them repeatedly

370
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,952
and coerce them into drinking and smoking.

371
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,539
Kang's classmates allege
they reported Kang's sexual harassment

372
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:15,709
to the school many times
but were silenced.

373
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,044
No.

374
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,839
It's all nonsense.
Hyun-woo is not a kid who would do that.

375
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,424
It's fake news.

376
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,135
We're looking into it too.

377
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,511
First,

378
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,891
we have to find out
what evidence the reporters have--

379
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,309
There's no need.

380
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:37,522
Hyun-woo didn't sexually harass anyone.
The others did.

381
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,155
My gosh.

382
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,202
I found this from his acquaintances.

383
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,288
I think the fight broke out
when Gyeong-min

384
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,375
uploaded that doctored photo
on Hyun-woo's social media page.

385
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,292
Oh my.

386
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,754
So Hyun-woo didn't beat that kid up
for no reason.

387
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,215
No. From what I heard from the other kids,

388
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,636
Hyun-woo has been having
a hard time because of attacks on Ms. Oh.

389
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:12,349
Lately, he's been constantly receiving
malicious online comments about Ms. Oh,

390
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,102
which really had him on edge.

391
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,650
Have you been monitoring his account?

392
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,112
Yes. We've been monitoring it every day,

393
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,988
but everything seemed fine.

394
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,824
Not this one, his other account.

395
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,701
He has another account?

396
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,122
Yes. He has an alt account
that he shared with his friends.

397
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:38,542
He didn't want the campaign staff
meddling with his account.

398
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,836
Hurry up and log in.

399
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,055
STUPID SMUG FACE AFTER BEATING UP KIDS

400
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,974
DUMBASSES FLOCK TOGETHER
HOPELESS FAMILY

401
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,810
I SEE THAT JERK AT SCHOOL
AND HIS MOM ON THE STREET. WTF

402
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,895
HE'S SCREWED IF HIS MOM LOSES, HUH?

403
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,981
DAMN. THOSE PRICKS LOOK SO FUCKING NAIVE

404
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,400
SHITTY ATTENTION WHORE
GROSS LIKE HIS MOM

405
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,318
I SAW HER CHEAT
IS YOUR DAD A MORON?

406
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,237
IS HYUN-WOO A BASTARD?
FUCKED UP FAMILY!

407
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,075
POOR YOU, HAVING THAT MOM
DON'T BE SO COCKY

408
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,578
STOP, HE'S GONNA CRY
KYUNG-SOOK ARMPIT BEAM, FIRE!

409
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,080
IS YOUR MOM A HOOKER NOW?
I KNEW I RECOGNIZED HER!

410
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,968
Hyun-woo put up with all that.

411
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,053
He's been swallowing up

412
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,639
all those attacks alone.

413
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,810
And suffering by himself.

414
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,940
What's happening?

415
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,112
How could something so horrible
happen to him?

416
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,697
How?

417
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,282
God.

418
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,831
Withdraw?

419
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,167
What do you mean?

420
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,671
You know exactly what I mean.
Don't make me say it again.

421
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,007
Imagine what'd happen
with a sex offender's mom

422
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,342
as our party's candidate.

423
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,681
We need to sever ties with her
to save the party, isn't that right?

424
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,143
You take charge

425
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,188
and convince Hwang Do-hee
to make Oh withdraw.

426
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,776
We'll forget about how you stabbed Seo
in the back and welcome you back.

427
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,613
-No, thank you.
-What?

428
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,741
I didn't come back because I have regrets.

429
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,204
I'm only here
to help Candidate Oh Kyung-sook win.

430
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,790
Hey, Ma Joong-seok.

431
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,125
Snap out of it, you moron!

432
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,005
Do you think you'll make a candidate
if you alone pretend to be clean?

433
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,176
You idiot. It's over for Oh Kyung-sook.

434
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,886
No, it's not over yet.

435
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,639
I'll prove that

436
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,351
sometimes the real deal can survive,

437
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,437
even in a cesspool like this.

438
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,110
-Turn on the monitor.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,199
We've analyzed the traffic
on Hyun-woo's alt account.

440
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,705
Only his close friends visit this account,
so it usually has 30 or so visitors a day.

441
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:26,084
But last week, he started getting
150 simultaneous visitors a day.

442
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,627
Simultaneous?

443
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:32,882
So I tracked each visitor's IP address
and investigated each of them.

444
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,011
There's evidence they used
a specific browser.

445
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,138
So, the dark web is

446
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:42,309
a sort of ghost network devised
to prevent your IP from being tracked.

447
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,020
It's mainly used for criminal purposes.

448
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,315
The fact that over 100 kids visited
his page simultaneously

449
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,443
indicates that
they may have been bought out

450
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,362
with things only dealt on the dark web.

451
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,698
In-game currency!

452
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,243
I saw them playing video games
at an Internet cafe earlier,

453
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,079
and they were decked out
with the most powerful items.

454
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,915
So I asked
how they could afford the items,

455
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,543
and they said they worked part-time.

456
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,756
Then those kids must have all…

457
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,467
They went on the dark web,
received in-game currency…

458
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,885
And wrote nasty comments

459
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,889
on Hyun-woo's social media account
as a part-time job.

460
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,559
In other words…

461
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,980
In order to destroy Oh Kyung-sook's son,

462
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,149
they bribed those children

463
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,943
to leave malicious comments,
provoked a fistfight,

464
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,113
and conspired with the prosecution
to expose him to the press.

465
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,283
All just to smear Oh Kyung-sook's image.

466
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:42,911
So…

467
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:47,957
all of this had been planned out

468
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,835
from the beginning.

469
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,216
They roped in all those innocent kids
because of the election.

470
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,678
Hyun-woo became the scapegoat

471
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,432
for their attempt to frame you
as a sex offender's mother.

472
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,227
Those bastards.

473
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:09,437
-Ms. Oh!
-Let go!

474
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,856
Let go of me! Let go!

475
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,275
I'm going to kill them all! I will!

476
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,404
I'll kill them all! Those bastards!

477
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,118
My poor Hyun-woo.

478
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,371
That poor thing.

479
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,421
Honey.

480
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:36,548
It's me.

481
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,508
I ruined everything.

482
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,594
I ruined my boy's life!

483
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,388
It's all my fault.

484
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,597
Oh Kyung-sook.

485
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,057
Get a hold of yourself!

486
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,686
Forget how bad you feel for him,
and focus on saving him first.

487
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:52,522
Will you sit by
and let them ruin Hyun-woo's life?

488
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,067
We still have a chance.

489
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:58,653
We can still save Hyun-woo.

490
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,745
They want me to withdraw?

491
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,375
Yeah.

492
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,547
Ji-yeon gave me a final warning
at the Prosecutors' Office.

493
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,008
She said

494
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,721
she'd make Hyun-woo's case go away
if you withdrew.

495
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,724
And the case would end
as a squabble between kids.

496
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,687
And?

497
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,777
I refused.

498
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,905
I told her we would keep going.

499
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:45,658
I even pressured and warned them
that they would be the ones to withdraw.

500
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,664
That's how we ended up in this mess.
It was because I provoked them.

501
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,292
You didn't provoke them.

502
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,547
You just did your job.

503
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:11,476
The prosecution…

504
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,606
will indict Hyun-woo tomorrow morning.

505
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:20,819
They'll stop if you tell them
you're withdrawing before then.

506
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,741
And if I don't?

507
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,746
They'll keep backing us into a corner.

508
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,251
Until Hyun-woo's life…

509
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,046
can never return to normal.

510
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,641
Ms. Oh!

511
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,231
They've finished interrogating Hyun-woo.

512
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,435
Kang Hyun-woo.

513
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,354
Look at me.

514
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,983
Are you not going to look at me? Huh?

515
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,277
Will you never look at me again?

516
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,655
Come over here. Now.

517
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,592
Whatever the reason was…

518
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,389
it's wrong to hit people.
You know that, don't you?

519
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,225
That's what you're being punished for.

520
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,479
But if it had been me

521
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:24,317
seeing such an obscene photo
attached to my mom's face, mocking her,

522
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,194
I would've lost my cool.

523
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,863
How could I not? I would've hit him too.

524
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,042
This is all my fault. I'm sorry.

525
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:45,171
You're going through so much
all because of me.

526
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,050
Why do you keep saying that?

527
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,637
Listen.

528
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,351
The other grown-ups
that are competing against me

529
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,689
used your friends to provoke you
and put you here

530
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,025
so that they could win the election.

531
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,782
Grown-ups live
in such a cruel world, don't they?

532
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,786
Those grown-ups upset me so much

533
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,163
that I've been holding on until now

534
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,416
to teach them a lesson.

535
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,380
But I'm going to stop now.

536
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,220
You see.

537
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,432
I'm going to withdraw my candidacy.

538
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,768
After putting you through this,

539
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,646
being mayor of Seoul and all that…

540
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,025
I'm not interested anymore. I won't do it.

541
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:47,942
After all this?

542
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,072
It's fine, okay?

543
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,326
I know it's a bit too late,

544
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,829
but I'm going to try
and be a proper mother. What?

545
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,205
You don't think I can?

546
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,125
I…

547
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,295
I was the one who gave birth to you.

548
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,256
I should be making sacrifices for you.

549
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:14,927
How could I let you sacrifice yourself
for me instead? That just isn't right.

550
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,138
I'm not sacrificing myself.

551
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,099
All you have to do is win.

552
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,270
If you give up…

553
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,858
they'll keep making scapegoats like me.

554
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,945
You have to win to teach them a lesson
and bring change.

555
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,948
-Hyun-woo.
-I'm Oh Kyung-sook's son.

556
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,160
While in your womb, I saw you protest.

557
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,996
I've seen you fight for labor rights
for 15 years.

558
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,582
I'm a mini rhino.

559
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,505
Do you think I'll flinch
being locked up in here?

560
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,217
I know that you'll win in the end
and get me out.

561
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,387
Hyun-woo, I'm not as great as
you think I am. Okay?

562
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,181
I might not even win the election--

563
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,474
You promised me.

564
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,811
That you'd create a better world for me.

565
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,981
That promise kept Dad and me going
for all this time.

566
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,151
Are you going to let us down?

567
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,197
Will you let me live in a world
built by those evil people?

568
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,451
Hyun-woo.

569
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,995
Jeez.

570
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,416
I really wasn't going to cry.

571
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,796
Why did you have to make me cry, huh?

572
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,133
I'm sorry, honey.

573
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,554
I'm sorry.

574
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,829
Fine.

575
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,374
Let's do this.

576
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,086
We'll do this your way.

577
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,339
We'll keep going.

578
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,344
From now on,

579
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,890
we'll do whatever it takes.

580
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,477
Let's keep fighting to the end

581
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,230
and win.

582
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:15,942
FOR THE 39TH SEOUL CITY
MAYORAL BY-ELECTION D-7

583
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,549
We have this game

584
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,219
completely in our pocket now. Have a seat.

585
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,390
How did we do in the most recent poll?

586
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,351
We dominated the polls at 55%.

587
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,435
Okay.

588
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,231
Keep flooding the press
with that final poll.

589
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,566
For the next week,

590
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,569
we'll keep our rating at 55%.

591
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,239
The swing voters always end up

592
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,493
giving their votes to the candidate
who seems most likely to win.

593
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,661
Yes, sir.

594
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,454
But

595
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,582
what should we do about Oh Kyung-sook?

596
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,126
Just leave her.

597
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,422
Whether she withdraws or not,
it's over for Oh Kyung-sook.

598
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,716
Let's see.

599
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:27,847
If Chairwoman Son would kindly share some
of her gold with the starving subjects,

600
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,892
this election
would be wrapped up nicely, right?

601
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,519
Good job, everyone.

602
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,697
Of course.

603
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,827
It's my turn to support Jae-min
when he's doing so well.

604
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,205
And the duty-free shop's opening?

605
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,916
Everything's perfectly prepared.

606
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,046
I used my connections to invite
Korean and international celebrities.

607
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,632
We'll also have all the media outlets
that owe us announce the opening,

608
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:07,511
and I will give a speech at the end
as the CEO of the duty-free shop.

609
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:08,846
Sound good?

610
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,890
Focus the event on Jae-min.

611
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,809
Don't try to hog all the spotlight.

612
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,981
Starting tomorrow,
have the duty-free shop open 24 hours

613
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,983
until the day of the election.

614
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,321
Leave it open so that anyone can shop
as long as they're Seoul citizens.

615
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,989
-Mom.
-Ma'am.

616
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:31,369
I know that you're feeling generous,
but that's a bit--

617
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,455
And the duty-free shop's official opening
will be held

618
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,624
on the day Jae-min wins the election.

619
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,549
What are you doing here?

620
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,346
What's wrong?

621
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,723
Am I not welcome here?

622
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,309
I may have left my position,

623
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,145
but I'm still a key member
of the Eunsung Group board.

624
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,817
Our chairwoman's lifelong dream,
Eunsung Duty-Free Shop,

625
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,861
will hold its soft opening event tomorrow.

626
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,948
I should be kept in the loop.

627
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,618
Especially with the election imminent.

628
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,288
What's wrong?

629
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,419
It's only when my husband is elected

630
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,797
that the duty-free shop
can officially open, isn't it?

631
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,468
You need him to cover up
everything illegal we did,

632
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,513
from getting site permits
to passing the building inspection.

633
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,642
He also needs to use his power
as mayor to exempt us

634
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,938
from the final safety inspection
so we can decide

635
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,190
whether to open the shop or not.

636
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:44,775
Have you lost it?

637
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,570
What are you trying to say?

638
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,452
We shouldn't underestimate Oh Kyung-sook.

639
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,125
She won't give in even when we try
burying her son alive to make her quit.

640
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,129
If she were to discover
that the duty-free shop

641
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,798
is a hunk of metal
built on all sorts of corruption,

642
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,259
the tables might turn.

643
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,971
If Oh Kyung-sook ends up becoming mayor,

644
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,349
what will happen to us, Chairwoman Son?

645
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,267
Wait.

646
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,981
Maybe I should ask the future CEO
of Eunsung Duty-Free Shop.

647
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:32,531
If your figurehead can't even come up
with a solution in an emergency like this,

648
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,744
would she really be able
to do her job as the CEO?

649
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,374
I'd like to hear
what the chairwoman thinks.

650
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:50,049
I think it's time we talked privately,
Director Eun.

651
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,027
My youngest has come a long way.

652
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:15,241
You even know
how to threaten your mother now.

653
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,368
It's always been like this.

654
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,041
I couldn't get your attention
unless I pulled a crazy stunt like this.

655
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:34,635
Were you worried I was going to give
your sister the duty-free shop?

656
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,514
More like offended.

657
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,144
I've even put up with Baek Jae-min
sowing his wild oats everywhere

658
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,563
to get where I am.

659
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,110
He's something, isn't he?

660
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,489
Making an illegitimate child
at a time like this.

661
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:10,212
We can always dig out the seed
that is sown outside of my walls.

662
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,298
I'll deal with that problem, so--

663
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,215
You know what?

664
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,801
I'll raise that child as my own.

665
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,478
Just like how you took me in,

666
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,607
Father's illegitimate child.

667
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,028
Chae-ryoung!

668
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:37,281
He'll have to announce it
as he's in line for public office.

669
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,203
I'll have him come clean to everyone
that he has an illegitimate child…

670
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,583
and make him give up the election.

671
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,043
You…

672
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,422
Are you trying
to hang your mother out to dry?

673
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,674
Would any daughter want to do that?

674
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,344
I lived my entire life…

675
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,598
doing my best to become your daughter.

676
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,644
I wanted people to tell me
that I took after you more than Seo-jin,

677
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,395
the daughter you gave birth to.

678
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,981
So I tried hard
to learn how to run this company.

679
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,610
Even if I didn't inherit your blood,

680
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,073
I held on so far, thinking
I'd become your real daughter

681
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,699
if I inherited the company.

682
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,119
So give me the same chance
you gave Seo-jin.

683
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,374
The chance to become
Eunsung Group's owner.

684
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,213
If you promise me that,
I'll focus on this election as you want.

685
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,301
I'll do whatever it takes…

686
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,181
to make that bastard mayor.

687
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:05,911
All right.

688
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,125
I'll do what you want me to do.

689
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:14,837
My daughter.

690
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,530
How did it go?

691
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:45,659
Ms. Eun Chae-ryoung will attend
the duty-free shop's soft opening

692
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,453
with her husband.

693
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,748
And the CEO position?

694
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,460
It seems that Chairwoman Son will give it
to Director Eun Chae-ryoung.

695
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,639
HWANG DO-HEE

696
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,000
You seem better than I thought.

697
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,086
You sounded desperate,
so I thought you'd be dying.

698
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,048
What for? I have no reason to be.

699
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,011
My heart flutters even more.

700
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,056
Why would the high and mighty Ms. Hwang

701
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,769
ask to see a nobody like me
when she isn't in any imminent danger?

702
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,482
The offer you made me before.

703
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,527
Is that still on?

704
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,447
The 20 billion won.

705
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,951
Can you get it in cash by tomorrow?

706
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,958
How the mighty have fallen.

707
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:21,171
You wouldn't take an umbrella from us
even if it were pouring,

708
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:24,341
but now that Oh Kyung-sook
might end up losing,

709
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,760
you're crawling back to us for help?

710
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,846
How humiliating.

711
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,309
This is too good to just watch on my own.

712
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,188
Ms. Hwang, of all people,

713
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,234
is begging me for money!

714
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,823
This stupidity is
why you always lost to Chae-ryoung.

715
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:53,328
Private life, marriage,
and corporate management skills.

716
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,497
Are you better than Chae-ryoung
at anything?

717
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,877
You don't want to lose your mom's favor,

718
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,087
but you know you are
no match for Chae-ryoung,

719
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,965
so you keep running away,
pretending to be tough and cool,

720
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,175
trying to hide your inferiority complex.

721
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,220
Shut your mouth.

722
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,765
The only advantage you have
over Chae-ryoung

723
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,351
is that you were born
to the chairwoman legitimately.

724
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,478
I told you to shut your mouth!

725
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,480
Don't you throw a fit at me.

726
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,276
I'm giving you the chance
of a lifetime now.

727
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,326
I'm going to win…

728
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,663
this election, whatever it takes.

729
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,668
Then Baek Jae-min

730
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,339
will be discarded by your mother.

731
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,799
Chae-ryoung will fall out of favor
with him too.

732
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,053
And meanwhile, you will end up

733
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:55,599
with a direct connection
to Mayor Oh Kyung-sook's office.

734
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,516
Then…

735
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,063
you will be the one holding hegemony

736
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,898
in Eunsung Group.

737
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,071
You think you can win?

738
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,075
When things are this hopeless?

739
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,212
Have you forgotten already?

740
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,424
I've never lost, not even once.

741
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,969
Yes. I'm well aware.

742
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,139
So let's say I inherit Eunsung,

743
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,394
and Oh Kyung-sook becomes mayor,
as you said.

744
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,313
What about you?

745
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,942
What do you get out of it?

746
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,122
Have it ready by tomorrow.

747
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,076
Have some of this.

748
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:07,165
You little brat.
I told you to stop playing video games.

749
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:09,209
Just leave me alone.

750
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,805
How dare you come here?

751
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,226
I wanted to see
if Gyeong-min was recovering well.

752
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,354
There was also something
I wanted to ask him.

753
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,984
If you have any questions,
go ask the prosecutors.

754
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,986
We have nothing to say to you.

755
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,446
Are you sure about that?

756
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,743
If I were to go to the prosecutors
with what I'm about to discuss with you,

757
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,415
Gyeong-min would become the assailant,
not the victim.

758
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:04,472
You said that Hyun-woo beat you
when you didn't do anything, right?

759
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,770
-Are you sure?
-Hey, you!

760
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,398
What do you think you're doing to him?

761
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:18,778
This.

762
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,158
You uploaded this
to Hyun-woo's social media page, right?

763
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,748
According to the kids there that day,

764
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,376
you and Hyun-woo started fighting
because of this photo you uploaded.

765
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,589
But you lied that Hyun-woo beat you up
for no good reason.

766
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,425
That's not…

767
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:44,304
Perjury, distributing pornography,
and recklessly provoking violence.

768
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,014
These are serious charges, okay?

769
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,141
What do you think you're saying to him?

770
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,435
Are you blackmailing him now?

771
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,063
Yes.

772
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:56,149
I am,
so you'd better listen carefully too.

773
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,576
Gyeong-min.

774
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,122
Life is about to become
very difficult for you.

775
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:12,707
Why?

776
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,796
I'll make you pay for your crimes
for the rest of your life.

777
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:19,965
What?

778
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,343
In all the important moments
you will face in life,

779
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:25,929
I'll show up and remind you
of what you did to Hyun-woo

780
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:28,265
and his mother, and I'll make you pay.

781
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,101
If you get into a university,

782
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,938
I'll expose the things you did
on the school's website.

783
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:37,691
If you get a job,
I'll hack into the company's intranet

784
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,776
and expose what an evil monster you are.

785
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:40,819
What did you say?

786
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,947
Marriage won't be easy either.

787
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:50,453
I'll tell your wife-to-be
that you've been disseminating pornography

788
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,622
and sexually abusing women

789
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,083
without any remorse since middle school.

790
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,295
And I'll upload the photo
you doctored of Hyun-woo's mother

791
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,464
on your kids' social media pages
and make your kids pay

792
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,467
for the sins of their father.

793
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,344
Don't believe me, do you?

794
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:07,929
You better believe I will.

795
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,056
Because that's what I do for a living!

796
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,401
If you run over your friend's life,

797
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,196
the same thing happens to yours.
You should know that.

798
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,033
That's how you become a good person.

799
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,708
They offered us in-game currency.

800
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,798
To leave nasty comments…

801
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,677
on Hyun-woo's social media.

802
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,137
Oh my!

803
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,183
They promised to pay us five times
if we uploaded that photo too.

804
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,519
That's why I did it.

805
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,276
So, they'll settle and testify?

806
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,296
Let's quickly move on to our next step.

807
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,841
We wasted three days of valuable time

808
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,927
getting played by those beastly bastards

809
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,430
when we have less than a week left.

810
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,433
Should we schedule a public apology first?

811
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,519
No need to take this step by step.

812
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,855
We'll do both the apology
and the campaign at once.

813
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:44,901
That will be the fastest way
we can rise in the polls.

814
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:46,778
She has a point.

815
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,446
The specifics to carry this out?

816
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,740
First…

817
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,913
we'll have to appease
the disappointed mothers.

818
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,874
CENTRISTS, TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

819
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,876
This show isn't for the left or the right,

820
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,130
but for the centrists.
"Centrists, To the National Assembly."

821
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:07,465
We have with us
Candidate Yook Seung-cheol,

822
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:10,051
who's served three terms
as Superintendent of Education.

823
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,680
Candidate Yook.

824
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,308
The online parent communities are outraged
because of Candidate Oh's son.

825
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,935
If you look here, it says

826
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:24,107
he "craves affection due to his mother's
continued absence since childhood."

827
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:30,447
These symptoms must have led
to hatred and violence toward women

828
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:34,159
and distorted sexual expression,

829
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:37,036
ultimately causing him
to commit sex crimes.

830
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,584
Candidate Yook Seung-cheol.

831
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,632
Why don't you change

832
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,553
your toupee to something
that better suits your age?

833
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,432
Keeping a youthful hairstyle…

834
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,978
with liver spots on your face

835
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,524
isn't going to make
your political career last any longer.

836
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,529
You're as insolent as the rumors say.

837
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,116
You're here spying on my bald spots

838
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,119
when your candidate is dying.

839
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:19,871
Sir.

840
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:26,169
In return for
your next campaign's sponsorship…

841
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,132
you joined hands
with Candidate Baek, right?

842
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,592
What are you accusing me of--

843
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:37,013
I have all the evidence on how
Candidate Baek has set Ms. Oh's son up.

844
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,226
And I've also obtained evidence

845
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,269
to prove how you joined them

846
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,647
and manipulated

847
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,691
his psychiatric counseling

848
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,236
and school records.

849
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,012
Make your choice.

850
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,100
Will you join Candidate Oh

851
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:25,770
like a true educator of Korea
and spend your remaining years peacefully,

852
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,898
or will you live the rest of your life

853
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,818
serving time for ruining a kid
young enough to be your grandson

854
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,737
because you couldn't give up
on your ambitions?

855
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:43,830
Ms. Hwang Do-hee.

856
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,126
This election is already over.

857
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:54,507
Even if I told the truth
and criticized Baek Jae-min openly,

858
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:01,472
no one in their right mind would vote
for a sex offender's mother.

859
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,766
Do you still not understand

860
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,854
that the winner's words
become the truth in politics?

861
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,022
Mr. Yook!

862
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,233
You know how high the suicide rate is
among today's youth, right?

863
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,029
Have Oh Kyung-sook

864
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,616
withdraw quietly…

865
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,912
unless she wants to hold
a funeral for her son.

866
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,304
Camilla Song, right?

867
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,147
Your 42-year-old lover
living in California.

868
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:53,274
It began as an affair,

869
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,527
and you've been in a common-law marriage
over the past ten years.

870
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,695
And it seems

871
01:00:58,237 --> 01:01:01,407
you have quite a fortune
in the US under her name.

872
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,956
Here's 20 billion won.

873
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,087
It's exactly ten times the money
you received from Baek Jae-min's camp.

874
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:19,717
If you retire, I will have the funds
wired to Camilla's account.

875
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,597
Wouldn't the warm sun of California

876
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:29,018
suit you better in your later days
than the filthy world of politics?

877
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:36,275
My fellow citizens!

878
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,403
This is it!

879
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,331
That is the reason

880
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:54,794
that I, Yook Seung-cheol,
requested an urgent press conference.

881
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,715
These horrible photos

882
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,469
were found to have been uploaded
to the social media of Candidate Oh's Son.

883
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:08,558
The classmate who claimed to have been
beaten senselessly by Candidate Oh's son

884
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,019
uploaded this photo to provoke

885
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:15,022
a violent response from her son.

886
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:16,858
This being the case,

887
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:21,362
would that kid have decided on his own
to upload that photo online?

888
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,073
No.

889
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,244
It was adults who bribed
the students with in-game currency,

890
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,456
pressuring them to post toxic comments
on the boy's social media

891
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:36,627
and to upload
those sexually suggestive photos

892
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,172
that humiliated his mother!

893
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:41,924
Mr. Yook!

894
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,676
Dear citizens,

895
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,097
they say that a nation's hope
lies in our children.

896
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,768
I've been an educator my whole life,

897
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:56,689
and I can't forgive such despicable people
who used an innocent child

898
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,525
to try and win an election!

899
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,319
That's right!

900
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,654
So I've decided…

901
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,492
to lend my strength…

902
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,788
to Candidate Oh Kyung-sook.

903
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:13,998
I, Yook Seung-cheol,

904
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,709
will unite camps

905
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,337
with the Reform Party of Korea's
Oh Kyung-sook

906
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:22,757
and continue my part in this battle

907
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,051
as a true educator of children.

908
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,651
My dear citizens, as you have seen today…

909
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:44,862
my son…

910
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,200
was ruthlessly exploited

911
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,620
by the monstrous adults in politics.

912
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,165
And I was

913
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,002
bared before all.

914
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:04,257
I am a human being, a mother of a child,

915
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,343
and a woman

916
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,513
before I am a politician,

917
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:13,933
and I was trampled on.

918
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,937
But no matter what his reasons were,

919
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,441
I cannot justify my son's violence
toward his friend.

920
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:26,445
I believe that it should not be justified.

921
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,488
Dear citizens.

922
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,200
That is the world

923
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,287
I would like to create.

924
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:40,334
A world where you must pay
for your crimes,

925
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:45,339
even if you are a politician's child
or the heir to a chaebol.

926
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,717
A fair world.

927
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:50,636
That is the world

928
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,389
I want to create.

929
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,944
Like a lion that does not flinch
at loud noises,

930
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,824
like a wind that cannot be trapped
by a net,

931
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:17,121
like a lotus flower that's never tainted
even in the mud…

932
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,459
I will overcome greed and hatred,

933
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:23,586
and I'll continue

934
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,047
to fearlessly walk my path

935
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,507
like the horn of a rhinoceros.

936
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:34,347
My beloved and esteemed citizens of Seoul.

937
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:37,767
I beg of you…

938
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,437
to give me a chance.

939
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,868
Oh Kyung-sook!

940
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,288
Oh Kyung-sook!

941
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,666
Proceed with the next step.
