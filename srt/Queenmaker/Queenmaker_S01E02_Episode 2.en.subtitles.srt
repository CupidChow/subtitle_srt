1
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,293
Ms. Hwang!

2
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,629
Ms. Hwang, are you okay?

3
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,049
Quick! Call an ambulance.

4
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,900
MS. HWANG, THIS IS HAN I-SEUL

5
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,490
Ms. Hwang, this is Han I-seul.

6
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,160
I'm writing to tell you something
for the last time.

7
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,205
You're right.

8
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,917
Everything you dug up about my past

9
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,795
is totally true.

10
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,927
But I've never sold my body to men

11
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,013
to make a quick buck

12
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,935
or live comfortably,
contrary to your careless speculations.

13
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,441
I couldn't get a student loan
in my final semester before graduation.

14
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,697
I was running out of options to make
more than ten million for tuition

15
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,949
over the short school vacation.

16
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,787
I couldn't ask my sick mother for help.

17
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,208
Whatever the reasons,

18
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,878
it's true that I was a waitress in a bar.

19
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,381
If you say
that's a fatal flaw preventing me

20
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,466
from joining the "noble" Eunsung Group…

21
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,511
then fine.

22
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,889
I'll accept that.

23
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,395
But if you're saying I must remain silent

24
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,774
about the fact that Baek Jae-min sexually
assaulted me because of my past,

25
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,484
then no.

26
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,403
I refuse to accept that.

27
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,241
The horrible events that took place
that day, now embedded in my memory,

28
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,952
have already destroyed my life,

29
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,079
and I am certain

30
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,583
that they'll keep eating away at me
for the rest of my life.

31
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,255
I heard people call you
"Eunsung's Go-To Lady."

32
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,136
You've once again wiped away a crime
that despicable bastard

33
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,139
Baek Jae-min committed without a trace.

34
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,391
Congratulations.

35
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,812
And please remember this.

36
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,317
The only person in the world
who knows the truth

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,820
about what happened to me
is you, Ms. Hwang.

38
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,260
-You're missing a cuff link.
-Christ, you're right.

39
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,761
Why didn't you check?

40
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,097
Oh…

41
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,933
Please. I'm the slob here.

42
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,394
I prefer it this way.
This is so uncomfortable.

43
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,646
Stop fighting!

44
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,731
Please stop!

45
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,647
WE HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT
FOR PEOPLE'S RIGHTS AND DIGNITY

46
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:20,903
DIRECTOR BAEK JAE-MIN

47
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,904
Come in.

48
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,912
Ms. Hwang.

49
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,417
I can't believe I-seul did that.

50
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,627
You must be pretty shaken.

51
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,464
I'm okay.

52
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,303
Did she leave a suicide note?

53
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,680
Anything at all?

54
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,240
This is what I-seul held onto
until her final moment.

55
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,285
Why would she have…

56
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,457
I guess you don't know anything either.

57
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,834
No. I told you

58
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,046
everything I know last night.

59
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,300
Understood, sir.

60
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,679
And, Mr. Baek…

61
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,848
Yes, go ahead.

62
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:35,436
Do you still have the messages
you received from I-seul?

63
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,397
Yes.

64
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,024
Could I see them again?

65
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:41,859
Of course.

66
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:46,781
But the screenshot you took yesterday
was everything.

67
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,075
I'm aware.

68
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,496
But in order to get to the bottom of this…

69
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,918
I think it'd be wise to confirm the facts.

70
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,379
Okay.

71
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,131
Just a moment.

72
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,852
Here you go.

73
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,109
SECRETARY HAN I-SEUL

74
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,540
CALLING
SECRETARY HAN I-SEUL

75
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,705
What have you done?

76
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:20,833
What?

77
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,299
What terrible things did you do to I-seul

78
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,345
that forced you to fabricate
text messages to hide them?

79
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,349
I did what I had to

80
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,143
in order to try to help you out.

81
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,189
You've been crazy busy lately.

82
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:49,445
I felt bad seeing you clean up the messes
made by the Eun family's crazy women.

83
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,030
I couldn't burden you further

84
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,824
with something so trivial.

85
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,547
I am sorry.

86
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,590
I feel bad.

87
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,428
I should've been honest with you,
of all people.

88
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,353
You're apologizing to me

89
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,565
and not to I-seul?

90
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,609
A few bucks could've made it go away.

91
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,405
Now you have to deal with a dead body.
I'm sorry for that.

92
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,575
I didn't know
things would get so out of control.

93
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,369
But girls these days…

94
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,622
They're so unattractively fragile.

95
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,589
Are you being serious?

96
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,844
Because of you…

97
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,143
I-seul died because of you!

98
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,653
Ms. Hwang, come on.

99
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,324
I heard she worked at a hostess bar.

100
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,749
I mean, you were the one
who called over a hardworking girl,

101
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,126
exposed her past, blackmailed her,

102
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,003
and made her go up to that rooftop.

103
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,631
You did all of that.

104
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,260
Isn't this what they call
"gross negligence manslaughter"?

105
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,642
Have you no shame?

106
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,685
Look who's talking.

107
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,022
Think about all the terrible things
you did to clean up

108
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,941
the messes created by Eunsung's owners.

109
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,154
You've been swinging your sword
without a pang of guilt,

110
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,240
and now you've found your conscience
because a girl died?

111
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,327
Jeez, have you no shame?

112
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,755
Do you think…

113
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,342
I'd let you get away with this?

114
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,843
No, more than that,

115
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,680
you should protect me

116
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,640
by any means necessary.

117
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,476
Isn't it your duty to protect

118
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,853
the owners of the Eunsung Group?

119
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,774
That includes me.

120
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,614
Keep it up, Ms. Hwang.

121
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,222
GREENPEOPLE IS ALWAYS THERE FOR YOU

122
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,485
Mr. Baek wants to speak to me.

123
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,911
Did you tell him?

124
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,873
About I-seul's past?

125
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,543
Yes.

126
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,546
The intel obtained
by the Corporate Strategy Team

127
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,467
shouldn't be leaked to outsiders
without my permission.

128
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:43,971
But Mr. Baek

129
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,390
is not

130
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,185
an outsider.

131
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,397
You…

132
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,734
"Protecting the owner's family
by any means necessary

133
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,239
is protecting the company
and the jobs of thousands of employees,

134
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,784
and it contributes
to making this country great."

135
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,163
You told us this was the noble goal
of the Corporate Strategy Team,

136
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,623
didn't you?

137
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:30,267
GREENPEOPLE FOUNDATION

138
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,863
Drag her down from the rooftop.
Use Ms. Son's method.

139
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,492
Be extra careful with security.

140
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,539
Hello, subscribers. It's Oh Kyung-sook.

141
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:02,252
Only the darkness of night looms over
the rooftop of Eunsung Department Store.

142
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,339
Until all of the fired employees
have been reinstated,

143
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,424
we must keep going.

144
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,842
You know what?

145
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,596
To boost our spirits, I, Oh Kyung-sook,

146
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,432
will spice things up a little. Everyone!

147
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,978
Let's boost our energy
with a song to lift our spirits.

148
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,022
Let's sing "Like A Rock" together!

149
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:26,360
Let's live like a rock

150
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,945
Hey!

151
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:34,076
Heavy storms may get in our way

152
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:40,582
Let's live like a rock, never wavering

153
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:46,296
No matter what temptations lie ahead

154
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:53,971
Yes, ma'am.

155
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,056
-Stand down.
-Sorry?

156
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,559
Stand down on the rooftop. Now!

157
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,476
Now?

158
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,146
They must've arrived by now.

159
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,273
And we've already reported it to Ms. Son.

160
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,649
Wasn't I-seul enough?

161
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,362
I refuse to let any more people die
under my watch, so stand down!

162
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,118
I'll take care of things here.

163
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,580
You just remember your end of the deal.

164
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,386
Get ready.

165
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,989
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

166
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:58,077
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

167
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,036
Hey, On-sil.

168
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,663
Film everything that happens here, okay?

169
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,207
Hey, Dong-joo, what is it?

170
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,209
Don't miss a thing, okay?

171
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,753
-Okay.
-Make sure you film everything.

172
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,838
OUR SURVIVAL DEPENDS ON IT
PUT YOURSELF IN OUR SHOES

173
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,934
EUNSUNG DEPARTMENT STORE

174
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,320
Wait!

175
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,242
Damn it.

176
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,661
Jeez.

177
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,539
Dong-joo? What the hell?

178
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,456
ERROR

179
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,415
What's wrong?

180
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,839
Those crazy bastards.

181
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,607
You bastards!

182
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,779
Move!

183
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,620
Damn it.

184
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,164
What's wrong?

185
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,999
What's going on?

186
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,712
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

187
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,971
My friends! Can you hear me?

188
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,058
I love you, my friends!

189
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,609
What the…

190
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,236
Shit.

191
00:19:56,778 --> 00:20:00,115
-You bastards.
-What are you waiting for? Drag her down.

192
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,538
SERVICE UNAVAILABLE

193
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,794
Stay away.

194
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,509
Crap. Stay away!

195
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,429
Go away!

196
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,145
Go away, or I'll jump!

197
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,271
I really will.

198
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,857
Don't you dare. I'm going to jump!

199
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,341
-Don't move!
-Stop!

200
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,846
Didn't you hear me? I said stop!

201
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,473
What's this?

202
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,229
Wait, you're the one
who brought these thugs here?

203
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,023
Huh? You're the lowest of the low.

204
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,109
Now you're getting thugs involved?

205
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,070
Oh Kyung-sook,
stop talking, and come down.

206
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:20,988
Now!

207
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,823
Are you nuts?

208
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,742
Why? Does your master
want me captured alive?

209
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,829
Forget it.
Tell her I'm not going anywhere.

210
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,914
You idiots, get up there and grab her!

211
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,000
Stop it!

212
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,214
I'm in charge here.

213
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,135
I never gave you permission
to come up, so leave.

214
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,304
Don't you hear me? Get back down!

215
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,657
No! Stop!

216
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,619
"Ms. Oh!"

217
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,675
Huh? What's that?

218
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:29,348
The footage of the human rights attorney
Oh's jump from a rooftop

219
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,351
has not only moved Korea
but the entire world.

220
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,187
With this jump,
she declared the establishment guilty,

221
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,980
bringing an end to their hubris.

222
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,858
The faith and courage
to jump from that rooftop…

223
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,611
The hope of the workers, Oh Kyung-sook!

224
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,030
Oh Kyung-sook,
we love you for bringing justice.

225
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,698
OH SACRIFICED HERSELF FOR WORKERS

226
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,117
HER NOBLE DEEDS ARE RECORDED IN HISTORY

227
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,035
SUBSCRIBERS

228
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:54,790
Former councilor Oh's YouTube channel
has now surpassed one million subscribers

229
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,958
and is getting massive attention.

230
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:01,421
Various global human rights groups,
including Amnesty International, stated…

231
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,090
This cult-like popularity

232
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:07,052
is possible because she's the new hero
that the public has been waiting for.

233
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,262
OH KYUNG-SOOK SYNDROME
WHAT IS THE CAUSE?

234
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,390
In this era when we need a true hero…

235
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,852
GET WELL SOON

236
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,938
What are you doing?

237
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,024
Let's see how far they'll go
to glorify you.

238
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,486
Stop watching!

239
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,279
I told you I didn't jump.

240
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,366
Gosh, my wife is so humble.

241
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,243
Seriously, I told you…

242
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,702
Give me that!

243
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,622
Okay, fine. Here you go.

244
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,084
You can't interview her now!

245
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,587
You can't. She can't talk right now.

246
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,549
Ms. Oh needs to rest now.

247
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,508
Please leave.

248
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,760
We'll set a date and let you know.

249
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,929
RHINO WITH WINGS
OH KYUNG-SOOK

250
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,764
OH KYUNG-SOOK'S WOMAN POWER!

251
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,682
Wow.

252
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,478
Shouldn't we recruit her
to our party right away?

253
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,606
We'll let you know.

254
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,321
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

255
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,906
Please leave.

256
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,377
-Only family members are allowed.
-I'm family.

257
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:45,942
I'm sorry.

258
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,743
-Our son?
-He's at school.

259
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,162
What did he say?

260
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,082
I'm glad
he didn't develop speech issues.

261
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,253
Whatever the reason,
he saw his mom jump off a rooftop.

262
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,049
Even I, someone who's lived with you
for 15 years, was flabbergasted.

263
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,258
The thing is,

264
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,804
it's not that I meant
to jump off the building.

265
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,806
That's not it.

266
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:21,811
-What are you talking about?
-I was forced to jump.

267
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,439
Toilet Hwang, that crazy bitch.

268
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,316
Because of that woman…

269
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,758
So it's true

270
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,719
that you used brute force.

271
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,473
Given the state of you,
I'm sure you lead them to the rooftop.

272
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,183
Go away.

273
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,936
I've got nothing to say.

274
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,438
You sure are something.

275
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,735
I accepted you saying you didn't realize
our marriage was crumbling

276
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,196
'cause you were too busy
chasing the Eun family.

277
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,199
But do you have to do it
while harming yourself?

278
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,534
Let me get some rest.

279
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:20,203
Why are you still loyal to them?
You deserve better.

280
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:32,591
While Former Councilor Oh's jump
has become

281
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,759
the talk of the town these days,

282
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,679
people have started boycotting
the Eunsung Department Store

283
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,308
for firing part-time employees
with growing support.

284
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,727
The criticism against Eunsung's owners

285
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,271
is growing just as fast.

286
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:51,151
This morning, Mayor Sa Jae-gon
visited the Sangah redevelopment district

287
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:55,780
to strongly demand Eunsung Construction
leave the construction site,

288
00:26:56,323 --> 00:27:00,410
and drew attention for uploading a post
criticizing Eunsung on his social media.

289
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,871
Where were you?

290
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:08,126
That arrogant prick is spitting on me,
and I have no roof to protect me?

291
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,712
Don't I even get a cheap umbrella?

292
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,964
I'm sorry.

293
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,342
This is why we can't trust anyone
but family.

294
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,929
I'll be on top of things.
Please calm down.

295
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,099
What's gotten into Sa Jae-gon?

296
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:26,227
He thinks he's being smart.
To be reelected.

297
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,732
Thanks to you, Eunsung's image
has been tarnished lately.

298
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,736
He wants to cut ties with us
and find a stronger rope to hold onto.

299
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,034
Where the hell is Do-hee?

300
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,703
She took sick leave.

301
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,497
Sick leave?

302
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,751
She seems pretty shaken after the girl
from her team committed suicide.

303
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,297
She's bedridden at a time like this
because of one dead employee?

304
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,676
Ma'am, why don't we reprimand her later

305
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,720
and talk about
the fired temp workers first?

306
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,890
If we can't turn public opinion
around now,

307
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:08,061
not only the redevelopment project
but the succession plan…

308
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,648
Let's reinstate them all.

309
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,487
Think of it as an investment in me.

310
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,657
I think the bet's worth making

311
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,451
in a difficult situation like this.

312
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,206
Leave us.

313
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,803
You two as well.

314
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,863
I didn't expect to see you today.

315
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,949
You ruined your marriage
by having an affair,

316
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,993
and became the black sheep of the family.

317
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,162
Are you worried?

318
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,205
You must be the one who's worried.

319
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:14,377
You jeopardized your chances of inheriting
Eunsung due to your crazy behavior,

320
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,504
so you brought your husband.

321
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,635
Can he even get it up?

322
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,661
Behave yourself,

323
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,333
or I'll take away
what little inheritance you have.

324
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,220
Investment?

325
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,933
This is the first time
you've asked me for something directly.

326
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,021
I didn't think
I could afford to be subtle.

327
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:15,939
And…

328
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,779
I thought you must have already finished
your assessment of me

329
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,531
in the past seven years.

330
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,241
"Assessment"?

331
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,952
I know you want to make me a politician.

332
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:34,249
Wasn't that why you accepted me
as your son-in-law in the first place?

333
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,376
You're right.

334
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,589
You've worked hard over the years.

335
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,843
That's why I dare to make this suggestion.

336
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,470
I'm good with words,

337
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,764
I obey what you say,

338
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,601
I even live with your problematic daughter
without complaining.

339
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,564
Your goal is to rise to the top
of the business world

340
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,815
using me as your pawn.

341
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,610
I believe the time has come
to realize that goal.

342
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,410
People are suckers for a grand gesture.

343
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:13,705
If you surprise them
by reinstating the workers,

344
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:17,250
it'll improve the image of our group,
stop the boycott,

345
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,460
and appease the public's anger
all at once.

346
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,588
Mayor Sa, who's running rampant…

347
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,758
will be on edge.

348
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,848
Have you discussed this with Do-hee?

349
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,685
No.

350
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,770
It's my own idea,

351
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,648
and I'll carry it out alone.

352
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,445
I like your idea
of covering one issue with another,

353
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,240
but can you do this alone?

354
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,951
We lost a mere mutt.

355
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,329
I can still protect our house.

356
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,980
How dare you cut out someone I had
under my wing for over ten years?

357
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,026
Because she refused to sweep
your womanizing under the rug?

358
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,444
How dare you!

359
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:36,120
I'll let it slide this once,
so consider yourself lucky.

360
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,707
But your luck will run out one day.

361
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,460
You think you're smart,

362
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,046
but when your luck runs out,
you're nothing.

363
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,053
Being with my daughter
is the luckiest aspect of your life,

364
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,180
so hold onto her tight.

365
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,977
Duly noted.

366
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,946
I know why you want me to invest in you,

367
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,074
and I want to see
your detailed business proposal.

368
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,120
Come in.

369
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,287
CONDOLENCES
EUNSUNG GROUP

370
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,977
OUR CONDOLENCES
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

371
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,397
My deepest condolences.

372
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,399
Mr. Baek,

373
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,111
thank you for coming.

374
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,322
I should've taken better care of her.

375
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm terribly sorry.

376
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,328
Don't worry about the funeral expenses.

377
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,206
Just focus on

378
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,167
honoring I-seul.

379
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,505
Thank you so much, Mr. Baek.

380
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,007
Thank you so much.

381
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,386
I really can't thank you enough.

382
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,557
Thank you so much.

383
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,986
Thank you, Ms. Hwang.

384
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:57,780
Stay strong.

385
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,724
What's all this?

386
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,603
Only celebrities receive
meals like this from their fans.

387
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,023
You got this from your fans
all across the nation.

388
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,024
Where to begin?

389
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,903
-Abalones? Yukhoe?
-I don't feel like eating.

390
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,239
Ms. Oh.

391
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,034
I saw everything.

392
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:45,786
Saw what?

393
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,789
What happened on the rooftop.

394
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,836
Hwang Do-hee took the thugs to the rooftop
and pushed you off the building.

395
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,637
I won't let them get away with it.

396
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,726
I used to work with the guys
who were there on that day.

397
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,979
I'm going to chase them down
and make them--

398
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:12,897
Yoon Dong-joo.

399
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,402
Pull yourself together. Okay?

400
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,030
You just got out of that shithole.

401
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,368
You're not going back to that life.
Are you a thug?

402
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,545
Who are you?

403
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,841
I'm from the Eunsung
Corporate Strategy Team.

404
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,094
How dare you show your face here?

405
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,470
Dong-joo.

406
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,283
I heard you like apples.

407
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,450
Gosh.

408
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,206
You sent those thugs up to beat me up,

409
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,416
and now

410
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,127
you brought a few lousy apples?

411
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,713
You think this will cut it?

412
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,798
Listen.

413
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:25,845
I won't let this slide.
This is clearly attempted murder.

414
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,769
How about we give
everyone their jobs back?

415
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,356
If you accept our apology

416
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,444
and don't make an issue about that day,
we'll make it happen right away.

417
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,740
If you're thinking
of taking things to court,

418
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,619
we won't be able to agree to your demand.

419
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,311
Try this. It'll be better than whiskey
on a day like this.

420
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,658
You look good.

421
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,993
Thank you.

422
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,704
I'm good enough to listen to your story.

423
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,842
Did you see the news?

424
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,303
Things must be tense at Eunsung.

425
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,306
Chairwoman Son's greed is endless.

426
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,309
Her two girls
are becoming wilder each day.

427
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,859
A girl from my team died.

428
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,071
Don't tell me.

429
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,323
Was it Baek Jae-min?

430
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,704
It took longer than expected.

431
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,291
Before he married Chae-ryoung,

432
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,961
I did a background check on him.

433
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,338
That asshole was flirting
with an announcer

434
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,258
until the day before the wedding.

435
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,762
I repeatedly warned Ms. Son
to keep her eyes on him,

436
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,305
but she wouldn't listen.

437
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,350
Once she decided
to accept him into her family,

438
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,353
she closed her eyes and covered her ears.

439
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,649
Should I have done the same?

440
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,195
As you taught me,

441
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:53,367
I should've closed my eyes,
covered my ears, and kept my mouth shut.

442
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:57,705
Hwang Do-hee.

443
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,957
What's on your mind?

444
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,210
You've enjoyed a comfortable life,

445
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,088
but now you feel too guilty to keep going.

446
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,006
Is that it?

447
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,426
You feel like you killed her
with your own hands?

448
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,233
DELETE THIS?
DELETE

449
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,569
Come in.

450
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,662
Ms. Guk.

451
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,125
Coffee?

452
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,342
I went to the hospital
and talked to Ms. Oh Kyung-sook.

453
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,303
And?

454
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,681
She seemed tempted
to reinstate all the workers.

455
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,017
Is that so? Thank you.

456
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:02,937
Excuse me.

457
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,458
It looks good on you.

458
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,212
Can I…

459
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,132
bet everything…

460
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,553
on you, Mr. Baek?

461
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,517
Do you think everything will end
if you just quit?

462
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,396
Cha-sun--

463
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,313
After you quit,

464
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,317
someone as smart as you will replace you

465
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:53,988
and clean up the messes
the Euns make, just like you have.

466
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,449
-Do you really think so?
-Of course.

467
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,120
That wretched family will never change.

468
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,498
How will you take them down on your own?

469
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,457
Dinner?

470
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,042
I'm good.

471
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:53,255
I wanted to visit you at the hospital,
but I was grounded.

472
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,716
Mom locked me up here

473
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,011
so I wouldn't go and make things
worse than they were.

474
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,473
Getting a divorce isn't a crime.
Am I wrong?

475
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,393
Why did you want to see me?

476
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,356
I heard a girl on your team
killed herself.

477
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,489
Yes.

478
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,408
Baek Jae-min is involved, right?

479
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,246
Ms. Hwang. I'm not stupid.

480
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:31,460
I may seem like a spoiled rich girl
who wastes money and likes men,

481
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,506
but I'm smart enough to know
Jae-min in power would be a disaster.

482
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:42,179
Then should we tell your mother
about what really happened?

483
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,724
Go public.

484
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,936
Make it the biggest shitshow ever.

485
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,021
How?

486
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,857
I heard that she used to work
at a hostess bar.

487
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,402
Let's say that he met her at the bar,

488
00:44:56,485 --> 00:45:00,280
sponsored her, paid her tuition,
and smuggled her into his wife's company.

489
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,409
Then he took her abroad
for volunteer work as an excuse

490
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,868
and enjoyed their tryst.

491
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,704
Then she became pregnant.

492
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,124
Baek Jae-min betrayed her.
She was heartbroken and jumped.

493
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,501
Only a story as messy as this

494
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,838
could make Mom turn her back on him.

495
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,965
Are you trying

496
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,135
to kill I-seul all over again?

497
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,846
She took her own life anyway.

498
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,600
When I take over this company
instead of Chae-ryoung and Jae-min,

499
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,145
I'll take you under my wing.

500
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:36,316
Now that Baek Jae-min's won over Mom,
you're no longer useful to her.

501
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,738
It'd be unfair for you
to be ousted like this.

502
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,116
When I have to step down, I will.

503
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,413
But I promised Chairwoman Son my loyalty.

504
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,707
Whether I'm ousted or I stay,

505
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,334
I'll follow the Chairwoman's orders.

506
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:58,839
I knew it.

507
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,509
Mom did such a great job
training her mutt.

508
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,973
You got that right.

509
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,352
So please don't insult the deceased I-seul

510
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,938
or provoke I-seul's family.

511
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,859
I might go after the master's daughter.

512
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,006
Rumors of illegal slush funds
that Mayor Sa had been keeping…

513
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,551
It is rumored that during his candidacy,
a Korean-American businessman…

514
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,388
…in the overseas Korean community
where he was given 600 million won…

515
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,979
Call Chairwoman Son,
and ask her to dinner.

516
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,481
Yes, sir.

517
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,207
Sea bream is in season now.

518
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,884
I should've invited you first.

519
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,428
I agree.

520
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,015
You seem quite busy lately,

521
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,310
so I made a special exception today.

522
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,484
I don't want to be a useless old hag,
so I keep myself busy.

523
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,699
Is this your doing, ma'am?

524
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,624
Ma'am.

525
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:02,504
I'm the mayor of Seoul
AKA the vice president of Korea.

526
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:08,886
You still think of me as an employee
at one of your companies.

527
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,096
Get a hold of yourself. Why?

528
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:15,517
I, Sa Jae-gon, am no longer intimidated
by your threats.

529
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,107
What's your plan?

530
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,278
Will you cough up all the money I spent

531
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,281
on making you mayor?

532
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:40,083
Give up the Sangah District
redevelopment project, and take a break.

533
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:44,838
You've already made enough money
with all the help I've given you thus far.

534
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,095
Why don't you finish this?

535
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,932
I'm not really into fish

536
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,393
whose heads have gotten too big.

537
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,236
-Proceed.
-Yes, ma'am.

538
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,369
Moon Yong-soon, Mayor Sa's wife,

539
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,664
was spotted wearing 300 million won
worth of jewelry

540
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,167
at the charity exhibition
that was held a month ago,

541
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,044
and it's causing great controversy.

542
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,464
The jewelry that she was wearing
is a limited edition not sold in Korea.

543
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,424
UNDER SUSPICION OF SMUGGLING DIAMONDS

544
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,135
The Korean branch of the brand
denied providing the item

545
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,929
to her in a sponsorship deal.

546
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,555
Do you see this?

547
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,640
The question is,

548
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:40,435
who gave her the jewelry as a bribe?

549
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,063
Oh, wow, thank you.

550
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,022
What's this?

551
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,774
A hundred million?

552
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,984
DONATION COMPLETE

553
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,194
Yes.

554
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,071
Yes.

555
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,656
Thank you.

556
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,325
Shouldn't we finish him off?

557
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,036
How much more time should we waste on him?

558
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,038
Yes, ma'am. We'll wrap it up.

559
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,749
Mayor Sa's second son was arrested

560
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,334
for hosting drug parties.

561
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,587
Currently studying in the US,
Mayor Sa's second son was charged

562
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,550
with injecting a large amount of meth
at a club in LA's Koreatown.

563
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,554
The fact that he frequently hosted
drug parties was a shock to people.

564
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:22,060
I sincerely apologize
for disappointing the citizens of Seoul

565
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:28,942
with the recent shameful scandals
regarding my family members.

566
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:30,944
I hereby

567
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,697
resign from the position of mayor.

568
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,657
I'm sorry.

569
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,492
RESIGNATION OF SA JAE-GON, SEOUL'S MAYOR

570
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,454
Wasn't the press release
regarding your wife a mere rumor?

571
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,999
If you resign, you're admitting
the rumors are actually true…

572
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:51,715
So, you're going to take the mound now

573
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,675
and turn the tables?

574
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,304
I'll need a grand entrance to do so.

575
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,556
How?

576
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,143
As I told you before,

577
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,230
people are suckers for a grand gesture.

578
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:09,649
ACTING CEO BAEK JAE-MIN

579
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,489
WE WELCOME YOU AS A PART OF OUR FAMILY

580
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,742
EUNSUNG DEPARTMENT STORE
PERMANENT EMPLOYEE SIGNING CEREMONY

581
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,297
You did it!

582
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,260
Everyone.

583
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,055
It's been quite a journey.

584
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,518
You've fought hard
for your survival and won.

585
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:50,899
I promise I will take care of you
as if you were my own family.

586
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,984
Welcome back.

587
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,494
Good work.

588
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,165
Thank you for coming.

589
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:15,257
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

590
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,968
I should've visited you earlier.

591
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,220
But as you know,

592
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,766
I wasn't free to do as I wanted.

593
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,518
I'm aware of

594
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,396
your hard work on this.

595
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,190
I won't forget this. Thank you.

596
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,154
Let's continue working together.

597
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:48,039
Lawyer Oh Kyung-sook,
who protested on the rooftop

598
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,293
of Eunsung Department Store,
was also present.

599
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:55,630
Director Baek Jae-min
sincerely thanked Ms. Oh,

600
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,842
who jumped from the rooftop
to get the workers reinstated.

601
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,969
Mr. Baek.

602
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,805
Is it true that you'll be running
in the by-election

603
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,473
now that Mayor Sa has resigned?

604
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,560
Well.

605
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,562
Is that a yes?

606
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,148
It's not about the title.

607
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:18,028
I want to serve the people.
I'll put it that way.

608
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,199
If, by any chance,

609
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:28,163
the citizens of Seoul were to grant me
the noble honor of being mayor,

610
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:34,711
I want to serve people with all my heart
to the fullest extent of my abilities.

611
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,505
That'll be all.

612
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:42,135
Are you saying you're officially running?

613
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,555
The star of today's event isn't me,

614
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,475
but you, who got your job back.

615
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,936
Everyone here…

616
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:53,939
is family to me.

617
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,212
I apologize once again.

618
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,506
And thank you for everything.

619
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,676
We'll stay together until the end.

620
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,804
-Together until the end.
-Until the end!

621
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,014
-Together until the end!
-Until the end!

622
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:28,932
Thank you.

623
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,059
BAEK JAE-MIN HELPS
REACH DRAMATIC AGREEMENT

624
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,998
That was a long sick leave.

625
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,501
I'm sorry, ma'am.

626
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,839
No need to apologize.
You must've been pretty shaken.

627
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,093
It's a sin not to mourn a death.

628
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,642
But neglecting your duty
because of a dead person

629
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:14,644
is a greater sin.

630
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:16,980
Ma'am.

631
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:18,648
Forget about what Jae-min did.

632
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,694
He's destined for greater things.

633
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:27,574
We should ignore a small mistake
that he made in order to relieve stress.

634
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,868
It wasn't a mistake. It was a crime.

635
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,209
What are you trying to say?

636
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,171
Mr. Baek cannot be mayor.

637
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,841
He is a beast running rampant,

638
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:48,845
incapable of feeling guilt even when
his actions caused a girl's death.

639
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,265
And you want to give him a sword?

640
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,352
There's no guarantee
that he won't stab you with it--

641
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,788
Jae-min seemed quite upset with you.

642
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,167
Give him your sincere apologies,

643
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,253
and prepare for his campaign.

644
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,255
Ma'am.

645
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,050
That girl, Guk something,
has taken over your position.

646
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:33,139
But I could never trust anyone
who is still so wet behind the ears.

647
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:37,435
I'll never know whether she'll grow up
to be a useless weed

648
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:41,523
or bring me
a bountiful harvest in due time.

649
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,402
Reclaim your position.

650
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,071
And make sure

651
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,074
that Jae-min becomes mayor.

652
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,131
I refuse.

653
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,934
I refuse…

654
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,398
to follow your order.
