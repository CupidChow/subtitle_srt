1
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,721
I was wondering what you were up to.

2
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,682
You've been living in hell,

3
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,103
where only beasts were born
and live in poverty

4
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,732
because of the sins they committed
in their past lives.

5
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:13,073
Jacob's wife from the Old Testament.

6
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,577
The woman who prospered her whole life

7
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,039
as her reward for obeying God, Leah.

8
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,587
That's the name Chae-ryoung used
while studying abroad.

9
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,382
It was you, just as I expected.

10
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,469
The de facto owner of Leah Company.

11
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:38,932
Of course.

12
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,434
You've always been

13
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,020
such a smart girl.

14
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,817
It seems that you take after me

15
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,863
more than the daughter
that I gave birth to.

16
00:01:55,573 --> 00:02:00,078
If you really meant that, you would've
dropped a hint about this earlier.

17
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,250
I spent over ten years
of my life serving you,

18
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,629
but I didn't even know
Leah Company existed.

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,173
But, of course,

20
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,760
you wouldn't give the keys
to the safe to a mere guard dog.

21
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,640
-Did that disappoint you?
-Not at all.

22
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:25,728
I'm glad not to have sunk myself
deeper into the hell

23
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,190
that you've created.

24
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,115
Do-hee.

25
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,079
You should stop now.

26
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,251
You taught me how to run…

27
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,630
but you never taught me how to stop.

28
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,386
Are you sure?

29
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,891
That you can handle
whatever happens to you?

30
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:05,351
Wasn't it you who told me
that it was my destiny

31
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,189
to handle things beyond my control?

32
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,117
It's gotten chilly.

33
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,705
Take care of yourself.

34
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,168
You've always been

35
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,338
sensitive to cold weather.

36
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,608
Leah Company is a hot topic.

37
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,362
The acting mayor, Kim Jeong-do,
has finally commented on the connection…

38
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,363
Don't you worry.

39
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,448
…between Seoul and Leah Company.

40
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,284
Acting Mayor Kim said the allegations…

41
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,204
This only happened because Hwang Do-hee
knows this family inside out.

42
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,375
You will solve the problem
as the pillar of the family.

43
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,673
I would prefer it if problems didn't occur
in the first place.

44
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,510
Take care of Hwang Do-hee ASAP.

45
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,305
We'll do our best

46
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,474
in the jobs that we each have.

47
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,490
I've prepared a bold color
for you to wear.

48
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,787
Your next stop is
a visit to a digital market.

49
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,248
Don't worry about me.

50
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,001
Focus on supporting Chae-ryoung.

51
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,315
Something's up with them.

52
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,027
That seems a bit overdramatic
for picking out a tie.

53
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,572
Keep your husband in check.

54
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,658
He can't risk messing things up
with another affair.

55
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,708
Is that the best you can come up with
while sitting in the spot

56
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,418
you stole from me?

57
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,299
Your stupidity is the reason

58
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,551
you always lost to me.

59
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,847
Chae-ryoung, grow up.

60
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,559
I didn't lose to you. I walked out myself.

61
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,771
I didn't want to live
as mom's puppet, like you.

62
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,524
Brace yourself.

63
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,026
If Jae-min doesn't become mayor,

64
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,487
Mom will disown you in no time.

65
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,574
You were only my replacement
to begin with.

66
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,332
You must've cared for Hwang Do-hee
more than I thought.

67
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,126
Visiting her in person
at a time like this.

68
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,131
Why haven't you

69
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,301
taken care of Do-hee yet?

70
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,345
I did it for you, ma'am.

71
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,349
I didn't return

72
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,894
just to make
your son-in-law Seoul's mayor.

73
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:41,979
Then?

74
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:46,651
Through this election, I intended to make
Baek Jae-min a presidential candidate

75
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:50,947
so that I can place the whole nation
in the palm of your hand.

76
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,631
Do you think that's possible,
realistically speaking?

77
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,009
It's what the people truly want.

78
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,888
What have they ever gotten
as a result of the squabbles

79
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,974
between the liberals and conservatives?

80
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,310
They'd rather live
in a world ruled by money.

81
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,688
It'd be a lot simpler.

82
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,357
Why do you need

83
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,528
a dangerous beast like Do-hee
in that grand plan?

84
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,200
Elections are the most entertaining shows
in the world.

85
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,787
The show must be a success
for a star to be born.

86
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:44,292
We need someone interesting
like Oh Kyung-sook to grab attention

87
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:49,338
and someone cunning like Hwang Do-hee
to play the villain

88
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,717
for our dear candidate Baek's victory
to seem more dramatic.

89
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,846
I understand you are set on this,

90
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,517
but it will all be in vain
if the duty-free shop fails.

91
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,187
And Do-hee knows that better than anyone.

92
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,693
Any other requests?

93
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,332
Do-hee…

94
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,755
Get rid of her.

95
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,155
CREATE A NEW TOMORROW FOR SEOUL TOGETHER
OH KYUNG-SOOK

96
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,284
Approval rating?

97
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,746
Steadily increasing.

98
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,584
We still fall short
against Baek Jae-min head-to-head,

99
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,088
but we have a chance once we bring over
Seo Min-jung's supporters.

100
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,135
Ms. Hwang,
why don't we cut the dead wood already?

101
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,430
Our goal is to win the main election,
not to defeat Seo Min-jung.

102
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,475
You're right. Are the ingredients ready?

103
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,310
Yes.

104
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,521
HYUAN COSMETIC SURGERY

105
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,564
Three times a month,

106
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,109
Seo Min-jung received VVIP care

107
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,528
from Hyuan Cosmetic Surgery
in Cheongdam-dong.

108
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,156
I bribed the manager and asked
about how Seo makes her payments,

109
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,367
and I hit the jackpot.

110
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,829
"KM Management"?

111
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,124
All the artists and actors
that are signed with them

112
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,583
receive care at Hyuan.

113
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,962
KM has been covering the costs
of Seo Min-jung's treatment too.

114
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,088
And what's this?

115
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,842
We looked into who it was
that introduced Seo Min-jung to KM,

116
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,344
and it was a private art tutoring group
in Gangnam.

117
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:04,598
She's paying 20 million won a month
for her daughter's violin lessons alone.

118
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,227
And how is this tutoring group
connected to KM Management?

119
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,689
The daughter of the parent
who let Seo Min-jung into the group

120
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,649
is an artist signed with KM Management.

121
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,694
The one who was in the news recently
for smuggling ecstasy.

122
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:17,862
No way.

123
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,240
She brought Seo Min-jung in
to keep her daughter's mishap a secret.

124
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,826
This is huge, like a nuclear bomb,
Ms. Hwang.

125
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,078
Keep KM and the cosmetic surgery
out of this.

126
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:26,996
Sorry?

127
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,915
But KM is the key here.

128
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,837
It's the education that will rile up
every mother in Korea.

129
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,214
Keep the focus on that issue.

130
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,633
It will be the mothers

131
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,802
of this country

132
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,347
who will bring her down
and not Oh Kyung-sook.

133
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,810
No to expensive private tutoring!

134
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,936
-No!
-No!

135
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,063
No to education inequality!

136
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,733
We demand Seo Min-jung resign immediately!

137
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,276
-Resign!
-Resign!

138
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,402
NO SEO MIN-JUNG

139
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,613
Expel Seo Min-jung's daughter!

140
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,531
Expel her!

141
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,577
-We demand Seo Min-jung apologize!
-Apologize!

142
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,496
Seo Min-jung's daughter should be expel…

143
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,003
You!

144
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,548
Is this also that bitch's doing?
Your ex-wife?

145
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,637
Release a statement denying everything,

146
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,599
and sue Hwang Do-hee and Oh Kyung-sook
for defamation and spreading falsehoods.

147
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,353
One wrong move,
and you risk violating election laws.

148
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,357
For today, we should prepare
meticulous countermeasures--

149
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,274
Shut it!

150
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:42,196
No smear campaign or fabrication.
Not even any legal action!

151
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,782
You son of a bitch. Who are you, a saint?

152
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,117
Oh Kyung-sook is even taking
all the swing voters!

153
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,995
How can you be so laid back,
you meticulous jerk?

154
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,758
Let's bring Jae-i in.

155
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,552
What?

156
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,264
Are you suggesting I sell my daughter
out to the public as a figurehead?

157
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,850
The primary election is
in less than 15 days.

158
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,311
As you just said,
we're even losing our loyal supporters

159
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,064
because of this private tutoring issue
with Jae-i.

160
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,237
If we miss this window,
there's no turning back.

161
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,452
Come on. You're hurting me! It hurts!

162
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,663
-What's with you?
-Han Jae-i!

163
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,959
-Can you listen to me already?
-Why should I help out with your campaign?

164
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,546
What about my rights?

165
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,050
You want to get into Juilliard, right?

166
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,261
And you want a place
on Park Avenue, don't you?

167
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,890
None of that will be possible
if I lose this election, okay?

168
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,933
Shit! This sucks!

169
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,688
Do a good job
if you want to become a New Yorker

170
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,690
and have your fancy
human rights protected!

171
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,701
Jae-i, you have to read
what's written here and--

172
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:11,911
Read it for me.

173
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,585
You were being bullied in school,
and because of that stress--

174
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,795
Do I look like a loser to you? Do I?

175
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,089
Bullied?

176
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,593
Why are you making me out to be a loser
when I'm not?!

177
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,910
You're shameless, aren't you?

178
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,915
I knew you were stupid, but…

179
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,503
You know your mom changed

180
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,381
the entry regulations to art high schools

181
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,470
and accepts conglomerate money
for your lessons because you lack talent.

182
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,144
You're responsible for at least 80%
of the wrongs your mom committed.

183
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,647
As her accomplice,

184
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,316
this is the least you can do.

185
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,240
SEO, THE ONLY OPTION
FOR COMMON FOLK AND THE ECONOMY

186
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,210
Jeez!

187
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,931
Don't be nervous.

188
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,143
Whatever.

189
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,733
We should get going.

190
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,411
What the hell!

191
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,630
Tidy her up.

192
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,799
Like all she does is study.

193
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,219
And like she's been through hell
with bullying and school violence.

194
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,389
Make her look
as naive and pitiful as possible.

195
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,491
When

196
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,911
I went to middle school in America,

197
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,956
I was badly bullied
and racially discriminated against.

198
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,335
Having suffered from school violence
for so long,

199
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,089
I became emotionally unstable
and depressed.

200
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,551
My days were filled
with thoughts of suicide.

201
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:21,183
That was when my mom
suggested music therapy,

202
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,394
and I finally started to find hope.

203
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,898
When I played the violin,

204
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:31,777
I could escape the terrible trauma
imprisoning me.

205
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,254
In order to heal
my daughter's wounded heart,

206
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,884
I had no choice but to get her
expensive music therapy.

207
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,766
I knew that it would end up fatally
jeopardizing my political career.

208
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,479
But I…

209
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,403
I felt this desperate need as a mother

210
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,822
to save my child.

211
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:25,831
The violin was never an extravagant means
to get into good schools for either of us.

212
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,541
It was a lifeline

213
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,378
we desperately clung to!

214
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,841
Please, find it in your hearts
to forgive my daughter.

215
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,677
As the People's Servant,

216
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,388
I promise to expiate my guilt,

217
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,433
and devote the rest of my life
to serving this country!

218
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,686
Jae-i!

219
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,481
Jae-i!

220
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,694
Jae-i!

221
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,333
Wow, she's such an amazing actress.

222
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,432
With ten days until the primary election,

223
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,476
the issue of Seo's daughter…

224
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,853
No wonder she served three terms.

225
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,438
She won't go down so easily.

226
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,565
She revealed that she was bullied…

227
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,483
You're right.

228
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,113
We'd better hurry on to the next step.

229
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,210
Ms. Seo.
You're regaining the support you lost.

230
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,128
Your loyal supporters have returned.

231
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,631
Don't get excited.
Oh Kyung-sook isn't dead yet.

232
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,313
Ms. Seo.

233
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,041
Nice to meet you, Ms. Seo.

234
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,628
I was moved
by your passionate motherly love.

235
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:38,588
Thank you.

236
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,760
Well, now it's time for me
to repay you for your moving speech.

237
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,438
There's a hole in the account that holds

238
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,648
Oh's campaign funds?

239
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,775
Well, it's not an actual hole,

240
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,654
but there's a crack
that could become a hole.

241
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm well aware that you are a legend

242
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,621
in the world of politics. That said,

243
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,458
do I look like a joke to you?

244
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,210
Or do you think I'm an easy target?

245
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,799
You seem to think it'd be better for you
if I went to the final round

246
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,010
instead of a nobody like Oh Kyung-sook.

247
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,430
I find it very offensive
and extremely insulting.

248
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,392
The heart of politics is having class.

249
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,021
We had a president
without a university degree,

250
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,024
we impeached a president
with candlelight vigils,

251
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,777
and former political activists
are running amok,

252
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,695
but we must maintain some class.

253
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,240
To have some weed, a nobody
like Oh Kyung-sook, become Seoul's mayor

254
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,493
would be truly offensive.

255
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,246
So, you want to use me
to get rid of that weed

256
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,541
and become
Baek Jae-min's sacrificial lamb?

257
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,419
Not a sacrificial lamb
but a symbol of hope.

258
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:04,299
When two true leaders with class
compete in good faith,

259
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:10,055
a healthy tension will return
to this rotten political world.

260
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,645
To the campaign office.

261
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,856
Let's come up with a plan
on Oh's campaign funds.

262
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,442
-We already looked into it, but nothing--
-Hey!

263
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,987
I even had to cut my daughter's hair
to get this chance.

264
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:29,866
We have to deal Oh Kyung-sook a big blow
and make it into the final round.

265
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,701
That's why I'm telling you.

266
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,997
-If we were to take just any bait they--
-Joong-seok!

267
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,252
When I become mayor,

268
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,547
who do you think I'll give my district to?

269
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,507
Sorry?

270
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,968
Are you going to spend
the rest of your career

271
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,430
cleaning up after me
and going from camp to camp?

272
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,267
You know this.

273
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,978
No matter how smart you are,

274
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,647
you're a nobody if you don't get elected.

275
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,943
Let's go. Trust me.

276
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,136
WOMEN'S ALLIANCE, SOOM
WILL THEY TURN TO ACTIVISM?

277
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,140
SOOM, A WOMEN'S ALLIANCE,
FORMED IN 2019 TO REINSTATE TEMP WORKERS

278
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,106
MAJANG-DONG PREMIUM KOREAN BEEF

279
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,274
"Majang-dong"?

280
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:50,363
I like that keyword.
All right. Let's start with that.

281
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:54,701
Oh Kyung-sook, common folk's spokesperson,
uses donations for the Women's Alliance

282
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:59,122
to feast on expensive Korean beef.

283
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,625
Korean beef dinner.

284
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,878
We should check
if she used the money there personally.

285
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,922
She's been there many times.

286
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,007
-Her employees might--
-What's the total?

287
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,509
A total of 3.6 million won.

288
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,886
With workers' hard-earned money,

289
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,388
she treated herself
to 3.6 million won worth of beef?

290
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,306
She's done for.

291
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,642
-Ms. Seo, you can't do this.
-Why not?

292
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,312
-If we get caught fabricating a story--
-We're not fabricating a story.

293
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,774
We're restoring balance
and making things right.

294
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,152
"Balance"?

295
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,863
In the past, when a child
worthy of being a general

296
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,074
was born to a low class family,

297
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,825
the family would maim that child

298
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,827
to prevent the child's destiny.

299
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:42,249
Someone with the face of a king
when they are not of royal birth

300
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,668
would break the balance of the world.

301
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,630
If we destroy Oh Kyung-sook,

302
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,590
a better world will come.

303
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,717
OH KYUNG-SOOK FEASTS LIKE AN EMPRESS

304
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,720
DONATION MONEY FOR PERSONAL USE

305
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,515
COMMON FOLK'S FRIEND
IS EXPENSIVE BEEF LOVER?

306
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,434
EAT BEEF WITH DONATION MONEY?

307
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:06,189
CANDIDATE OH ENJOYS DINNER WITH DONATION
MONEY FROM A WOMEN'S ORGANIZATION

308
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,817
Change the headline to a comment
by a taxi driver or a waiter.

309
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,820
Use the common folk's voice
to rouse their anger.

310
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,864
Publish the exact amount of donations
and the cost of the meal.

311
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,575
3.6 MILLION WON OF BEEF?

312
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,076
And for every article,

313
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,705
add the phrase "Republic of Korea."

314
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,627
Middle-aged people get riled up
by patriotism.

315
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,426
This Carl Yoon is an amazing storyteller.

316
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,553
He is the best there is.

317
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,682
If this gets out,
Oh Kyung-sook won't survive another day.

318
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,268
We should nail her coffin shut.

319
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,772
Violation of Campaign Fund Act,
Local Finances Act,

320
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,900
fraud, embezzlement, minor fraud,
and breach of duty. How many?

321
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,152
Six in total.

322
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,155
Sort them out,
and ask Mr. Yoon to go over them.

323
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,866
Tell him I'll hit her tomorrow
when I get the signal.

324
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,451
Yes, ma'am.

325
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,220
Okay, we've prepared everything.

326
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,766
Why don't we give Oh Kyung-sook

327
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,144
her farewell present?

328
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,777
Allegations that Oh Kyung-sook,
the Reform Party of Korea's

329
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,738
Seoul mayoral primary election candidate,
abused money donated for Soom,

330
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,908
an organization to reinstate
fired female workers, have surfaced.

331
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,161
Oh, who protested for the reinstatement
of female temp workers

332
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,288
fired from Eunsung Department Store,

333
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,375
was found to have used
some of the donations

334
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,418
for personal use,

335
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,629
and the members who worked with her

336
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,548
have either turned a blind eye
or actively hidden this fact,

337
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,550
greatly disappointing the common people.

338
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,510
Ms. Oh!

339
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,970
-She tampered with the books…
-Please step out!

340
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,764
-Ms. Oh! Can you come out…
-Ms. Oh!

341
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,599
There she is.

342
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,226
Do you admit to embezzlement?

343
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,321
Ms. Hwang, what's going on?

344
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,949
Deny all accusations
and put an embargo on the press.

345
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,744
Don't do anything other than that
until I arrive at the office.

346
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,454
What about Seo Min-jung's camp?

347
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,915
Are we letting them get away with it?

348
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,084
Keep a cool head. Let me deal with it.

349
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,086
Be there for Ms. Oh.

350
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,549
You can't let them record anything,
not even her breathing.

351
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,552
Ms. Oh!

352
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,972
-Ms. Oh!
-Is it true?

353
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,310
What did you use the embezzled money for?

354
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,522
Did you use that money
for your primary election?

355
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,483
-I--
-Ms. Oh! You have to go.

356
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,320
Ms. Oh, any comment?

357
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,912
Come on, why won't you
let me say anything?

358
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,540
I did nothing wrong.

359
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,460
Why should I hide like a criminal and run?

360
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,670
You know reporters and their petty tricks.

361
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,382
The moment they provoke a word out of you,
they'll use that to publish fake news.

362
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,092
Fake news?

363
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,305
That's violating the election law.

364
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,390
Election Act, Article 96, Clause 2.

365
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,727
Those who purposely report untrue facts
or report a falsified fact

366
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:34,230
to aid and abet a particular candidate
to win or lose in the election

367
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,901
will be sentenced to up to seven years
or be fined up to 30 million won.

368
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:42,697
-Ms. Oh.
-And if Seo is the one behind this?

369
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,033
That makes things even worse.

370
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,035
Article 250 of the Election Act.

371
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,579
Publishing or making others
publish false information.

372
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,831
Up to seven years in jail
or up to 30 million won fine.

373
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,668
If violated in the primary election?
Up to five years in prison,

374
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,421
ten million won fine,
and permanent deprivation of suffrage.

375
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,760
I'll write a bill of indictment.

376
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:05,595
I'll do it.

377
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,309
Ms. Oh. You should talk this over
with your campaign manager first.

378
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,896
Yes, it seemed like
she had a plan to deal with this.

379
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,231
When will she get here?

380
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,734
Yes, Cho-rong.

381
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,403
Go to the National Police Agency
right now.

382
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,948
Seo is filing a lawsuit against Ms. Oh.

383
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,516
You must have quite the intel.

384
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,311
Stop with your show.

385
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:59,148
Take another step from here,
and we'll also take legal action.

386
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:02,402
And I'll also expose
all the dirt I dug up on you.

387
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,030
A villain being bad is one thing,

388
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,783
but a hero being bad is another.

389
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,161
No matter what it is you have on me,

390
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:16,833
nothing will cover up Ms. Righteous Rhino
stabbing the common folk in the back.

391
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,503
That's how politics works.

392
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,762
What are you up to?

393
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,057
You're the one who started it.

394
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,810
You even dug into her private life.

395
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,730
At least I didn't make things up.

396
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:39,856
Embezzlement?

397
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,775
It's a campaign tactic, not fabrication.

398
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:46,946
Ma Joong-seok.

399
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,949
Is this why you entered this election?

400
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:54,037
To end an innocent person's life
with bullshit from your righteous mind?

401
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,750
That sounds ironic coming from you.

402
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,711
Stop it! Now!

403
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,756
This is not who you are.

404
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,218
Winning an election is being who I am.

405
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,597
And the winner is always righteous.

406
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,313
Today, I'm not here
as the People's Servant,

407
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,230
BILL OF INDICTMENT

408
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,982
but as an ordinary citizen of Seoul

409
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,946
to expose the vile two-faced nature
of a certain woman.

410
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,950
Under the guise of the people's hero,

411
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,621
Oh Kyung-sook's hypocrisy
and selective justice has deceived you.

412
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:42,502
And I, Seo Min-jung, will expose
her abominable nature at any cost.

413
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,671
Did you trace the source of the money?

414
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,757
What a load of bullshit. Damn.

415
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,301
It's all as I expected,
so don't be too startled.

416
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,136
I'll be there soon.

417
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,057
-We'll prepare to take this to court--
-Let's just face it head-on.

418
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,351
Hold a press conference.

419
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,854
Let's do it my way. Fair and square.

420
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,777
Sir. Have you finished eat--

421
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,781
Huh?

422
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,122
Yes, ma'am.

423
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,373
Do-hee, bad news.

424
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,459
What happened?

425
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,212
Your father's gone!

426
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,428
It's been dealt with.

427
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,014
Right, did they get him a jacket?

428
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,809
He needs to dress warmly
if he wants to play hide and seek

429
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,896
with his daughter in this cold.

430
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:25,813
Yes.

431
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,608
We'll return him in the evening.

432
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,820
Here's a manual we have prepared
for future countermeasures.

433
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,738
No!

434
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,656
Destroy the report.

435
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,909
There's nothing more

436
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,578
we need to do from now on.

437
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,459
The key to a successful smear campaign
isn't perfect planning.

438
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,504
It's leaving our opponent
no chance to respond.

439
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,922
In its early stages.

440
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,925
Then…

441
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,595
Hwang will fail to make a swift response
while looking for her father.

442
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:01,307
And without her,
Oh Kyung-sook will be rattled.

443
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,605
And the fake news will continue to spread,
turning mere speculation…

444
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,985
into fact.

445
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,687
PRESS CONFERENCE

446
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,775
Hwang Do-hee! Where on earth are you?

447
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,154
Something happened with my father.
How's Ms. Oh doing?

448
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:58,364
Ms. Oh's not the problem right now.

449
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,450
There are so many articles
that we can't deal with them all.

450
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,912
Everyone seems to believe
that the embezzlement is true!

451
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,167
Get everything we have on Seo ready,
and help Ms. Oh with the press conference.

452
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,377
I'll be back before the press conference.

453
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:19,927
This is terrible.

454
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,890
You still haven't found him?

455
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,560
We searched the hospital
and the streets, but no luck.

456
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,937
He couldn't have gotten far
in his condition.

457
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,857
My goodness. How could this have happened?

458
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,237
Ms. Oh, we've sorted things out.

459
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,035
HAPPY SENIORS' HOME

460
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,351
Ms. Oh.

461
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,020
We should get going.

462
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,535
Take that.

463
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,913
-You need to look two moves ahead.
-Darn it!

464
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,630
PRESS CONFERENCE

465
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:35,855
What?

466
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,899
ALLEGATIONS
REGARDING THE WOMEN'S ALLIANCE, SOOM

467
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:40,860
Ms. Oh.

468
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,863
-How could this…
-Where are all the reporters?

469
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,535
MS. KIM HWA-SOO REVEALS TRUTH

470
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,004
Today,

471
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,465
I stand here

472
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:07,136
with Ms. Kim Hwa-soo, who has worked with

473
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,222
Candidate Oh Kyung-sook
in the Women's Alliance, Soom.

474
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:15,353
Ms. Kim Hwa-soo,
who took care of the group's finances

475
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,023
as a former general manager of Soom,
asked me

476
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,028
to be here with her when she delivers
the truth to the people of Korea.

477
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,864
Are you ready, ma'am?

478
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:46,967
I stand before you
to clear my conscience today.

479
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:53,099
Ms. Kim, were you in charge
of the donations that Soom received?

480
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,811
Yes. I'm the general manager, after all.

481
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,942
But according to our investigation,
some money in Soom's donation account

482
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,778
seems to have been used
for illegitimate purposes.

483
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,448
What do you mean?

484
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,077
May 3, 2019, 1.8 million won.

485
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,287
June 8, 2019, 1.7 million won.

486
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,081
July 2, 2020, 1 million won.

487
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,252
A total of 4.5 million won seems
to have been withdrawn in cash.

488
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:27,633
Did you withdraw this money
for your personal use?

489
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,722
No. I've never done such a thing.

490
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,853
Going around accusing innocent people,
how dare you…

491
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,812
Ms. Kim.

492
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,567
You seem to have done
a great job raising your children.

493
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:49,738
Your son entered a big company last month
after graduating earlier this year, right?

494
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,074
I wonder how you managed

495
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,120
to pay the 10 million won tuition fee
for a private university

496
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,538
when

497
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,124
you were unemployed?

498
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,380
Ma'am.

499
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,634
My son doesn't know anything.

500
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,515
I am solely in the wrong.

501
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,562
I was going to pay it back
when I returned to work.

502
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,524
Please don't tell my son.

503
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,447
You should focus only on one thing.

504
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,284
Focus on
what your best course of action is

505
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,244
to save your precious son.

506
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,834
At first, I felt nothing but gratitude
towards Candidate Oh.

507
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:51,467
When someone as smart and brave as her
went up to the department store rooftop

508
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,137
for us poor and uneducated middle-aged
female temp workers, I was so moved.

509
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:59,892
I was so happy to have her backing us.
It gave me the courage to fight

510
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:04,021
and the hope
that a better world would come.

511
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,439
But

512
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,611
then, I saw her true face.

513
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:16,033
The money the good people of Korea donated

514
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,536
for us poor temp workers
who were out of jobs,

515
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,541
a large sum of it, had been used
by Candidate Oh for personal purposes.

516
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,796
I even ended up withdrawing
large amounts of cash

517
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,926
and delivering it to Candidate Oh.

518
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,846
I felt a heavy weight on my heart
seeing the hard-earned money

519
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,808
the people of Korea gave us

520
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:45,062
being used
not for the women's reinstatement

521
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,856
but for Oh Kyung-sook's own comfort.

522
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,067
But

523
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,319
I believed

524
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,072
that we needed…

525
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,337
that we needed to protect her
for a better world…

526
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:22,308
so I had no choice
but to turn a blind eye.

527
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,605
You did well. Calm down.

528
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,361
Everyone.

529
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,574
There is no doubt
that she was a victim of gaslighting.

530
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,828
Ms. Kim Hwa-soo is not an accomplice

531
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:47,583
but a brainwashed victim who suffered
at the hands of Candidate Oh.

532
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,086
I ask that the people bring
Candidate Oh to justice

533
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,048
for how she lied to the people

534
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:59,637
with her righteous image
and exploited the fired workers.

535
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:03,599
What exactly did she spend money on
and how much?

536
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,769
Ms. Kim, how much cash
did you withdraw for Ms. Oh?

537
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,397
Ms. Oh, how could Aunt Hwa-soo…

538
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,276
How could she do this to us? Damn it!

539
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,277
That wasn't

540
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,905
Hwa-soo's idea.

541
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,045
Ms. Oh, where are you going?

542
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,092
To talk to Hwa-soo.

543
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,261
Now's not the time.

544
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,431
First, we need to release a statement
denying the accusations--

545
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,974
And drive her to her death?

546
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,979
If we do that, it'd only prove
she committed perjury on that stage.

547
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,863
Hwa-soo is one of my people.

548
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,909
I don't know if Seo Min-jung
bought her off or blackmailed her,

549
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,789
but I'm going to go find out for myself.

550
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,103
Do-hee!

551
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,023
What happened?

552
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,818
Your father… Oh God!

553
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,446
I was just driving by,

554
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,448
and he just appeared out of….

555
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,560
Dad…

556
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,952
No!

557
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:19,711
Dad!

558
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,487
Thank you for your work.

559
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,073
That being said,

560
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,368
that was completely unexpected.

561
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,539
I only thought about
what would prevent Hwang Do-hee

562
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,667
from responding in that first moment.

563
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,713
It is a pity that what happened was
a lot more cruel

564
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,465
than we intended.

565
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:22,941
This must be the most traumatic experience
of her whole life.

566
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,779
Her only family member has passed away.

567
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,326
I am deeply regretful.

568
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,747
I didn't intend for this to happen.

569
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,001
Looking at the positive side,

570
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,672
it's part of the process
of everything returning to its place.

571
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:55,390
Have some flowers sent to the funeral.

572
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,359
And make sure to include…

573
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,280
plenty of hyacinths, her favorite.

574
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,618
-There she is!
-Is it true?

575
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,203
How are you feeling?

576
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,080
Why the sudden change of heart?

577
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,373
You did well.

578
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,209
I'll have them escort you home safely--

579
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,586
Come with us
to the campaign staff's lodging.

580
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,422
I just want to go home.

581
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,340
Hwa-soo!

582
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,676
-Aunt Hwa-soo!
-Hwa-soo!

583
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,302
-Aunt Hwa-soo!
-Move!

584
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,220
Hwa-soo!

585
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,722
We'll keep you under guard,
for your own protection.

586
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,432
You should rest where it's safe.

587
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,976
-Hwa-soo!
-Hwa-soo!

588
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,018
-Step back!
-Come on.

589
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:40,978
Hwa-soo!

590
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,771
-I said, move!
-Hwa-soo!

591
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,524
Hwa-soo! It's me!

592
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,739
Move aside! Damn it. Aunt Hwa-soo! Aunt!

593
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:55,826
Hwa-soo!

594
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:57,703
Let's get going!

595
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,124
-Ms. Seo is leaving.
-Hwa-soo!

596
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:10,716
A few moments ago,
Seoul mayoral candidate Oh Kyung-sook,

597
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,010
who is under suspicion
of embezzling donations…

598
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,761
Ms. Kim seemed very anxious.

599
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:16,763
Why don't we send her home?

600
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,974
That's nonsense.

601
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,686
We need to keep her as a hostage
to provoke Oh Kyung-sook.

602
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:28,025
But something's missing in this picture.

603
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,193
With all of this going on,

604
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,572
how come Hwang Do-hee is
nowhere to be seen near the Rhino?

605
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:34,906
Huh?

606
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,537
You don't think she ran off, do you?

607
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:45,250
Did she get scared because she couldn't
see how she could resolve this?

608
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,128
…if she'll announce her resignation.

609
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,130
Next.

610
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,466
She wouldn't be that cowardly.

611
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,344
Joong-seok.

612
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,015
There's no point in holding on
to a woman who left you

613
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,435
or a politician who's lost their power.

614
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,527
-There he is.
-He's here.

615
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,575
Any comment on allegations of misdeeds
regarding your book publication?

616
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,328
Tell us exactly where the money came from.

617
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,121
Where did you use the donations?

618
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,040
How much of the donations did you use?

619
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,084
A comment, please.

620
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,710
Tell us the truth.

621
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,587
Tell us where the money came from.

622
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,255
A comment, please.

623
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,677
PARASITE SUCKING DRY THE PEOPLE'S BLOOD

624
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,554
GET LOST OH

625
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,479
CANDIDATE OH SECRETLY STORED
EMBEZZLED MONEY AT HER IN-LAW'S?

626
00:51:58,573 --> 00:51:59,407
Hey, honey.

627
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,119
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

628
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,703
No, I'm fine.

629
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,041
Okay.

630
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,211
What about Hyun-woo?
Is he back from school?

631
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,630
Yes. He's with me right now.
He's all right.

632
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,049
Honey, could you put him on?

633
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,929
Oh, he's too embarrassed to talk to you.

634
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,724
I'll call you back later.

635
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,268
Stay strong, Kyung-sook!

636
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,233
I mean…

637
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:37,070
What happened with Do-hee?
Where did she go?

638
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,782
She's at the hospital
with her father right now.

639
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,743
His condition suddenly
worsened this morning.

640
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,079
Oh Kyung-sook, a Seoul mayoral candidate,

641
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,748
is suspected of using
donation money for personal…

642
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,000
Is it serious?

643
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,460
No.

644
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,671
She said she'll be back by tonight,

645
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:59,801
so don't worry about her, and let's find
a way to get through this first.

646
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,596
The expression, "an ass in a lion's skin"…

647
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,314
This is Hwa-soo's handwriting.

648
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,024
She wrote it herself

649
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,943
when we were doing that protest together,

650
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,363
and as you can see,
it's all colloquial from start to finish.

651
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,407
It's short and simple.

652
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:27,537
Completely different from the phrasing
she used at the press conference today.

653
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,539
Yeah, they're nothing alike.

654
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:32,167
I heard that hundreds of times
at the protest site.

655
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,002
We'll be able to use that

656
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,505
to suggest that she made false claims
at the press conference today.

657
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,302
It would be correct to say
that she was forced into false testimony.

658
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:46,890
Ms. Oh.

659
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,808
We need to meet Aunt Hwa-soo.

660
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,144
We'll be able to turn the tables

661
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,979
once we get the truth out of her.

662
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,941
Turn the tables? Forget it.

663
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,568
The game is already over.

664
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,531
Why should I resign?

665
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,329
I thought you'd be ingenuous
as a human rights activist,

666
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,956
but you're quite shameless.

667
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:16,962
Can't you see
that you're dragging our party's name

668
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,922
through the mud?

669
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,761
I apologize for having brought the party
in harm's way, however inadvertently.

670
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,265
I'll talk to Ms. Kim Hwa-soo
as soon as I can, check the facts--

671
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,184
Ms. Oh. You know what?

672
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:35,397
Monkeys start acting like pigs
once you put them in a pigsty.

673
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,774
No matter how capable you are,

674
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:41,861
there's no way to show it
unless you have control of the situation.

675
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,865
Whatever the truth may be,

676
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:50,036
the Reform Party of Korea
can no longer assist you in any way,

677
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:53,498
so resign and leave the party.

678
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,714
I refuse.

679
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,848
Seeing how quick you are
to try to remove me,

680
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,310
yes, I'm now certain…

681
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,480
that Seo Min-jung bribed Ms. Kim,

682
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,442
and the party must have
fabricated this story.

683
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:23,403
"Fabricated"? How dare you?

684
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,241
One more thing.

685
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,411
I'm not a monkey.

686
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,873
I'm a rhino.

687
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,252
I'm a rhino
who will charge on relentlessly

688
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,841
until the bell of truth rings.

689
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,223
She's not resigning?

690
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:54,351
No.

691
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,271
Have the reporters on standby
outside the lodgings.

692
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,108
Oh Kyung-sook will rocket herself
into the headlines.

693
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,860
Take them.

694
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,917
Candidate Oh of the Reform Party of Korea,

695
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,379
who has been accused of embezzling money
from the Women's Alliance,

696
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,673
is attempting to enter the accommodation
Ms. Kim Hwa-soo is staying in.

697
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,927
People have been critical of her attempts.

698
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,263
Various activist groups,
who had been her strongest supporters,

699
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,350
were furious and have decided to erase

700
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,060
all traces of Oh.

701
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:40,063
I am here at the scene
where activist groups are burning

702
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,731
Candidate Oh's effigy.

703
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,150
Many activist groups
and women's rights groups

704
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,069
are withdrawing their support

705
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,030
by declaring a joint statement
that they have officially…

706
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:20,353
I offer my sincerest condolences.

707
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,729
Thank you.

708
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,692
Oh, um…

709
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,903
I am a distant friend of your father.

710
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,330
I heard he was suffering from dementia.

711
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,083
Yes.

712
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,589
Losing one's memory
can be a good thing in some ways.

713
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,968
One could erase all the times one suffered

714
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:53,928
and enjoy

715
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:59,851
the happy moments on repeat
as if for the first time.

716
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:07,275
I'm sure he left happily

717
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,946
with only the good memories
he had with you.

718
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:26,753
Do you believe in God?

719
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,882
If you do,

720
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,970
you must feel betrayed
in a situation like this.

721
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,642
You're right.

722
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,021
I'd like to ask why this happened,
if I could.

723
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,398
Why my father

724
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,152
had to be taken away now.

725
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,698
I would have asked the same.

726
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,954
But God is unwavering.

727
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,414
He isn't someone that humans can oppose

728
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:06,918
or dream of taking vengeance against.

729
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,091
I hope this will be
the turning point in your life

730
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,468
that brings you peace.

731
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,178
Then your father

732
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,266
will be able to truly rest
in peace as well.

733
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:52,005
OUR CONDOLENCES

734
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,841
They look expensive, don't they?
They smell nice too.

735
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:56,718
Who are they from?

736
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:01,347
It was your father's friend,
the one who just left.

737
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:05,393
I wonder what he does for a living.

738
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,444
Are you sure?

739
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,614
That you can handle
whatever happens to you?

740
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,199
But God is unwavering.

741
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,744
He isn't someone that humans can oppose

742
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,122
or dream of taking vengeance against.
