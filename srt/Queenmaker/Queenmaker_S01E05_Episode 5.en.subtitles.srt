1
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:44,836
Everyone.

2
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,466
Did you know that rhinos
are an endangered species?

3
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,055
It's because the rhino horn
is known as this miraculous cure-all.

4
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,476
However, in reality, a rhino's horn

5
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,980
is made completely out of keratin,
which is nothing but dead skin cells.

6
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,442
In other words, consuming the rhino's horn

7
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:11,154
is no different than biting
and eating one's own nails.

8
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,948
Disappointing, isn't it?

9
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,367
It seems those who've been enticed

10
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:19,037
by the rhino's strong appearance
and loud voice

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,415
are exaggerating
the value of the rhino's horn.

12
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,042
The crazy rhino…

13
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,877
She seems pretty pissed.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,173
-That's why I provoked her.
-…monikers describing Ms. Oh.

15
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,219
But I found a name that stands out
amongst your campaign staff.

16
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,553
Hwang Do-hee.

17
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,641
Yes, she's our camp's campaign manager.

18
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,477
Exactly. Campaign Manager Hwang Do-hee.

19
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,231
She worked on a conglomerate
corporate strategy team for over a decade

20
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,651
and was their famous problem solver.

21
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:54,239
Isn't she the polar opposite of you,
the rhino of justice who stands and fights

22
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,990
for the rights of laborers?

23
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,158
That's right.

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,663
The path Ms. Hwang was on
was rather different, no,

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,874
completely different from mine.

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,669
But we happened to face each other

27
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,712
over the issue
of temporary workers one day,

28
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,173
and through that interaction,

29
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,552
Ms. Hwang discovered
the tragic reality of laborers.

30
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,096
She started soul-searching--

31
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,974
Oh, so are you saying
you're willing to embrace anyone

32
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,936
as long as it might win you the election?

33
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,440
That you are willing
to take and use even a rotten tree

34
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,734
that grew in the garden
of a conglomerate family

35
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,944
as long as you can win?

36
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,456
Are you saying

37
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,668
that I should abandon this woman

38
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,881
who devoted her life to me
just because our paths differed

39
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,591
in the past?

40
00:02:58,636 --> 00:02:59,470
"Woman"?

41
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,765
You're making this into a gender issue--

42
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,684
Then, Assemblywoman Seo,

43
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,770
do you think that it's okay for you
to give the cold shoulder

44
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,441
to anyone who didn't support you
in the past?

45
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:15,278
Is that why you're still ignoring
calls from Hayu-dong residents

46
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,114
to demolish the chemical plant
in the area?

47
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,202
Or are you prioritizing your sympathies
with the corporation that owns this plant

48
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:26,873
so that you can maintain your power
as a three-time National Assembly member?

49
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,291
Is this your strategy?

50
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,169
Well, now,
you're going off-topic to attack--

51
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,629
Please answer the question.

52
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,881
Why are you refusing to pass the bill

53
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,218
to remove the chemical plant
from Hayu-dong?

54
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,179
Relocating the plant
isn't difficult at all.

55
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,640
But relocating the plant to a rural area

56
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:47,185
would hurt Seoul by reducing
the number of manufacturing jobs--

57
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,938
This is a chemical plant
we're talking about.

58
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,191
Not a kimchi factory
with chili powder flying about.

59
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,903
It's a chemical plant
that emits sulfurous gases, okay?

60
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,907
Are you willing to ignore
the health and safety of Seoul's citizens

61
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,952
as long as you can bring about
economic growth? Huh?

62
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,537
Does money come before people's lives?
Is that it?

63
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,667
Listen, Attorney Oh. Please calm down.

64
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,504
Of course the health and safety
of citizens comes first.

65
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,924
Yes. I'm glad to hear that.
I definitely agree with you.

66
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,052
Then you must believe
such a dangerous chemical plant

67
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,929
should not be in Hayu-dong,

68
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:27,850
and it must be removed
for the health and safety of the citizens.

69
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,894
That's what you're saying, right?

70
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,857
Assemblywoman Seo.

71
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,820
The citizens of Seoul
are watching right now.

72
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,655
You should give us your answer.

73
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,619
Yes, of course.

74
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,288
I, too, believe

75
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,332
that we should definitely consider

76
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,294
the removal of the chemical plant.

77
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,878
I knew it!

78
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,383
I wouldn't have expected
any less from the People's Servant.

79
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,135
Thank you.

80
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,059
We'll return after a commercial break.

81
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,568
Call Chairwoman Cheon, and let her know
what I said was just for TV.

82
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,987
Just focus on the debate for now.

83
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,991
The one-on-one debate is over
and the audience questions will begin,

84
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,784
so review the potential questions.

85
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:31,998
Ms. Oh.

86
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,418
People are going crazy.

87
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,713
They're saying the rhino
body-slammed her opponent.

88
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,551
What about Do-hee? What did she say?

89
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,772
Ms. Hwang. He's here.

90
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,070
Soo-ho, hi.

91
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,076
Am I too late?

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,996
No, you're just in time.

93
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,501
This is the Wednesday End-All Debate
that brings about change.

94
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,921
Today, two female mayoral candidates,

95
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,257
Assemblywoman Seo Min-jung
and Attorney Oh Kyung-sook,

96
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,426
are both with us live on air.

97
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,304
Next we'll have a Q&A session
with the audience,

98
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,015
where you'll answer
your supporters' questions.

99
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,018
Now, does anyone have a question
for Assemblywoman Seo?

100
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,520
Oh, yes.

101
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,819
I have a question regarding the video
uploaded before today's debate.

102
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,737
Assemblywoman Seo.

103
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,033
The lifestyle portrayed in the video.
Is it all true?

104
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,455
Okay, let me give you the facts upfront.
It is not.

105
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,749
It seems a certain camp is trying

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,919
to brand me as an extravagant spender
and an indiscreet woman.

107
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,171
I think it's a witch hunt.

108
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,591
I think it's an attempt to start a fight
between Ms. Oh and me

109
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:09,637
by framing this with the cliché
that "Women are women's worst enemies."

110
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,974
I see. Then does anyone have a question

111
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,518
for Attorney Oh Kyung-sook? Yes.

112
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,867
I would like to

113
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,996
ask a question
to Assemblywoman Seo Min-jung.

114
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,124
Oh, it's Attorney Oh's turn
to answer a question--

115
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,167
Assemblywoman Seo.

116
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,753
What do you think

117
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,923
the moral boundaries of a politician are?

118
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,594
Do you think their privacy

119
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,098
should be strictly protected
provided they don't break the law?

120
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,560
I would like to hear
your thoughts on the matter.

121
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,826
Well, yes.

122
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,580
That's quite an interesting question.

123
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,309
OH KYUNG-SOOK
SEOUL, A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE

124
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:35,825
Assemblywoman Seo?

125
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,788
Well, I would say,

126
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,000
more than anything,

127
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,170
I believe you should listen
to your conscience.

128
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,147
Joong-seok.

129
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,734
Your ex-wife is such an evil bitch.

130
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,529
How could she bring Soo-ho into this?

131
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,407
-I'm sorry.
-Get him out of here!

132
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,535
Get Soo-ho…

133
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,456
out of my sight right now.

134
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,791
We're live on air.

135
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,545
If he disappeared
after asking you a question,

136
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,921
the viewers would think--

137
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,676
You motherfucker. You son of a bitch!

138
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:40,181
You couldn't control your fucking ex,
and then let this happen?

139
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
This is why I advised you

140
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,732
to end things with Soo-ho
before he became a threat to you.

141
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,233
What did you say, you fucker?

142
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,403
We should finish the debate for now.

143
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,614
Clean this mess up.

144
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,493
Or I'll kill that bitch
Hwang Do-hee myself.

145
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,288
Jeez, it's hot.

146
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,706
Hi, Ms. Oh.

147
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:08,959
I'm soaked!

148
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
God, it's so hot.

149
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,846
Guys, have a heart.

150
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,391
-Let me just take this one off.
-No, you can't.

151
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,559
Come on. It'll break all my ribs!

152
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,895
But your waist looks perfect.

153
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,064
-God, I can't breathe.
-Can you hold this?

154
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,192
-Hang in there.
-Okay, the left.

155
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,319
Hey, Do-hee.

156
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,864
Did you see Seo Min-jung?

157
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,284
She seems to have completely lost it.
What's gotten into her?

158
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,370
Forget what happened and keep going.

159
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,415
We're going to ignore the cue sheets
and the questionnaires,

160
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,750
and go off script.

161
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,547
What's this all about?

162
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,925
Just answer the questions
head-on, like a rhino.

163
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,846
Be aggressive and don't dodge questions.

164
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,810
I might end up causing an incident on air.

165
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,898
That's exactly what I want.

166
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,067
Stir things up.

167
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,661
Now, let's take a question
from a female supporter.

168
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,539
Yes, you, over there at the end.

169
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,542
Hello.

170
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:36,255
I am a great fan of you both
and support you both in the election.

171
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,133
Nice to meet you.

172
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,469
I would really love to see

173
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,556
Seoul gets its first female mayor
in this election,

174
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,727
but I'm worried that this competition
between two remarkable women

175
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,688
might take all your energy
and end up splitting the voters.

176
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,523
So I was wondering

177
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,694
if the two of you were willing
to become one.

178
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,447
What do you mean?

179
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,159
For example,
you could have a primary election

180
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,369
and unify under the winner.

181
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,885
The moderator is on Seo's side.

182
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,763
He took a break
the moment she became flustered.

183
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,099
But only two breaks are allowed
during an hour-long debate.

184
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,476
There's one in the middle,

185
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,770
and he can choose the time
for the second ad.

186
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,232
After that, he can't interfere
with the debate, even if he wants to.

187
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,069
We'll bring up the primary election now.

188
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,279
That's your signal

189
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,699
to start pushing for a primary election

190
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,660
using the power of live TV.

191
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:02,007
Well, since this isn't
an official campaign period,

192
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,595
bringing up such an issue
might not be appropriate at this moment.

193
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,055
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

194
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,808
Are you cutting off this question?

195
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,561
No, Attorney Oh.
I'm just making a correction--

196
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,728
Sir.

197
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,398
You weren't the one
who asked the question,

198
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,109
so why would you try to correct it?

199
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,529
I thought the goal
of this audience question session was

200
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,782
to create a safe space for the citizens
to freely voice their opinions.

201
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,117
Am I wrong?

202
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,451
You're right. But--

203
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,163
If I'm right,
let's hear what she has to say.

204
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,416
Please, do go on.

205
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,127
In order to win,

206
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,838
are you willing to unify
under a single candidate?

207
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,550
"A single candidate"?

208
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,468
Yes.

209
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,430
I am all for it.

210
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,725
As long as the competition
is fair and square,

211
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:56,645
I am ready and willing to humbly accept

212
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,898
whatever the outcome may be.

213
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,108
And for Seoul,

214
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:05,988
I am willing to become one
with Assemblywoman Seo.

215
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,742
We will live and die together as one,
joined by mind

216
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,621
and body too. I'll do whatever it takes.

217
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,632
Oh, I'm afraid that this isn't something

218
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:29,470
I can decide on my own
without first discussing it with my party.

219
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,431
A primary election is

220
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,975
a family affair between party members--

221
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,477
In that case, I will join

222
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,480
the Reform Party of Korea.

223
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,610
Is the Reform Party of Korea
a supermarket? A convenience store?

224
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,780
There are formalities and procedures
for joining a party.

225
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,657
Come on, is that really important--

226
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,742
We must look into your character to see

227
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,870
if you fit the party's vision
and determine you won't harm

228
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,705
the party's history or its name.

229
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,874
And with the approval
of the other members--

230
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,211
This is so frustrating, seriously.
I can't believe this.

231
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,213
How can you be so stuffy? My God.

232
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,842
Gosh!

233
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,512
Jeez.

234
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,975
Oh my!

235
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,893
I've had enough!

236
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,687
I mean,

237
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,774
formalities, procedures,
and pretending to be pretty and confident.

238
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,484
Let's just stop, okay?

239
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,946
I mean, let's just throw
things like this out the window.

240
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,200
All we need to think about is

241
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,244
what's best for the citizens of Seoul.

242
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:37,997
I, Oh Kyung-sook,

243
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,041
have taken it all off.

244
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,918
For the city of Seoul,

245
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,963
to protect Seoul
from conglomerate lackeys,

246
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:50,509
I stand before you as myself,
just as I am, and challenge you

247
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,053
to a primary election, fair and square.

248
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:01,103
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

249
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,273
-Oh Kyung-sook!
-Oh Kyung-sook!

250
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,190
Ding!

251
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,652
And it seems like that was
the end of the People's Servant.

252
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,238
It seems that Attorney Oh's
on-air corset revolution

253
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:15,534
has brought Assemblywoman Seo Min-jung
to her knees.

254
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:16,452
That's right.

255
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,122
And the debate came to an abrupt end
without her really answering

256
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,082
Attorney Oh's request
for a primary election.

257
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,419
Is the rhino already preparing
for the primary election?

258
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,302
Ms. Oh!

259
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,346
You were oozing charisma today.

260
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,640
You were totally and absolutely
awesome today.

261
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,600
I agree.

262
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,395
When you suggested the primary election,
we got goosebumps. Right, guys?

263
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,938
That's right!

264
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,984
Yes. I owe you a big one, guys.

265
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:53,489
I knew you would back me up,
so I provoked Seo today.

266
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,827
Ms. Oh! She's our hero.

267
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,247
She's the creator of the viral video
that completely shook up

268
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,500
Assemblywoman Seo before the live debate.

269
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,168
I'm Lee Cha-sun.

270
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,753
Ms. Hwang asked me,

271
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,213
so I worked my magic.

272
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,631
Did you like it, Ms. Oh?

273
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:15,177
Oh, thanks to you,
I had a great start to the debate.

274
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,221
Please keep up the good work.

275
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,352
Raise your drinks. On three,
"Let's win the primary election."

276
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,478
One, two, three.

277
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,355
-Let's win…
-…the primary election!

278
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,192
All right. Let's go!

279
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,120
What's with you?

280
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:49,294
Why are you here alone,
brooding and looking all cool?

281
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,255
Are you trying to get my attention?

282
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:57,553
Aren't you the one who tried
to grab my attention with that stunt?

283
00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,179
The corset.

284
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,682
It must've startled you.

285
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,396
The Oh Kyung-sook I know

286
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,899
is the last person
who'd use strategies like that.

287
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,776
What strategy?

288
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,405
Who would calculate
and plan a move like that?

289
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,288
Wow. That's why I say you're a natural.

290
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,499
How could you pull
a stunt like that instantly?

291
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,294
You know what?

292
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,881
Can we do

293
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,050
without the corset?

294
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,721
It's suffocating and pretentious.

295
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,139
It oppresses me.

296
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,185
I'd rather wear handcuffs, okay?

297
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,149
Fine.

298
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:53,859
You win.

299
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,990
You mean it? Keep your word, okay?

300
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:07,623
Yes!

301
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,086
-Yes, I'm free!
-Wow!

302
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,882
Okay. Here's to my freedom. Cheers.

303
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,985
I thought you'd be drunk out of your mind
after a day like today.

304
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,030
What are you doing?

305
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,744
I'm trying to make Oh the mayor of Seoul.

306
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,749
By doing everything I can
to get dirt on my opponent.

307
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,544
Soo-ho is

308
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,715
just one of the musical prodigies
that Ms. Seo is supporting.

309
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,802
Since he is so gifted--

310
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,346
She started a foundation
with conglomerate money,

311
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,015
bought him a violin worth 300 million won,

312
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,142
got him a house,

313
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,687
and slept with him.

314
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,232
And before she gets caught,

315
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,735
she had you ruthlessly
cut him out of her life.

316
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:36,128
…and challenge you
to a primary election, fair and square.

317
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,716
It looks like this Hwang Do-hee knows
how to play the game.

318
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,886
Shouldn't we cut them off now?

319
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:50,559
If Oh Kyung-sook runs wild like this,
it won't be easy for me to draw attention.

320
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,437
This is what makes elections fun.

321
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,317
The dew-christened hero of the morning

322
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,821
makes way for a new hero of tomorrow,
created overnight.

323
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,824
Thrilling, isn't it?

324
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,411
Now, it's about time

325
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,079
we join the game too.

326
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,267
Hello, everyone.

327
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,688
The Greenpeople Foundation is celebrating

328
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,274
its seventh birthday today.

329
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,653
I'd like to express my heartfelt gratitude
to all our supporters

330
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,074
who've volunteered
and shared their time with warm hearts

331
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,659
for all these years.

332
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,120
I am thrilled

333
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:57,000
that I am able to come to you bearing
a heartwarming gift on this wonderful day.

334
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,545
A shelter for all Korean women,

335
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,757
including single and unmarried mothers.

336
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,593
It's a home for you.

337
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,805
I present to you, Green House.

338
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,015
GREEN HOUSE

339
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,522
We made this plant

340
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,526
so that children can grow
and taste it themselves.

341
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,155
Mr. Baek. Could we have
a nice photo of you two?

342
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,490
Oh, shall we?

343
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,038
Could you two stand a little closer?

344
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,125
This way, please?

345
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,086
Thank you.

346
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,631
-Ms. Eun, is something bothering you?
-Are you two happily married?

347
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,761
No one has asked me that in a while.

348
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,890
Are you aware of the rumor
that your marriage is a sham?

349
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,478
Some say that this event
is also just a show to help you

350
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,188
become mayor.

351
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,607
-Well, that's--
-I was asking Ms. Eun.

352
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,279
I haven't been well recently.

353
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:12,367
I visited an OBGYN because I had symptoms
similar to when I was pregnant,

354
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,411
and it turns out…

355
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,457
that cancer was spreading in my womb.

356
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:26,923
I underwent surgery immediately
and am no longer at risk,

357
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,596
but the painful chemo has made me
extremely sensitive to stress.

358
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,639
And…

359
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,561
I was devastated by the fact
that I can no longer have kids.

360
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,817
I know that many of you have noticed

361
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,361
that we've grown apart as a couple.

362
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,159
It felt as if my womanhood
had come to an end…

363
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:02,042
I couldn't put a smile on my face
when I was with my husband.

364
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,925
He hesitated to run for mayor.

365
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,055
He said he'd drop out and stay by my side
when my condition worsened,

366
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,266
but I urged him to run.

367
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,313
I, who had been living
in the lap of luxury, had to face

368
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,940
such hardship as a woman.

369
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,777
Then how much worse must it be for mothers

370
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,028
in dire situations?

371
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,113
I asked him to lead

372
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,785
the way in helping

373
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,955
those mothers in need.

374
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,625
She's a smooth talker.

375
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,259
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,512
I'm so sorry.

377
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,432
This is the last time

378
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,977
I appear in one of your clown shows.

379
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,449
Wow.

380
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,955
A new hero is born.

381
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,881
You did a great job.

382
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,343
A huge weight has been lifted off my chest

383
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,554
thanks to your stellar performance.

384
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,848
Well, the credit goes
to this loving couple.

385
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,604
The cancer card was really dramatic.

386
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,189
I almost believed it was true myself.

387
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,359
The cancer was Ms. Eun's idea,

388
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,904
and the kiss was improvised by Mr. Baek.

389
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,368
Chae-ryoung, you did well.

390
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,042
You too, Jae-min.

391
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,959
It's nothing.

392
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,921
It was Chae-ryoung
who did all the heavy lifting.

393
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:16,926
Mom.

394
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,763
Then can I return to the department--

395
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,058
You should be at your husband's side
until the election is over.

396
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,019
Right. You have to support him dutifully
as his wife

397
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,021
for Mom's plan to pan out.

398
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,777
So, you'll have Seo-jin keep running
the department store?

399
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,572
It's also tied to attracting investment
for the duty-free shop.

400
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,032
Enough.

401
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,579
Today is a good day.
Let's enjoy ourselves.

402
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,458
-To Mayor Baek.
-To Mayor Baek.

403
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,644
Baek Jae-min won over voters
with a spontaneous romantic gesture

404
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,771
during his foundation's anniversary event.

405
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,981
He rose to the top
of the popularity polls.

406
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,610
It's Attorney Oh Kyung-sook,
who has taken the nation by surprise

407
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,986
with her corset revolution,

408
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,489
against Baek Jae-min,
who showcased his loving side

409
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,659
by tending to his wife's broken heart.

410
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,412
It's expected to be a heated race

411
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,122
between the two unique candidates,

412
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,999
the corset Amazon
and the romantic husband…

413
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,001
"A race between the two"?

414
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,171
They're not even mentioning us?

415
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,966
Ms. Seo.

416
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,052
This election is
a total box office flop for us.

417
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,263
That isn't our only issue.

418
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,599
We were counting on her
and didn't prepare a Plan B.

419
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,477
We might end up losing
the public's support

420
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,313
to the Korea Republican Party
as well as the mayoral office.

421
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,609
There's also a rumor going around
between the aides about your private life.

422
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,902
What's going on?

423
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,322
It looks like a bomb
is waiting to explode.

424
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,824
Mr. Yang.

425
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,495
You're crossing the line right now.

426
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,208
Considering how I'm the one feeding you,

427
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,420
you should just use your mouth for eating.

428
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,549
Instead of running it
about my personal life!

429
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,050
Don't you give me that crap!

430
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,927
-Sir, calm down!
-Feeding me?

431
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,972
-Oh, come on, let's go.
-You think you feed me?

432
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,223
Let go of me!

433
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,517
Who do you think you owe it all to?

434
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,852
-Come on.
-Let's step out.

435
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,604
-Who made you win?
-Calm down!

436
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,314
What have I ever done wrong?

437
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,441
Where are you taking me?

438
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,823
Agree to the primary election,

439
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,327
and I won't use Soo-ho
against her anymore.

440
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,122
You'll remove us
through the primary election

441
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,333
and go up against Baek Jae-min?

442
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,504
So cooperate.

443
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,049
Hwang Do-hee.

444
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,968
A primary election isn't that--

445
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,053
The People's Servant

446
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,974
had an affair
with a young artist in his thirties.

447
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,894
Is it desire, neglect of duty,
or a disgrace?

448
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,606
I believe gossip like this

449
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,735
is more than enough to rile up the public.

450
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,781
Should I share it with the reporters?

451
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,495
Agree to the primary election.

452
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,914
That's the only option we have.

453
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,000
They have Soo-ho against us.

454
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,710
Did they promise

455
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,048
that they won't go public with Soo-ho
if we agree to it?

456
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,010
That Hwang Do-hee has done nothing
but stab us in the back.

457
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:46,928
Ma'am.

458
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,348
Or are you two working together?

459
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,519
Are you using Soo-ho so that you can
put an end to my career for good?

460
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,604
Do you have a better idea?

461
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,441
It's not just your career that's at risk
if we lose this election.

462
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,695
It would mean a death blow
for all the elders of the party,

463
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:07,240
our representatives,
and the people at the bottom, like me,

464
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,576
who supported you

465
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,494
and the pride of our party.

466
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,668
They only support
whoever emerges as the victor.

467
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,755
Once you defeat Oh Kyung-sook,

468
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,759
the party will keep news about Soo-ho
from harming you at all cost

469
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,222
because that's how we can all survive.

470
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,941
I, Seo Min-jung…

471
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,945
I, Oh Kyung-sook…

472
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,700
swear to fight fairly to become
the Reform Party of Korea's

473
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,244
mayoral candidate.

474
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,331
For the betterment of Seoul,

475
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,499
the burning heart of Korea…

476
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,211
For the happiness
of the beloved citizens of Seoul…

477
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,509
we announce

478
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,056
our full commitment and agreement
to the primary election.

479
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,071
A NEW SEOUL

480
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,490
What about Ms. Cheon?

481
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,743
We've called her numerous times,
but no answer.

482
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,370
Petty hag.

483
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,748
-I'll contact her assistants and--
-Leave it.

484
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,043
She'll call us
when my approval rating goes up.

485
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,193
So it's you.

486
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,154
The infamous

487
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,906
Hwang Do-hee.

488
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,328
An honor to meet you.

489
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,667
Must be your ingrained habit
as a conglomerate lapdog.

490
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,130
You've really dug deep to find dirt on me.

491
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,425
I should teach you a lesson

492
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,802
so that you can survive

493
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,513
in this line of work.

494
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,724
I can't wait

495
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,518
to receive valuable lessons

496
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,063
from a three-time assemblywoman.

497
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,443
How dare you!

498
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,237
Lower your eyes!

499
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,615
Lower your eyes!

500
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,497
Mind your own damn business,
you little shit!

501
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,250
This is the last time

502
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,963
I'll be polite enough to take a blow
from you, three-time assemblywoman.

503
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,841
What?

504
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,009
-Let's go.
-How dare you?

505
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,345
You audacious prick!

506
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,263
Hey, Joong-seok.

507
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,516
Are you going to let him
get away with that?

508
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,433
Right,

509
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,813
Ms. Cheon has offered to throw us
a party to celebrate our candidacy.

510
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,774
Could you tell her that though grateful,
we must decline?

511
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,361
We have no intention
of accepting support from her.

512
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,581
Ma'am! Ms. Cheon!

513
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:27,416
Wait!

514
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,549
-Ma'am!
-Ma'am, be careful.

515
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,633
Watch your step.

516
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,388
Ma'am!

517
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,271
You grow ever more ill-mannered every day.

518
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,691
How dare you walk over my green
in those heels?

519
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,443
Oh, ma'am.

520
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:56,821
Ma'am.

521
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,865
Please help me.

522
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:06,581
You made a public promise
to remove my chemical plant on live TV.

523
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,458
Now you want my help?

524
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,212
It was Oh Kyung-sook.

525
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,299
I fell for her trick.

526
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,636
If I'd said I'd protect
the chemical plant live on TV,

527
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,471
I would've fallen behind in the polls.

528
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,766
And if I fail to become mayor
because of that, you'll also…

529
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,439
Judging from your long-winded excuses,
it must be your time to go.

530
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,696
Ma'am.

531
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,448
It can't be Oh Kyung-sook.

532
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,409
Even if she becomes mayor
with your support,

533
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,412
she will never keep
that chemical plant around.

534
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:49,999
And?

535
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,462
Just trust and support me one more time,
and I'll swear on my life… No,

536
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:59,884
I'll swear on my child's life
to protect that chemical plant.

537
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,678
You know how good I am.

538
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,222
I do.

539
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,016
My money is what makes you good.

540
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:11,395
If it weren't for that, there's no way
you would've served three terms

541
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,398
when you were nothing
but a pretty figurehead

542
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,777
in the political scene, don't you think?

543
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,616
So this time, I intend to see
what you're really capable of.

544
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,497
Win the primary election
without any help from me.

545
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,339
Are you all right?

546
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,218
I have to win, no matter what.

547
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:48,140
Find dirt on Oh Kyung-sook and her family.
Dig up her ancestors' graves if needed.

548
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,518
The moment I find one tiny fault,

549
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:52,812
I'll use it to drag her
to the depths of hell

550
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,730
and put an end to her for good.

551
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,082
TRAITOR OH KYUNG-SOOK MUST RESIGN!
SANGAH MARKET MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION

552
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,377
-That was good.
-Thank you.

553
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,795
-That was delicious.
-Bye.

554
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,049
A bowl of noodles, please.

555
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,426
Hi, yes, welcome--

556
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,679
How have you been?

557
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,639
The kimchi looks good. Is it fresh?

558
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,557
Don't.

559
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,225
Don't touch it.

560
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,688
Please hear me out.

561
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,605
Piss off.

562
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,027
I've got nothing to say,
and I don't want to hear anything, so go.

563
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:41,944
Get lost!

564
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,865
Stop disturbing my business.
You disgust me!

565
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,118
-Sheesh.
-Auntie.

566
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,788
How dare you sneak in here?

567
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,291
What, are you going to beg for votes now?

568
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,251
What a nerve!

569
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,759
I know that you are upset with me,

570
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,053
and I understand how you feel.

571
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,222
But the only reason
I'm running for mayor of Seoul

572
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,892
is to protect regular people
like the merchants here--

573
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,060
Cut the bullshit!

574
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,897
That's a load of crap!

575
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,234
Hey, Oh Kyung-sook.
Do you think we're idiots?

576
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,739
You bad-mouthed Baek Jae-min,
who wants to redevelop this market,

577
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,909
so you can get votes
from the working class!

578
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,453
We're not falling for your bullshit.

579
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:34,955
Sir.

580
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,917
Please hear me out--

581
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,587
-Get your dirty hands off me.
-We don't need your help, so get lost!

582
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,053
That's the end
of the ordinary people's hero.

583
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,225
The moment you're branded as tainted,
your own side throws stones at you.

584
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:55,935
How pitiful.

585
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,071
-Go away!
-My goodness.

586
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,073
Why are you lynching her in the streets?

587
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,992
-Hyun-woo.
-Like mother, like son.

588
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,494
Look at his temper!

589
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,955
That's right. I'm Oh Kyung-sook's son!

590
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,250
So stay away from her
unless you've got a death wish, asshole!

591
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,420
You little brat, what's wrong with you?

592
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,464
Is this how I taught you
to treat your elders?

593
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,426
Apologize, now!

594
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,761
I'm sorry. I apologize.

595
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,180
I'm terribly sorry. Forgive him.

596
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,017
Why aren't you apologizing?

597
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,022
Goodness, would you look at that?

598
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,733
She should teach her son right first.

599
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,360
Hyun-woo!

600
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,529
Kang Hyun-woo!

601
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,871
Look at me, Hyun-woo.

602
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,665
-Hyun-woo.
-Are you a punching bag?

603
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,084
Why do you put up with them?

604
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,211
Why did you let them
beat you up like that?

605
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,255
Hyun-woo.

606
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,967
Please hear me out.

607
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,054
The people at the market are a little--

608
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,931
You said it's for a good cause,

609
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,601
so I should be supportive.

610
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:21,604
When you missed

611
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:26,150
my birthdays, graduations ceremonies,
and sports day events,

612
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:30,446
you said it was to help those in need,
so I should be understanding.

613
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,364
For what?

614
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,367
You took shit from people,

615
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,705
fought for people, and jumped
off a building, only to be beaten up?

616
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,876
Is this what I had to give you up for?

617
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:50,966
Sorry.

618
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,678
I'm so sorry.

619
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,724
Kang Hyun-woo.

620
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,478
I'm sorry.

621
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,773
If you're sorry,

622
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:07,942
will you quit?

623
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,572
Hyun-woo.

624
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,536
I can't wait to see

625
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,872
the great world that you'll make.

626
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,295
Hyun-woo.

627
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,316
THE LEAH COMPANY

628
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:19,138
THE LEAH COMPANY

629
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,189
SANGAH, SOONJUNG DISTRICT
GREEN BELT DEVELOPMENT PERMIT

630
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:49,043
The fifth investor's conference
for Asia's number-one landmark,

631
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:54,548
Eunsung's new duty-free shop building,
Heaven, will begin shortly.

632
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,886
We'd appreciate your cooperation
in taking your seats

633
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,512
with our staff's guidance.

634
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,391
"The moment Eunsung's
new duty-free shop building is completed,

635
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,519
Seoul will become Asia's heaven on earth…"

636
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,189
We're ready for you, ma'am.

637
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:12,858
How many people?

638
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,237
With the guests at the conference
and foreign investors joining us online,

639
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,781
there are 890 in total.

640
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,284
That's twice as many people
as our last conference.

641
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,457
It seems that we're reaping the benefits
of Jae-min's candidacy

642
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,751
in the election.

643
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,720
I hope you like my outfit.

644
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,724
Chae-ryoung's acting as a happily
married wife to keep her share.

645
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,268
So I'll go for it as well.

646
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,270
Friendly competition never hurts.

647
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,190
Let's go.

648
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,668
Heaven of Asia!

649
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:25,013
The moment Eunsung's new duty-free
shop building, Heaven, is completed,

650
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:30,310
Seoul will become Asia's heaven on earth.

651
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,355
Over the next ten years,

652
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:36,233
Heaven is expected
to bring Eunsung a profit of

653
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,570
950 million dollars.

654
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,493
The businesses and the school district
that will be built

655
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:52,207
around Heaven and the quality of life
for local residents will be top-class.

656
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,420
The infrastructure in the area, including
apartments, shopping malls, and offices,

657
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:59,882
will be occupied by Eunsung subsidiaries.

658
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,385
The closer your ties to the Eunsung Group,

659
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,722
the more heavenly your life will be.

660
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,894
I welcome you to that noble world

661
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,313
of your dreams

662
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,482
with open arms!

663
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:35,334
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

664
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,169
SANGAH MARKET

665
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,555
-Impressive.
-Thank you.

666
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,057
But

667
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,019
won't there be trouble from the poor

668
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,854
who cannot enter that world?

669
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,858
Prior to developing the area,

670
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:04,112
don't you think you should drive out
the poor currently living there?

671
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,535
We need to give them hope.

672
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,205
No one can refuse the sweet promise

673
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,707
that no matter how poor

674
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,710
or weak you are,

675
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,339
you can become rich

676
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:27,970
and live a life of heavenly pleasures
as long as you join hands with Eunsung.

677
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,724
I, Baek Jae-min, will make sure
that Sangah Market

678
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,060
is redeveloped!

679
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,065
Who does the Sangah Market belong to?

680
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,776
It belongs to you all.

681
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,821
This is your life's accomplishment

682
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,157
that you've poured your blood, sweat,
tears, and youth into.

683
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:53,537
I, Baek Jae-min, will turn this market
into a place that can provide

684
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,207
for not just you and your children,
but their children too.

685
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,084
I will open

686
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,462
the doors to that heaven on earth!

687
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:11,179
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

688
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,849
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

689
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,434
Hi, how old are you?

690
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:20,898
Thank you!

691
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,233
I will do my best!

692
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,821
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

693
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:28,906
How sad.

694
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,700
All those naive people

695
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,453
really believe they'll end up rich.

696
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,914
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

697
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,540
He's exploiting that fantasy.

698
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,462
"Trust me, and you'll escape
this wretched life."

699
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:48,342
-Baek Jae-min!
-Baek Jae-min!

700
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,259
Anyway,

701
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:53,513
I know you didn't call me
to watch Baek Jae-min put on a show.

702
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,728
I want you to rain…

703
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,774
on that despicable parade of his.

704
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:10,113
It was reported The Leah Company,
a multinational corporation

705
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,949
based in the British Virgin Islands,

706
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,242
has obtained the rights

707
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:17,412
to develop a green belt area in Seoul.

708
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,165
Districts, such as Sangah and Soonjung

709
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:24,294
that The Leah Company
hold the development rights for,

710
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,713
were originally scheduled to build

711
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,841
five million apartment units
for low-income families.

712
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:35,347
Why was an area that was supposed to
become a home for the citizens of Seoul

713
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,183
given to a foreign corporation
with no roots in Korea?

714
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,728
Who might be behind The Leah Company?

715
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,874
Oh, thank you.

716
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,086
They say a man's position changes him.

717
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:10,799
My dear deputy mayor, you look
more like the little president of Korea.

718
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,554
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Son.
I don't deserve the honor.

719
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:23,645
I know you've had it easy

720
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,440
feasting on the scraps
from Sa Jae-gon's trough,

721
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:32,070
but I believe that it's time
for you to work for your food.

722
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,698
You must prove your loyalty

723
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:38,243
by throwing yourself
into harm's way to protect me

724
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,622
if I'm to let you keep feeding
from that trough of yours

725
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,754
and make sure
your family can stay in the States.

726
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,761
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'll correct everything this instant.

727
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,807
Hold a press conference.

728
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,686
Tell them that Seoul has no relations

729
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,647
with The Leah Company whatsoever

730
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,108
and that you don't intend
to withdraw the permit

731
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:13,779
given to them or stop them
from their scheduled redevelopment

732
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:16,823
due to such baseless accusations.

733
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,159
Of course, ma'am.

734
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,536
I'll hold a press conference
tomorrow morning,

735
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,372
and tell them exactly what you told me.

736
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,258
There's a good dog.

737
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,845
As long as you stick
to the food I give you,

738
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,640
you won't ever get sick.

739
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,946
"Seoul city

740
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,783
is in the process of investigating
the fairness of the permit

741
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,953
given to The Leah Company
to redevelop the land in Seoul."

742
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,329
Okay, good.

743
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,081
Got it. Oh, right.

744
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,961
You've included every word
Chairwoman Son relayed to us, right?

745
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,629
You've checked again and again.

746
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,755
Have I?

747
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,675
I've also invited
a few reporters friendly to Eunsung,

748
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,759
so you can relax.

749
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,470
They'll embellish their articles
if we miss anything.

750
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,472
Good. Let's go.

751
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,732
Kim Jeong-do, the acting mayor of Seoul,
will shortly begin

752
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:36,278
the press conference on the issue
of the supposed favoritism given to…

753
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,530
He won't try any funny business, will he?

754
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,907
In today's press conference,
the acting mayor…

755
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,535
He's incompetent, not stupid.

756
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,333
As long as the press conference
goes over well,

757
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:53,712
I'll lower the official land value
in Sangah District.

758
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,130
Mom.

759
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,924
But that would reduce the sale price too.

760
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,511
I feel generous.

761
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,224
Once Jae-min becomes mayor,

762
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,769
all the green belt areas of Seoul
will be in the palm of my hand.

763
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,816
It's my present to the common folk
who don't even own a house.

764
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,027
Yes. That's a great idea.

765
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,780
It is in the common folk's nature
to bow their heads

766
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:25,368
when a ruler they deem harmful
offers them an unexpected kindness.

767
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:26,328
Yes.

768
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,290
I plan on giving that kindness
little by little

769
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,252
so I can reap the benefits
for a long time.

770
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:40,175
Until you make Jae-min the new mayor.

771
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:41,885
Great.

772
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:44,930
Acting mayor Kim Jeong-do…

773
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,056
I will do my best.

774
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,849
…is entering the press conference.

775
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,190
ACTING MAYOR KIM JEONG-DO
EXPLAINS CONTROVERSY

776
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,483
OVER FOREIGN COMPANY

777
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:04,908
First of all,

778
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:07,619
let me apologize

779
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,748
to the citizens of Seoul
about the allegations

780
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,750
that the Seoul metropolitan government

781
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,711
colluded with a foreign corporation.

782
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,383
Yesterday afternoon,

783
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,011
you visited Chairwoman Son of Eunsung

784
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,182
from 1:40 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.

785
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,893
You two seemed quite serious.

786
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,440
Is it related to the press conference
you're holding today?

787
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,737
What are you talking about?

788
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,949
You know reporter Kim Cho-rong from IBC?

789
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,952
Should I send her this photo?

790
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,289
It is strongly suspected

791
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,458
that The Leah Company is owned
by the owners of Eunsung,

792
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,755
and acting Seoul Mayor, Kim Jeong-do,
is at the center of this controversy.

793
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,509
The moment I send this photo,

794
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,304
this will naturally be
the headline of the article.

795
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,640
Why don't you read this instead?

796
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:31,953
Currently, the Seoul
Metropolitan Government

797
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:36,666
is investigating the fairness
of the decision to sell

798
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,793
the redevelopment site
to the Leah Company.

799
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,714
Due to the concerns and the interest
of the citizens of Seoul,

800
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,426
we will put a hold
on the redevelopment permit

801
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,012
we have given to The Leah Company

802
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,766
until the new mayor has been elected.

803
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,273
Furthermore,

804
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,193
the 39th mayor of Seoul,

805
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:07,655
to be elected in the mayoral by-election
in 70 days,

806
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,743
will be given the sole power to decide

807
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:15,038
whether the redevelopment construction
should continue or not.

808
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,756
Mr. Mayor, what if it's revealed

809
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,925
the city colluded with The Leah Company?

810
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,176
When will it be revealed

811
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,762
whether the land was unfairly sold
for redevelopment?

812
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,680
If the construction doesn't resume…

813
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,766
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor!

814
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,980
Kim Jeong-do, the acting mayor of Seoul,
has announced

815
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,025
that Seoul city is currently investigating
the fairness

816
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:47,070
of selling the redevelopment site
to the Leah Company.

817
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,614
In addition, all development
will come to a halt…

818
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,698
How much?

819
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,868
If the redevelopment of Sangah
comes to a halt,

820
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,287
we will suffer a loss
of 2.8 billion won a day.

821
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,999
And the other district?

822
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:03,711
Things are looking worse
in Soonjung District.

823
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:08,425
The loans we took out from the national
pension under The Leah Company

824
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,219
were all spent on the construction
of the duty-free shop.

825
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,471
If the investigation starts,
the duty-free shop--

826
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,515
Don't let the investigation start!

827
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,269
Since when do we care
about the complaints of these peasants

828
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:20,645
when doing business?

829
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,981
The press and public opinion
aren't the issue.

830
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,525
It's our foreign investors
who are getting spooked.

831
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,695
They're withdrawing
their investment in the duty-free shop

832
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,406
because Seoul city
is distancing itself from us.

833
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,540
All right.

834
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,793
Dad, happy birthday!

835
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,886
Thank you, ma'am.

836
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:57,390
Come on, Dad.
Don't call your daughter "ma'am."

837
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,187
But my daughter got married

838
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,232
to this handsome man you see in the photo.

839
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,408
Come on, Dad.

840
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,660
Hang in there.

841
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,538
I'm doing everything I can

842
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,458
to find a new donor for you.

843
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,839
What's the point of living longer?

844
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,636
I'm only a burden to you and Joong-seok.

845
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:39,641
Right.

846
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,354
How is my grandson doing?

847
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,279
Oh, I see your daughter is here.

848
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,366
Hello, ma'am.

849
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,284
You're working so hard.

850
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,788
Please. It's the patient
who has it the hardest.

851
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,459
By the way,
why aren't you visiting together?

852
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:08,711
I'm sorry?

853
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,171
I mean…

854
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:15,385
Your husband came to visit yesterday.

855
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:16,928
Right.

856
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,098
-This hand, please.
-Okay.

857
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,728
Ma'am. Please take good care of my father.

858
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,274
Call me anytime if anything happens.

859
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,817
Sure, don't you worry.

860
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:46,457
What are you doing?

861
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,544
What do you mean?

862
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,672
Where did you go,
and why didn't you answer your phone?

863
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,007
Did something happen?

864
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:55,466
Yes.

865
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:01,222
Having you disappear from my eyes is
the worst thing that could happen to me.

866
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,517
If something happened to you,

867
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,686
Ms. Oh would be the one
to suffer the blows.

868
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,230
How could I not care
about your whereabouts?

869
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:12,525
Are you playing hot and cold
with me or something?

01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,695
I simply haven't got the energy for that.
I'm too tired.

871
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,783
What about lunch? Have you eaten?

872
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,869
I haven't had a bite because of someone.

873
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,496
Let's eat together if you haven't yet.

874
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,292
What do you want?
