00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The most outstanding master of the day, Dr. Jun Huiji, is here.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I heard that after the former director resigned,

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
he was temporarily in charge of the private business of the young and promising.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He has changed the style of the man who admires the woman.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He is more exquisite and practical.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'd rather not say a word.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll go to see him in person.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll go to see him in person.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll go to see him in person.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'll go to see him in person.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll go to see him in person.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll go to see him in person.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is how you look at a woman.

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll go to see him in person.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll go to see him in person.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'll go to see him in person.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll go to see him in person.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll go to see him in person.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll go to see him in person.

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll go to see him in person.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll go to see him in person.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll go to see him in person.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll go to see him in person.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll go to see him in person.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll go to see him in person.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll go to see him in person.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll go to see him in person.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll go to see him in person.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll go to see him in person.

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll go to see him in person.

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll go to see him in person.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll go to see him in person.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll go to see him in person.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll go to see him in person.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll go to see him in person.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll go to see him in person.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll go to see him in person.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll go to see him in person.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll go to see him in person.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll go to see him in person.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll go to see him in person.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The Love by Hypnotic

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Episode 10

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Miss, you're here.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm here. Hurry.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hurry.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Be good. Be good. Be good.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Young Master. Young Master.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This is the third time I've been here.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This time, it's Miss Song.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's okay. Then, hit it.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What? But it's Dr. Song's pearl.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Then, speed up.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He'll escape anyway.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Speed up.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yan Yun Zhi saved the beauty and speeded up.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What should we do?

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Go.

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Young Master, have you been hurt?

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're a weirdo.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Miss.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
How are you? Are you hurt?

63
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's all your fault. You ruined my plan.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Miss.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Miss.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Miss.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Miss.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
A fool on the road,

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
a weirdo in the car.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
People in Bianjing won't say thank you, right?

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not grateful to you.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're not grateful.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're really ungrateful.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm telling you.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can blow the wind into the world.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can save you.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I...

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you know who you're bothering?

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is Dr. Song's daughter, Song Jiayin.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Can you afford to offend her?

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Song Changsi is annoying.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Song Jiayin is annoying.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I've never been a high-ranking person.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Come and catch me if you can.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm Sang Qi.

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sang Qi?

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Where did you come from?

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You'll suffer in the future.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You've been looking at me like this.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But I want to thank you.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No need.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm about to get married.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not your first time.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What a pity.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can't speak.

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can't speak.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This lady.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The tables are full now.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Qi.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Come up.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Zhou Meng Yuan.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Qi.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Are you tired?

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's go.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Roast lamb, braise lamb, roast lamb, and roast lamb chops.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
A dry yellow poison.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Add some appetizers as a garnish.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sweet and sour plum ball.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Braised fish with winter melon.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And some spicy and spicy pepper.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's a great dish.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've heard that you've always liked

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
this kind of roast lamb.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It seems that you're not lying.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Get ready.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okay.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sir, please.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Zan Lang.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Qi Lang.

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sit.

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why are you here so late?

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I met someone.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why did you suddenly think of coming back?

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's time for the national exam.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's time to study.

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
National exam?

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
National exam?

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Am I hearing things right?

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
National exam is the highest school of Song Dynasty.

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It only recruits male students

164
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
from famous families between 14 and 19 years old.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've never heard of female students.

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There's always a beginning.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can ask the official to give me a chance

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
to ask him to let me go to national exam

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and become the first female student.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's not easy to be the first one.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I've made up my mind.

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is my brother's will.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He wants me to follow his will

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
to study in the Imperial College.

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Chen Wen Yuan.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't care if you're the last one.

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You must give it to me.

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you dare to slander our Song family,

179
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll find someone to tear down your building.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't talk.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go.

182
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why are you...

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why are you...

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Learn to talk.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was just saying.

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You just called my name

188
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
as if you were not afraid of death.

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So, this is the woman Mr. Zhuo

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
has been looking for.

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mr. Zhuo.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're really a flower

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that blooms in the middle of the world.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Miss Song.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't say that.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is the second lady

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
of the Sang Tai Wei family,

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sang Qi.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're the wild girl

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
who was born in the border.

201
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You just came back to Bianjing.

202
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No wonder you don't know the rules.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You made me

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
get angry in front of my future husband.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Mr. Qin.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
When did you get married?

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're about to marry your future husband.

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Mr. Qin.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's not good to steal two girls' wine like this.

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm the one who's going to get drunk.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You just said

212
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
that one of the girls is Sang Qi,

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sang Yu's sister.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's really not good to meet in the public.

215
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You're the only daughter of the Tai Wei family.

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Even if I can't do anything to you,

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
the people of Qingfeng House

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
will have to give me an explanation.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Look at her dirty face.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
She's just a pretty old lady.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
She's always so big and fierce.

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why doesn't she listen at all?

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What's wrong?

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What are you talking about?

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm praising you.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Miss Song, I'm praising you.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're so crazy and ugly

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
that you make me feel so sad.

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Of course I have to say that.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You've been in front of me

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
for several times.

232
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're not trying to get my attention, are you?

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, I'm not.

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Even if you have a grudge,

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
you can't get rid of it.

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're making me angry.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You're going to pay the price.

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Take this girl away from me.

239
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Wait.

240
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Miss Song.

241
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This girl has a father and a mother.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You don't have to do this.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What does it have to do with you?

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Besides,

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
it's not her fault

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
because you ruined my good deeds.

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Then tell me, Miss Song.

248
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How did I ruin your good deeds?

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
As long as you can make it easy for her,

250
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm willing to help you

251
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
to complete your good deed.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're really

253
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
making fun of me.

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Miss Song,

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
why don't we make a bet?

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You want Ye Yanzhi to take your purse.

257
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ye Yanzhi.

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ye Yanzhi.

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What's that?

260
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The girl who just got off the bus.

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's her.

262
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's her.

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
She's a white-collar scholar

264
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
who can't even open her eyes

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and can't speak.

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This description is quite appropriate.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm Chen Ningzhi's model.

268
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I've never heard such an evaluation in my life.

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's so annoying.

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Time is set for Shangyuan Festival.

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If you don't let Ye Yanzhi

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
take your purse,

273
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
then...

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Then you can go to the lantern show

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
like those singers

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and perform on stage.

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
How?

278
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Everyone in Bianjing

279
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
will laugh at you.

280
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What if she takes it?

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Then I'll perform on stage.

282
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll apologize to you

283
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in front of everyone in Bianjing.

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And I won't bother you anymore.

285
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But Miss Song,

286
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I want to remind you that

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
if Qi really loses

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
the performance on Shangyuan Festival,

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm afraid you're not

290
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
willing to continue.

291
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm also obedient.

292
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Shopkeeper,

293
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
give me the paper and the pen.

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No need.

295
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm a man of my word.

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Everyone here is a witness.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll accept this bet.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll wait.

300
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Anye.

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ye Yanzhi

302
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
doesn't even take your purse.

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why do you have to give her a match?

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Have you ever heard of Dong Shi and Xiao Ping?

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The ugly one

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
is more beautiful.

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll go.

308
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Where should I find

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ye Yanzhi?

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I just gave her a match.

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why do I have to wait until Shangyuan Festival?

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Anxin,

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I thought it was the hardest thing

314
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
for you to go to study in the Imperial College.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I didn't expect you to choose

316
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
a more difficult one.

317
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's talk about it.

318
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Where did she get Ye Yanzhi?

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ye Yanzhi

320
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
is the head of the four princes of Bianjing.

321
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The rest are the son of the God of Green Gables, Yan Xiaolang

322
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and me.

323
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
And you?

324
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes.

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The standard is not high.

326
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The most difficult thing

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
among the four people

328
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
is that Ye Yanzhi.

329
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Although she is the son of the Prime Minister,

330
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
she is talented.

331
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
She is good at everything.

332
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
She...

333
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
She specializes in

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
sending letters with her head.

335
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you want to send her a match,

336
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I advise you

337
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
to learn the zither first.

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Don't worry.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't handle it without Sang Qi.

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I know.

341
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm looking forward to it.

342
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Please.

343
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Mr. Yan,

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
we have met twice in a day.

345
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's fate.

346
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why don't you take my purse?

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Hey.

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In Bianjing,

349
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
it's easy to express your love for the purse.

350
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No.

351
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
No.

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't misunderstand.

353
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I have no feelings for you.

354
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What a coincidence.

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's good.

356
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Besides,

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can't open my eyes

358
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and I can't speak.

359
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
How can I match

360
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the purse you gave me?

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Then you are too modest.

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You just have to close your eyes

363
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and look at the mirror.

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You can't see anything.

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You can't see anything.

366
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
A two-layer piece of paper.

367
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
How can you

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
show your love for the purse?

369
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let go.

370
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You were talking behind my back.

371
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Now you are giving her the purse.

372
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What do you want?

373
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I...

374
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I just came back from the Bianjing match.

375
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The accent was a little too strong.

376
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I kept saying the same accent.

377
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How can it be possible?

378
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How can it be possible?

379
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's impossible.

380
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

382
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You are so beautiful.

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You are so beautiful.

384
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You are so beautiful.

385
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You are so beautiful.

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was talking behind your back.

387
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was talking behind your back.

388
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was talking in front of you.

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Look at her.

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She is a perfect match

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
with Song Jiayin.

392
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Perfect match.

393
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Perfect match.

394
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Baby is listening to the moves.

395
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
She can't hear anything.

396
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
She is complimenting her.

397
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
She is complimenting her.

398
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She is so cute.

399
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Cute.

400
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I really can read.

401
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I once went to Shu Lu to do some public works.

402
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I learned a few things.

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Then...

404
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then we...

405
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We still have a chance.

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Unless I'm Haru.

407
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Unless you are Haru.

408
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Thank you, sir.

409
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I...

410
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Are you going to beat him up like this?

411
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What happened here?

412
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
But it's still a bit late.

413
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't believe Ye Yanzhi

414
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
will accept my gift.

415
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I haven't finished the first thing

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
in this whole day.

417
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What else can I do?

418
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
A gift for luck.

419
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The first thing?

420
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Are you still thinking about going to study in the national university?

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I did what I said.

422
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course I will go.

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's so hard.

424
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Did you come early?

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I came early.

426
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, right.

427
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Let's go.

428
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Let's go.

429
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's ridiculous.

430
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Isn't it ridiculous?

431
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm so old.

432
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I've never heard of any girl entering the palace.

433
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Today,

434
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Grand Commandant Sang is capable

435
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
to let the official allow his daughter

436
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to enter the Imperial College.

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In the future,

438
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
won't his daughter

439
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
be able to sit in the Imperial College

440
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
with us in a parallel?

441
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, that's right.

442
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's ridiculous.

443
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's ridiculous.

444
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's ridiculous.

445
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's ridiculous.

446
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's ridiculous.

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's right.

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Grand Commandant,

449
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I've discussed with all the doctors.

450
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
We must give this Sang Qi a test.

451
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The Imperial College

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
is not a place where everyone can enter.

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes, we must give him a test.

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
But this time,

455
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
all other students

456
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
were recruited from the school.

457
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They didn't take the entrance exam.

458
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why did they have to take the test when they arrived at Sang Qi?

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Is it because she is a girl?

460
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And since we have decided

461
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
to recruit the first female student

462
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
of the Imperial College,

463
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
why should we make it difficult for her?

464
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This...

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Grand Commandant,

466
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Dr. Feng is also being careful.

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
After all, recruiting a female student

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
is a matter of the Imperial College.

469
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We must help her.

470
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I hope you'll be careful.

471
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I hope you'll be careful.

472
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I am very careful.

473
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Education

474
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
needs to be based on the heart.

475
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You shouldn't be the one to follow the rules.

476
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If Sang Qi

477
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
is a good student,

478
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
we can't make it difficult for her

479
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
because she is a girl.

480
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We can't refuse her to enter the Imperial College.

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If we do that,

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
it will be a big problem.

483
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Since you think so,

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
then the family matter

485
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
can be confirmed by my words.

486
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If Sang Qi can't pass the exam,

487
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
it means that she is not good at studying.

488
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
We shouldn't give her

489
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
the chance to enter the Imperial College.

490
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Even if the officials have questions,

491
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
we can answer them.

492
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Right?

493
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yes.

494
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Since you all think so,

495
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
okay,

496
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
let's see

497
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
if Sang Qi

498
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
can do it.

499
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes,

500
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm the only one.

501
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They are deliberately making things difficult for me.

502
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I told you

503
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
it's not that easy.

504
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Zhuo Wen Yu,

505
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
since you can enter the Imperial College,

506
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
it means that you have some way.

507
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Tell me about it.

508
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can't solve the problem of learning quickly.

509
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't help it.

510
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Dad,

511
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Dad,

512
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
brother,

513
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm going to be a monk.

515
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sorry for my ancestors.

516
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm sorry for the past ten years.

517
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm sorry for the mutton,

518
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
rice and...

519
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Okay, okay.

520
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You can say it now.

521
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I should say it now.

522
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Okay.

523
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I can't help you with the examination,

524
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
but I know

525
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
some teachers of the Imperial College.

526
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You just need to catch their characteristics

527
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and break them one by one.

528
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Dr. Hong,

529
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
the Imperial College's Sword Master,

530
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
is a teacher of Tai-Xue.

531
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He is a person who hates to change his mind.

532
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
He is not satisfied with you coming to the Imperial College to study.

533
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But the good news is,

534
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
his paper is not changed at all.

535
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's not changed at all.

536
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There are only a few questions.

537
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You just need to read and remember the answers I give you.

538
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Then you can be a good student.

539
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Dr. Huo Cheng,

540
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
the teacher of martial arts,

541
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
has a deep relationship with your family under your father's care.

542
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He won't make it difficult for you.

543
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He just tests your skill of riding and shooting.

544
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's a small lesson for you.

545
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The Imperial College's Sword Master

546
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Yan Yun Zhi?

547
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why are you here?

548
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You are also in the Imperial College?

549
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
My son is the teacher of the Imperial College.

550
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yan Yun Zhi, Deputy Chief Yan.

551
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I told you.

552
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You lost my purse at the front.

553
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I will be responsible for the rest of the money.

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I just made a bet.

555
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You are really a person who can't pay back.

556
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But what a coincidence.

557
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I, Sang Qi Nan, like to win and win.

558
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is the Imperial College.

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I will pay you.

560
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The Imperial College

561
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The Imperial College

562
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's time.

563
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
The Imperial College

564
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Deputy Chief Yan,

565
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I have got all the questions you asked.

566
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
This time,

567
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
you should accept me as your student.

568
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Then tomorrow at 10 o'clock,

569
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I will be late.

570
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm leaving.

571
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm leaving.

572
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Yan Yan, don't keep blocking me.

573
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yan Yan, don't come here.

574
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Let's go.

575
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You are a traitor.

576
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I will take you to the prison.

577
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
You are a traitor.

578
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yan Yan,

579
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm not a child.

580
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You are a bastard.

581
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You are behind my class.

582
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
You are really a bastard.

583
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yan Yan,

584
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
look at you,

585
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
you are the same as an eight-year-old child.

586
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
You are like a bastard.

587
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You are behind my class.

588
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You are behind my class.

589
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Isn't it a fair game?

590
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What's wrong with my class?

591
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You two,

592
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
don't be so angry for a name.

593
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
In terms of the immortal,

594
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the four classes of the Heavenly Emperor,

595
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the classmates of our class are very happy.

596
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Look,

597
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
they are still being pulled out.

598
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It's really amazing.

599
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Why are they all here so early today?

600
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Did something big happen to the Imperial Army?

601
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Sang Qi?

602
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Who is Sang Qi?

603
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm just a big man from the Sang family in Bianjing.

604
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm the son of the Sang family.

605
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
But doesn't he have a son?

606
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
He's already gone.

607
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I heard that he is the first female disciple

608
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
since the opening of the Imperial College.

609
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Nonsense.

610
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
A young lady came to study at the Imperial College.

611
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's not proper.

612
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Isn't it a disgrace to the reputation of the Imperial College?

613
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You agree with the Feng Bo Mountain.

614
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You agree with the private business.

615
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
If you say it louder,

616
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
can the officials agree?

617
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Sang Qi came to the Imperial College yesterday

618
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
and passed the exam.

619
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
He got the approval of the doctors.

620
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Yan Yan,

621
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
you are still the son of the Tai Shi family.

622
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You don't even know this news.

623
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's the daughter of the Sang family.

624
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
She grew up with him.

625
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Now she is at the age of being married.

626
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
She is sent back to Bianjing.

627
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Is she at the age of being married?

628
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What does it have to do with you?

629
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You have to go to propose.

630
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
She doesn't study in her private study.

631
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
She has to go to the Imperial College.

632
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Why does she have to go to a place where men are in a group?

633
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
In my opinion,

634
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
she came here to choose a wife.

635
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
She treats us

636
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
as her belongings.

637
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
The first day of the marriage,

638
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
a woman thought about our reputation like this.

639
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
She is really thoughtful.

640
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Who said a woman can't go to the Imperial College to study?

641
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But it's the first time a woman goes to the Imperial College.

642
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Let me do the math.

643
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
How is it?

644
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What's the answer?

645
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's...

646
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Big chest.

647
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Big chest?

648
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
This is not good.

649
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
A woman can't go to the Imperial College.

650
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Really?

651
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'll do the math.

652
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I want to see

653
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
what kind of woman she is.

654
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I also have the same idea.

655
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Let her come to the Imperial College

656
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
to learn the rules of reading books outside.

657
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Let's go.

658
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Let's go.

659
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Let's go.

660
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll do the math.

661
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I'll do the math.

662
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Let's go.

663
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
After going to the Imperial College,

664
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
how can you not be able to complete the report?

665
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Mr. Wei.

666
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Why don't you return to your seat?

667
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Sang Qi.

668
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Please show your sword.

669
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I, Jing Xue,

670
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
greet Yan Si Yan.

671
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Sang Qi.

672
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Do you know

673
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
what it means to send a man's pouch to a woman?

674
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I know.

675
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It means something interesting.

676
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I know.

677
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I know.

678
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It means something interesting.

679
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But I don't mean that.

680
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What do you mean?

681
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The meaning of the student to the teacher.

682
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It means something interesting.

683
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Yan Si Yan.

684
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
This is a ceremony to pay respect to the teacher.

685
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You can't not accept it.

686
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm sorry.

687
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Bai Shi.

688
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Record it.

689
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Today, I received a gift from Sang Qi.

690
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
A pen.

691
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
A small pen.

692
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Si Yan.

693
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Si Yan.

694
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Si Yan.

695
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Although you said you were good at embroidery,

696
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
you still look like a man.

697
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Are you done?

698
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Others send pouches to women to make a living.

699
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But you send pouches to women.

700
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It's like you're going to die.

701
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If you were a killer,

702
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I would have been shot by you with bow and arrow

703
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and you would have been scared to death

704
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and you would have been pissed off.

705
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm afraid

706
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
there's no challenge.

707
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
How can I attract your attention?

708
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You're so ungrateful.

709
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Si Yan.

710
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
For the sake of your future,

711
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
you should accept this pouch.

712
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What future do you and I have?

713
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Put the pouch down.

714
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll take you to the classroom.

715
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
According to the position of the disciple,

716
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
the Imperial College is high and low.

717
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
It's a four-level class.

718
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The student should be respected by the teacher.

719
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Don't be rude.

720
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Do you understand?

721
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
This is the future of Tian Bai.

722
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
This is your classmate, Wang Ban.

723
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Go in.

724
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I...

725
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm not going to...

726
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Remember.

727
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Respect the teacher and be a good person.

728
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's a Посine!

729
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
What's wrong with her?

730
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What's wrong with her?

731
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Why is the lady

732
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
in our royal family?

733
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What's wrong with her?

734
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You're just worried about her?

735
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Why are you ignoring me?

736
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What's wrong with her?

737
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What's wrong with her?

738
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
What's wrong with her?

739
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What's wrong with her?

740
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Isn't she in the hall?

741
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What's wrong with her?

742
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Brother Zhuo, why are you in our class?

743
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
From today on,

744
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm also a student of your royal class.

745
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I didn't hear wrong, right?

746
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You're not in the good Tianzi class.

747
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Why are you here to humiliate us?

748
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
We'll talk about it when we're here.

749
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Why are you here?

750
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
To be your classmate.

751
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Be my classmate?

752
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
No.

753
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
You'd better go back to your class.

754
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You want me to go back?

755
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
That's easy.

756
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Take the exam.

757
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Go to the class.

758
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'll go back with you.

759
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Zhong Yuan,

760
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Deputy Chief wants you to go to the hall.

761
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Deputy Chief.

762
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm here to see you.

763
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm here to see you.

764
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm here to see you.

765
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm here to see you.

766
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm here to see you.

767
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I'm here to see you.

768
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm here to see you.

769
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Zhu Wanyuan,

770
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
your grades

771
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
are in the first or second place in the heavenly class.

772
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
You'll be a top student one day.

773
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
You might even be a high school senior.

774
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Why do you want to go to the royal class?

775
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
It will destroy your future.

776
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Deputy Chief once taught us

777
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
that we can't study only for fame.

778
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I also obey your teaching.

779
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You're a good student.

780
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
You've been a good student since the beginning.

781
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Does your aunt know you're doing this?

782
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Deputy Chief,

783
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
you don't have to

784
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
make an effort to make an aunt happy.

785
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If you're going to ask me

786
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
why I'm doing this,

787
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'll ask you the same question.

788
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I also want to ask you the same question.

789
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Sang Qi is a woman.

790
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's not easy to come to the Imperial College to study.

791
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Why do you still have to make things difficult for him?

792
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Do you think I'm making things difficult for him?

793
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Although Sang Qi didn't get into the heavenly class,

794
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
with his grades

795
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and the family background of his family,

796
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
he's still good at this class.

797
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
To study,

798
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
you need to have the heart to be in the top position.

799
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
There are thousands of women in the imperial family.

800
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Only he has the chance to go to the Imperial College.

801
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
If you can't set an example for women to study,

802
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
who else will have the courage

803
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
to step into the Imperial College?

804
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
I understand your intention.

805
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
But Sang Qi will never give up.

806
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'll take my leave.

807
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Qi?

808
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Brother Yu,

809
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
which lady are you writing to?

810
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Wan Pi.

811
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
This is my sister.

812
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I recommend her to study in the Imperial College.

813
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,000
What do you think?

814
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I think you're joking.

815
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
A woman should study in the Imperial College.

816
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's a dream.

817
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm serious.

818
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
If one day, Qi returns to Bianjing

819
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
and enters the Imperial College,

820
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
you must take good care of her for me.

821
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
She's your sister, not mine.

822
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I don't know her.

823
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You know my condition.

824
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Can you endure that day?

825
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Brother Yu,

826
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I promise you.

827
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But don't talk nonsense.

828
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Okay.

829
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm relieved to hear that.

830
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The Imperial College

831
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Zi Yan,

832
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
the fire is burning.

833
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Come in.

834
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Zi Yan.

835
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Zi Yan.

836
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Zi Yan,

837
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
why can't you open it?

838
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
This is...

839
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Baishen.

840
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yes.

841
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Go tell the Jingzhao's Mansion

842
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
that the victim may have used a wide cloth.

843
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So there are no obvious scars on the ear.

844
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Yes, Young Master.

845
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Zi Yan,

846
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
you're here to help the Jingzhao's Mansion.

847
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Why are you laughing?

848
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Why are you here?

849
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I...

850
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I haven't seen you for a day.

851
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I missed you so much.

852
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I missed you so much that I came to see you.

853
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You'd better worry about your studies.

854
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Don't think that everything will be fine after you get into the Imperial College.

855
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You mean

856
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
you'll sweep me out?

857
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
What do you think?

858
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But don't worry.

859
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'll work hard

860
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
and make you the head of the family.

861
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I hope so.

862
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Since there's nothing else,

863
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'll go back to work.

864
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Wait.

865
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Take your things away.

866
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Where did you go?

867
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I went to see Deputy Chief.

868
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I think you can't send the pouch out.

869
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
He won't take it.

870
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
It fell into the river.

871
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
What?

872
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Deputy Chief is looking for a short sword?

873
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Is he all right?

874
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
He's fine. Don't worry.

875
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
He's fine.

876
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Qi.

877
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
What's going on?

878
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Looking for a short sword?

879
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Qi.

880
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You must be rich.

881
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Thank you, Master.

882
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Here's your water.

883
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I want to tell you something.

884
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
What?

885
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I want to tell you something.

886
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What?

887
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Keep it a secret.

888
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Master, I want to tell you something.

889
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Come here.

890
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Come here.

891
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
What?

892
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I want to tell you something.

893
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Keep it a secret.

894
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I want to tell you something.

895
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Keep it a secret.

896
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Deputy Chief Yan.

897
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
You're not dead.

898
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Time to hit.

899
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Time to hit.

900
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Who told you that?

901
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't know.

902
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Sang Qi.

903
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Deputy Chief, you finally found me.

904
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Deputy Chief, in broad daylight,

905
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
are you trying to hit me?

906
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm willing to use this life

907
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
to exchange for a lifetime of love.

908
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm willing to use this life

909
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
to exchange for a lifetime of love.

910
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If love is a persistence,

911
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
we will love each other deeply.

912
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I'm the only one who has this life.

913
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
If it's a past life,

914
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
it will become my value.

915
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I can never

916
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
be unknown.

917
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'm the perfect story.

918
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'm the way I am

919
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
when I'm in the wind.

920
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
My heart is in the city of unknown.

921
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I've changed the beginning.

922
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm the one who has lost the love.

923
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'm writing the lyrics of the new moon.

924
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I've also finished

925
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
this life that I've been waiting for.

926
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I've also finished

927
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
this life that I've been waiting for.

928
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I've also finished

929
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
this life that I've been waiting for.

930
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I've also finished

931
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
this life that I've been waiting for.

932
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I've also finished

933
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
this life that I've been waiting for.

934
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I've also finished

935
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
this life that I've been waiting for.

936
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I've also finished

937
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
this life that I've been waiting for.

938
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
