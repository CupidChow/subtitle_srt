1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of the waves are like the sound of the waves

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The rain is like the sound of water, the sound of the waves are like the sound of water

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The rain is like the sound of water, the sound of water

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The rain is like the sound of water, the sound of water

5
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The rain is like the sound of water, the sound of water

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Young Master, the Jin Zhao House has already taken action.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you have any countermeasures?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's wait and see.

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yin Yun Zhi and the others haven't gotten the evidence yet.

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Otherwise, it wouldn't be as simple as following the track.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Tell your people not to act rashly.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's take care of it first.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Are we going to keep waiting like this?

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The road is already in danger.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We can't do anything about the Spider's business.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If we keep doing this,

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will lose my money.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now is a critical time.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We should be careful.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If we are caught by them again,

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
we will be in danger.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The so-called one move is not good.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The whole board will lose.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's why we need to be patient.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Young Master, I advise you to make a plan earlier.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The reason why Xi Zhao House cooperates with the Zhuo family

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is because it has benefits.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now, you have entered the court and got power.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you haven't fulfilled your promise.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you annoy his old man,

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
it will not benefit you.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I...

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I haven't seen you for a few days.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm afraid you are not feeling well.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So I came to see you.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You are so thoughtful.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Dear,

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you have been working for the public affairs for days.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's really hard for you.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I prepared some dishes.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why don't you go to my room and have a drink?

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Really?

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I shouldn't have been angry before.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I happen to take this opportunity to apologize to you.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Since you sincerely apologize,

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Zhuo, don't refuse.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you for your kindness.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Dear,

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
what are you doing?

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm teaching you the rules of the Zhuo family.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Next time, I'll see if you dare to sneak a peek.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Qianqiu,

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
go to your room and have a drink.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't let your wife down.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you, my lady.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Zhuo Yuan,

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you are so heartless.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Thank you.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Zhuo Yuan,

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you are so heartless.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Zhuo Yuan,

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you are so heartless.

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thank you.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Zhuo Yuan,

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
you are so heartless.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Zhuo Yuan,

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you are so heartless.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Zhuo Yuan,

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
you are so heartless.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Zhuo Yuan,

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you are so heartless.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thank you.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Zhuo Yuan,

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you are so heartless.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Zhuo Yuan,

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,060
ADVCE

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
S lets open

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the last door

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Your Ladyship,

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
let open it

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the last door

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Pak

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Please,

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
wait for me

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your Ladyship,

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How dare you bully me in broad daylight?

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Me?

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Who bullied you?

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You're making excuses.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're a man. Why are you doing this?

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're still acting like a fool.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're a thief.

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're not a good person at first sight.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, I have to find someone.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who are you calling a thief?

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not me.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Please explain.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have to find someone.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Stop fighting.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Stop fighting.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Stop fighting.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Stop fighting.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Lord Ye.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why did you suddenly summon me?

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're so insolent.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're still in the dark.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're going to be in trouble.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The people of Jingzhao Prefecture are secretly interrogating.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They're going to confess soon.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's right.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You young people are too hasty.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
How can you call the people of Jingzhao Prefecture

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to catch the bait?

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Is this news reliable?

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Whether it's reliable or not,

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
at this time,

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
we'd rather believe it than not.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Whether it's true or false,

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
we can't be careless.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Besides,

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I heard from Luo Tian that

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the government officials around Bianjing

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
are gathering the officials of Jinggan.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
They're going to Jingzhao Prefecture.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Look.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Isn't this going to be done soon?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't worry, Lord Ye.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will handle this.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Young Master.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I failed to do my job.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I lost my father and you.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
But you know that

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I will never do such a lowly thing.

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
All right.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We believe you.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Deputy Chief.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There's something wrong with Mrs. Zhang.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She's not a simple person.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
She wanted to find other places

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
when she was in trouble.

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She's not a simple person.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She just wanted to find other places

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
when she was in trouble.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But she escaped.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's all right.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She'll be killed sooner or later.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The evidence we tested

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
can be used.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Deputy Chief.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Have you arranged everything

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I told you?

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
As you said,

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
everything is arranged.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We can set off at any time.

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's time to set off.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Take them.

169
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yan Yan.

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Light the horse and go with me.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Young Master.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You and Miss Sang

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
were looking at the body of the teacher.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What did you find?

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The shoulder is hard.

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The palm is very smooth.

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Teacher?

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Scissors.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Long Xian Xiang.

182
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
There is only the Shuyu Hall in Bianjing

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that uses this kind of spice.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Take them away.

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Yes.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The face is greasy and full of bubbles.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It should be caused by the long-term oil and smoke.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The palm is hard.

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The back of the hand is red.

190
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I guess

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the hand is full of oil.

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The hand is full of oil.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The hand is full of oil.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I guess

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
it should be the cook.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Later,

197
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
investigate all the restaurant and restaurant.

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
See if there are any missing cooks.

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yes.

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Sir.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm back.

202
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Stop.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Catch him.

204
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Stop.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't move.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There is a mark on the shoulder.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There are obvious marks.

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hand over.

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Search carefully.

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There is someone over there.

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Chase.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Go.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Go.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The feet are soaked by water all the time.

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The lips are dry and the skin is black.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It should be

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
the fish.

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fish are sold.

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hurry up.

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't move.

222
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Take them away.

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Those people have worked for Xizhao for many years.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Once the government of Jinzhao gets the evidence,

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
the consequences will be unimaginable.

226
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Everything we run in Bianjing

227
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
will be destroyed in an instant.

228
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sir.

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can you use the power of the court

230
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
to help Xizhao get through this?

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Before Zhan Hong died,

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
the government has already given me a warning.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm afraid the Ruo family won't interfere in this matter anymore.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Otherwise, it will inevitably cause a fire.

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What you told Qianjiu to do before,

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Qianjiu never gave up.

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Every move was a good one.

238
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Now Xizhao is in trouble.

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Do you want to stand by and watch?

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The spring is cold.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Once Xizhao is destroyed,

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
can the Ruo family still retreat?

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Now I can't protect myself.

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Moreover,

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
this information may not be reliable.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It may be the plot of the first night of the cloud.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We want to catch the person who broke it.

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Now we take the risk,

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
it's not a good thing.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's fine if you don't want to do it.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I will report this truthfully.

252
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
As for what to do,

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
it's up to the old man.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,960
The

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
All of you, go to the cell.

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

257
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Go, go, go.

258
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hurry up.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Will anyone really come to save them?

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Not necessarily.

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But they will definitely come to destroy the door.

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Go.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Qianqiao.

264
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're back.

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You didn't come back today.

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I was worried.

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
All the contact points in Bianjing

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
were destroyed.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I wanted to tell them in advance.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I didn't expect that the capital's government

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
has long been in a situation of ambush.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There is no chance at all.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
So

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
our people

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
really made a contribution.

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Now the capital's government

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
has caught fire again.

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We are many people.

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm afraid the situation will get more and more dangerous.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I have called people from outside the city.

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They will sneak into the capital's government tomorrow night.

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We can't let these people

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
fall into the hands of the government.

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I have worked hard for so many years.

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I can't just give up like this.

286
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The capital's government has been prepared for this.

287
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm afraid it will be more dangerous.

288
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Please let Qianqiao go with you.

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I will do my best for you.

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Qianqiao.

291
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You have been with me for the longest time.

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Although you are my subordinate,

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I always treat you as my family.

294
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
In my opinion,

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I can't let you take the risk with me.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If I can't make it,

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
you are the master of Xizhao.

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You must lead Xizhao to correct the situation in the future.

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mrs. Zhang, but...

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I have decided.

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No need to say more.

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

303
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Mr. Zhuo.

304
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You heard it all.

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You don't have to be so vigilant with me.

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Since we are in the same alliance,

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can't just stand by Mingyu's action.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Tomorrow night, I will send people

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
to look for themselves in Bianjing.

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The Zhaofu will send people to

311
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
hold the peace ceremony.

312
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You can sneak into the prison

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
when there is no one else.

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's great.

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you, Mr. Zhuo.

316
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You can also make a good plan for yourself.

317
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What do you mean?

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No matter what the result of today's action

319
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is,

320
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
the government will not give up.

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can't stay in Bianjing.

322
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is the pass of the document and the recording.

323
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It can guarantee that you can

324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
go through the whole journey without any problems.

325
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There are some banknotes and land deed in the box.

326
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's enough to make you feel free in the rest of your life.

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So, you have planned for me.

328
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I just planned for myself.

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You never care about Qianqiu.

330
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You risked yourself

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to protect yourself.

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You really risked yourself.

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Qianqiu,

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
don't listen to my mother.

335
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's not worth your life to take the risk.

336
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We know each other.

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't want you to stop.

338
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's go.

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Mr. Zhuo,

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
if you fail this time,

341
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
have you ever thought of a way out?

342
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Whether there is a way out

343
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
is not a chance for me.

344
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Mr. Zhuo,

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm afraid Qianqiu will let you down.

346
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Mr. Zhuo,

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
the West Regiment is also going to attack the capital.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We must ensure that everything is fine.

349
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
We can't fail.

350
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I understand.

351
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Mr. Zhuo,

352
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
you are back.

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Someone just came to report the case.

354
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Someone from the West Regiment is attacking the capital.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Mr. Yan asked you to take someone to handle it.

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What?

357
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Something happened again?

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's going on tonight?

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The case has never been interrupted.

360
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Where is Song Xiaotian?

361
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Mr. Song is dealing with other cases.

362
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He hasn't come back yet.

363
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He is also

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
in a critical moment.

365
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Forget it.

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Brothers,

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
let's go again.

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm going to the capital.

369
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm going to the capital.

370
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm going to the capital.

371
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm going to the capital.

372
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm going to the capital.

373
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm going to the capital.

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's go again.

375
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes.

376
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Go.

377
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Go.

378
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Go.

379
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Where do you want to go in the middle of the night?

380
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Go.

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Go.

382
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Leave the fire.

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Go.

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I told you to leave the fire.

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's really you.

386
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We meet again.

387
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Mr. Yan.

388
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Marinate her.

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes.

390
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
How is it?

391
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
She's dead.

392
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
She's dead.

393
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
She's dead.

394
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
She's dead.

395
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
She's dead.

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
She's dead.

397
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Diao Hua token.

398
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is this

399
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
the personal item of the Xizhao thief?

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Mrs. Zhang is the leader of Xizhao.

401
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Now we will interrogate the Xizhao people

402
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
immediately,

403
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
in case there are too many people in the night.

404
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Okay.

405
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Yan Yan.

406
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Go to Zhou's mansion quickly.

407
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Bring Zhou Wen Yuan to ask.

408
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yes.

409
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Go.

410
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yan Yan.

411
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
How is the interrogation going?

412
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The Xizhao people saw the head dead.

413
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
They all pleaded guilty.

414
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Mrs. Zhang is the leader of Xizhao.

415
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Qian Jiu is her right-hand man.

416
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But

417
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
they don't know

418
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
who is the person who conspired with Xizhao in the court.

419
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's a little bit of a catch.

420
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Deputy Chief.

421
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Qian Jiu hasn't confessed yet

422
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
who is the person who conspired with Xizhao?

423
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
She only admitted that she was from Xizhao.

424
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't need to make up excuses.

425
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Let me go see her.

426
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I want to ask her about

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
my brother.

428
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
This time, it's Miss Sang's turn to interrogate me.

429
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Qian Jiu.

430
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm not here to interrogate you.

431
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I want to ask you something.

432
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Don't waste your energy.

433
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Qian Jiu won't point fingers at anyone.

434
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's not about this.

435
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I just want to know

436
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
how my brother died.

437
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He was just a scholar.

438
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He had nothing to do with Xizhao.

439
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He was a scholar.

440
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He had nothing to do with Xizhao.

441
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why did you take his life?

442
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's been a long time.

443
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You still care about this matter.

444
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Fine.

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's a long night.

446
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You can't drink and sing.

447
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Why don't I tell you the truth?

448
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I didn't want to kill him.

449
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But he went to a place he shouldn't have.

450
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He saw something he shouldn't have.

451
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Hello.

452
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I want to buy some medicine.

453
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Sir, your medicine.

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Thank you.

455
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That day,

456
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I accidentally got the list of Xizhao's secret letters

457
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
in the pharmacy.

458
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Zeyu, the Deputy Chief wants to see you.

459
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Okay.

460
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
We've got the list.

461
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But Zeyu has seen it.

462
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But he didn't want to see you.

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You don't want to see me?

464
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Let's go.

465
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Let's go.

466
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's go.

467
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Let's go.

468
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Let's go.

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Let's go.

470
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's go.

471
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Let's go.

472
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Let's go.

473
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Let's go.

474
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I've seen it.

475
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I can only kill him

476
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
if I can't prevent it.

477
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Why did he get the list in the pharmacy?

478
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
He made a mistake.

479
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Say it.

480
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Is it important to ask now?

481
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Anyway, I killed your brother.

482
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
If you want to seek revenge,

483
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
you can aim at me.

484
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Now I'm a fish in the pond,

485
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
a fish in the pond,

486
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
a fish in the pond,

487
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
all in your mind.

488
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You'll regret it

489
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
if you miss this great opportunity.

490
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Then tell me,

491
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
is Zhuo Wen Yan related to this?

492
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Miss Sang,

493
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Mr. Zhuo is just a cover

494
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I found in Bianjing.

495
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
He and I are just acting.

496
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We don't have any affection.

497
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
But you, Miss Sang,

498
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
are always so reserved

499
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
and turn the soul of men into a knife.

500
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
If you come to Qingfeng Restaurant to sing,

501
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
you can definitely get the title of my flower.

502
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Qin Jiu,

503
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
your leader is dead.

504
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
The person who caught him has confessed.

505
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Why are you still so reserved?

506
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll endure everything I do.

507
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
But Qin Jiu will never

508
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
point out the innocent.

509
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Miss Sang,

510
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
please come back.

511
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Come back.

512
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
That was a night of a full moon.

513
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I asked someone to make two jars of wine

514
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and sing with Qin Jiu.

515
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But he didn't like it.

516
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
He didn't do anything strange that night.

517
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
He even played the zither for me.

518
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
What was the tune

519
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
he was playing at that time?

520
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Mr. Zhuo,

521
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I asked you to help with the investigation.

522
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I didn't come to hear you

523
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
talk about these full moon things.

524
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Mr. Yan,

525
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
didn't you say

526
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
you would report to you without any details?

527
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The clue of this case

528
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
may be in the daily life.

529
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Don't worry, sir.

530
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Just let me

531
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
take my time.

532
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Enough.

533
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I just want to ask you one question.

534
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Qin Jiu lives in your mansion.

535
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
He is a thief from the West.

536
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you really have nothing to do with this case?

537
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Then I'll ask you a question.

538
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Mr. Yan

539
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
is the parent official of Bianjing.

540
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The fraud in Bianjing

541
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
was all involved by Mr. Yan.

542
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Zhu Wenyuan,

543
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
you are lying.

544
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Mr. Yan,

545
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I just refuted one sentence.

546
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You are so angry.

547
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
But since I entered the Tang Dynasty,

548
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
you have been pushing me

549
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
to treat me as a criminal.

550
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I just helped with the investigation.

551
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Are you going to

552
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
put me on the spot?

553
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You...

554
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Mr. Yan,

555
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I have work to do tomorrow morning.

556
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'll see you tomorrow.

557
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Sir,

559
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Qian Jiu is in the hands of the Jinzhao family.

560
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
He is very different from us.

561
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yan Yun's tricks are very tricky.

562
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

563
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

564
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

565
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

566
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

567

I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

569
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

570
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

574
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

575
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

576
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

577
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

578
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

579
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

581
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

582
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

583
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

584
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

585
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

586
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

587
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

588
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

589
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

590
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

591
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

592
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

593
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

594
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'm afraid that he will be very angry.

595
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Mr. Zhuo

596
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You came to save me?

597
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,380
You don't deserve to come back.

598
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,420
You shouldn't come here either.

599
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,960
It is a very minor matter.

600
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,640
I can leave it to beggars to settle it.

601
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,340
Might be

602
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,600
you have feelings against me.

603
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,060
Now that you have found

604
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,960
such a great match for me,

605
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,800
I shall show you

606
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,960
You should know

607
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
what Job you'll face in the future.

608
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,180
But I don't want you

609
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,000
to be fare Presidential

610
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,800
Young master

611
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,720
Mr. Zhou.

612
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,880
Aren't you afraid that I'll turn back

613
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,200
and suddenly tell you?

614
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,760
Mr. Zhou.

615
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
This is the last time

616
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,320
I wish you hell.

617
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,960
Please keep your words.

618
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,600
Zhao Yingstick.

619
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,880
Zhao Yingstick.

620
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,440
Zhao Yingstick.

621
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,760
Zhao Yingstick.

622
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,020
Zhao Fei.

623
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,100
Zhao Fei.

624
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,520
Qin Xiyue.

625
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,060
Wu Kaye.

626
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,020
Wu Kaye.

627
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,640
Yu Li.

628
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,040

Gu Xiyue

632
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,960
Same.

633
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:06,820
Same.

634
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,320
Won't death make me DUI?

635
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,440
I finally know the truth

636
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,320
about my brother's death.

637
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,320
But I don't understand

638
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,200
why he never wants to tell the truth.

639
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,240
Maybe he will never tell the truth.

640
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,040
I want to try.

641
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,040
He is dying.

642
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,800
He won't tell the truth.

643
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,280
I won't talk again.

644
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,560
Then how exactly can you tell the truth?

645
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,560
I will ask again.

646
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,040
I've already confessed.

647
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,280
Why are you still here?

648
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,040
Because you still have something to hide.

649
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,920
Xizhao has been in chaos for years.

650
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,920
If there's no secret in the court,

651
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,920
it's impossible to hide it to this day.

652
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,760
Sang Qi.

653
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,960
Aren't you and Ye Yunchi

654
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,600
just trying to get justice for Sang Yu's death?

655
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,920
Now Xizhao is already in a bad state.

656
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,760
You've achieved your dream.

657
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,480
I advise you

658
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,040
to let go of it as soon as possible.

659
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,320
Those who are in the same boat with Xizhao

660
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,640
are still in the high-ranking temple.

661
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,160
If you don't get out of it,

662
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
there will be no peace in the world.

663
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,760
The past is like the present.

664
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,800
The world

665
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,640
has nothing to do with me.

666
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,360
Qingjiu.

667
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,280
If you can help the court to get rid of the enemy,

668
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,680
the government will spare your life.

669
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,920
The building is still in ruins.

670
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,760
Do you really not care about your own life?

671
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,720
They called me a murderer since I was a child.

672
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,680
They called me a murderer.

673
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,600
I've never been like a human.

674
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,840
I've long been a walking dead.

675
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,080
In this world,

676
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,080
only this person will be gentle to me.

677
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,040
And now,

678
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,160
everything is ruined.

679
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,640
Who do you think this person is?

680
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,160
Is it Zhuang Wenyuan?

681
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,640
Qingjiu.

682
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,960
Call the doctor now.

683
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,640
No need.

684
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,840
I have to go to poison myself.

685
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,600
This poison...

686
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,520
I have to get rid of it.

687
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:30,880
You know it's more poisonous than that.

688
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,040
Why do you still want to eat it?

689
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,720
Because...

690
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,960
This is the last thing

691
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
I can do for him.

692
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,240
Qingjiu.

693
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,360
I'm sorry.

694
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,360
I'll take a nap for a while.

695
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,800
I'll take a nap for a while.

696
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,440
My Lord.

697
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,920
All the observations of the food and drink

698
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,000
have been checked one by one.

699
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,320
There's nothing suspicious.

700
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,800
You can send the poisonous thing

701
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,320
to the prison in a sudden.

702
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,880
That's a great skill.

703
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,040
Qi Lang.

704
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,320
Did you find anything from the poison?

705
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,640
This poison is not a rare poison.

706
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,120
We haven't found anything yet.

707
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,480
Kill and kill.

708
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,360
Always trouble.

709
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,320
The person I've always wanted to protect

710
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,000
always wants to get rid of him.

711
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,840
Tomorrow, I'll tell the officials

712
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,640
about this in the court.

713
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,800
Anyway,

714
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,080
Xi Zhao was killed

715
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,120
except for the court's big trouble.

716
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,920
Thank you for your help these days.

717
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,240
How about this?

718
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,240
Tomorrow, you all come to the palace together.

719
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,480
I'll pay respect to you in front of the officials.

720
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,680
I just hope that my father can come back safely

721
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,480
and my brother's grievance can be forgiven.

722
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,960
The rest is not necessary.

723
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,400
Your Majesty,

724
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,240
please go back with us and let's behave ourselves.

725
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,520
I hope to see you again.

726
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,120
I can come back,

727
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,640
depend on you all.

728
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,320
Strange.

729
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,360
Come back when you see me.

730
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,600
OK.

731
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,240
Huiniu,

732
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,880
Please tell him to leave.

733
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,640
The deities will leave.

734
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,640
But you are the only one

735
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,640
I miss you every moment

736
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,640
But you are lost in my heart

737
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,640
I hear the sound of wind

738
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,640
I hear the sound of mountains

739
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,640
But you are the only one

740
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,640
I hear the sound of stars

741
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,640
I hear the sound of rain

742
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,640
But you are lost in my heart

743
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,640
Anyway

744
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Yu's murder case is finally exposed

745
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,640
He knows it

746
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
He will be clear

747
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
I just didn't expect

748
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
The government is unwilling to investigate it again

749
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
Zhuo Wenyuan is in a good position

750
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
You and Sang Qi have done a great job

751
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
But you only got a false report

752
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,640
You didn't get the marriage license

753
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
It's a shame

754
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,640
We have no evidence to prove that Zhuo Wenyuan is a spy

755
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
It's reasonable that the government doesn't want to investigate

756
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,640
Besides, Qi and I helped the Jinzhao's family to handle the case

757
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,640
We didn't do it for the reward

758
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
The government has agreed to release my father

759
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
Let's go to pick him up

760
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
Don't worry

761
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,640
The official's order didn't arrive in Yuzhou so soon

762
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
I will pick up the imperial bodyguards in person later

763
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
I promise the imperial bodyguards will be back to the mansion today

764
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,640
You go back and get ready

765
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
Take a good look at the imperial bodyguards

766
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
Ok

767
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Ok

768
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
Go

769
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
Qi

770
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
Qi

771
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,640
You are...

772
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
I'm making snacks for my father

773
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,640
So he can eat fresh snacks as soon as he comes back

774
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
In that case

775
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
I should show my gratitude

776
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
Let me help you

777
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
You know how to make snacks

778
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
I don't know

779
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
But I can learn

780
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,640
Miss

781
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
I am going to the kitchen to check the fire

782
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,640
I will go to check it

783
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,640
Ok

784
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Ok

785
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
I am going to check it

786
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
Ok

787
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,640
I am going to check it

788
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Ok

789
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,640
I am going to check it

790
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
Ok

791
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
I am going to check it

792
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,640
You wash your hands first

793
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,640
Take it

794
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
There is the cauldron

795
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,640
The cauldron is the bigger place for you

796
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Ok

797
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,640
I remember I saw people生活

798
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
It is like this

799
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
You are not so du EE

800
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,640
I can do it

801
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,640
I...

802
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,640
Look

803
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,640
You can push it open

804
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
Push it open

805
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
And keep kneading

806
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,640
Until you press it

807
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,120
you can just put this back

808
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,520
once you Gulf it again.

809
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,020
Then you positions it...

810
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,660
Is that right?

811
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:28,920
Am I right?

812
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,640
SHUGE

813
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,680
Episode 30

814
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm sorry.

815
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,280
I'm sorry.

816
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,080

I'm sorry.

824
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
I'm sorry.

825
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
I'm sorry.

826
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
I'm sorry.

827
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
I'm sorry.

828
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,800
