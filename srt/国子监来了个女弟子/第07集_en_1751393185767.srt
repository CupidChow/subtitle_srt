1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
I'm just like a rock

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,200
I don't regret it for the rest of my life

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,800
I miss the old days

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,000
I miss the youth

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,400
I miss the old days

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,800
I miss the youth

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,000
I miss the youth

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,600
I miss the youth

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,000
I miss the youth

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
I miss the youth

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,400
I miss the youth

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,200
I miss the youth

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:10,500
You can

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,960
Episode 17

15
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,260
I promised you.

16
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,860
Master.

17
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,160
統治斷壁

18
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,540
It hurts so much!

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,780
Master Si, it's hurt!

20
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't pretend! It doesn't work on me.

21
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,320
How could you

22
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,540
even try to當我騙游士?

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,820
This is a skill my dad gave me.

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,140
Who taught you

25
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,600
how to correctly mitigate

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,680
views

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,440
from unimportant people

28
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,100
that don't matter.

29
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,420
You can't learn to play the chess

30
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,620
even if you play against that master.

31
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,660
Deputy Chief, can you

32
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,060
let me go before you talk?

33
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,700
You just showed up and you want to learn martial arts?

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,980
You can't even beat me.

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,460
Who will teach you this talent?

36
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,660
It's a matter of whether I can learn it or not.

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,900
But I will definitely find the place.

38
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,700
Are you sure?

39
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,660
Because I think

40
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,420
he is the master sent by God.

41
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,260
Actually, I can't learn martial arts.

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,620
My father can teach me.

43
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,380
And we have a lot of soldiers from the Sang family.

44
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,340
But those are all moves for fighting.

45
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,220
I know that you are very good.

46
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,180
I also want to see if there are any other masters

47
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,460
who are better than you.

48
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,380
If I can find this master,

49
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,860
I can learn martial arts from him.

50
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,900
I can only be harmed.

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,380
I don't have to be so embarrassed.

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,300
If you are more careful in daily life,

53
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,820
you will not be in danger.

54
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,980
For example, don't be like now.

55
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,740
It's so late.

56
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,700
You are so late and you are so late.

57
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,300
If I don't come out,

58
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,380
how can I find the master?

59
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,460
It's a coincidence.

60
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,660
Deputy Chief, please protect me and go back.

61
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,980
It's really a bit dangerous.

62
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,220
I have protected you for so many times.

63
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,340
When did you protect me?

64
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,860
You heard it wrong.

65
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,020
I never protected you.

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,540
You were like this just now.

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,860
You are very beautiful.

68
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,820
Very beautiful?

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,100
Why are you not smiling again?

70
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,780
You know Dr. Feng, right?

71
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,780
I will teach you Dr. Feng.

72
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,060
His face

73
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,020
is almost on the ground.

74
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,780
Just like this.

75
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,260
His face.

76
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,500
Every time I see his face,

77
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,900
I remember how the word bitter gourd is written.

78
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,660
If you see his head shaking,

79
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,580
his face is red,

80
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,420
and his head is spinning like a sunflower,

81
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,940
he must be reciting poetry.

82
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,420
If he is not sure of his spinning,

83
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,340
and his eyebrows are still frowning,

84
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,300
like this,

85
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,700
he must be scolding me.

86
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,020
Sang Qi.

87
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,900
Sang Qi.

88
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,660
Sang Qi.

89
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,260
Sang Qi.

90
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:11,980
Sang Qi.

91
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,860
Do you know

92
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,940
all the ladies in Bianjing

93
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,540
are elegant and elegant.

94
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,420
Only you are so strange.

95
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,740
So you mean

96
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,740
this is the difference between us, right?

97
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,020
No.

98
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,700
Deputy Chief, remember to protect me.

99
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,740
Stop looking. He is not here.

100
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,220
I will go by myself.

101
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,620
There is a difference between us.

102
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,660
There is a difference.

103
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,220
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

104
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,580
I will invite you to the mansion to meet you another day.

105
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,020
Go back now.

106
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:09,940
Okay.

107
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,420
Go.

108
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,220
My legs are not comfortable.

109
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,940
Please give me a ride.

110
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,260
Why don't you go?

111
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,860
My father is afraid that I am in danger,

112
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,940
so he doesn't let me go out.

113
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,300
If I knock on the door and wake him up,

114
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,100
I don't know how much it costs.

115
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,820
The other one is a lot more expensive.

116
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,900
I am the Deputy Chief of the Imperial College.

117
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,220
Why should I do this kind of

118
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
sneaky thing with you?

119
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,580
Shui Wa.

120
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,180
Stop.

121
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,580
Hold me.

122
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,820
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

123
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,340
Deputy Chief,

124
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,940
why are you different from the people in the book?

125
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,940
I think the children in the book

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
are all

127
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,460
flying up in a second.

128
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,900
Why are you trying to be strong?

129
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,580
Are you a little short of kung fu?

130
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,380
What kind of book are you reading?

131
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,540
Aren't you the one who is reading it?

132
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,260
I really don't understand why

133
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,540
Yuxiu asked you to read that book.

134
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,580
If it were me,

135
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,020
I would have found you a book of Di Zi Gui

136
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,980
and let you read it.

137
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,820
I don't understand.

138
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,240
There is no turning back.

139
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,780
Give up.

140
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,620
Your way of turning back is

141
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,260
to drag your other leg

142
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,900
as Grand속 in the a place whose crown End Vanguard will caused you.

143
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,740
I can still be a noob if the throne buildings.

144
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,740
I'm gonna take it off.

145
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,860
You need in the carriers,

146
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,420
or I will give you half a human.

147
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,340
You.

148
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,380
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,460
Young Master.

150
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,060
Baishi, what are you thinking about?

151
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,020
Nothing.

152
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,900
I've been with you for years.

153
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,260
I've never seen you

154
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,180
being so devoted to a girl.

155
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,500
You came to visit her in person

156
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,780
and sent her home secretly.

157
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,900
Even Miss Su

158
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,220
doesn't treat you like that.

159
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,500
What nonsense are you talking about?

160
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,020
She's...

161
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,940
She's Yuxiu's sister.

162
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,380
How can I be careless?

163
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,820
Although you're right,

164
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,980
you've been

165
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,020
too worried recently.

166
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,380
You're different from before.

167
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,460
Baishi.

168
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,980
I haven't cared about you for a long time.

169
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,180
You're old enough.

170
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,140
Do you have a car?

171
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:34,860
Do you have a house?

172
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,100
Do you have a family

173
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,420
who wants to marry you?

174
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,460
Young Master, it's getting late.

175
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,020
Let's go back to the mansion.

176
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,900
Please, Young Master.

177
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,340
It's so beautiful.

178
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,700
It's so beautiful.

179
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,900
Lanji.

180
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,700
It's so beautiful.

181
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,460
It's so beautiful.

182
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,540
Look at the beautiful scenery.

183
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,900
Let's go.

184
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,020
I'll go with you.

185
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,900
I'll go with you.

186
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,820
Lan... Lanji.

187
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,300
What a coincidence.

188
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,540
I met Qi here.

189
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,860
Lanji,

190
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,220
is dinner ready?

191
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,100
That's great.

192
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,300
I...

193
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm not hungry.

194
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,780
Because last time,

195
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,020
you took me to the Qingquan Army for dinner.

196
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,220
Let me treat you this time.

197
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,860
It's also a return of the favor.

198
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,460
Okay?

199
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,380
Then...

200
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,340
I'll be Qi's friend.

201
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,660
I didn't have a chance

202
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,780
to talk to you alone before.

203
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,060
Wen Yuan, go back first.

204
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,220
Tell my mother

205
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,980
I'll have dinner with Qi tonight.

206
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,780
Don't wait for me.

207
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,580
Yes.

208
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,380
Okay.

209
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:57,460
Okay.

210
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,580
Please enjoy.

211
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,220
Thank you.

212
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,820
Yes.

213
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,460
So,

214
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,900
are you okay?

215
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,380
Your cold won't go away too.

216
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,900
But when will it go away?

217
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,300
He's 3 years when Lanji has not been in Bianjing for a while.

218
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,740
mans panics

219
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,220
But...

220
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,440
If he leaves,

221
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,620
he won't have anything to do in the world.

222
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,980
Can you tell me?

223
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,260
If you want to know this,

224
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,860
just listen to me.

225
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,580
When I just arrived in Bianjing,

226
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,220
I saw Deputy Chief's carriage.

227
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,220
So I stopped the carriage for him.

228
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,500
He didn't thank me.

229
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,420
Instead, he stared at me.

230
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,220
And that Jia Yin...

231
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,180
Guofeng.

232
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,020
Miss Sang

233
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,820
just told Miss Su about the pouch.

234
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,780
How dare she?

235
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,780
It's you.

236
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,300
So you and A Yin

237
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,420
have this kind of conflict.

238
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,220
No wonder he asked you to make a bet.

239
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,100
But I know

240
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,500
he is like this.

241
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,860
He may look cold and rude,

242
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,140
but if you really

243
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,620
get into a fight because of him,

244
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,700
he will never ignore you.

245
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,740
But I'm curious.

246
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,140
What made him

247
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,900
have this kind of temper?

248
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,220
Or

249
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,660
he has been like this since he was a kid?

250
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,820
Maybe not.

251
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,860
But he is really familiar.

252
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,660
Since I met him,

253
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,500
I think

254
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,260
he has always been like this.

255
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,740
You know

256
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,060
Yun Zhi's time is not long enough.

257
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,220
You don't know

258
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,500
his temperament.

259
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,860
If you are interested,

260
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,380
I will tell you

261
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,580
our experience later.

262
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,940
If only the two girls

263
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,980
could have such a good time.

264
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,180
I'm not afraid of suffocating you.

265
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,820
I shouldn't have come out with you today.

266
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,900
Lan, you can eat.

267
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,780
I'm full.

268
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,460
You should eat.

269
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,460
You are just a

270
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,220
naughty boy.

271
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,940
Thank you, Qi.

272
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,620
Qi is a

273
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,060
generous girl.

274
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,900
By the way, Lan,

275
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,820
we have been talking for a long time.

276
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,660
We have been talking about Siye.

277
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,660
I'm a little curious.

278
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,420
Don't say it.

279
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,860
You care about her so much.

280
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,940
Is it because you have a engagement

281
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,660
or you like each other?

282
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,100
It's...

283
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,580
I like her.

284
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,540
Why?

285
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,020
Although

286
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,500
she often faces others with a cold face,

287
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,820
she is not really honest.

288
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,660
It can even be said

289
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,260
that she is a careful and considerate person.

290
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,980
If someone does something unkind,

291
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,220
she will definitely be behind it

292
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,500
and make it perfect.

293
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,260
But she never says it.

294
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,820
But

295
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,420
that's her personality.

296
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,780
If she says it,

297
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,500
she is not Yan Yunzhi.

298
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,900
Are we talking about one person?

299
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,700
Or

300
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,300
she is just a playboy in Guo Zijian?

301
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,860
Although we have known each other for a long time,

302
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,820
I think I have a feeling for you.

303
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,420
In my eyes, Lan Jin

304
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,620
is gentle, virtuous, and talented.

305
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,780
She is a good girl

306
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,900
who deserves to be respected and loved.

307
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,380
Siye is also like that.

308
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,540
She is my brother's best friend.

309
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,860
She is my teacher.

310
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,900
But I have to remind you that

311
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,780
why can't you

312
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,300
like Yan Yunzhi?

313
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,660
I know it's a bit rude.

314
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,860
I mean

315
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,260
you can think about it again.

316
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,660
No, you just said it yourself.

317
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,460
Siye looks like

318
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,900
a brick.

319
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,580
It's like everyone owes her money.

320
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,060
But you should get to know her.

321
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,420
You are not even close to her.

322
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,820
She is more like a friend to you.

323
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,980
How naughty you are!

324
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,580
Lan Jin is so good at being angry.

325
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,340
She will definitely bully you.

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,980
After hearing you say that,

327
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,340
I have a feeling

328
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,300
that she is like that.

329
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,900
She seems to be a good girl,

330
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,780
but she can be annoying sometimes.

331
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,060
And...

332
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Let me tell you.

333
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,020
Siye is also...

334
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,580
What else?

335
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,740
Forget it.

336
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,580
It's not good to talk about others.

337
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,500
But it's okay to talk about us.

338
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,460
We will never change.

339
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,980
Siye likes to

340
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,980
set up traps.

341
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,860
She just likes to watch the fun.

342
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,340
You mean

343
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,260
Yunzhi

344
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,540
often pretends to be a person on purpose?

345
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,180
But

346
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,420
I was just guessing.

347
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,420
But Siye

348
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,580
looks like

349
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,780
a person.

350
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,060
But she is actually

351
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:22,980
very evil.

352
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,500
Lan Jin is such a good girl.

353
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,140
Don't let her get in the way.

354
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,340
Although I know

355
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,300
it's up to you.

356
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,420
I can only give you

357
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,780
a little advice

358
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,660
as a reference.

359
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,540
I thought

360
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,020
I would consider

361
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,140
Qi's advice.

362
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,020
But that's all.

363
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,900
I think

364
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,980
the young master of Zhuo

365
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,180
and the young master of Yan

366
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,580
are all very fashionable.

367
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,460
Which one is your favorite?

368
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,620
They two.

369
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,500
No, no, no.

370
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,260
They two.

371
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,860
Let me tell you.

372
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,540
Yan Yan

373
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,140
is like a goldfish.

374
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,700
The skin is golden.

375
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,460
It's quite tiring to eat.

376
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,060
It's easy to get a headache

377
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,060
if you drink too much.

378
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I can't even feel my bones.

379
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,100
I thought it was a taro.

380
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,060
It hurts.

381
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,580
Zhuo is like a roasted chicken.

382
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,380
It's crispy and tender.

383
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,580
It's a good dish.

384
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,100
But I've been eating it

385
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,020
since I was a kid.

386
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,940
After eating it for a long time,

387
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,420
I don't feel the taste anymore.

388
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,060
I don't feel anything.

389
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,820
Qi's analogy

390
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,100
is quite interesting.

391
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,100
What about

392
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,820
Yun Zhi?

393
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,780
If Yun Zhi

394
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,020
is a person you can consider,

395
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,020
how would you describe him?

396
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,100
Si Yi.

397
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
It's a sweet potato.

398
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,020
Sweet potato?

399
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:00,860
Yes.

400
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
Don't look at the things we just took.

401
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,860
Think about it carefully.

402
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,900
This sweet potato

403
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,820
is better than the sweet potato skin.

404
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,420
It's hard to feel it

405
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,140
even if you eat it for a long time.

406
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,900
It's the same as Si Yi.

407
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,540
It looks good on the surface.

408
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,580
You've been together for a long time.

409
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
It's heartwarming.

410
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,700
Let's go.

411
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,700
Qi,

412
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,060
I'm sorry.

413
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,980
I'm sorry.

414
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,660
You're really an interesting woman.

415
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,460
Thank you for the compliment.

416
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,220
I just don't know

417
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,420
how Yun Zhi will respond to you

418
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,940
if he knows you're so good at it.

419
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,140
He doesn't know.

420
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,660
How can he know?

421
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,860
It's just the two of us.

422
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,540
Please.

423
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,060
Let's go.

424
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,940
Yun Zhi.

425
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,780
You're here too?

426
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,620
Yes.

427
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,380
Si Yi.

428
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,300
What a coincidence.

429
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,580
You're here too.

430
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,140
Lan Jin and I are here too.

431
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,660
It's destiny.

432
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,820
We can meet each other here.

433
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,300
Where did you eat just now?

434
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,340
I didn't see you.

435
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,460
I'm right next to you.

436
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,060
I said I didn't see you.

437
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,660
This wall should be

438
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
a soundproof wall.

439
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,460
Oh, I just remembered

440
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,340
that I have something to do.

441
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,500
I'll leave first.

442
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,620
Please send Lan Jin back to the dorm.

443
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,820
What's the matter?

444
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,540
It's...

445
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,380
It's a bit urgent.

446
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,380
I'll be right back.

447
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,300
I'm leaving, Si Yi.

448
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,980
Let go of my foot.

449
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,060
Bai Shi.

450
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,180
Yes.

451
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,060
Let go of my foot.

452
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
I think that

453
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,100
Miss Sang has been studying hard recently.

454
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,140
Let go of my foot.

455
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,260
In the name of the Imperial College,

456
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,180
send a sweet potato to the house.

457
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,220
Please, Miss Sang.

458
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:09,980
Yes.

459
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,020
Sweet potato?

460
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,860
You're the one who's being cheated.

461
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,620
What?

462
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,580
I'm talking about

463
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,620
the sweet potato that

464
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,660
Miss Sang stole from me.

465
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,820
You're the one who's being cheated.

466
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
You're the one who's being cheated.

467
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
You're the one who's being cheated.

468
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
You're the one who's being cheated.

469
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,940
I'm watching for Yuxiong.

470
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,940
Thank you.

471
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,900
Bai Shi, send Miss Sang off.

472
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,660
Then...

473
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,660
I'll thank you.

474
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,420
Lan Jin.

475
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,100
I have something to tell you.

476
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,940
I finally made it.

477
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,540
I'm so happy that you found me.

478
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,340
I just want to show your gratitude.

479
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,380
Lan Jin,

480
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,620
thanks for youri b ziet background with the grey powder case.

481
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,540
Yuaneming, please, six distant language lessons,

482
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,060
do we still have to serving on pay?

483
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,420
We didn't have a marriage contract.

484
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,060
We've always been friends.

485
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,420
It was like this three years ago.

486
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,620
It's still the same now.

487
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,420
I hope

488
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,780
you won't waste your time on me.

489
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,340
And don't harm others.

490
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,660
For example, Sang Qi.

491
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,940
Sang Qi?

492
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,580
I just happened to see him.

493
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,740
It's just a coincidence

494
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,940
that you met him at the national gate.

495
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,140
Nanny laughs so hard.

496
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,700
Okay.

497
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
I know you do,

498
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
but to be honest,

499
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,220
these things are too much.

500
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,340
You said those words

501
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,060
three years ago.

502
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,180
I ran away from you

503
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,540
and stepped into your play.

504
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,540
I thought if I'm not by your side,

505
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,580
you would miss my interest.

506
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
You almost forgot about me.

507
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
In the end,

508
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,460
I'm still not good enough

509
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,420
and not worth being loved.

510
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,180
No.

511
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,420
It's not like that.

512
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,620
You don't have to slander yourself.

513
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
You said that

514
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,420
because I still have a chance?

515
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,300
Anji,

516
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,020
are you an outstanding woman?

517
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
Does it have anything to do with me liking you?

518
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,740
It's two different things.

519
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,700
You really don't care about

520
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,500
our friendship for so many years?

521
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,940
It's because I care about you.

522
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,220
That's why I have to make it clear.

523
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,420
Then let me ask you.

524
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,980
What's your feeling for Sang Qi?

525
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,300
Do you

526
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
like him?

527
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,300
I'm his teacher.

528
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,100
He's my student.

529
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,580
She's my old friend's sister.

530
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,060
That's all.

531
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,460
If that's all,

532
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,180
then you've done too many things you shouldn't have.

533
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,180
Although I only saw him three times

534
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,580
in the last few days,

535
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
I saw you

536
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,940
keep trying to change him.

537
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,940
The Yan Yun Zhi I know

538
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,380
hates to show up in public.

539
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,060
But because he's afraid of being exposed,

540
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,180
you were on stage

541
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,820
in public.

542
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,900
You don't like to talk to people.

543
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Even I

544
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,060
can't talk to you.

545
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,260
But Sang Qi

546
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,980
can talk to you.

547
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,820
You're the only one who can't let anyone else come.

548
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,660
You're not here,

549
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,220
but you dare to talk to Deputy Chief like that.

550
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,940
I saved you on stage last night.

551
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,980
If you had received the package earlier,

552
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,660
I wouldn't have bothered you to be on stage.

553
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,100
I've been back to the city for half a month.

554
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,060
I've seen too many of you

555
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,500
being close to each other.

556
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,140
If you don't like him,

557
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,860
and you only take care of him because of Yu Xiong's request,

558
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,980
then your behavior

559
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,380
is more than a normal relationship between a man and a woman.

560
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,140
If it were someone else,

561
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,260
I'm afraid you would have already set a trap behind him.

562
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,100
I can only tell you

563
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,140
for your own good.

564
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,380
You're a smart person.

565
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,260
You must understand what I mean.

566
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,300
Then,

567
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,540
I'll take my leave.

568
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,700
Let's go.

569
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,580
Here.

570
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,660
En.

571
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,020
See you another time.

572
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,020
No.

573
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,660
Prince.

574
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,000
What did Miss Su tell you?

575
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,540
There is something wrong.

576
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,920
Nothing. It's not important.

577
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,200
White serpent.

578
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:44,780
Here.

579
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,660
I have a friend.

580
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,100
He told me

581
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,180
that he felt like he was poisoned.

582
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,940
He couldn't control himself

583
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,340
to think of a girl.

584
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,500
That girl

585
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,940
was always in his mind.

586
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,540
She was walking around and not knowing where to go.

587
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,220
But that girl was actually quite strange.

588
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,980
But my friend

589
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,540
wanted to be with her.

590
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,020
He wanted to see her happy

591
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,020
and wanted to help her.

592
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,060
Did my friend die?

593
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,780
Young Master,

594
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,820
are you in love with Miss Sang?

595
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,860
Did I say that?

596
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,940
Did I say that it was Sang Qi?

597
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,140
Young Master,

598
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,380
I can see

599
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,660
your concern for Sang Qi every day.

600
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:33,980
Don't talk nonsense.

601
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,340
How could I like her?

602
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,740
She is a very strange girl.

603
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,540
She is naughty and mischievous.

604
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,500
She loves to make trouble with you.

605
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,380
She never knows what she is going to do in the next episode.

606
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,060
She is a stubborn girl.

607
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,060
She doesn't listen to the instructions.

608
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,620
She is so stubborn.

609
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
Every time she makes up her mind,

610
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,660
she is so stubborn.

611
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,940
How could I like her?

612
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
How could I like her?

613
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,020
Why are you still here?

614
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,940
Young Master, I'm leaving.

615
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,580
Hyun Wu,

616
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,700
who do you thinkäng

617
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,180
ī

618
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,600
offered is me?

619
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:37,900
Rather than

620
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,820
setting up a trap,

621
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,300
don't you think

622
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,860
I can't believe

623
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,500
I can't find this person

624
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,900
for such a big Guo Zijian.

625
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,260
Sang Yu, don't be like this.

626
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,100
If I do anything wrong,

627
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,300
just do it.

628
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,100
Come on.

629
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,500
Mr. Yan,

630
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,780
why are you saying this?

631
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,780
I'm begging you.

632
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,220
How can I force you to do it?

633
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,740
I'm not that bad.

634
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,100
I know you have a lot of ways

635
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,460
to find out something.

636
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,620
You...

637
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,140
I...

638
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,700
I...

639
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,300
I...

640
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,940
I...

641
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,700
I...

642
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,300
I...

643
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,900
I...

644
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,500
I...

645
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,100
I...

646
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,700
I...

647
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,300
I...

648
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:44,900
I...

649
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,500
Do you know anyone?

650
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,300
You can find Zhou Wenyuan.

651
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,500
She's going to be in charge of the situation.

652
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,700
If she's a woman,

653
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,900
I'll definitely find her.

654
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,300
But I'm looking for an old man.

655
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,500
It's not within her ability.

656
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,300
Sang Qi.

657
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
Really?

658
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,700
So you want me?

659
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
What are you talking about?

660
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,700
I'm looking for my savior.

661
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,700
And I'll find her to learn from her.

662
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,100
The master you saved the day you were stabbed?

663
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,100
Yes.

664
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,300
I remember that night,

665
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,100
there was no one else but you.

666
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,900
And I didn't hear about this person

667
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,500
in Bianjing.

668
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,500
Did you have a stroke?

669
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,300
No, you had a stroke.

670
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,100
I heard her talking.

671
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,900
How could it be my imagination?

672
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,700
If you don't want to help,

673
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,700
forget it.

674
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,300
Wait.

675
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,700
I know a place.

676
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
It's a secret place.

677
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,300
I'll take you there later.

678
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
And I'll ask someone.

679
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
What place?

680
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,300
Qingfeng Restaurant.

681
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,500
Goodbye.

682
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,700
Don't leave now.

683
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,900
This is not a Qingfeng Restaurant.

684
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,900
I know you always eat and drink there.

685
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,700
But have you ever heard of the top floor of Qingfeng Restaurant?

686
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,500
There's a heaven above.

687
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,100
It's a big open field.

688
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,900
I'm going to the heaven.

689
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
I'll wait for you.

690
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,500
Okay.

691
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,900
Miss,

692
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,100
you're not tired of seeing this scene every day?

693
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,500
I don't know how many times I have to come here a month.

694
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
How can I not be tired of it?

695
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,300
Master Sang.

696
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,100
Let's go.

697
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:39,900
Okay.

698
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,900
You don't welcome me?

699
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,900
Welcome.

700
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
I'll treat you to a meal.

701
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,500
Just eat.

702
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,300
Let's go.

703
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,300
Please.

704
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,300
Be careful, Master Sang.

705
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,100
Please.

706
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,500
Please come in.

707
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,900
It's the same as downstairs.

708
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,900
Men and women are not afraid.

709
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,900
The old and young are all welcome.

710
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
Even if it's your first time here,

711
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
you don't have to be afraid.

712
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
I guarantee you will feel like a turtle.

713
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,700
Master Sang,

714
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,900
look at this.

715
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,500
Men and women are not afraid.

716
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,700
The top floor of Qingfeng Restaurant

717
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,100
is the most open place in the whole Bianjing.

718
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,700
You don't have to be nervous.

719
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,900
You don't have to be angry.

720
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,100
Just go with me to pick a coin

721
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,100
and spend more money.

722
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Listen to the music.

723
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,900
The musicians of men and women

724
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
who talk about books and even serve people

725
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,100
are all the distribution centers of the news.

726
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,700
As long as you see more,

727
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,300
I guarantee you will want more.

728
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,900
I, Yan Xiaoyue,

729
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,700
am a good person here.

730
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,100
If I ask for help,

731
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,700
I will find a way.

732
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,900
Let's go.

733
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Please come in.

734
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,500
Please.

735
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,300
Miss Qianjiu,

736
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,100
it's been a long time.

737
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,100
How are you?

738
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,700
Master Sang,

739
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,100
we are so lucky today.

740
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,100
No, thank you.

741
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
We met the top girl.

742
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,900
What a pity.

743
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,100
It's okay.

744
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
We will come again.

745
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,300
Yan Xiaoyue,

746
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,300
wipe your saliva quickly.

747
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,100
We will come again.

748
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,100
I...

749
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,300
Miss Qianjiu.

750
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,700
There is no patterned tattoo.

751
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,900
It seems that I was wrong that night.

752
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,700
Master Sang,

753
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,700
you are so hidden.

754
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,700
You even said that you didn't know

755
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,500
what's different upstairs.

756
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,100
You even knew Miss Qianjiu.

757
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,700
Zhou Wenyuan,

758
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,100
Brother Zhuo has brought you here.

759
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,100
Brother Zhuo is really a generous person.

760
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,500
He has been in charge of official affairs for such a long time.

761
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,700
He should

762
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,700
organize a card game and play mahjong.

763
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,300
Life is so good.

764
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,100
Miss Sang Qi,

765
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,100
why are you dressed up like this today

766
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,900
to experience life here?

767
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,700
Is this also a task

768
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,700
of the Imperial College?

769
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,300
Miss Qianjiu, you are joking.

770
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,300
I am here for a personal matter.

771
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,300
I want to find out the identity of the old man in white.

772
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,100
Grandpa said that this place is

773
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,900
the center of the news.

774
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,100
So I am thinking

775
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,700
if there will be some life here.

776
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,100
I wish Miss Sang Qi

777
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,300
can find the person she wants.

778
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,300
Thank you.

779
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,100
Miss Qianjiu,

780
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,500
you must be the one

781
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,700
with the most connections.

782
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,900
If you want to find out the news,

783
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,300
who can be more suitable than you?

784
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Miss, don't blame me.

785
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,500
Miss, don't blame me.

786
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
We will pay you

787
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,900
as you want.

788
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,700
I just want to talk to you.

789
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,500
Dear guests,

790
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,700
it's not that we don't do your business.

791
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,300
It's that we already have a guest.

792
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,100
We are really in different places.

793
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Mrs. Zhang, it's okay.

794
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,500
If you don't mind,

795
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,900
I can handle it.

796
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,100
Please.

797
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,300
She can handle this?

798
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,900
We are three people.

799
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,900
Brother Zhuo.

800
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,900
So the guest Miss Qianjiu mentioned

801
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,900
is Brother Zhuo.

802
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,900
Deputy Chief.

803
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,900
Wait.

804
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,300
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

805
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,100
So Deputy Chief

806
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,700
looks so serious.

807
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,500
He actually came to this kind of place.

808
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,700
Deputy Chief.

809
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,500
When we were in Xianxia,

810
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,300
we were walking around.

811
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,500
It's understandable.

812
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,900
You secretly came to drink with Miss Qianjiu.

813
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,300
You are wrong.

814
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,300
First,

815
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,900
you failed her good intentions.

816
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,700
Second,

817
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,900
you stole Zhuo Wen Yuan's new number.

818
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:52,900
Right?

819
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,500
Miss Sang Qi, don't say that.

820
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,900
I have nothing to do with Mr. Zhuo.

821
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,300
Although people are saying

822
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,300
I will be Mr. Zhuo's concubine,

823
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,700
Mr. Zhuo didn't agree to it.

824
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
I didn't agree to it either.

825
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,700
Qianjiu, are you trying to make a deal with me?

826
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,700
It's a business.

827
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,300
Mr. Zhuo.

828
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,100
It's not impossible.

829
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,300
We just need to talk according to my principles.

830
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,100
We need to pay more.

831
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,700
It's a small matter.

832
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,300
Can I get the bid?

833
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,500
If it's you,

834
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,100
I'm afraid I can't get the whole Taishi Mansion.

835
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,300
I may not agree to it either.

836
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,500
Deputy Chief.

837
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,700
You haven't answered me yet.

838
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,900
I should ask you.

839
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,300
Why are you here?

840
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,100
Me?

841
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
To inquire about the information.

842
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,700
I have to find out

843
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,500
the identity of the White Cloak Tower.

844
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,700
You haven't found it out yet?

845
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,500
I can't.

846
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,900
I need to find it out.

847
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,100
I need to learn martial arts and protect the Sang family.

848
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,100
Can you find it?

849
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,100
I'm not done yet.

850
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,100
I'm sorry. It's yours.

851
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
Miss Sang Qi.

852
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,900
Can you describe it in detail?

853
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Maybe Qianjiu can help you.

854
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,500
This is a

855
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,300
mysterious and powerful White Cloak Tower.

856
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,700
It's invisible and unrecognizable.

857
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,500
But it always appears

858
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
when I need it most.

859
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,700
It's so stupid.

860
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,100
But I don't justify it.

861
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,300
I'm just naming it.

862
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Could you please tell me

863
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,100
the background of this video?

864
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,900
What idea do you have?

865
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,300
It's a simple and subtle description.

866
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,300
Miss Qianjiu,

867
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,900
you can get the Vault of画.

868
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,200
That's the dream come true.

869
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,500
I've drawn a picture of you

870
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,100
to let you makeup.

871
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,980
Hold it.

872
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,600
What kind of attitude is this?

873
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
Being more strict?

874
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,120
This is a painting

875
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,460
that placed the spirit of the figure.

876
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,280
Are you sure this is a painting

877
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,800
Deputy Chief, your eyes are...

878
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,760
Your eyes are so pretty.

879
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,200
I admit that I'm a bit too pretty

880
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,840
except for Gu Zijun.

881
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,840
But you have to admit that

882
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,880
this is a painting that can't be replaced.

883
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,840
Look.

884
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,480
The perfect head shape

885
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,520
and his cool figure

886
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,840
completely capture this character.

887
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,080
It has the most vitality

888
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,720
and the most variable place.

889
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,160
You're lying.

890
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,280
Did you feel it?

891
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,280
It's pretty.

892
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,640
Think about it.

893
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,280
I really didn't feel it.

894
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,720
Let's pretend that we didn't see this joke today.

895
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,720
I can't let others know

896
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,880
that Gu Zijun's body shape

897
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,720
is so good at painting.

898
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
Miss Qian Jiu,

899
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,040
sorry to bother you today.

900
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,600
We'll take our leave now.

901
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,520
You guys,

902
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
get up.

903
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,800
I'm sorry, Miss Jiu.

904
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,480
I really didn't see it.

905
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,160
Like this.

906
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:09,840
Like this.

907
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,680
And a knife.

908
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,240
Thank you.

909
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,880
You've already got the news here.

910
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,360
Have you ever thought about

911
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,960
asking the real people who have ideas?

912
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,320
The real people who have ideas?

913
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,520
Who?

914
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,520
Who is so powerful?

915
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,200
It's far away,

916
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,400
but it's close to me.

917
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,080
Yes.

918
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
The biggest one in the country.

919
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,520
Dr. Feng.

920
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,960
Yes.

921
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,240
Dr. Feng is more experienced than Yan Yan.

922
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,160
Why should I listen to you?

923
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,280
Why should I come to this place with you?

924
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,040
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

925
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,640
Yes.

926
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,720
It's Dr. Feng.

927
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,760
Let's go.

928
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,640
Qian.

929
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,640
Yan Yan.

930
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,320
Take Lian Pian back.

931
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,160
I'll send Song Qi.

932
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,640
Aren't we going our own way?

933
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,800
Besides, we're from the same family.

934
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,880
Mrs. Yan doesn't know

935
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,080
that you're here, right?

936
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,400
Miss Lian Pian,

937
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,480
come with me.

938
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,240
I'll take you home safely.

939
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,800
Let's go.

940
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,640
Take your time.

941
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,520
Take your time.

942
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,200
Let's go.

943
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,560
Let's go.

944
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,120
Miss.

945
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,040
Miss, I...

946
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,000
I'll take you home safely.

947
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Let's go.

948
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,800
Why do you want to get rid of them?

949
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,360
What you said just now

950
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,440
is true.

951
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,880
Which one?

952
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,680
The one you said about me.

953
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,640
Every word I said is true.

954
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,880
You really don't care about it?

955
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,320
Zhu Wen Yuan,

956
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,720
I'm just kidding.

957
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,640
Besides, this is your private matter.

958
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,400
I'm not qualified to comment on it.

959
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,800
Besides,

960
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,120
you don't have such a private matter, right?

961
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
I think Miss Qian Yue is a good person.

962
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,600
If you're willing to accept her,

963
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,360
it's also your blessing.

964
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,440
Come on.

965
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,160
Let's go.

966
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,440
I can't understand it for half a day.

967
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,960
You're really familiar with it.

968
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,960
Young Master.

969
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,080
You've drawn it like this.

970
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,800
Can you tell who drew it?

971
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,400
If it's the person I thought it was,

972
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,640
it's still Sang Qi's blessing.

973
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,360
But if it's her,

974
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,960
it's hard to handle.

975
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,480
Don't think of a way.

976
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,320
In my opinion, Young Master,

977
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,320
you're single-minded to Miss Sang.

978
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,920
You've put so much effort into it.

979
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,160
She might not know anything.

980
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,360
I don't want that.

981
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,880
Today, I went to test that Qian Jiu.

982
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,520
Either she has high martial arts and is very skilled,

983
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,640
or she's really a commoner.

984
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
We need to investigate it carefully.

985
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,480
But if Sang Qi is her friend,

986
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,160
it's still risky.

987
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,320
And that Zhu Wen Yuan.

988
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,880
She also has a deep love for Sang Qi.

989
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,720
But she can be so kind to Sang Qi

990
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,240
that she can be so kind to Sang Qi

991
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,600
and be so kind to her.

992
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,400
Yes.

993
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,840
Did you hear the question?

994
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,720
Yes.

995
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,800
She's also very affectionate.

996
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,720
It sounds like a little bit.

997
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,200
Is this the point I'm talking about?

998
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,120
You've learned a lot recently.

999
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,360
Young Master.

1000
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,760
I should improve

1001
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,720
by going to the Imperial College with you.

1002
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,760
The most important thing

1003
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,520
is to ensure Sang Qi's safety.

1004
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:50,840
We need to find a place to settle her down.

1005
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,840
At the same time, we need to train her

1006
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,800
without any trouble

1007
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,000
and practice her martial arts.

1008
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,440
If she has such problems again,

1009
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,080
it will be easy to protect herself.

1010
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,720
When fate begins to tell,

1011
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,000
when it ends,

1012
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,880
I'm willing to use this life

1013
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,320
to exchange for a lifetime of love.

1014
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,360
With a thousand worries,

1015
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,480
leave me a place.

1016
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,280
If it's the persistence of love,

1017
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,120
we've deepened our love for each other.

1018
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,840
If it's the persistence of love,

1019
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,920
we've deepened our love for each other.

1020
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,640
If it's the persistence of love,

1021
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,440
I'll have this lifetime for each time.

1022
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,440
If ten years become nine,

1023
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,320
it'll become my long-term goal.

1024
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,080
My long-term goal.

1025
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,080
I can never be unknown.

1026
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,320
I'll ignore this perfect story.

1027
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,320
I'll be the unyielding look in the wind.

1028
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,840
My heart is in a lonely city.

1029
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:14,160
It's changed its beginning and lost its place.

1030
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,560
If it's the persistence of love,

1031
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,200
I'll write down my love's words.

1032
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,520
I'll have this lifetime for each time.

1033
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,880
When the love begins to fade,

1034
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,880
it'll become our deep kiss.

1035
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,920
When the love begins to fade,

1036
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,600
it'll become our deep kiss.
