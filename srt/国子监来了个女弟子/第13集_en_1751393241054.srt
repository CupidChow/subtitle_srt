1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
Someone is smiling

2
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,960
The blue god is playing a joke

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,400
The red god is going to be your partner

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:44,840
The red god is like a

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,360
The moon shines on the white year

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
The moon shines on the white year

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,920
The moon shines on the white year

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,160
The moon shines on the white year

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,640
The moon shines on the white year

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,120
The moon shines on the white year

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,760
He left a story

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,640
This life is like the spirit of the water

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,520
Who is the true lover

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,820
Rain and green phoenix water

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,240
Rod is not used to shaking

16
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,600
To light the fire

17
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,800
Reagan is a last year

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Text Nhip

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,160
Episode 27

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,640
What are...

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,680
Who told you to...

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,220
Ro하 valuable

23
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,580
Hurry up

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,900
Lie down

25
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,580
Come

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Don't talk.

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,200
Say whatever you want.

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,200
Don't make me cry.

29
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,720
You've crushed my hair.

30
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,200
You're so annoying.

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,760
Why are you here, Deputy Chief?

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,440
I'm a little drunk.

34
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,120
I'm here to get some tea.

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,400
It's a wine.

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm actually curious

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,760
why we always drink

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,960
when we're together.

39
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,280
I don't dare to write a script.

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,640
It's not a coincidence.

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,480
It's destiny.

42
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,760
Destiny?

43
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,680
Qi.

44
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,160
Qi.

45
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Zheng Yu?

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,720
You go first.

47
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,800
Why are you here?

48
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
Nothing. Let's go.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,080
Let's go. Go back.

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,160
Deputy Chief is here too?

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,160
You two...

52
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,320
Deputy Chief said he was a little drunk

53
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,120
and wanted to get some wine.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,920
I'm just passing by.

55
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,680
Really?

56
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,240
It seems Deputy Chief is really drunk.

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
But it's better

58
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,800
to ask the villagers to do something like this.

59
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,400
You two are in the Taifu Mansion.

60
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,480
It's not right.

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,400
There's no one here. Let's go.

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,720
If others find out,

63
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,240
they'll think you're here to steal.

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
That's right. Let's go.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,440
Let's go to pick it.

66
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,680
He Yini,

67
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,460
before Y graduating fromwide explore,

68
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,800
please be a good lover.

69
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,940
I'll leave the job to you.

70
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:33,980
Your Highness.

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,180
Yuchan.

72
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,720
Yuchan.

73
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,720
Grand VPN has suddenly

74
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,800
come to find me,

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,060
this is what I should do.

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,440
Network noite.

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,000
Young Master.

79
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,920
Any response?

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,520
Young Master.

81
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,040
Lord Yan said he'll do his best to cooperate with you.

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,200
It's time to solve the mystery.

83
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,720
Everyone.

84
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,720
Let's go to the tea garden tomorrow.

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,800
Great!

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,640
Tea garden farmers!

87
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,240
Zhong Yu.

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,400
They're just tea garden farmers.

89
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,080
If they didn't graduate,

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,320
why are they so happy?

91
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,840
As long as they don't have to go to class,

92
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,640
they can always be in good health.

93
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
Just take it as a reminder of the graduation.

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,040
I don't understand.

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,080
There are many holidays in the room.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,040
Besides, the field trip is just over.

97
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,040
I don't know what to do.

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,320
You don't understand.

99
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,680
This is different from the holiday.

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,440
I wanted to go to the exam before

101
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
and study hard in the classroom.

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,960
I didn't expect to play for a few days in a hurry.

103
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,440
Right?

104
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,120
Yes!

105
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,880
Now that you mention it,

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm really happy.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
Don't be too happy.

108
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,400
This time, I didn't ask you to go to the tea garden

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,920
to have fun.

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,480
I asked you to experience the hardships of the farmers.

111
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,680
I'm sorry for the loss of your efforts.

112
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,320
Go home and rest early today.

113
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,560
You'll be more energetic.

114
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,040
We'll set off tomorrow morning.

115
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,600
Yes!

116
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,880
Everybody get ready!

117
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,240
Go!

118
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,160
Let's go!

119
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,120
Hurry up to pack the stuff.

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,920
Pack again?

121
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,760
Don't forget to bring it.

122
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,520
You have to bring everything you need.

123
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,800
You can have this plan!

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,280
This must work.

125
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Bring it!

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,680
We're going to stay here.

127
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,280
That's right.

128
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,560
Over here.

129
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
Come on.

130
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,440
Slow down.

131
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,440
Brother Song.

132
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,880
Brother Song just got married.

133
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,840
I'm staying in the mansion with my wife.

134
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,480
Why do you have to work hard

135
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,800
and suffer all by yourself?

136
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,760
It's not easy for the Imperial College to gather together.

137
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,600
It's more interesting than in the mansion.

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,720
Don't worry.

139
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
The Chayuan of the Song family is also in the mountain.

140
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,000
Changgong can take out money anytime.

141
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,320
He won't be tired of us.

142
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,400
Besides,

143
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,680
Deputy Chief can really make it.

144
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,320
It's a joke.

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,760
Catch it.

146
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,400
Don't just look at this door after you go up the mountain.

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,000
Take care of the lady for me.

148
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
And take care of yourself.

149
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,400
Don't worry.

150
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,880
Qi.

151
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,040
Catch it.

152
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,800
I brought you some cake.

153
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,320
I bought it for you when you took a bath.

154
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,280
Mr. Zhuo, you came all the way here to buy this?

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,920
Not only that.

156
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,320
I have a lot of good things on my car.

157
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's go to the same city together later.

158
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,560
Can I go with you?

159
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,760
What does it have to do with you?

160
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
This is so interesting.

161
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,880
You'd better keep it for yourself.

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,000
Deputy Chief is here.

163
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,200
Come on.

164
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,000
Keep your things.

165
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,720
Come on.

166
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,960
Come on.

167
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,400
You can't take unnecessary things with you

168
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
when you work here.

169
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,440
What?

170
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,240
We can't take these things?

171
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,040
Besides,

172
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,920
the journey is not far.

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,520
You can go up the mountain

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
and practice your new habits.

175
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,000
Isn't this for us?

176
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
I brought so many things for nothing.

177
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,280
Gentlemen,

178
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,920
please keep the things you can't take with you.

179
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,040
I will keep them for you.

180
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,080
Go.

181
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,080
Go.

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
We didn't bring them for nothing.

183
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,160
Right.

184
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,120
Forget it.

185
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,760
That's it.

186
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,360
Right?

187
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,920
Yes.

188
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,840
Look.

189
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,280
Qi.

190
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,280
Qi.

191
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,920
Zheng Qi.

192
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,920
Are you okay?

193
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,760
Yan Yan.

194
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,640
Are you okay, Qi?

195
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,200
No.

196
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,440
Get up.

197
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,000
Qi.

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,640
It hurts.

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,720
It hurts.

200
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
Can you walk?

201
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,760
No, you can't walk anymore.

202
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,520
I'll carry you.

203
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,240
Yan Xiang Lang.

204
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,400
Your leg injury just healed.

205
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,800
Let me do it.

206
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,280
I often carry you in the competition.

207
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,440
I often carry you.

208
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,760
So it's time for me to repay you.

209
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm injured.

210
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,640
I can't carry you.

211
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,440
Deputy Chief.

212
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,400
You don't ask if Sang Qi is willing to do it.

213
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,440
It's not easy to take the road.

214
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,880
It's a deep mountain and a deep water.

215
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,960
You didn't prepare for the trouble.

216
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
What if you're weak and something happens?

217
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Do you want Sang Qi to get hurt again?

218
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,040
You...

219
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,760
Right.

220
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,000
Deputy Chief is right.

221
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,440
If you get hurt,

222
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,520
it will be more troublesome.

223
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
Right, Deputy Chief?

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,720
Let's go.

225
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,120
Let's keep on chasing.

226
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,400
Right, Deputy Chief.

227
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,080
The hundred years under the moon

228
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,640
The light shines on the sky

229
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,920
The moon shines on the sky

230
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,320
The stars shine on the sky

231
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,720
The sun shines on the sky

232
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,640
The sound of the zither is like the sound of the water

233
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
The world is complete

234
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,240
Everyone

235
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,560
Later

236
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,280
You will live in the room with the number on the sign

237
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
After you arrive at the room today, you can rest well

238
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,480
Tomorrow we will start working

239
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,280
Okay

240
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,680
Okay

241
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,520
Hurry up and draw

242
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
Yeah

243
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Look at yours

244
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,360
Sang Qi, don't worry.

245
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
You're a woman.

246
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,760
You can live alone.

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,960
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

248
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,640
Yan Xiao Lang and Yi Lian are so close.

249
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,200
I've already drawn a pair with Song Luo Tian and Wei Zhan Hong.

250
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,480
Zhou Xiu,

251
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,000
how about we switch?

252
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,560
I can't help you.

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I haven't drawn yet.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,960
I really hope I can draw

255
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,480
fifty pairs that look like Qi's.

256
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,760
You don't know that

257
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,000
the mountain is so vast.

258
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,320
The bandits might be in charge in the middle of the night.

259
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,560
I can protect her.

260
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,960
You can protect her.

261
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,480
Zhou Wen Yuan.

262
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
You and I will live together.

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,520
I'll set up another rule.

264
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,360
No one can break in the night.

265
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Wei Zhan Hong will be punished.

266
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,080
How about this?

267
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,880
Lin Xiao Lang,

268
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
I'll let you change your room.

269
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,680
Forget it.

270
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,440
I'll just live with Song Luo Tian.

271
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't you want to live with Song Luo Tian?

272
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,840
Song Luo Tian is better

273
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,360
than Si Ye.

274
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,400
Let's go find Sang Qi.

275
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:32,960
Let's go.

276
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,080
Go.

277
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
This one, Zhou Xiu.

278
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,680
Si Ye is really a man of his word.

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,360
He said he would train us.

280
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,880
He is so hard-working.

281
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,680
But he arranged such a good room for us.

282
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,200
Even the rouge powder is ready.

283
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,880
All the rooms in this room

284
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,200
are all made of rouge powder.

285
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,440
I'm a little tired.

286
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,640
I need to take a break.

287
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,040
Why don't you go back first?

288
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Go back.

289
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,240
Yan Yan, I'm telling you.

290
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,160
If you don't go back,

291
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,040
Song Luo Tian will eat all the fruit.

292
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,200
Let's go.

293
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,880
Fruit.

294
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,000
My fruit.

295
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,000
Goodbye.

296
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,320
Goodbye.

297
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,520
Si Ye, I want to talk to you.

298
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,320
What?

299
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,960
Let's talk.

300
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,320
Si Ye is a man of his word.

301
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,680
He has done so much for us.

302
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
Aren't you afraid that he will be too hard on you?

303
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm not afraid.

304
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,840
I can do everything

305
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,880
without any regret.

306
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,320
Si Ye is really a man of his word.

307
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,880
You are, too.

308
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,880
Do you think

309
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,360
Qi will choose you?

310
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,080
I don't know.

311
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,480
I'll do my best.

312
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,760
And as Si Ye?

313
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,760
You mean

314
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,280
you want to compete fairly?

315
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,840
Okay.

316
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,200
Okay.

317
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,240
I'm going to bed.

318
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,640
Go to sleep.

319
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,160
I don't know.

320
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,040
I hope you would let me have a chance.

321
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,160
Nothing to do.

322
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,200
Ihr щ�問我,

323
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:51,740
Take your

324
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,720
救我

325
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,440
I don't know what time is it.

326
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,880
Go.

327
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,360
You won't make it.

328
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,400
Your condition is very bad.

329
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,400
Who�

330
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,160
Come on.

331
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,400
Hello, Deputy Chief.

332
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
Hello, Deputy Chief.

333
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,520
We're going to start working officially from today.

334
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,760
You're not students here.

335
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,880
You're tea slaves.

336
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,400
Three meals a day.

337
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,600
All the rules

338
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,320
must be followed by the tea garden.

339
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,200
What we're going to do today

340
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,680
is to remove weeds,

341
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,200
clear the soil and pick tea.

342
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,120
We'll arrange for everyone to have tea in the afternoon.

343
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
If anyone doesn't understand,

344
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,120
the tea farmers are here.

345
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,440
They'll give you instructions.

346
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,600
Your tools are here.

347
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,400
Come and get them.

348
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,960
Thank you.

349
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,040
Are you going, Deputy Chief?

350
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,280
As a teacher,

351
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,200
you should be more careful.

352
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,860
Help me clean up.

353
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,520
It's dirty when you're eating.

354
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,400
Come and get it!

355
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,920
Hurry.

356
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,200
Hurry up.

357
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,600
I can only Sci-Fi

358
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,160
if I was young andén dictated

359
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
An example has been지가

360
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,000
For a person guys

361
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,160
you can offer whatever you want

362
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
Everyone is fast. Where did you learn it?

363
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,000
Brother Zuo, you're so fast.

364
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,400
Yes, Brother Zuo, you're so fast.

365
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,240
Over there.

366
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,240
You're so neat.

367
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Three days later

368
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,560
Sang Qi, put it down.

369
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,480
It's okay.

370
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,200
You're still hurt.

371
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't force yourself to do such a heavy work.

372
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,000
Put it down.

373
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,960
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

374
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,160
An Qi,

375
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,760
let's go to the cold room upstairs to rest.

376
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

377
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,880
Hold my hand, okay?

378
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,000
All right, I'm here.

379
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,080
Master Inuyi.

380
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,640
Why bother?

381
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,200
It's your work.

382
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
Master Inuyi.

383
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,400
In my opinion,

384
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
I guess his mind every day.

385
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,640
It's so bad to make him feel so haggard.

386
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
It's not the time yet.

387
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,320
When we find out the truth about Song's family,

388
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,880
I'll make it clear to him

389
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
after I solve the problem.

390
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,600
Baishi,

391
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,240
we have to be careful in the daytime.

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,720
We'll start investigating at night.

393
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes, Mr. Kong.

394
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
What's in your hand?

395
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,440
Nothing.

396
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,800
Anything else?

397
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,680
No.

398
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,320
Really?

399
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,520
What's this?

400
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,320
Give it to me.

401
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,000
After I30 minutes.

402
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,080
farming

403
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,100
farming

404
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,680
farming

405
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,260
farming

406
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,300
Eventually.

407
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:39,840
requested

408
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,040

409
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,260

410
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:40,860
requested

411
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,520

summon

413
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,960
We're Qin's family.

414
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,440
No.

415
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,240
Mr. and Mrs. Bai actually

416
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,700
like

417
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,480
We are.

418
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,200
no.

419
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,080
no.

420
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,600
what

421
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,800
We're business.

422
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,660
Lets go.

423
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,660
You've worked hard.

424
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
Eat it yourself.

425
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,380
I have some too.

426
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Sang Qi.

427
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,220
Guess who's here?

428
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,740
Li Yantian is here.

429
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,940
How did you know?

430
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,820
Of course I know.

431
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,660
I know this box.

432
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,260
And

433
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,780
you're smiling.

434
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,100
I know who it is.

435
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,540
Li Yantian is here to deliver some food.

436
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Where is he?

437
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
He's waiting in the lotus pond.

438
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,180
My lady.

439
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,020
You've done enough work this afternoon.

440
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
You should go to bed.

441
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,540
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

442
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:37,500
Let's go.

443
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Let's go.

444
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,180
Let's go.

445
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,180
Hurry.

446
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
Li Yantian.

447
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
My lady.

448
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:47,780
Look.

449
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,180
I've prepared a lot of snacks for you.

450
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
There's tea.

451
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,300
My lady, have some tea.

452
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
Lin Pei.

453
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,700
You're here to see me.

454
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,900
The snacks I brought

455
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,700
are all from Yan Xiang Lang.

456
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Isn't this his work?

457
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,100
I brought some for him too.

458
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,500
You brought some too?

459
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,900
They're all his favorites.

460
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,300
None of them are my favorites.

461
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
My goodness.

462
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,900
I'll bring more for you next time.

463
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Okay.

464
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
I'll go now.

465
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
Bye.

466
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
My lady.

467
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
Don't be mad.

468
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
Don't be mad.

469
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
By the way,

470
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,900
why didn't I see Mr. Zhuo today?

471
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Zhu An Yuan.

472
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
You did a good job with the grass.

473
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,700
But the tea you picked

474
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,900
is really bad.

475
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,300
The tea you picked

476
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,300
is not that good.

477
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,900
It's not bad as mine.

478
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,300
You don't know

479
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,100
the details and details.

480
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Deputy Chief.

481
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,900
The tea you picked

482
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,500
is just average.

483
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
That's all.

484
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,300
When picking tea,

485
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
you should use your fingers

486
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,700
to pick the tea.

487
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,700
I picked the tea without using my fingers.

488
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
I picked the tea with my fingers.

489
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,700
I didn't need to pick it.

490
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,300
It made me pick the wrong tea.

491
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,500
Go with yourself.

492
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
What...

493
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Look.

494
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Look.

495
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,440
Indeed.

496
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,020
icz 3

497
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,200
z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z z access

498
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,120
I now know why Deputy Chief

499
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,860
don't go escape with Su Jie

500
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,200
so there are betrayals

501
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,100
no wonder they

502
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,620
always compete with each other

503
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,280
stop talking now

504
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,500
stop it

505
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,580
you two stop

506
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,880
and then you can write the script

507
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,120
Li Bin

508
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,280
Let's go there.

509
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:19,840
Okay.

510
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,240
Let's go.

511
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,440
Let's go.

512
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,080
Let's go.

513
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,400
Lian Pian, you're here to see me?

514
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,720
I...

515
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:31,960
I told you,

516
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,160
we're not close.

517
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,240
Since you've worked hard,

518
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,760
after you've had your tea,

519
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,960
we'll have tea for you.

520
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,600
Enjoy your labor.

521
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,280
Great!

522
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,120
Students,

523
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,200
you can bring me

524
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,520
the tea you picked yourself later.

525
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,480
After you bring the tea,

526
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,520
I'll give you some of the finished products

527
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,440
and let you taste the tea you picked yourself.

528
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,680
It's better than the tea you usually drink.

529
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
It's more delicious.

530
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,560
Great!

531
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,160
Great!

532
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,000
Deputy Chief,

533
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,760
it's important to taste the tea.

534
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,600
How can we do without a tea table?

535
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,280
Yes.

536
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,920
We can't do that.

537
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,240
Don't ruin the tea.

538
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,360
How about letting Sang Qi be a tea master?

539
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
Lian Pian can help her.

540
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,400
Great!

541
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,880
Tea?

542
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,360
Sang Qi,

543
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,440
do you know how to make tea?

544
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Don't work in the tea house.

545
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,320
Leave Lian Pian here.

546
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,440
Just stay here and do your work.

547
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:39,960
Get lost.

548
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,800
Okay.

549
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,440
I'll try.

550
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,080
My brother taught me tea art in the past.

551
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,560
I can try.

552
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,560
I can try.

553
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,320
It's settled then.

554
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,920
Miss,

555
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,600
I brought some well water to prepare the meat.

556
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,520
Did Mr. Tang teach you how to make tea?

557
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
I think so.

558
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,440
I can make tea with a cup of tea.

559
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,080
Let's go.

560
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,120
A Xi,

561
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,720
make tea first.

562
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,160
Make mine first.

563
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,920
Deputy Chief,

564
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,520
I came first.

565
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,160
You're a master of the art.

566
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,440
Don't you understand that?

567
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,480
That's fair.

568
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,360
Okay.

569
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,720
Let Sang Qi say it.

570
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,200
Sang Qi, make my tea.

571
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,640
Make my tea.

572
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,240
Make my tea.

573
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,040
Make my tea.

574
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,920
Make my tea.

575
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,560
Just one cup.

576
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,160
Enough!

577
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,040
Is it necessary?

578
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm a little scared

579
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,880
because of you.

580
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,240
Yan Yan.

581
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,760
I'm here.

582
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,400
Let me make tea.

583
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,000
I want you to make tea.

584
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,760
Get lost.

585
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,520
Okay.

586
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,640
In that case,

587
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,280
make my tea.

588
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:18,760
Make my tea.

589
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,520
Make my tea.

590
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,000
Making tea is a

591
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,120
cultural thing.

592
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,760
Right?

593
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,120
Let's make tea.

594
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,640
Okay?

595
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,320
Let's make tea.

596
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,320
Let's make tea.

597
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,240
Okay.

598
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,240
Are you a beauty?

599
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,860
Deputy Chief.

600
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,740
I...

601
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,980
You know martial arts.

602
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,300
Why did you hit him?

603
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,140
How is it?

604
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,740
Does it still hurt?

605
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,620
Does it still hurt?

606
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,620
Say something.

607
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,940
Are you okay?

608
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,180
I'm fine.

609
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,940
Let me soak for a while.

610
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,580
Miss,

611
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,300
I can tell

612
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,700
that Deputy Chief Yan really means a lot to you.

613
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
Didn't you say that

614
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,620
he's been acting abnormally lately?

615
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,740
Don't you understand?

616
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,980
Of course I understand.

617
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,460
I know he's good to me.

618
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,900
But I'm not sure

619
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,580
if it's because I'm his old sister

620
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,300
or because he's my sister.

621
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,180
I'm not sure.

622
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,580
Is it because I'm his old sister

623
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,700
or because I'm his disciple

624
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,140
or his junior?

625
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,460
If you want to know the answer,

626
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,260
you can't just guess.

627
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,860
Miss, I'm leaving.

628
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,060
Be careful.

629
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,180
Take care of yourself.

630
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:55,300
Huauctie

631
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,060
Wait.

632
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,740
Siye.

633
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,260
Siye.

634
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:00,900
Come on.

635
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
You know martial arts.

636
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,340
Why don't you defeat him?

637
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,820
Young Master.

638
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,780
We've searched everywhere.

639
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,340
Have you found anything?

640
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,580
The soil here is moist.

641
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,740
It's not suitable for the spider that grows the western-style.

642
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,300
Did we find the wrong place?

643
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,300
I have a feeling that it should be around here.

644
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,420
The spider hasn't been found yet.

645
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,220
Let's go to another place.

646
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,500
Baishi.

647
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,300
Yes.

648
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,180
They should be more vigilant at night.

649
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,860
Be careful.

650
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,380
Let's go separately.

651
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,100
Okay, Young Master.

652
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,460
Go.

653
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,100
Siye.

654
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:10,860
Sang Qi.

655
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,500
It's late. Why are you here?

656
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,220
Are you okay?

657
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,540
I'm fine.

658
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,580
That's good.

659
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,180
Siye has just talked to Older Brother.

660
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,220
He surely can be able to sanctify lots of things.

661
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,200
That's how the

662
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
dust in my eyesbike.

663
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,220
Four also helped.

664
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,540
Ze!

665
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,460
cube jump

666
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,860
How did you overcome a fire?

667
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,020
With sleep effect.

668
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,860
I'm sorry.

669
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,580
Qi.

670
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,500
Zhuo Wenyu,

671
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,300
why did you come out

672
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,380
so late at night?

673
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,140
You're talking about...

674
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,460
I couldn't sleep at night.

675
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,260
I came out to take a nap and met you.

676
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,380
I couldn't sleep at night either.

677
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,300
So I came out for a walk.

678
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,060
How about this, Qi?

679
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,260
I'll go with you.

680
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,860
Don't go out so late.

681
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,660
You have to work tomorrow.

682
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,300
Go back and rest early.

683
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,020
Qi,

684
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,540
I'll come out in the middle of the night next time.

685
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,940
What if you get caught?

686
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,300
By the way,

687
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,140
I'll take you back with Deputy Chief.

688
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:31,980
Let's go.

689
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,340
Good morning.

690
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,740
Good morning.

691
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,980
Morning.

692
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,100
Good morning, Deputy Chief.

693
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,180
Today,

694
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,020
we'll continue to work according to the tea garden's schedule.

695
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,220
You must be careful.

696
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,300
Don't be lazy.

697
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,460
Go.

698
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,660
Cheer up.

699
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:19,860
Young Master.

700
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,980
The tea garden's staff and I

701
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,340
can start working now, right?

702
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,220
Do as planned.

703
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,460
Understood.

704
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,220
Cheer up.

705
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,100
Why is Song Luo Tian not worried at all?

706
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,100
He's afraid that he'll be punished if he can't finish it.

707
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,900
He has a time to cry.

708
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,060
Liu.

709
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,340
Young Master.

710
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,740
Call some people here.

711
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,540
Yes, Young Master.

712
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,820
San, Hu,

713
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,780
Niu, Liu.

714
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,820
You guys come out.

715
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,820
Hurry up.

716
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,900
Are you tired?

717
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,500
Remove all the weeds here.

718
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,820
Song Luo Tian,

719
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,460
you're playing tricks.

720
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,340
I have the ability.

721
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,900
I have the ability.

722
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,500
You can also ask your servants to help.

723
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,340
I'm not as shameless as you.

724
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:26,020
I'm just a regular worker.

725
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,900
Who told you that you don't have a tea garden?

726
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,420
Hurry up.

727
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,140
Take all the weeds

728
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,100
and send them to Yan Yan.

729
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,020
Send some fertilizer to him.

730
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,780
Song Luo Tian.

731
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,180
Are you playing tricks?

732
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,060
Who's afraid?

733
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,020
Come here.

734
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,020
Tell me the truth.

735
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,180
Today, I must come here

736
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,580
to play tricks on you.

737
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,420
Song Luo Tian and Yan Xiao Lang are starting again.

738
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,300
Aren't you going to persuade them?

739
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,660
No.

740
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,700
Yan Yan, are you crazy?

741
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,220
There are so many of us.

742
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,900
Didn't you ask me to come here?

743
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,780
Are you scared?

744
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,100
You're kidding.

745
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,100
I'm afraid of you.

746
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,820
Wei Ruo Hong.

747
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,380
Don't pull me.

748
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,180
I have to...

749
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,780
Beat him.

750
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:11,620
I...

751
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,740
I'll teach you a lesson.

752
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,900
Okay.

753
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,700
Song Luo Tian.

754
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,260
You really dare to take it, right?

755
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,420
Come on.

756
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:20,980
Beat him.

757
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,140
Teach him a lesson.

758
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Beat him.

759
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,300
Do it.

760
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:24,900
I'm beating him.

761
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:25,860
Don't stop me.

762
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,620
Beat him.

763
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,060
No.

764
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,580
Song Luo Tian.

765
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,180
Come on.

766
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,140
Beat him.

767
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,660
Do it.

768
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,260
Calm down.

769
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,140
Calm down.

770
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,300
Song Luo Tian.

771
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,980
Are you crazy? You want to fight?

772
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,660
Song Xiao Lang, we're all classmates.

773
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,740
Why are you so serious?

774
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,020
Yan Yan.

775
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,180
I...

776
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,620
I'll teach you a lesson sooner or later.

777
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,020
Don't go back to the room.

778
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:47,860
Okay.

779
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
Wait in the room.

780
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:51,580
Go.

781
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,700
I promise you.

782
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,940
Come on.

783
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,620
Miss Su.

784
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
You're really in a hurry.

785
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,900
You brought us so many good medicine.

786
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,340
Yes.

787
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,340
Thank you, Miss Su.

788
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:11,900
Miss Su.

789
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,340
I know you're busy with your work.

790
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,700
I came to visit you.

791
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:17,900
You're welcome.

792
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,740
Eat more.

793
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,140
Let's eat.

794
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:28,860
Qi.

795
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,740
Why are you so tired today?

796
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,420
You're weird.

797
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,820
I'm not.

798
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,060
Maybe I'm too tired.

799
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
After lunch,

800
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,900
you can go back to the room and rest.

801
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,500
I'll take a leave with Deputy Chief.

802
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,340
You're welcome.

803
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:39,740
You're welcome.

804
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,420
Eat more.

805
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,260
Thank you.

806
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,140
Thank you.

807
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,620
Thank you.

808
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,660
Qi.

809
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,420
You're back.

810
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,420
I prepared what you want to eat.

811
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,660
Sit down.

812
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,260
This is the crisp cake I made.

813
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,980
It looks good.

814
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,580
Try it.

815
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,220
Thank you.

816
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:04,980
Eat more.

817
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,020
Deputy Chief.

818
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,660
It's good.

819
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,260
Yanzhi.

820
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,660
You're back.

821
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,380
Sit down.

822
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:21,820
Yanyan.

823
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,860
It's going to be a good show.

824
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,220
I think so, too.

825
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,060
Okay.

826
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,620
Why don't you eat?

827
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,860
Don't waste Lan's heart.

828
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,420
Qi.

829
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,700
Yanzhi.

830
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,580
Is this dish not to your taste?

831
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,900
How could it be?

832
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,060
It's delicious.

833
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,940
It's delicious.

834
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,100
You have to work later.

835
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,020
Eat more.

836
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,300
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

837
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,900
Zhou Chen, eat, too.

838
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,540
Okay.

839
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,220
Yanzhi.

840
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,140
I heard thatability of imp мяс

841
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,100
came to the tea house suddenly.

842
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,820
And they're just

843
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,380
in the tea garden of the Song's.

844
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,500
So, I guess

845
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,940
work is false

846
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,460
and the cooperate is real.

847
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,540
So I come here to help.

848
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,460
Yanzhi.

849
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,520
Can I

850
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,500
do something for you?

851
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,060
Lan Qing.

852
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,100
Don't interfere

853
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,380
with my business anymore.

854
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,060
Yanzhi.

855
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm worried about you.

856
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,460
I've made it clear to you.

857
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,340
It's inconvenient for you to stay here.

858
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,260
You'd better go back to Bianjing.

859
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,540
Yan.

860
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,340
Song Hanyan.

861
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,420
Get up.

862
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,300
What are you doing?

863
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,700
What are you up to?

864
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,340
If you're capable, don't pretend to be a ghost.

865
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,060
You want me to fight with you?

866
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,100
Are you crazy?

867
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,580
You're not sleeping at midnight.

868
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,820
I'm sleeping.

869
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,020
Yan.

870
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,500
My Lady.

871
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,580
Deputy Chief is really out of it.

872
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,820
My Lady, you're so ungrateful.

873
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,500
He just doesn't appreciate it.

874
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,820
He even dares to leave.

875
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,100
It's Yanzhi.

876
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,460
Is there anything I can do?

877
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,460
My Lady.

878
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,300
Look at you. You're still speaking for him.

879
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,460
I heard that Deputy Chief specially arranged for Sang Qi

880
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,580
to own a room.

881
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,820
He's very considerate.

882
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,620
Sang Qi is now interested in Deputy Chief.

883
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,980
If they keep pestering him,

884
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,060
I'm afraid...

885
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,820
Who's there?

886
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Miss Sang.

887
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,220
Your food is here.

888
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,740
Zhuo Wenyuan, what are you doing here?

889
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,780
You've been frowning all day.

890
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,140
I asked someone to bring you

891
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,740
fish and wine from the wind tower.

892
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,620
It's for you.

893
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,860
I don't want to eat.

894
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,820
Don't let anyone see you.

895
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,020
Why are you standing there?

896
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,820
It's a beautiful day.

897
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,260
You're drinking with your family.

898
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
Isn't that enough?

899
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,460
Come on. Let's have a drink.

900
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,140
I said I don't want to eat.

901
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,420
Then I'll have to enjoy it alone.

902
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,460
Can't you enjoy it alone in the room?

903
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,460
I secretly brought the leeks.

904
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,020
Deputy Chief can't know about it.

905
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,740
If I go back now, I'll be in trouble.

906
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,620
I'll leave after I finish eating.

907
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,700
I won't keep you from sleeping.

908
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,580
You'll leave after you finish eating?

909
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,500
If you have something to tell me,

910
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,500
it's not that you can't.

911
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,700
I can chat with you.

912
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,020
I have nothing to say to you.

913
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,420
Then tell me

914
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,620
what happened to you recently.

915
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
Nothing.

916
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,740
Maybe I'm just too tired.

917
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,540
Who is it?

918
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,340
Could it be Deputy Chief?

919
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,260
If love is a stronghold,

920
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,860
we are deeply in love.

921
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,340
That's why I have this life.

922
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,380
If it's a past,

923
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,980
it becomes my past.

924
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:42,340
I can't let it go.

925
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,300
I'll write a perfect story.

926
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,340
I'll be a stubborn person.

927
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,820
My heart is in a small town.

928
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,820
Changed the beginning.

929
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,380
I lost the love I didn't know about.

930
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,900
I'll write the lyrics of the new moon.

931
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,540
I've also seen this city.

932
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,820
In the future, I'll be a stranger.

933
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:14,500
I'll be a stranger.

934
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,820
In the future, I'll be a stranger.

935
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,060
I'll be a stranger.

936
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,500
I'll be a stranger.
