1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The sound of the zither is like water, like a shadow, like a wolf

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sound of the zither is like water, like a shadow, like a wolf

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
My Lord, the whole Sang Mansion has been searched.

5
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
There's nothing unusual.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you satisfied now?

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,500
Xi.

8
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Stop talking.

9
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Send the guest out.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The sound of the zither is like water, like a wolf

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A'Jie.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,500
A'Jie.

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's wrong with you?

14
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,500
A'Jie.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,500
A'Jie.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,500
A'Jie.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,500
A'Jie.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,500
A'Jie.

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,500
A'Jie.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're awake.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Weren't you better before?

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why are you like this again?

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,500
A'Jie.

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,000
I will definitely find the best doctor for you.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Use the best medicine.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's find the patient together.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You brat.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A'Jie has three short stories.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm not done with you.

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,500
A'Jie.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not done with you.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not done with you.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not done with you.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Who wants water?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Go. Go. Go.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,500
Young Master.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Miss Sang's illness...

38
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,000
It's the same as what Qian Jiu described.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It should be the poison in the box.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The poison has been released.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You've thought it through.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's not long.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I didn't ask Qian Jiu for the antidote.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No one returned to the inn.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,500
Jing Meng.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Spread the news of Sang Qi's illness as much as possible.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Since we can't find the person who caused the cloud,

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
we should spread the news.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let him come to us.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Doctor. Please.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry. I really can't.

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Qingfeng Restaurant

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Qingfeng Restaurant is always here.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I remember that

55
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we were celebrating the end of the imperial examination here.

56
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It was a mess back then.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,500
Yes.

58
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Sang Qi also spread the big news about him and Deputy Chief.

59
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Think about it.

60
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
When Sang Qi entered school a year ago,

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
it was so chaotic.

62
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
It was so wonderful during the Shangyuan Festival.

63
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
It was even more magnificent when the gold medal was announced.

64
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Now, I heard that he was very ill.

65
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
He said he was ill and was ill for a long time.

66
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Life is really full of ups and downs.

67
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Who can't be sure?

68
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Sang Qi

69
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Miss Song.

70
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
How is he?

71
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Sang Qi's pulse is strange.

72
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I've never seen such a strange symptom.

73
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
If it's a poison,

74
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
it's never been before.

75
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Father.

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Qi.

77
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Why are you out?

78
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Sang Qi came to see me on purpose.

79
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
How can I not see him off?

80
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Sang Qi.

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I know my health.

82
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
You don't have to worry too much.

83
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Just be careful.

84
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
When can we meet?

85
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Qi.

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Don't say that.

87
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Remember to take the medicine I gave you.

88
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
The grass is like gold.

89
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
The sky is bright and the earth is clear.

90
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
This is a dream.

91
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Take a glance.

92
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:45,500
The thing that's in the dream.

93
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,380
My mother sent me to a forest

94
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,060
and found me a magic star.

95
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,780
I define the pe해도es

96
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,800
with the same letter than the upper auspices

97
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:09,540
and can form two

98
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,100
Do you mean that

99
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,380
I'm not going to save you, right?

100
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,700
Don't talk nonsense.

101
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Have a good rest.

102
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,500
I know

103
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,500
my own body.

104
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,100
No matter what,

105
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,620
I won't be like this.

106
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,460
You poisoned me.

107
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,700
Don't think too much.

108
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,980
Now that it has come to this,

109
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,100
I don't know what I can't admit.

110
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,740
I didn't go back to Heaven.

111
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,260
I just want to die.

112
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,080
Chief dishes and drinks,

113
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,020
don't make me pathways muk recovered

114
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:28,120
and

115
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,520
are my assets completed?

116
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,600
Now that's why.

117
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Zhao Wan Yuan.

118
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,220
About my brother,

119
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,080
I don't think shooting you...

120
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,360
Looking at why you were trying to hurt my dad,

121
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,640
I want to give it all for it.

122
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,780
종聲аз uncomfortable,

123
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:11,980
right?

124
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Why did you never think of me

125
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
as your brother?

126
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Have you forgotten your feelings?

127
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I tried my best to get your attention.

128
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,100
I hoped you could look back at me

129
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
even for a moment.

130
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
But you didn't.

131
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
You didn't.

132
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
You didn't.

133
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
You forgot our past.

134
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
You forced me to go this far.

135
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
I know Zheng Weiyuan.

136
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
He is a man of the common people.

137
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
He is a young man.

138
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,100
He is definitely not a man like this.

139
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
He has gone through all the hardships and made mistakes,

140
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
but he is a man who is full of people.

141
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,100
You know Zhuowen Yuan.

142
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Do you really know him?

143
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Can you understand him?

144
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,100
You can't.

145
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
You are the daughter of the Grand Commandant's Manor.

146
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Your father protected you since you were a child.

147
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Your brother favored you.

148
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
You grew up in the country without any worries.

149
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
But what about me?

150
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,100
What about you?

151
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
My father made a mistake.

152
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Our whole family was expelled from Bianjing.

153
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Fortunately, my aunt was in the back palace.

154
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the chance to come back to study.

155
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I will always remember

156
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
those who were in the situation

157
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
and were unable to take advantage of the situation

158
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
and looked down on me.

159
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
I will follow the existing rules

160
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
and take them step by step.

161
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
I'm afraid that everyone will look down on me

162
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,100
and respect me.

163
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
I'm afraid that I won't be humiliated anymore.

164
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,100
I'm afraid that I can't live a normal life.

165
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
For the sake of a day,

166
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,100
when you need me,

167
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
I can stand by your side and protect you.

168
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Anxi,

169
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
you are my bottom line.

170
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Since you came to Bianjing

171
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
and kept messing up my plan,

172
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
I never blamed you.

173
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
I've been holding the strings between Xizhao and my aunt.

174
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,100
I've been protecting you with all my heart.

175
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
I've been thinking about marrying you

176
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
more than once.

177
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
But you...

178
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
You've been betraying me

179
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
and lying to me one after another.

180
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Now,

181
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
it's all your choice.

182
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Anxi.

183
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
It's a pity

184
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,100
that I met you

185
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
and made the most wrong thing

186
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
in my life.

187
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
I'm going to die.

188
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Now, you are...

189
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Losing you

190
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,100
is a regret in my life.

191
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
But if I lose you,

192
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
I'll do nothing.

193
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm going to die.

194
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,100
Anxi,

195
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,100
in the last moment of your life,

196
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
the one who was by your side

197
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
was me.

198
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
I'm going to die.

199
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,100
Anxi,

200
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
in the last moment of your life,

201
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
the one who was by your side

202
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
was me.

203
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
I'm going to die.

204
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
Anxi,

205
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,100
in the last moment of your life,

206
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
the one who was by your side

207
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
was me.

208
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,100
Anxi,

209
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
in the last moment of your life,

210
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
the one who was by your side

211
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
was me.

212
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Anxi,

213
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
in the last moment of your life,

214
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
the one who was by your side

215
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,100
was me.

216
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,100
Anxi,

217
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
in the last moment of your life,

218
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
the one who was by your side

219
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
was me.

220
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Anxi,

221
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
in the last moment of your life,

222
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
the one who was by your side

223
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,100
was me.

224
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Anxi,

225
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
in the last moment of your life,

226
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
the one who was by your side

227
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
was me.

228
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Anxi,

229
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
in the last moment of your life,

230
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
the one who was by your side

231
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
was me.

232
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Anxi,

233
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
are you and Bianjing

234
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
having an ill relationship?

235
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Sang Yu died of illness four years ago.

236
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
Now Sang Qi

237
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
can't escape from the same fate.

238
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
It's just that Sang Tai is crying.

239
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I heard that he was ill

240
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
and was ill all the time.

241
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Didn't you see that Sang Qi was ill today?

242
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
He didn't come to the host.

243
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
He said that after today,

244
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
he would report to the government

245
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
and leave Bianjing.

246
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Life is so hard.

247
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,100
I'm sorry.

248
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
Brother Zhuo.

249
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Zhuo...

250
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Let's go.

251
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Go.

252
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
How dare you come here?

253
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,100
I'm a friend.

254
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I can't even pay you a hundred times.

255
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
Friend?

256
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
I'm afraid that Sang Qi won't recognize you.

257
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Aren't you afraid that he will come back

258
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,100
and settle the score with you?

259
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,100
Grandpa.

260
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Fine.

261
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
I won't argue with you

262
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
here today.

263
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,100
But in the future,

264
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I will settle the score with you.

265
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,100
Then I will

266
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
take Yan Xiaolang in.

267
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Move aside.

268
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,100
I know he will come.

269
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
But I will never let him

270
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,100
see you for the last time

271
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
and forgive me.

272
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,100
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
I'm sorry.

275
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
I'm sorry.

277
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
I'm sorry.

278
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,100
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,100
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,100
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,100
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,100
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,100
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,100
I'm sorry.

293
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
I'm sorry.

295
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,100
I'm sorry.

296
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm sorry.

297
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,100
I'm sorry.

299
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,100
He really came.

300
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Send a letter.

301
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Arrest him.

302
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
The dead are the greatest.

303
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,100
I don't think he wants to escape.

304
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Why don't we wait until he's defeated

305
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,100
and then arrest him to return to the dark?

306
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,100
What?

307
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
You don't want to hide it anymore?

308
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
Zhou Wen Yuan

309
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
Let me in.

310
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Let me see her for the last time.

311
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,100
After that, I'll naturally go with you.

312
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
Lord Yan,

313
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
I told you clearly

314
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
that I won't let you see Sang Qi for the last time.

315
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,100
I want you to use the power of the card

316
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,100
in this place.

317
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Master four.

318
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
I want you to remember forever

319
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
that the last person to see A'qi

320
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,100
is me.

321
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Then I won't have to wait for you anymore.

322
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
Si Yi!

323
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
Father, you...

324
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,100
I lost you because I lost the baby.

325
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
I'm going to help Si Yi today.

326
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Chu Wan Yuan.

327
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,100
Don't!

328
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Chu Wan Yuan!

329
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Chu Wan Yuan, what are you doing?

330
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
Chu Wan Yuan!

331
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Chu Wan Yuan!

332
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Chu Wan Yuan!

333
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,100
Master.

334
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,100
Master!

335
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Chu Wan Yuan!

336
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,100
Chu Wan Yuan!

337
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
A'qi!

338
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
San Yue.

339
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,100
A'qi!

340
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,100
A'qi!

341
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
A'qi!

342
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
Master!

343
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
A'qi!

344
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
A'qi!

345
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,100
A'qi!

346
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
A'qi!

347
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
A'qi!

348
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,100
A'qi!

349
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
You're sleeping so well.

350
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,100
You're making me feel so quiet.

351
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
It's already like this.

352
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
You still don't admit your guilt?

353
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Looking back, I've always been a little bit of a coward.

354
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
I have no rules.

355
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
I have no rules.

356
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,100
You're still so virtuous.

357
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
That's good.

358
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I'll go to sleep.

359
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
I'll go to sleep.

360
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
I have something to tell you.

361
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,100
That day, you sent someone to send Yan San Lang to the mountain.

362
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
It was a good idea.

363
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,100
But he wasn't in good health.

364
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Grand Concubine Sang.

365
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,100
She lost her son and daughter.

366
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,100
She's so fragile that she's in bed now.

367
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,100
She hasn't been in the imperial court for days.

368
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
As for your Yan family,

369
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,100
although you've already cut off all ties with them,

370
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,100
but the Prime Minister has been a good man.

371
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
You always do things in a bad way.

372
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Now you're thinking about your own family.

373
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Yan family...

374
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
I don't even have to say it.

375
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Yan Yan Shu is just a minor official who has nothing to do with it.

376
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,100
It's impossible for him to just return to his family.

377
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:17,100
The strong grass of the Song family is now very obedient.

378
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,100
It sounds like I'm going to be empty-handed with you.

379
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Now the upper and lower classes and the common people

380
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,100
are all counting on you.

381
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Everything you wanted to do

382
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
is not for me.

383
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Even if you, Lord Zhuo,

384
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,100
is just a criminal son,

385
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,100
if it wasn't for the fact that

386
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
I opened the gate for you and let you study,

387
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
where would you be today?

388
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Don't call me father.

389
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
He's incompetent.

390
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,100
He's not me.

391
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,100
I can only depend on myself to get to where I am today.

392
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
It has nothing to do with him.

393
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
I won.

394
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Do you really think you won?

395
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
Zhuo Yan Yuan, let me ask you.

396
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
Now Sang Qi is gone.

397
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Is it that important to lose and win?

398
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,100
Even if you and Fu Kui,

399
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Sang Qi is gone,

400
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
is it worth it?

401
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

402
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
I want to answer it well.

403
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
I want to choose it well.

404
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
But Sang Qi has never given me a chance.

405
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
It's you

406
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
who forced me.

407
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
You're so stupid.

408
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
You're so stupid.

409
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
What are you laughing at?

410
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
What else do you have to laugh at?

411
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
I know you won't let me go.

412
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
I know I won't live long.

413
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,100
But don't you think you're more miserable?

414
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
If you lose,

415
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
you lose more than I do.

416
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Do you believe I'll kill you now?

417
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Okay.

418
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
If you want to kill,

419
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
I'll say it.

420
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,100
There's always a change.

421
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
Fercendo,

422
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
incident of expression.

423
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
So,

424
00:27:44,100 --> 00:28:03,920
if you want to

425
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,100
change your mind.

426
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,740
Your Highness.

427
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,580
Your Highness.

428
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,420
Do you want to get changed

429
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,700
before going to see the Noble Consort

430
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,100
to avoid the bad luck?

431
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,660
No need.

432
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,980
I can't stand the bad luck.

433
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,020
Let's go to the palace.

434
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,380
Yes.

435
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,020
Home sweet home area

436
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,340
The optic syncope gigs

437
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,220
spectacular girls

438
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,260
has been found

439
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,540
and is now in the Jinzhao mansion.

440
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,540
The official is ordered to be interrogated by Lord Xiao.

441
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
He has evidence, account books,

442
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,180
and witness.

443
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,340
He also has the motive to hide his identity

444
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,820
and suppress him for years.

445
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,420
Even he has confessed.

446
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:23,980
Aunt,

447
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,460
don't worry.

448
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,460
He is a murderer,

449
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,100
a thug,

450
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,460
and even murdered a court official.

451
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,820
Everything is a big mistake.

452
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,580
It should be solved earlier.

453
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,580
I understand.

454
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,420
It's clean outside.

455
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,260
Everything can be restored.

456
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,660
I have repaired

457
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,140
the waterways and roads.

458
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,260
It will be able to operate normally in a few days.

459
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,500
Now,

460
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,460
without the redness of the west Zhao,

461
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,820
we are

462
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,220
even more rich.

463
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,540
With these savings,

464
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,620
we can plan bigger things

465
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,060
and buy more people.

466
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,900
Have you hidden the money?

467
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,980
Never hide it in Zhuo mansion again.

468
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,020
Aunt, don't worry.

469
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,100
Before the chaos,

470
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,420
I have transferred it slowly.

471
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,620
Now,

472
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,740
it's placed in a place

473
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,060
that is absolutely safe.

474
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,940
If your father

475
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,380
had half of your wisdom,

476
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,620
he wouldn't have been killed

477
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,500
as a scapegoat.

478
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,060
He even got you involved in the war.

479
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,060
I have been in the cold and warm world.

480
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,700
Now, we are working together.

481
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,820
From the decline of Zhuo family

482
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,900
to the new nobility in the court,

483
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,380
it's not a waste of

484
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,340
all these years of experience.

485
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,820
Wen Yuan,

486
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,220
I was worried that you wouldn't be able to do anything

487
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,500
because of the girl from the Sang family.

488
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,940
Now, it seems that

489
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,940
I have been thinking too much.

490
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,140
Zhuo is still far from here.

491
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,500
All the way here,

492
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,100
she will be stubborn.

493
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,100
From now on,

494
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,700
no one will oppose us again.

495
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,820
It depends on the face of Zhuo family.

496
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,620
SUBJECT

497
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,860
Next Fall

498
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,020
Where are you going?

499
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,020
You've already seen me leave

500
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,020
before you finished your dinner.

501
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,500
Do I look like I'm emerge free?

502
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,660
Come and have some dinner.

503
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,700
If you have anything to say, just remain fistful.

504
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,900
You asked me to be frank.

505
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,940
Tell me.

506
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,220
Is Sang Qi's death

507
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,220
related to you?

508
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,060
What did the roomers say?

509
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,180
It has nothing to do with me.

510
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,660
She's in such good health.

511
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,820
How could she be gone in a few days?

512
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,500
I'm not sure.

513
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,020
I don't know much about medicine.

514
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,740
Besides, you're a weird person.

515
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,980
Since you met Sang Qi for the first time,

516
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,180
you two have been acting differently.

517
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,260
You're always waiting for her to show up.

518
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,780
Why are you suddenly concerned about her death?

519
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:31,700
Indeed.

520
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,100
Sang Qi and I are not good sisters.

521
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,180
We always have a good relationship.

522
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,700
But I heard...

523
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,980
But I heard that she died

524
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,580
because she wanted to see her again.

525
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,260
She dared to do something wrong

526
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,700
in the big Bianjing city.

527
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,820
She doesn't see me as a lady of the Song family.

528
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,940
It's interesting to think about

529
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,620
the days when she was with us.

530
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,140
Although I wish her well,

531
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,100
I don't want her to die.

532
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:12,700
Don't cry.

533
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,140
The food is getting cold.

534
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,460
Let's eat together.

535
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,660
Okay.

536
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,660
You've been too busy these days.

537
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,220
You haven't had time to go back to your mother's house, right?

538
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,860
I'll go back with you tomorrow.

539
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,660
Really?

540
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,940
Are you willing to go with me?

541
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,700
There are too many things these days.

542
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,540
I'm tired of it.

543
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,580
I want to stay with my family.

544
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,500
After all, we are family now.

545
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,820
You mean we are family?

546
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,820
From now on,

547
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,620
we are family.

548
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,820
I will treat you well

549
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,300
and cherish what's in front of me.

550
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,140
Tie Meng.

551
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,660
Yes.

552
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,140
Prepare some gifts for the date.

553
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,700
You can go there empty-handed tomorrow.

554
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,820
It's not a good idea.

555
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,740
I'll do it right away.

556
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,500
Thank you.

557
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,620
Let's eat.

558
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,940
You don't think I'm a bad person now, do you?

559
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,220
You are not a bad person.

560
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,420
You are a family.

561
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,860
Honey, let's eat.

562
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,780
Let's eat together.

563
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,020
I'll eat.

564
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,420
Dad,

565
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,860
why don't you see your mother?

566
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,780
I have something to talk to Xianxu.

567
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,180
Go to the back room and find your mother.

568
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:48,980
Dad.

569
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,660
Be good.

570
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,220
Be good.

571
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,500
Okay.

572
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,500
I won't bother you.

573
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,980
Go. Go.

574
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,140
Xianxu,

575
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,580
I heard that you solved the case of Xi Zhao.

576
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,940
It's a great achievement.

577
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,540
I also heard that Yan Yunzhi also confessed.

578
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,340
I have NO way out of Yan Yunzhi.

579
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,540
Yes.

580
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:51,500
How about the ledger

581
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,460
Don't think about it.

582
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,500
I'll remember it.

583
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,460
Then, do you think we can...

584
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,500
Xianxu, look.

585
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,460
We're a family now.

586
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,340
Everything I do

587
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,740
is for the good of our family

588
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,660
and for the good of the Noble Consort.

589
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,420
So, Xianxu, I...

590
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,860
Oh.

591
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,100
Three or four batches of goods

592
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,140
haven't come in yet.

593
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,580
The south is in a mess.

594
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,180
The warehouse is in poor condition.

595
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,580
The goods are in great loss.

596
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,900
If it's safe,

597
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,540
we can move.

598
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,620
It's good for everyone.

599
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,580
Look.

600
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,020
I've told Aunt.

601
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,420
She said it's fine.

602
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,820
Now, this matter is over.

603
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,060
Mr. Xiao is writing a security document.

604
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,780
Since it's over,

605
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,980
no one will pay attention to

606
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,060
the rest.

607
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,100
Oh.

608
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
Then,

609
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,260
can we move the goods?

610
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,260
Yes.

611
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,380
The world is in a mess.

612
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,900
The world is in a mess.

613
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,060
If we don't move the goods,

614
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,100
will it be

615
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,780
a mess?

616
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,100
Yes.

617
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,460
Xianxu is smart.

618
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,940
Xianxu is smart.

619
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,060
Put this over here.

620
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Yang Zhuo.

621
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,260
Sir.

622
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,580
This is the transaction thing.

623
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,340
Please see here.

624
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Let's go.

625
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,780
I have something important to report.

626
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,780
I want to see the officer.

627
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,780
Please pass it on.

628
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Search the place.

629
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
Yes.

630
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,780
Sir, we have a clue.

631
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
Sir, we have a clue.

632
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
Sir, we have caught the spy in the capital.

633
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,780
How did you catch him?

634
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
It's...

635
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Say it clearly.

636
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
I think I saw it clearly.

637
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,780
But it's impossible.

638
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
I think we should go back to the capital.

639
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
Yes.

640
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
Yes.

641
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,780
I have this.

642
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,780
If I think about the past,

643
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,920
it becomes my

644
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,780
sense of direction.

645
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,780
My sense of direction.

646
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
I can't

647
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,780
be the one

648
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,780
who forgets the perfect story.

649
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Is it the way I feel?

650
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,780
The city where the heart is in the unknown.

651
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
Changed the beginning.

652
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,780
The person who lost the love.

653
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,780
I wrote the words of the new moon.

654
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:55,780
I also finished the life in this life.

655
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,780
In the future, we will have a deep talk.

656
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:03,780
We will have a deep talk.

657
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,780
In the future, we will have a deep talk.

658
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:11,780
We will have a deep talk.

659
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
I'm sorry.

660
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,780
I'm sorry.

661
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,780
I'm sorry.

662
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,780
I'm sorry.

663
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
I'm sorry.

664
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
I'm sorry.

665
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,780
I'm sorry.

666
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,780
I'm sorry.

667
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,780
I'm sorry.

668
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
I'm sorry.

669
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,780
I'm sorry.

670
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
I'm sorry.

671
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,780
I'm sorry.

672
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,780
I'm sorry.

673
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,780
I'm sorry.

674
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,780
I'm sorry.

675
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
I'm sorry.

676
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
I'm sorry.

677
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,780
I'm sorry.

679
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,780
I'm sorry.

680
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:40,780
I'm sorry.

681
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
I'm sorry.

682
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,780
I'm sorry.

683
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,780
I'm sorry.

684
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,780
I'm sorry.

685
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,780
I'm sorry.

686
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,780
I'm sorry.
