The Long Ballad

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Did you catch up?

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't think so.

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's a life-saving pill.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is this what you should do?

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll let them settle the bill tomorrow.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
By tomorrow,

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
there will be a group of thugs

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
who won't pay for the food.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They'll eat and drink.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What are you doing, Yan Yuzhi?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Since they are thugs,

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I should do something I don't usually think about

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and I don't dare to do.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Long Ballad

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The Long Ballad

18
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's beautiful.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do you want to see it more closely?

21
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Come on.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hurry up.

23
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Look at this.

24
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Qin, I'll go buy some drinks.

25
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Wait for me here.

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't run away.

27
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The Long Ballad

28
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Deputy Chief.

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Deputy Chief.

30
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Qi.

31
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's wrong?

32
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I thought you were gone.

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I couldn't find you.

34
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Didn't I tell you

35
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'd go buy some drinks?

36
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
When did you say that?

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I must have seen the fireworks

38
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
and saw her naked face.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I didn't hear it.

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're stealing again.

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why are you stealing so fast?

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Silly girl.

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You really think I'm stupid?

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm here to date you.

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why should I not bring my wallet?

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was just kidding.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I want to make our date special today.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A little more unforgettable.

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you mind?

50
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I think you're really

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
boring sometimes.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Qi.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I discussed with Baishi.

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He said it was an emotion.

55
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What emotion?

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's boring.

57
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Fine.

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't be angry.

60
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
By the way,

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
when I went down,

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
there were a lot of fun things.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's go and have a look.

64
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then you have to promise me

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you won't play the long ballad again.

66
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I promise.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And I'll clean up Baishi when I go back.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay.

69
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So you changed her comment.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I care too much.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I won't have you as a gift.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So you can go now.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Xiao Tao, you don't need to be mean to me.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:20,740
Actually, the message 탖

103
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,740
has the end of year.

104
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,960
The line was fun

105
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,860
when we last met and forbade you.

106
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,620
I didn't expect Wei Zhanghong

107
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,220
to leave the Imperial College.

108
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,340
He always

109
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
treated Song Lotian with respect.

110
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,300
But he ended up

111
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,580
in a bad situation.

112
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,100
Poor him.

113
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,420
Song Lotian didn't even come to see him off.

114
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,980
Let's go.

115
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,420
Yeah.

116
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,740
Deputy Chief Yan, Dr. Feng,

117
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,020
Dr. Guang,

118
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,260
I'm leaving Bianjing in a few days.

119
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,100
I'll say goodbye to the teachers here.

120
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,820
Even if you leave the Imperial College,

121
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,220
don't forget to study.

122
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,060
Don't forget the school.

123
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,180
I'll remember it.

124
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,700
It's getting late.

125
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,060
Stop the nonsense. Take him away.

126
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,780
Yes.

127
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,420
Stop.

128
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,260
They're here.

129
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,900
Hurry up.

130
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,020
I'll let you live.

131
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,740
Song Lotian.

132
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,700
Young Master, you can't.

133
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,140
Master didn't want you to leave the mansion.

134
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,660
If you make trouble again, be careful of getting punished.

135
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,860
Put it down.

136
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,380
Put it down.

137
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,700
Don't worry, Wei Zhanghong.

138
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,940
I'll ask my father to help you.

139
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,660
No need.

140
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,700
I won't

141
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,740
have any more business with your family.

142
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,420
Take him away.

143
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,060
Yes.

144
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,860
Go back to class.

145
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,980
Go back to class.

146
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,620
Let's go.

147
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,500
Go back to class.

148
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,300
Let's go.

149
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,460
Please.

150
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,540
Mr. Zhuo,

151
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,580
why did you find such a place to meet me?

152
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,700
You can only stay awake

153
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,940
when you're in a state of absence.

154
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,540
You can't be too happy.

155
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,180
Aunt said

156
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,420
the Grand Tutor has lived in the temple for a long time.

157
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,260
It's inevitable that he's lost his mind.

158
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,500
He should come out more often.

159
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,060
You're right.

160
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,260
I should come out more often.

161
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,940
I'm afraid

162
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,940
I can't be with you.

163
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,940
I came here early.

164
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,740
About the tea garden,

165
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,900
you've helped me solve the problem

166
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,980
without any other way.

167
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,820
If you want to be an official,

168
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,580
I'll help you.

169
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,580
Thank you, Grand Tutor.

170
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,820
Although you

171
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,620
have taken the responsibility,

172
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,060
you can't

173
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,780
keep the truth.

174
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,060
If you can't

175
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,900
bear the blame,

176
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,260
I'll be the one to be blamed.

177
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,540
Besides,

178
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,620
Yan Yunzhi is not easy to deal with.

179
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,220
If it wasn't for his nephew,

180
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,860
the tea garden wouldn't have been exposed.

181
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,660
I'm afraid

182
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,340
he won't let go of the matter.

183
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,500
If you can be an official,

184
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,540
you can keep the good news.

185
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,020
Don't worry, Grand Tutor.

186
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,340
I have my own plans.

187
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,380
What's the prize?

188
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,180
What prize?

189
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:20,980
What prize?

190
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,780
What prize?

191
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,500
What prize?

192
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,140
What prize?

193
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,860
What prize?

194
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,660
What prize?

195
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,380
What prize?

196
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,260
What prize?

197
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,060
What prize?

198
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,860
What prize?

199
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,660
What prize?

200
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,460
The Imperial College will hold a lecture tomorrow.

201
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,300
Dr. Song is the main actor.

202
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,700
How capable Dr. Song is!

203
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,620
He's going to give a lecture on behalf of the official.

204
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,460
Besides, the tea garden ceremony

205
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,580
has just passed.

206
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,420
It's too childish.

207
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,020
It shows that

208
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,780
Dr. Song is trusted by the official.

209
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,660
The lecture

210
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,420
is for the benefit of Grand Tutor.

211
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,380
It's to

212
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,860
eliminate the prejudice against him.

213
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,900
I think

214
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,340
it's just a premonition.

215
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,220
He just wants to make it look good.

216
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,900
As for whether he can make it or not,

217
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,500
it's up to us.

218
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,580
Look.

219
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,020
How about this?

220
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,340
Good.

221
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,020
I see.

222
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,380
The lecture tomorrow

223
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,740
will be inappropriate.

224
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,020
Sang Qi.

225
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,620
You're causing trouble again.

226
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,380
This is a serious matter.

227
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,140
Don't get into trouble again.

228
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,420
I'm not.

229
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,540
I'm not.

230
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,740
I'm not.

231
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,380
I'm not.

232
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,100
I'm not.

233
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,820
I'm not.

234
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,620
I'm not.

235
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,420
I'm not.

236
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,220
I'm not.

237
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:45,940
I'm not.

238
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,740
I'm not.

239
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,540
I'm not.

240
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,260
I'm not.

241
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,940
Let me make it clear.

242
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,580
I'm not causing trouble.

243
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,420
Dr. Song

244
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,020
is unlucky.

245
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,140
Yes.

246
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,900
It's the will of God.

247
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,380
Yes.

248
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,900
The will of God.

249
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,140
Be careful.

250
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,300
Don't get caught.

251
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,300
That's what friends should say.

252
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,660
I'll say it again.

253
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,380
Look.

254
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,380
You must

255
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,420
hold this rope.

256
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,980
Okay.

257
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,580
Don't let Dr. Song find out.

258
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,300
Don't worry.

259
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,380
I

260
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,980
have been a man of the world.

261
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,900
I've tried my best

262
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,700
and finally succeeded.

263
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,780
I've made great achievements

264
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,420
and made great achievements.

265
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,940
I'm doing this

266
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,620
to live up to

267
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,180
the expectation of the officials.

268
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,100
Hmm.

269
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,060
I know

270
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,220
that some people

271
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,900
have been spreading rumors

272
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,140
to blackmail me.

273
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,900
You

274
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,580
are eunuchs.

275
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,740
You are easily fooled.

276
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,940
You have some misunderstanding about me.

277
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,700
I don't care.

278
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,780
Look.

279
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,540
I guess you all know

280
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,140
that this tree

281
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,340
is the famous

282
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,860
bamboo cane.

283
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,220
Back then,

284
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,780
the boatman was talking about

285
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,300
this tree.

286
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,100
This bamboo cane is very spiritual.

287
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,940
It can be used to make a middleman.

288
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,900
Only loyal officials

289
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,580
can stand under this tree.

290
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,860
Do you know that?

291
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,220
Be careful, Your Highness.

292
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,500
Be careful, Your Highness.

293
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,060
Be careful, Your Highness.

294
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,020
There are assassins.

295
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,340
Be careful.

296
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,220
There are assassins.

297
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,020
There are assassins.

298
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,060
Catch them.

299
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,420
Hurry.

300
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,300
Hurry.

301
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,700
Sir.

302
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:10,980
This is...

303
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,620
This is...

304
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,900
Great.

305
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:39,440
You people in the Royalòngs Muhow

306
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,080
Fine.

307
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,760
Then don't blame me for being rude.

308
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,160
Please calm down, Grand Tutor.

309
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,120
Deputy Chief.

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,760
Deputy Chief.

311
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,840
Deputy Chief, look at this.

312
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,600
Grand Tutor Song,

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,920
I'm willing to take all the responsibility.

314
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,640
You're willing to take all the responsibility?

315
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,400
Please punish me, Grand Tutor.

316
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,640
Don't cover up

317
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,640
these evil swordsmen.

318
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,560
Please punish me, Grand Tutor.

319
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,360
It's inevitable that you'll be punished.

320
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,280
I think

321
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
you should be punished.

322
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,600
It's inevitable.

323
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,320
I think the school style of the Imperial College

324
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,920
is the sun and the moon.

325
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,520
The head of the Imperial College

326
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,560
has violated the law

327
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,000
and offended the officials of the court.

328
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,440
It's really

329
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,480
a bad thing.

330
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,680
It's hard to save him with this.

331
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,440
Don't look at Deputy Chief.

332
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,840
Grand Tutor Song was humiliated.

333
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,960
It's reasonable to

334
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,920
vent your anger at this time.

335
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Don't do it.

336
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,640
It's reasonable not to?

337
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,680
Say no more.

338
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,480
Grand Tutor Song,

339
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,800
do your own job.

340
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,960
Let me do it.

341
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,840
Shut up.

342
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,440
Go.

343
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,440
We've made a mistake,

344
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,640
it has nothing to do with the pancakes.

345
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
We've made a mistake,

346
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,640
it has nothing to do with the pancakes.

347
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,760
We've made a mistake,

348
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,640
it has nothing to do with pancakes.

349
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,120
We've made a mistake,

350
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,560
it has nothing to do with pancakes.

351
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,760
How dare you!

352
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,600
Don't you have a sign?

353
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,160
Grand Tutor Song,

354
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,160
I know who is the traitor.

355
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,360
Who?

356
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,600
After all,

357
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,280
it's because of this tree.

358
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,440
Although it's a sacred tree

359
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
that the official has certified,

360
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,320
it was also

361
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
hit by Grand Tutor Song

362
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,200
when he was unconscious.

363
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,120
Fortunately,

364
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,480
the tree was cut down

365
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,600
and he was able to breathe.

366
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,680
Am I right?

367
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,960
Yes.

368
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,920
Yes.

369
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,640
Get me out of here.

370
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,040
Go.

371
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,800
Go.

372
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,360
This...

373
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,440
Come on, Third Master.

374
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,000
Go.

375
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,240
You...

376
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,040
You...

377
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,520
Grand Tutor Song,

378
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,280
we'll satisfy you

379
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
with whatever you like.

380
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,000
If you're cold,

381
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,080
I'll cut it into wood

382
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,000
to keep you warm.

383
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,280
If you're tired,

384
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,280
we'll make you

385
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,760
a long-awaited sweet wooden bed.

386
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,800
You have everything you need.

387
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,080
You can choose.

388
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,240
I can choose?

389
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,560
If you're...

390
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,600
If you're bored...

391
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,000
It's easier to say if you're bored.

392
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,240
I'll make you a wooden stick

393
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,320
and sprinkle some of my

394
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,600
unique secret ingredients.

395
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,000
It's fun to tell stories.

396
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,680
Choose.

397
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,560
You...

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,360
You...

399
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:47,800
You...

400
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,240
Nonsense.

401
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,800
How can you do that?

402
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,720
Grand Tutor Song.

403
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,840
Grand Tutor Song,

404
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,160
or 15 Zemun revvers.

405
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,280
The one cut

406
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,280
is done by Grand Tutor Song himself.

407
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,960
You're not my sunlight underlings.

408
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,240
Grandfather.

410
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:29,880
Please.

411
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,200
You're going against me?

412
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,920
Are you going against me?

413
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
Are you trying to rebel?

414
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,640
Are you?

415
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,240
You...

416
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,280
Your father, Wang Zi Cheng,

417
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,480
will give you a good lesson.

418
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,160
Take it.

419
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,120
Take it.

420
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,440
Song Luo Tian.

421
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,440
You're a traitor.

422
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,480
You...

423
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,960
Listen.

424
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,600
Fine.

425
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,160
I'm going to report this

426
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,480
to the government today.

427
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,360
Wait and see.

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,440
Father.

429
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,720
Please calm down.

430
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,880
Father.

431
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,880
Please calm down.

432
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
Please calm down.

433
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,400
Please calm down.

434
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,440
Please calm down.

435
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,120
Father.

436
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,320
Grandfather.

437
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,520
Father.

438
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
Grandfather.

439
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,120
Please calm down.

440
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,400
Father.

441
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,120
I...

442
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
I'm going to the palace.

443
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,320
Why are you going with me?

444
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
You're a unfilial son.

445
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,480
You're embarrassing me.

446
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,520
Get out.

447
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,000
I...

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,720
Get out.

449
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,080
Father.

450
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,880
Father.

451
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,800
Please calm down.

452
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,280
Get out of here.

453
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,080
Father.

454
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,520
Father.

455
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,040
Please calm down.

456
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,040
Father.

457
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:09,880
Father.

458
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,560
Get out.

459
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,040
Mom, thanks.

460
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,280
I asked seeds before I chestnut or earned my pockets.

461
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,600
I never borrowed the money.

462
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,200
I Jewelry Store

463
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,920
Do everything according to plan

464
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,040
선anas watch out for the events

465
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,840
Rbinche

466
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm okay

467
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,680
How dare you bore one's part?

468
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,800
Youестil all my troubles.

469
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:23,080
I

470
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,160
The one who sent the letter threw away the Wei family.

471
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,240
Yan Sanlang made a mistake.

472
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,520
Yan Yunzhi,

473
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,040
I'll take your private position now.

474
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,240
First,

475
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,360
I do want to calm down

476
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,600
the anger of Grand Tutor Song.

477
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,600
Second,

478
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,840
without the private position,

479
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
you can help me

480
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,560
investigate the Song family.

481
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,080
You're wise, Your Majesty.

482
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,080
I won't let you down.

483
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,160
Remember,

484
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,440
don't say anything bad.

485
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,880
We're secretly reading Chen Cang's book.

486
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,000
You must be careful.

487
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,600
Don't let Grand Tutor Song

488
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,400
catch you again.

489
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,160
Yes.

490
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,360
Grand Tutor Song

491
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,200
won't give up easily

492
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,320
in the past.

493
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,480
I wonder

494
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,200
what crime

495
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,040
we'll be punished for.

496
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,960
It's okay.

497
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,720
The Song family

498
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,960
is the master of the Zhao family.

499
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,160
We can just do what we want.

500
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
Why are you so confident today?

501
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,200
Something bad happened.

502
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,440
What's wrong?

503
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,720
What's wrong?

504
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,960
The private position is gone.

505
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,800
What?

506
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,520
It's gone.

507
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,120
It's gone.

508
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,320
The private position is gone again.

509
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Yesterday,

510
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,040
under the strong demands of Grand Tutor Song,

511
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,200
the official family exempted

512
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,760
Yan Yunzhi's private position.

513
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,600
Yes.

514
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,320
Let's go.

515
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,760
Yes.

516
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,400
Let's go.

517
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,760
Let's go.

518
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,800
Hurry.

519
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,400
Hurry.

520
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,360
Go.

521
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,280
Go.

522
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,800
Hurry.

523
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,760
Hurry.

524
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,440
Hurry up.

525
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,080
Hurry.

526
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,640
Hurry.

527
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,720
Private position.

528
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,360
Private position.

529
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,920
Private position.

530
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,480
Private position.

531
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,560
Private position.

532
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,240
Private position.

533
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
Private position.

534
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,520
Private position.

535
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,160
Private position.

536
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,280
What are you doing?

537
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,240
Where is the private position?

538
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:00,960
Where is the private position?

539
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,400
There is no rule.

540
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,040
You're so loud.

541
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,200
You made a scene.

542
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,040
Today,

543
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,400
you don't know how much you're being punished.

544
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,920
Yan Yunzhi really doesn't come to the Imperial College?

545
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,520
It's arranged like this for now.

546
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,240
In the future,

547
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
I'll be in charge of it.

548
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,760
The official family

549
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,080
still values

550
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,480
Grand Tutor Song's feelings.

551
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,320
Let's go to Grand Tutor Song's mansion

552
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,520
to get justice for Deputy Chief.

553
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,840
I don't believe it.

554
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,680
We have so many people.

555
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,560
He can take us to the river.

556
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,800
Am I right?

557
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,120
Yes.

558
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,880
Get justice.

559
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,520
You...

560
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,400
We'll break through the city

561
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
and break the blood stream.

562
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,120
Can you talk?

563
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,360
We'll build a city

564
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,240
and make the world a better place.

565
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,200
Yes.

566
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,560
What are you doing?

567
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,880
Grand Tutor Song.

568
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,720
Grand Tutor Song.

569
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,880
Grand Tutor Song.

570
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,760
I'm sorry.

571
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,520
Look at you.

572
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,440
You're so mad at Grand Tutor Song.

573
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,720
You're going to see the saint.

574
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,080
Deputy Chief.

575
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,520
Deputy Chief.

576
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,760
Ren Zhi.

577
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
You're finally here.

578
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,360
I can't

579
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,480
control these naughty students.

580
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,720
I just came back to get some books.

581
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,360
Yesterday, you were so disrespectful to Grand Tutor Song.

582
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,440
Didn't you think about the consequences today?

583
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,600
From now on,

584
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,280
listen to the teachings of Grand Tutor Feng

585
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,640
and be patient.

586
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,680
Do you understand?

587
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,320
Yes.

588
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:31,680
I understand.

589
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,280
Miss.

590
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,600
Get the carriage ready.

591
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,280
Let's go.

592
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:35,840
Let's go.

593
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
You don't feel well?

594
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,200
No.

595
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,280
Father.

596
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,160
I'm hungry.

597
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Let's eat.

598
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,400
Do you want to eat?

599
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,600
Go to the Yan's Mansion.

600
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,200
Okay.

601
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,120
Don't go.

602
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,560
Brother.

603
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,160
Deputy Chief Yan is not in the Imperial College.

604
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,320
I have a lot of questions to answer.

605
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,520
Don't think too much.

606
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,880
It's all for learning.

607
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
You're so hardworking.

608
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,240
You want to be a man of honor.

609
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,000
Don't think I don't know

610
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,440
what you did to Grand Tutor Song in the Imperial College.

611
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
Now it's a joke

612
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,080
that the court officials are telling.

613
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,000
If I knew you would cause trouble,

614
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
I shouldn't have let you go to the Imperial College.

615
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
From now on,

616
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,560
you won't go to class.

617
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,120
Don't go out.

618
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,720
Close the door.

619
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,440
Yes.

620
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,720
Yan Ping.

621
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,240
When the lights in Father's room are dimmed,

622
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,760
we'll...

623
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,960
We'll go out from the backyard.

624
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,680
Miss.

625
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,320
Don't talk about me in this trick.

626
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,960
Grand Tutor is also confused.

627
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,440
He almost stepped on his back and left.

628
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,320
Yan Ping.

629
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You're so smart.

630
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,920
You can turn half of your mouth.

631
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,080
How nice.

632
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,040
Why are you here?

633
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,000
Mr. Zhuo.

634
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
How did you get in?

635
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,680
No one can catch your future master.

636
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,680
Who's your master?

637
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,600
What are you doing here?

638
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,920
I'm taking you out for a meal.

639
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,520
Let's go.

640
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,080
Let's go.

641
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,600
Let's go.

642
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,720
Miss.

643
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,560
Miss.

644
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,600
No.

645
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,960
I'm sorry.

646
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,680
I'm sorry.

647
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,320
I'm sorry.

648
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,040
I'm sorry.

649
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,640
I'm sorry.

650
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm sorry.

651
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,280
What do you think

652
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,640
about Deputy Chief's absence?

653
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,560
I think

654
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,840
he's a little bit dull.

655
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,680
Maybe he's feeling down

656
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,040
and crying at home.

657
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,440
No.

658
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,240
I think

659
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
he's doing something bad at home.

660
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,760
Think about it.

661
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,120
How did he deal with us?

662
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,440
How could a thousand-year-old fox

663
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,880
stay at home without any worries?

664
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,560
You said

665
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,600
Deputy Chief

666
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,720
was free and just stroked his feet.

667
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,760
What does that mean?

668
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,880
Is he like this

669
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,640
or like this?

670
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,400
He stroked his feet like this.

671
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:26,960
Mr. Sang.

672
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,880
You're here at the right time.

673
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,520
Mr. Zhuo.

674
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,280
Let's go to the Yan Mansion

675
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,240
and see Deputy Chief.

676
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
Calm down.

677
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,360
You're an old man.

678
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,440
You should calm down.

679
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,800
Although

680
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,760
Deputy Chief's absence

681
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,880
is indeed a big deal.

682
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
But is he

683
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,320
really like this?

684
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
He's not.

685
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,440
Maybe he's feeling down

686
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,600
and doesn't want us to bother him.

687
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,200
Right?

688
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,640
You're usually

689
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,920
very concerned about Deputy Chief.

690
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,400
Why are you suddenly

691
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,480
not concerned about his actions?

692
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,960
No, I...

693
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Right.

694
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
Isn't Sang

695
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,400
the most anxious person?

696
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,640
I...

697
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,600
I'm just like you.

698
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,880
I'm just guessing.

699
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,400
I just think

700
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,840
Deputy Chief is

701
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,520
like this.

702
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,960
If we rush to him,

703
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,200
he'll be upset.

704
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
You don't know

705
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,360
that he's always in the rain.

706
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,160
I can't figure it out.

707
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,600
I'm afraid that

708
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
we'll do something bad, right?

709
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,800
If you insist on going,

710
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,280
I can go with you.

711
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Then...

712
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,480
Let's go.

713
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:56,800
Let's go.

714
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,520
Let's go.

715
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:57,920
Let's go.

716
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,320
Let's go.

717
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:58,920
Let's go.

718
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,440
Let's go.

719
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,240
Let's go.

720
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
Another issue.

721
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,240
It'll be troublesome

722
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
if we disturb Deputy Chief.

723
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,920
Let's go.

724
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,720
Do you think

725
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,160
Deputy Chief will go up the mountain

726
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,680
to find Master to solve it?

727
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,520
Let me tell you.

728
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,480
If you dare to go up the mountain to find Master,

729
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,920
he'll definitely punish you

730
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,400
for pretending to be a thief.

731
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
That's annoying.

732
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,880
It's enough for today.

733
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,600
We've been working so hard to find Deputy Chief.

734
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Maybe he...

735
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,600
He's...

736
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,040
He's in the bathhouse

737
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,800
right?

738
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,600
Let's go back.

739
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
Let's go back.

740
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Right.

741
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
He's not in the bathhouse yet.

742
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Master Sang.

743
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,600
It's inconvenient for women to go there.

744
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,520
But I, Yan Yan,

745
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,680
can't be easily fooled.

746
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,240
I'll go.

747
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,960
No, Yan Yan.

748
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,760
Yan Yan.

749
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,200
You're...

750
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,960
Trust me.

751
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,880
Trust me.

752
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
Trust me.

753
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,360
How could he be in the bathhouse?

754
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,880
I'm so impressed.

755
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,720
You don't know.

756
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,360
How could it be?

757
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,360
Don't...

758
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,320
What do you want me to do?

759
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
You're so romantic.

760
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,720
What did you say?

761
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,720
I just left Guo Zi County.

762
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,080
You changed your mind so quickly.

763
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
Deputy Chief.

764
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,880
You're here.

765
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,600
Don't call me Deputy Chief.

766
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,600
Just call me by my real name.

767
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
You...

768
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Si...

769
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yan Yan.

770
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,400
The maid has been looking for you for a long time.

771
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,440
It's not her fault.

772
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,800
She pulled me and made trouble everywhere.

773
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,720
I'm just trying to relieve your boredom.

774
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,960
She came to my house

775
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,280
to play the piano and draw.

776
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,120
But she drank all my wine.

777
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,800
I took her to the wine room.

778
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,120
She was so drunk.

779
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,480
She refused to go in with me.

780
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
She pulled me.

781
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,280
It's not fair to be rude to a gentleman.

782
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,480
Yan Yan, you know it.

783
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,840
Then drink with me.

784
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,760
I know.

785
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,880
I can drink with you.

786
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,800
I'll drink with you.

787
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Take it.

788
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,240
We'll be good brothers in the future.

789
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,720
We'll go out and have fun together.

790
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,920
We'll drink together.

791
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,360
We won't bring Qing Xuan Jun with us.

792
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,240
To be honest,

793
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,760
I'm tired of it.

794
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,280
I'm your Deputy Chief.

795
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,200
I'm tired of your stupidity.

796
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,520
I finally got out of the bitter sea.

797
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,800
Now I'm no longer your Deputy Chief.

798
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
In the future,

799
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,000
we'll have a lot of time to play together

800
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
and drink together.

801
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,640
But Sang Qi can't bring you with him.

802
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
It's okay.

803
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
In the future,

804
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
you can drink with me.

805
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,680
What are you waiting for?

806
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Let's drink.

807
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
You...

808
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,360
You saw it.

809
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,800
Deputy Chief...

810
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,080
Deputy Chief Qian

811
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,440
is much better than us.

812
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,040
Let's go back to our home.

813
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Let's go back to our home.

814
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
You...

815
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
Brother Yan.

816
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,440
Let's forget about it.

817
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,040
Since we're brothers,

818
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,520
why don't we become sworn brothers

819
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,680
so we can enjoy the beauty together?

820
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
Let's go!

821
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,680
I haven't enough homework.

822
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,320
Am I being teased?

823
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,240
Come on.

824
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,120
Come on.

825
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,200
Bring all the wine out.

826
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,040
What's wrong with you?

827
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,280
You're so drunk.

828
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,000
You're just a private servant of the Imperial College.

829
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,000
You're really going to do nothing

830
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,560
after losing the official position.

831
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,760
Wen Shi.

832
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,040
Bring the wine.

833
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,160
Go get the wine for me.

834
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
If you don't bring the wine out,

835
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,760
I'll tell you what you'll do.

836
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,880
Wen Shi.

837
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,840
Bring it out.

838
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,800
Hurry up.

839
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,960
Qi Lang.

840
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,400
You're being polite.

841
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,720
You'll ruin the reputation of our family.

842
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,440
How can you do that?

843
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,360
Stop drinking.

844
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:51,760
No.

845
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,360
Stop drinking.

846
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,560
You're so drunk.

847
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,160
Alright.

848
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,120
Go, aunt.

849
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,160
Bring the wine out.

850
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,800
Qi Lang.

851
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,200
Let's drink.

852
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,520
Your Highness.

853
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,400
According to the informant,

854
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,840
the team that's going to arrest Lord Wei

855
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,000
has left Bianjing.

856
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
What we can be assured of is

857
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Lord Yan has sent people to protect the Yan family.

858
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,920
Keep an eye on their whereabouts.

859
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
Lord Yan asked me to give you the map.

860
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,720
This is the route to be left.

861
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,760
Jingzhou.

862
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,400
An Shi.

863
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,160
Yes.

864
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,840
Bring a message to Lord Qingxuan for me.

865
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,080
Tell him

866
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,840
I asked him to come to the capital.

867
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,440
Yes.

868
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,040
Yes.

869
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,640
Yes.

870
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,240
Yes.

871
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,840
Yes.

872
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes.

873
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,840
I asked him to go out to have fun.

874
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,160
Tell him to get ready

875
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,320
to pick me up.

876
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,080
Yes, Your Highness.

877
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,960
Miss Su.

878
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,840
Baishi.

879
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,800
What's up?

880
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,720
Is Lord Qingxuan here?

881
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,200
He's awake.

882
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,840
Just tell me if you need anything.

883
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,520
Here's the thing, Miss Su.

884
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,400
My son invited him to go out to have fun.

885
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,200
He asked Lord Qingxuan to come to the mansion

886
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,640
to ask my son to go out.

887
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,120
Okay.

888
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,920
I got it.

889
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,800
Thank you, Miss Su.

890
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,960
Lord Yan is not in the Imperial College.

891
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,440
I don't think you should send a message in person.

892
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,280
Yan Yunzhi left.

893
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
And Dr. Feng is still here.

894
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,080
Have you forgotten?

895
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,200
Dr. Feng is taking over the Imperial College.

896
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,600
He's getting more and more strict.

897
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,840
He's reading his grandpa's homework every day.

898
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,080
I'm still studying hard.

899
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
Unlike Yan Yan.

900
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,560
He can fall asleep in every class.

901
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,920
I'm really convinced of him.

902
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,200
Yan Yan?

903
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,800
He's a really free person.

904
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,560
He can treat Guo Zijian as his family.

905
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,320
He can sleep wherever he wants.

906
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,640
You're called...

907
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,120
What's that?

908
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,440
What's that?

909
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,840
A teacher in the Imperial College.

910
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,080
What are you talking about, Miss?

911
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,040
Qian Yan.

912
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,840
Qian...

913
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,840
Sorry.

914
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Sorry.

915
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,960
Sorry.

916
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,640
It's okay.

917
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,920
Miss Sang Qi.

918
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,920
Let's go.

919
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,760
Lan Ji.

920
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,680
Qi.

921
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,880
Long time no see.

922
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
Long time no see.

923
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,600
You've ordered so many things.

924
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,480
I need to go back to the villa for a while.

925
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,160
Where?

926
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,560
Qi is not pushing me away, right?

927
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,480
What?

928
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,640
I'm just kidding.

929
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,760
Qi is serious.

930
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,200
It's Yun Zhi.

931
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
He asked me to go out for a trip tomorrow.

932
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm here to do some things he likes.

933
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,680
Go out?

934
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,320
Could it be...

935
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,800
I haven't seen Mr. Yan for a long time.

936
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,800
How is he doing recently?

937
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,520
He's free at home.

938
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,560
But the elders are a little anxious.

939
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,120
But I think

940
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,080
it's good for him to take a break.

941
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,080
He was busy with the Imperial College affairs.

942
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,080
I rarely have time to spend with him alone.

943
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,920
It seems Lan Ji is not angry.

944
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,880
That's great.

945
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,160
He's still thinking about going out for a trip.

946
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,680
He said he was not forced to do so.

947
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,640
That's great.

948
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,920
Lan Ji hasn't finished some things yet.

949
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,680
He'll invite Qi to the mansion some other day.

950
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,800
dickey

951
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,200
Given up

952
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,680
You midway

953
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,400
Father,

954
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:33,960
don't worry, the

955
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,520
up quick

956
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Let your blessing of..

957
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,860
I can do it!

958
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,000
It's none of your business!

959
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,080
I can do it!

960
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,560
You mean

961
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,120
Who?

962
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,280
Yeah, who?

963
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,320
Do what?

964
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,280
There's nothing like my rope.

965
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,120
A little compounds is said that

966
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,740
the link

967
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,580
Isn't it?

968
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,520
Start

969
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,480
It's all right.

970
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,960
You're getting late.

971
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,760
gave the rings to our concubine.

972
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,080
Come in.

973
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,080
Many people have been watching us.

974
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm afraid

975
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,320
Lord Wei can't get to us.

976
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,720
It's okay.

977
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,040
There are many people in Jinzhou.

978
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,200
It's a good job.

979
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,600
I'll teach you to change your shape

980
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,840
and prepare to pick up the people.

981
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,920
Yes.

982
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,440
Love Me if you Are Sharp

983
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,120
If it's love's persistence

984
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,120
that has made us fall in love

985
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
I'm the one who has this vision

986
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
If it's attachment

987
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,120
that has made me a part of it

988
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,120
My part

989
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
I can't

990
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,120
hold it

991
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,120
and ignore this perfect story

992
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,120
It's the way

993
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
I feel when I'm crazy

994
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
It's the way

995
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,120
I feel when I'm crazy

996
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
I feel when I'm crazy

997
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
In this small city

998
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,120
I've changed the beginning

999
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
and lost the love that I didn't love

1000
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
I've changed the beginning

1001
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,120
and lost the love that I didn't love

1002
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,120
I've written the lyrics of the new moon

1003
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,120
and I've finished this city

1004
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,120
and I've finished this city

1005
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,120
In the future, I'll break through the barrenness

1006
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,120
and melt into the deep

1007
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,120
and warm room

1008
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
In the future, I'll break through the barrenness

1009
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
and melt into the deep

1010
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,120
and warm room
