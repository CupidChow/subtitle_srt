00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Aка dualick

2
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
For now

3
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,120
Aка dualick

4
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,320
九百年

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,720
Episode 7

6
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,740
I'll easily beat your skull.

7
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,820
Easy.

8
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,440
I'll beat you.

9
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,840
Easy.

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,420
I'll make your head shake.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My Lady, the Taiwei Prefecture is here.

12
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,560
It's good that

13
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,400
we can meet in the Imperial College

14
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,800
from now on.

15
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm not going to read it.

16
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,840
Don't worry.

17
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,200
I remember everything your brother told me.

18
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Besides...

19
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
How dare you say that?

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,200
Let me tell you, Ye Yanzhi.

21
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,440
The truth about Xiaobai is out.

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,600
But you haven't finished

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,640
the thing you hid from me.

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
Didn't I tell you everything just now?

25
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,800
This is a long story.

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,080
And let me remind you.

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,440
It's good that you know

28
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,200
the name Xiaobai in your heart.

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,040
If you dare to say it in front of others,

30
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,920
I'll...

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
What will you do?

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,720
You have the right

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,520
to be in the Imperial College.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,080
But besides the Imperial College,

35
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,400
you can't control me.

36
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
How dare you pretend to be drunk and lie to me?

37
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,760
Qi.

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm here.

39
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,440
Sit down.

40
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,520
It's rare that you invite me to dinner.

41
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
Are you going to celebrate

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
Shangyuan Festival with me?

43
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,160
Not only that.

44
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,760
Yesterday, Lanji took me

45
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,080
to the mansion of the Qingquan Army.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,640
I even met Yan Siyan.

47
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,280
You changed your name to Lanji.

48
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,080
You're the one who invited me to dinner.

49
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,880
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,320
You changed your name to Lanji.

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,200
It seems that you had a good time yesterday.

58
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Yes.

59
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,480
I didn't expect that there are so many interesting people in Bianjing.

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,760
The Qingquan Army.

61
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,400
The style is cool.

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,560
Yan Sanlang is a good man.

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,200
Not to mention Lanji.

64
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,080
This woman is so beautiful.

65
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
As expected, all the girls in Bianjing are not ordinary.

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,120
You didn't take the initiative to know my friend.

67
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,240
You've made friends with Yan Siyan.

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,560
I didn't.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,840
Is this a brother's friend?

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,440
Of course you have to know each other.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
All right.

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,040
They are all very interesting people.

73
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,320
I don't have so many friends

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,080
to introduce to you.

75
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,040
Zhou Wenyuan.

76
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,600
Can you stop talking like this?

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,880
I take you as a good friend.

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,080
You introduce me to your friends.

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,080
Do you remember the girl in front of me on the Spring Festival?

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,240
Oh, her.

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
She is also a lovely girl.

82
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,120
But she was too careless last time.

83
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,640
I didn't look carefully.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,520
In terms of beauty,

85
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,160
the name of Miss Qianjiu

86
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,840
is much more popular in Bianjing than Su Jieyu.

87
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,720
If you have a duty, I can arrange for you to meet.

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,920
Then I'll let you open your eyes.

89
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
Zhou Wenyuan.

90
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,240
The relationship between Miss Qianjiu and you is not shallow, right?

91
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,160
This is not the point.

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,120
The point is that I want you to see

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,160
that there are many interesting people around me.

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,600
Maybe

95
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,080
it's more interesting than the people around Yan Siyue.

96
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
OK.

97
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
All right.

98
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
Guo Zijian will start school tomorrow morning.

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,880
Let's finish eating early and leave early.

100
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
OK.

101
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Fill it up.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Let's go.

103
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,840
In this mountain full of rocks and rocks,

104
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,480
I should be in this mountain.

105
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,120
It's an interesting name.

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Go there.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,080
Let's go.

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,840
I'll leave first.

109
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,880
Mr. Zhuo.

110
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,080
Miss Sang.

111
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,320
Miss Sang has been in the military camp

112
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,560
for too long.

113
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,960
She called me fairy when she saw me.

114
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I brought her here

115
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
to see

116
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,240
what the most famous fairy in Bianjing looks like.

117
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,680
Mr. Zhuo, you're kidding.

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,440
Qian Jiu is just a mortal girl.

119
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,360
How can you say she's a fairy?

120
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,560
If you're a mortal girl,

121
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,200
then...

122
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
You're a heroine.

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,400
Mr. Zhuo, Miss Sang.

124
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,000
Please come with me.

125
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,720
Let's go.

126
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,920
Mr. Zhuo.

127
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,760
Miss Sang Qi.

128
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,200
Sorry for bothering you.

129
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,960
I smelled

130
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,000
a scented쪽

131
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,760
after I doorsopped Qian Jiu.

132
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,920
And your lips.

133
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,040
Are these defenses made of ink?

134
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,520
Or does this must be the nature of a beauty?

135
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,360
What do you mean?

136
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,800
This is a secret of women.

137
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,000
Men can't know it.

138
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,320
Please make yourself at home, Mr. Zhuo.

139
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,280
Miss Sang, please come with me.

140
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,840
Make yourself at home.

141
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,520
the fragrance dashingly goes off

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
in no time.

143
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,400
As for the spices,

144
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,120
it will as soon as possible

145
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,280
be cleared away.

146
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,080
Compared to this,

147
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,880
I prefer to dip the oil

148
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:42,160
in the incense and�

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,080
and the marigold

150
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
After the rouge,

151
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,440
cover it with a thin layer of powder.

152
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,440
Then it will be natural

153
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,840
and not easy to eat.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,640
Beauty relies on the atmosphere

155
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,160
and the language of the body.

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,880
Qian Jiu,

157
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,360
don't listen to Zhuo Wen Yuan.

158
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
I haven't seen

159
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,480
a beautiful woman in this world.

160
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,760
But I think

161
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
every woman

162
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,280
has her own beauty.

163
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,960
If you are kind and sincere,

164
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,560
I will be impressed.

165
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,760
Then Qian Jiu should be impressed.

166
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,640
I only heard about

167
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,200
Miss Sang Qi's name.

168
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,000
Today I know

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,680
you are the most different person

170
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,240
in Bianjing.

171
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,080
You are so kind.

172
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,320
Miss Qian Jiu

173
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
is the secretary of the Imperial College.

174
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,480
How can I serve you?

175
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,600
I know

176
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,200
you have a deep love for Miss Sang Qi.

177
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,880
I just don't know

178
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,920
if you are also moved.

179
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,680
No, no, no.

180
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
You misunderstood.

181
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,720
I am brothers with you.

182
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Brothers?

183
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,160
Ed drawers for yo us to get water.

184
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,040
There are many strands of相信 here.

185
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,640
You can try it.

186
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,720
Thank you.

187
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,480
Miss Sang Qi, I have new powder here.

188
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,240
I'll get you some.

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,680
The

190
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,680
Miss Qingluo,

191
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,440
it's getting late.

192
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
I should go back.

193
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:14,880
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

194
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

195
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,840
Wake up.

196
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,440
Get up.

197
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,720
Get up.

198
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,760
It's done.

199
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,040
It's done.

200
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm going home.

201
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,360
Let's go.

202
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,360
Young Master.

203
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Tea for the new wife.

204
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,720
Next time.

205
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,800
No.

206
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,360
You can stay here.

207
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,400
I'll take the carriage.

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,280
I don't need anyone to accompany me.

209
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,440
But I...

210
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,960
Young Master.

211
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,440
Let me go tell the carer

212
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,160
to send Miss Sang Qi home.

213
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,080
Thank you.

214
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,280
I'll go now.

215
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,800
I'll go.

216
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,480
Don't worry.

217
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,280
I'm fine.

218
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,320
All right.

219
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
Be careful.

220
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,560
It's no big deal.

221
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,400
All right.

222
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,440
You can go home.

223
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,760
Thank you for your hospitality.

224
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,800
We'll meet again.

225
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,400
It's my pleasure, Miss Sang Qi.

226
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm leaving.

227
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,360
Go.

228
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,000
Go.

229
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,560
Go.

230
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,160
Go.

231
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,960
Go.

232
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,720
Go.

233
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,400
Go.

234
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,200
Go.

235
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,840
Go.

236
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,600
Go.

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,720
Who is it?

238
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,000
How dare you

239
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,640
come to pick me up?

240
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
How old are you?

241
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,120
You're preference.

242
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,360
You can also make a home song.

243
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,160
Listen.

244
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,600
You think that I'm not a handle?

245
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,240
But my wife

246
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,800
is inconvenienced by being ill at home.

247
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,920
Then I don't know

248
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,040
I can't go to P TD.

249
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,400
I'll take you back home

250
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,080
tomorrow.

251
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,120
Don't worry.

252
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't worry.

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,080
Nothing will go wrong

254
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,080
with Xia loc.

255
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,760
Go.

256
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,360
Go.

257
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,920
Go.

258
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,520
Go.

259
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,280
Don't go.

260
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,520
I just warmed up and ran away.

261
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,760
I haven't been in the mood.

262
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,440
Come back.

263
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,680
Wait, sir.

264
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,880
Sir, may I know your name?

265
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,720
I'm just a passerby.

266
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,760
I don't have a name.

267
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,880
Miss, it's dangerous at night.

268
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,920
You should be careful.

269
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,240
So this is what Hua Ping said.

270
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Who goes to the grave first?

271
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,720
Yes.

272
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,160
What time is it now?

273
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,520
Why hasn't Qi come back yet?

274
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,840
A few days ago,

275
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,680
Deng Hui made a mess.

276
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,440
He didn't know he was afraid.

277
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,360
And you.

278
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,040
Why don't you keep an eye on him?

279
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,680
Tell him to come back earlier.

280
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,320
Sir,

281
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,720
Mr. Zhuo asked Miss out.

282
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,040
I can't keep up with him.

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,040
Zhuo Wenyuan.

284
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,840
In theory,

285
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,040
he's a loyal man.

286
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,440
If I were with him,

287
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,000
I'd be more at ease.

288
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,720
I know the mind of Zhuo's son.

289
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,720
Sir, do you think

290
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
Mr. Zhuo has a good chance?

291
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,960
You don't know your daughter?

292
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,280
I think Zhuo Wenyuan is a good man.

293
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,800
But what's the use of keeping an eye on me?

294
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,600
But if he keeps

295
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,160
following Qi's temper,

296
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,480
he'll be back early and be fine.

297
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,240
I have to say a few words to him.

298
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,440
If you can't tell your child,

299
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,640
you can say someone else's child.

300
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,440
You.

301
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,160
You've learned from Qi.

302
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,320
You're the lowest in the world.

303
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,920
Wait and see.

304
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,080
When he comes back,

305
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,480
I'll scold him hard.

306
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,360
I'll tell him who's in charge of the Tai Mei Bureau.

307
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,440
You're a fool.

308
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,160
Miss is back.

309
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,120
Master, Miss is injured.

310
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,000
Father.

311
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,640
Miss.

312
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,520
Qi.

313
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,440
What's wrong with you?

314
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,520
Father.

315
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
What's wrong with you?

316
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,560
It's okay.

317
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,840
Aren't you with Zhuo Wenyuan?

318
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,720
Why didn't he send you back?

319
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,480
Go to the doctor.

320
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,120
Go.

321
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,640
Get my medicine.

322
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
It's okay. It's just a wound.

323
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,480
Use some help.

324
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,580
Go back to the hotel,

325
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,920
we may see him all over the world.

326
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,680
People不是放轻 trainees.

327
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,840
I...

328
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,440
I'm sorry .

329
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,400
I wouldn't cause you worry next time.

330
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,880
It's rare for you to admit that you are wrong.

331
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,480
I have to be worried about you every day.

332
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,040
Isn't Zhong Yan with you?

333
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,600
Why didn't he send you back?

334
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,080
We went together.

335
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,880
But when we were about to leave,

336
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,120
he couldn't take his clothes off

337
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,520
and sent someone to send me back.

338
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,040
I didn't expect to be attacked.

339
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,960
Attack?

340
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
Did you see clearly?

341
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,120
This matter

342
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,120
must be reported to the Imperial Secretariat immediately.

343
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
We must find out

344
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,600
if these people

345
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,160
are after you.

346
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,840
Lian Mian,

347
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,280
take Miss Fu back to her room to rest.

348
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,040
Yes.

349
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,880
Miss, be careful.

350
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Report to the Imperial Secretariat.

351
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,640
Yes.

352
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,920
Miss,

353
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,600
you should listen to Master more.

354
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,520
He misses you a lot.

355
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,640
Before you came back,

356
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,320
he was so worried

357
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,640
that he wanted to teach you a good lesson.

358
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,320
But when he saw you were injured,

359
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,560
he said it right away.

360
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,840
Master

361
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,160
has never been soft with anyone in his life.

362
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,880
He only cares about you,

363
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,680
as his daughter.

364
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Is it

365
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
him?

366
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
Who is it?

367
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,240
Miss, what are you thinking about?

368
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,320
I...

369
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,360
I'm thinking about a woman.

370
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,880
A woman?

371
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,080
Master.

372
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,480
Have you reported to the Imperial Secretariat?

373
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,400
Yes.

374
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
I've already sent the message.

375
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,520
I've sent it to the Imperial Secretariat.

376
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,920
I've sent it to the Imperial Secretariat.

377
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,160
I've sent it to the Imperial Secretariat.

378
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,400
I've sent it to the Imperial Secretariat.

379
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,600
Have you sent it to the Imperial Secretariat?

380
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,440
They've already organized a manpower

381
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,400
and a special investigation.

382
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,080
They'll definitely give you an explanation.

383
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
We can't just rely on them.

384
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,640
If we don't send the message,

385
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,720
I don't believe that my Sang's Army

386
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,840
can't catch a thief who's been attacked.

387
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
Miss, you're awake.

388
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,120
What time is it now?

389
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,840
It's already past the time to go to school.

390
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,840
Don't worry.

391
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,040
Master has already sent someone

392
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,480
to ask for leave from the Imperial Secretariat.

393
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,120
He said that you need to recuperate at home.

394
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,520
I just asked for leave for a few days.

395
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,560
That's not good.

396
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Look at your leg.

397
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,120
I know that you want to work hard.

398
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,280
But I'm worried that you'll get hurt.

399
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,400
All right.

400
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,480
Miss, Mr. Yan is here to visit you.

401
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,960
Sang Ye.

402
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,200
My grandpa is here to visit you, Sang Ye.

403
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,240
Why are you here?

404
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Shouldn't Guo Zi Jian still be in class?

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,720
You're still young.

406
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,600
Guo Zi Jian has already

407
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,360
been talking about Sang Ye's attack.

408
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,080
Sang Ye is injured.

409
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,960
How can I still be there to teach him a lesson?

410
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,560
Let me go in and have a look.

411
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,800
Go. Go. Go.

412
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,440
You're a man.

413
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,200
How dare you talk about it in Miss's room?

414
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,560
Besides,

415
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,520
you're not the only one who's injured.

416
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,120
You're the one who's injured.

417
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,040
Besides,

418
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Miss is just a little bit thinner.

419
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,360
She's fine.

420
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,240
She's resting now.

421
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
Don't bother her.

422
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,000
But I've brought my stuff.

423
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,600
You can't...

424
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,400
I'll give it to her for you.

425
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,600
Let's go.

426
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,960
Remember to give it to her.

427
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,200
No.

428
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,120
Why did I leave?

429
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm scared.

430
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,920
It's Yan Xiao Lang.

431
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,720
He even broke into the room.

432
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,160
He's so rude.

433
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,680
But I've sent the message.

434
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,360
You can rest in peace.

435
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,240
Yan Xiao Lang is

436
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,520
the son of the Grand Tutor.

437
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,120
You're just a fool.

438
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,480
He's amazing.

439
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,640
He's a perfect match.

440
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,840
He?

441
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,960
I'm not that good.

442
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,080
I think you're just injured.

443
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,360
You're still trying to tease me.

444
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,880
I've recovered from the wound.

445
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,320
I can run away immediately.

446
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,760
It's nothing.

447
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,080
Deputy Chief Yan is here.

448
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,520
It's Deputy Chief Yan this time.

449
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,720
Yan Yun Zhi?

450
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,640
He's here...

451
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,640
He's here to prepare something.

452
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,560
Let's go.

453
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,600
Let's wash the books.

454
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,720
Let's go.

455
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Deputy Chief Yan.

456
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,320
The evil wind of Neigu

457
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
blew you here.

458
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,280
Your leg is injured.

459
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,920
It shouldn't affect your reading of the poem, right?

460
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,840
You're so stupid to come here.

461
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,560
I heard about your jade flag.

462
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,160
The Imperial Court of Jingzhao has started to investigate.

463
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,680
When you're almost recovered,

464
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,040
Deputy Chief Yan will come to ask you some questions.

465
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,360
The injury is nothing.

466
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,720
I need to find out who is the real master.

467
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,440
I was able to escape from the mountain last night.

468
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,280
Thanks to the help of that master.

469
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,440
Master?

470
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,160
That master

471
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,880
flew down from the sky

472
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,920
and walked like the wind.

473
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,000
He was so powerful.

474
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,920
He beat that thief

475
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,400
like a flower.

476
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,360
Those moves...

477
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,200
Hurry up.

478
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
Hurry up.

479
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Hurry up.

480
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,360
Hurry up.

481
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,720
Stop acting.

482
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,480
Sit down.

483
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,200
You...

484
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,360
Then...

485
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
I don't want to hear it.

486
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,480
Then that thief

487
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,920
was kicked by half of the people.

488
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,160
Deputy Chief Yan, you...

489
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,560
I'm afraid that the weapon of the thief is poisonous.

490
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,400
Don't think too much.

491
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,520
Although you're a naughty student

492
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,960
that I like,

493
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,320
naughty and naughty,

494
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,880
and you're not successful in your studies,

495
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,880
and you've failed to live up to

496
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,160
the expectation that Yuxiu has for you.

497
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,880
But...

498
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,080
Luckily, you're quick to dodge.

499
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,400
That thief

500
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,560
really went to kill you

501
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
and made a great effort.

502
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,280
The weapon is also very powerful.

503
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,160
It's very powerful.

504
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
It's very powerful.

505
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,880
What did you do last night?

506
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,360
I asked Zhuo Wen Yuan

507
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,560
to make an appointment with Miss Qian Jiu.

508
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,320
After coming out of her villa,

509
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Qian Jiu?

510
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,920
Villa? What villa?

511
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,520
It's called

512
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,240
Purple Mountain Pearl.

513
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,560
It's similar to the one in Qingxuan Jun.

514
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,720
Deputy Chief,

515
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,440
what kind of person have I met

516
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,520
that wants to ambush me?

517
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,040
You were poisoned first,

518
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,160
and now you're assassinated.

519
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,120
Can't you be quiet?

520
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,360
Don't investigate those things.

521
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,040
If you study hard,

522
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,160
you won't have these things.

523
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,680
Deputy Chief,

524
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,240
you're too mean.

525
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,040
If we encounter such things,

526
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,720
if we don't act now,

527
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,680
what if they

528
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,920
are against the innocent next time?

529
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,680
I suspect that

530
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,000
they are going to

531
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,560
kill Zhuo Wen Yuan and Qian Jiu.

532
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,280
You're still in the mood to worry about others?

533
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,040
Deputy Chief,

534
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,000
have you ever seen

535
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
such a pattern?

536
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,880
Where did you see this pattern?

537
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,680
On the shoulder of that thief.

538
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,240
And?

539
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,040
And what?

540
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,680
You still have the time to talk?

541
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,640
I'm afraid that I'm wrong.

542
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,480
Aren't you afraid that I'm wrong?

543
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,960
And?

544
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,440
There's also a pattern on the back of Qian Jiu's back.

545
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,320
I know.

546
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,080
You don't have to think about it anymore.

547
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,800
I'll investigate it.

548
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,720
But, Deputy Chief, don't worry.

549
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,480
Zhuo Wen Yuan won't harm me.

550
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,600
I'm just worried that he'll be involved in

551
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,320
some dangers that I don't even know about.

552
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,680
I told you not to worry about others.

553
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,640
Zhuo Wen Yuan is also my student.

554
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,280
I'll go investigate this matter.

555
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,080
Let's talk about it.

556
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,720
What did you do

557
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,520
in the villa last night?

558
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,320
You're so good-looking.

559
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,520
You're so kind.

560
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,960
I went to see a beauty.

561
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,760
Besides, I learned a lot.

562
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,920
What did you learn?

563
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,840
What else did you learn besides being injured?

564
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,040
Listen to me.

565
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,880
I found that there are all kinds of beauties

566
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,240
in this world.

567
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,520
For example, Sister Su.

568
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,560
She's talented, elegant,

569
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,240
and she's a good listener.

570
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
For example, Miss Qian Jiu.

571
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,640
She's perfect and has a beautiful style.

572
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,440
And also, Sun Jiayin.

573
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,760
Although she's not my type,

574
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,040
I think there must be something wrong with her.

575
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,080
But she's so proud and elegant.

576
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,920
There are some beauties that are her style.

577
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,440
And some that are different.

578
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,960
You don't have to see other people's beauty.

579
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,640
You can look at yourself when you're back.

580
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,560
You can be cool and free.

581
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,520
You're unique.

582
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
The unique trouble

583
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,400
is the most troublesome student I've ever seen.

584
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,280
Give me back my leg.

585
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,720
Don't hold me.

586
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,880
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

587
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:37,880
I'm flattered.

588
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm not a good girl.

589
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,480
I'll go back and lie down if there's nothing else.

590
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,480
Let's go.

591
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,480
Wait.

592
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,280
Did you forget something?

593
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,200
Take your body and medicine.

594
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
Miss, let's go.

595
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,880
Let's go.

596
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,680
Master.

597
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,240
Baishi,

598
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,840
from today on, Sang Qi will go to school every day.

599
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,760
You should follow him to ensure his safety.

600
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,280
I...

601
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,600
Yes, Master.

602
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,400
In the future,

603
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,440
Misty Li will never be vereign to you.

604
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,800
You must stay at the school safely.

605
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,680
Yes.

606
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,400
Miss,

607
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,200
I have a individual letter for you.

608
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,800
I'm sorry I've had to bother you finishing your paper.

609
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,080
No worries.

610
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,360
I'll let you know as soon as I'm done.

611
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,240
Do you see me as being unfriendly?

612
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,840
Trust me.

613
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,040
Finish your paper.

614
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,480
Yes.

615
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,760
Think of yourself as Ilu.

616
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,200
You are the겠지만 of the world.

617
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,400
Who is so bold to be so cruel to you?

618
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,640
If you are caught,

619
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,800
I, Ruo Wan Yuan, will be the first one to let him go.

620
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,040
Come on.

621
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,040
I don't know how many times I've heard this sentence.

622
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,800
If you want to avenge me,

623
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,360
it has to be after my father.

624
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,800
My father has been scolding and scolding for a long time.

625
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,800
I guess he's still here.

626
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,440
By the way,

627
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,480
you didn't meet any danger last night, right?

628
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,080
Miss Qian Jiu, everything is fine.

629
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,120
We're fine.

630
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
It's all my fault.

631
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,920
If I sent you back yesterday,

632
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,280
I wouldn't have hurt you.

633
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,400
You have to take me to school every day.

634
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
So I can help you get out of school.

635
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
No need.

636
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,880
That thief is very skilled.

637
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,320
If he takes you with him,

638
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,400
it's just a head-on delivery.

639
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,720
There's no need for that.

640
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,080
Qi,

641
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm just a pillow in your eyes.

642
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Come on.

643
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,160
Don't pretend in front of me.

644
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,880
We had a fight when we were kids.

645
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
What do you think?

646
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,680
Don't worry.

647
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,040
I'll go back to Guozi's room tomorrow.

648
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,240
Everything will be as before.

649
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,760
Don't worry.

650
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,680
Okay.

651
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,480
Tell me if you need anything in the future.

652
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,560
I'll do it for you.

653
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,600
Okay.

654
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,560
The sculpting pattern that Sang Qi saw

655
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,120
is a unique one of the organization.

656
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,680
It symbolizes the identity of the member.

657
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,720
Anyone with this pattern

658
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,040
is either a spy of the Situang Empire

659
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,440
or a black market trader

660
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,840
or a killer.

661
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,960
Anyway, they are all useless.

662
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,920
It's hard to check.

663
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,520
A few years ago,

664
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,520
the court ordered the arrest of members of the West Regions.

665
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,560
After several investigations,

666
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,160
the West Regions was in a state of emergency.

667
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,120
Although the important members have been caught,

668
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,560
their leader is still unknown.

669
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,280
No one knows his identity.

670
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,760
It seems that the court's investigation has not been complete for years.

671
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,800
It's finally a new beginning.

672
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:55,960
By the way,

673
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,960
Mr. Cang,

674
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,760
don't be too anxious to investigate the former prisoner.

675
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,240
He is in the Qingfeng Building.

676
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,800
There are many people there.

677
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,520
I'm afraid that if something goes wrong,

678
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
Sang Qi will be in danger.

679
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,680
I understand.

680
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,840
I'll report to the official the other day.

681
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,840
I'll also give an explanation to Mr. Sang.

682
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,520
Mr. Qi, be careful.

683
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,600
We have a relationship.

684
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,280
I don't want anything to happen to the Sang family.

685
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
But no matter how well I prepare,

686
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
they will always control me.

687
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,520
If Sang Qi has the ability to protect himself,

688
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,600
if there is a master who is better than me

689
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,920
and is willing to teach Sang Qi martial arts,

690
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
that would be the best.

691
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,680
Better than you?

692
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,360
I'm afraid that it's hard to find someone

693
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,160
who can fight with you in Bianjing.

694
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,800
Then go out of the city.

695
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,400
Just avoid danger.

696
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,960
Go.

697
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,520
Master Sang.

698
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,200
Walk slowly.

699
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,000
I'll be fine.

700
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,520
Thank you.

701
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,200
Master Sang.

702
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,320
Why don't you rest for a few days?

703
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,280
Why are you here today?

704
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,560
Why should I rest for a few days?

705
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,120
Are you trying to embarrass me?

706
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,560
That's why I said

707
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,480
not to be too arrogant.

708
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,880
Be careful not to be reminded by the thief.

709
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,800
No one can beat you

710
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,640
in terms of being arrogant.

711
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,280
That's right.

712
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,320
Master Sang.

713
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,920
You should have asked me to do the math a few days ago.

714
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,520
I knew you had a bloodthirsty disaster.

715
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,960
When did your turtle shell

716
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,400
do the math?

717
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,960
Well...

718
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,840
Master Sang.

719
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,880
Tell me.

720
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,680
How did you escape from the ghost?

721
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,560
That's right.

722
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,200
Want to hear it for free?

723
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,240
Think about it.

724
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:05,720
Go over there.

725
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,040
That's a moonlit night.

726
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,080
I was in the car.

727
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,200
The thief

728
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,880
suddenly came out of the bamboo forest.

729
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,200
And I knocked down the lady in the car.

730
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,600
I...

731
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,680
What happened next?

732
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,320
I could"...

733
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,560
...improve histi Main drink sympathiscli.

734
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,440
But I can't!

735
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,040
The car immediately knocked down

736
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,440
to be with him.

737
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,680
I thought

738
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,440
only one thing to think then.

739
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,880
Justice!

740
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,080
They were slow.

741
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,400
Well-done.

742
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
Ink dough.

743
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,520
Well-done.

744
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,280
You're amazing.

745
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,440
Let's go.

746
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,240
Deputy Chief.

747
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Let's go.

748
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,440
I'm not done yet.

749
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,400
Where are you?

750
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,560
You're already in class.

751
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,400
Why are you still reading?

752
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Have you finished memorizing the text?

753
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,280
Deputy Chief.

754
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,360
Sang Qi.

755
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,480
Don't mention the incident that night

756
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,840
to anyone else.

757
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,920
I know.

758
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,480
Go back to your room.

759
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,360
My past private life

760
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,080
will be帰awl

761
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,520
separated from care.

762
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,920
When everything is kept alive,

763
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,280
the rest will be guided by the pain to practice.

764
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,600
The last to master Houtou

765
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,520
master is of the last career.

766
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,080
Theheavy pressure

767
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,240
leads to nail and plate pointing.

768
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,880
Forرا

769
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,560
Leave it alone.

770
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,120
See how it's done at home.

771
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,280
Jia Qi.

772
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,280
Jia Qi.

773
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,440
The country is the foundation of the country.

774
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,520
The foundation of the country.

775
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,640
The foundation of the country.

776
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,640
From the emperor to the common people.

777
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,760
They all have the foundation of cultivation.

778
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,360
The foundation of the country.

779
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,160
The one who doesn't have the foundation is the king.

780
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,360
The one who doesn't have the foundation is the king.

781
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,960
At last, I have a plan.

782
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,960
I want to see the eyes smile and smile.

783
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,360
I want to hear a joke.

784
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,800
I want to be with you in the dream.

785
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,160
I want to be a simple person.

786
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,520
I want to spend my life without regrets.

787
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,960
I want to spend my life under the moon.

788
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,520
I want to see the morning sun.

789
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,760
I want to be with you in the dream.

790
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,000
I want to be with you in the dream.

791
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
I want to be with you in the dream.

792
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,800
I want to be with you in the dream.

793
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,240
I want to be with you in the dream.

794
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,600
I want to be with you in the dream.

795
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,560
I want to be with you in the dream.

796
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
I want to be with you in the dream.

797
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,240
I want to be with you in the dream.

798
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,000
I want to be with you in the dream.

799
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,240
I want to be with you in the dream.

800
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,760
I want to be with you in the dream.

801
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,040
Sang Qi.

802
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,600
The wind blew through the world.

803
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,960
The peach blossom is blooming.

804
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,400
What are you doing?

805
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,680
Thank you, Zhou Zheng.

806
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,160
Si Ye, aren't you going to school?

807
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,240
Go home.

808
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,080
Don't stay outside.

809
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,200
Go home.

810
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
Go home.

811
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,840
Go home.

812
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,160
Go home.

813
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,160
I want to be a simple person.

814
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
I want to spend my life without regrets.

815
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,840
I want to spend my life without regrets.

816
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,200
I want to spend my life under the moon.

817
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,840
Looking at the morning and evening in my dream.

818
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,000
The 나는 find a flower of strength.

819
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:41,100
The

820
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,040
I'm sorry.

821
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,760
Father, you're finally back.

822
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,160
You...

823
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,600
You're so rude.

824
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,280
I just heard from the palace

825
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,160
that you were assassinated

826
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,200
by the Xizhao people.

827
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,600
If they keep an eye on you,

828
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,960
you'll be dead.

829
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,240
If anything happens to you,

830
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,720
I won't live.

831
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,200
Father, don't say that.

832
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,480
Xizhao?

833
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,600
I heard about it

834
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,880
when I was at the border.

835
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,760
The beauty is the most important thing.

836
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,320
Will the Xizhao people still be afraid of the concubines?

837
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,680
Listen up.

838
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,840
Miss is the second time she's been hurt.

839
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,240
From now on,

840
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,040
don't be rude to her.

841
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,400
You can't insult her.

842
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,560
Yes.

843
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,560
Father.

844
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,120
Father, you...

845
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,800
I can jump.

846
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,160
I can run.

847
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,160
I can do anything.

848
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,200
I can barely fly.

849
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
Don't be rude to me.

850
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,520
I have to go out...

851
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,080
I have to go out.

852
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,080
Father.

853
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,280
Especially you, Lianpian.

854
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,560
I...

855
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,360
If you help Miss run away again,

856
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,360
I'll send you back to your hometown.

857
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,320
Father.

858
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,680
Miss, I don't want to go back.

859
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm just scaring you.

860
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,680
Fine.

861
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,240
I won't go out.

862
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,360
Miss.

863
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,160
Let's go back and rest.

864
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,520
You're going too far

865
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,200
by not letting us go out.

866
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,920
Father knows we love going out.

867
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,920
I'm sorry.

868
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,800
I'm sorry.

869
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,760
I'm sorry.

870
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,800
I'm sorry.

871
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,760
I'm sorry.

872
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
I'm sorry.

873
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm sorry.

874
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,760
I'm sorry.

875
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm sorry.

876
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,760
I'm sorry.

877
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,760
I'm sorry.

878
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,760
I'm sorry.

879
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,640
I'm afraid of being attacked.

880
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,080
Why are you calling me a coward?

881
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,880
Father is doing this for your own good.

882
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,760
He's old.

883
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,480
He doesn't want to pursue anything else.

884
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,040
The only thing he cares about

885
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,120
is you.

886
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,400
Lianpian.

887
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,800
If I find this old man

888
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,600
and learn martial arts from him,

889
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,920
I won't be afraid of being ambushed again.

890
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,280
I'll beat him up.

891
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,080
Then father won't have to worry about me.

892
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,280
Am I right?

893
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Lianpian.

894
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,440
Don't think about it.

895
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,560
Lianpian.

896
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
No.

897
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,760
Don't go anywhere.

898
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,040
I promised father.

899
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,760
I don't want to go back to my hometown.

900
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,560
I'm scaring you.

901
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,560
No.

902
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,840
I won't go anywhere.

903
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,160
I'll just watch you.

904
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,040
Then just watch me.

905
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,680
Be careful.

906
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
Be careful.

907
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,360
Let's go.

908
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
Be careful.

909
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,640
It's all because of the wind.

910
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,840
The wind.

911
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,120
Let's do it like a gentleman.

912
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Be a gentleman.

913
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,120
High God.

914
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,840
Please worship me.

915
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,400
Deputy Chief.

916
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
Deputy Chief, why are you here?

917
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:43,760
What's wrong with me?

918
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,000
Well...

919
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,240
Why are you here?

920
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,520
Why can't I be here?

921
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,120
It's so late. Why are you here?

922
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,280
I should be the one asking.

923
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,360
You're not seriously injured.

924
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,360
Come back again.

925
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,800
No, look at what you said.

926
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,680
I'm here to pay my respects to the snow-capped wolf.

927
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,160
I didn't find the master.

928
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,000
I just pay my respects to Deputy Chief.

929
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,280
I'm your Deputy Chief.

930
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,240
It's not a big deal.

931
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,760
It's so late. Go back.

932
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,280
Listen, don't think about it anymore.

933
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,240
There are no other people on the mountain.

934
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,480
The master you mentioned may just pass by.

935
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,960
Deputy Chief.

936
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,200
You know me so well.

937
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,720
Why don't you give me a way out?

938
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:29,520
Go back to the mansion.

939
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,480
No!

940
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:40,800
Keep up.

941
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,840
I'm careless.

942
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,280
Master.

943
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,120
If it's the persistence of love,

944
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,560
we will be deeply in love with each other.

945
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,080
I am the one who owns this life.

946
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,240
If it's the past,

947
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,480
it will become my distance.

948
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,880
My distance.

949
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,960
I can never be unknown.

950
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,200
I will never forget this perfect story.

951
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,080
It's the way I am when I'm in the wind.

952
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,320
The way I am when I'm in the wind.

953
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,800
The city in the distance.

954
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,760
Changed its beginning.

955
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,360
It's the time of love.

956
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,920
I write the words of the new moon.

957
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,520
I also end this life in silence.

958
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,800
In the future, we will be in love with each other.

959
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:31,480
We will be deeply in love with each other.

960
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,840
In the future, we will be in love with each other.

961
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:39,560
We will be deeply in love with each other.
