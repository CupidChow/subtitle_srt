1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
The wind blew through the world

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,000
Blowing open the flow of the peach blossom

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,300
The story in the book

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,400
Always has a touching scene

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Amazing

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Who is the best? Who is the best? The wind is not over

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,500
I look back at someone smiling

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,900
The heart is in the sky

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,300
The red string has your identity

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,500
The wind is not over

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,000
I look back at someone smiling

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
The moon is like a hundred years

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,900
The wind blows through the world

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,300
The sound of the flute is like a wind

15
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,700
The sound of the flute is like a wind

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,800
The story in the book

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,400
Always has a touching scene

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Amazing

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,200
The story in the book

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
Always has a touching scene

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,100
Amazing

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,300
The blue sky is like a blue sand

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,000
The rain is like a wild wild geese

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,300
The wind is not over

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,800
The story in the book

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,300
Always has a touching scene

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Episode 2

28
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Are you okay?

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,300
He's here. He's here.

30
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
He's here.

31
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Thank you for saving my life.

32
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,300
It's nothing.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,300
I've seen your ability today.

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,300
I admire your body.

35
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,300
I've offended you before.

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,300
If you need anything from me,

37
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,800
please tell me.

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
I'll do my best.

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
It was a misunderstanding.

40
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Don't take it to heart.

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,300
I'll forget it later.

42
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,300
You're really generous.

43
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,300
I'm not inferior to you.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Please sit down.

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Please.

46
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Please.

47
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Sit down.

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
I'm not inferior to you.

49
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
I'll get married.

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,300
You're a good man.

51
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I'll get married.

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
I'll get married.

53
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
I'll get married.

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,300
I'll get married.

55
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,300
I'll get married.

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,300
Grandpa, do you plan to pray to me?

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,060
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,860
Here.

59
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:05,980
Here you are.

60
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,700
Thank you.

61
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,060
This is the scene of the murder.

62
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,020
It's also the crime scene.

63
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,540
I've checked it with my men.

64
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,900
But I didn't find any clues.

65
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,580
So I asked you to come and help me.

66
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:22,780
Bai Shi.

67
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,400
aqui vamos

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,360
Through the door separately.

69
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,160
Yes.

70
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,860
Two months later

71
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,460
I find him important.

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,580
It's like being cleaned up.

73
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,140
There's no clue left.

74
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,380
The family was here a few days ago.

75
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,540
Why did they leave so suddenly?

76
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,900
Move the table away.

77
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,140
What's this?

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,940
Put it away. Take it back for inspection.

79
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,940
Yes.

80
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,620
It seems that you suspect

81
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,100
Sang Yu died at the hands of someone else.

82
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,660
I was half-heartedly suspicious at that time.

83
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,260
Now it seems that

84
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,300
you're right.

85
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,980
The deceased in this case

86
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,300
is very similar to the one who died in Sang Yu's case.

87
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,660
And the family disappeared in the air.

88
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,660
It's really strange.

89
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,660
Maybe

90
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,940
there's something between them.

91
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,180
As long as we find out the source of the poison,

92
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,780
we can solve this.

93
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,620
Qi Lang,

94
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,580
you're the master of the case in Bianjing.

95
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,900
If it weren't for your help these years,

96
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,140
I don't know how many cases

97
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,860
our Jingzhao Mansion would have been in.

98
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,900
Don't worry.

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
This time, our Jingzhao Mansion

100
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,380
will do our best to help.

101
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,140
We will help Sang Yu get justice.

102
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,220
Thank you.

103
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,300
By the way,

104
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,460
Sang Qi is studying at the Imperial College.

105
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,260
She's

106
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,500
an old friend's sister.

107
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,340
You should take care of her.

108
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,140
Don't let her be bullied.

109
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,220
She

110
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,980
was bullied?

111
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,980
Protect the evidence. I'll go after her.

112
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,460
Okay.

113
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,980
Go.

114
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,580
Censor Mansion?

115
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,540
Who is it?

116
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,340
Who is it?

117
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,900
What are you doing?

118
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,340
I...

119
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,300
I said I'm here to visit my parents.

120
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:51,940
Do you believe me?

121
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,500
Visit your parents?

122
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,380
No.

123
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,740
I don't think you'll believe me.

124
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,420
I'm leaving.

125
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,300
There's an assassin.

126
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,060
Go after him.

127
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,580
Hurry.

128
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:01,940
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,900
Are they here to arrest you?

130
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,220
I'm talking to you.

131
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:06,980
I...

132
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,260
I was helping the Jinzhao family to arrest the thief.

133
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,980
I saw the thief entered the Taiwei mansion

134
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
and heard you screaming.

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,900
I thought you were in danger.

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,780
So I came in.

137
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,060
Really?

138
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,540
If you don't believe me,

139
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,980
I'll explain it to them.

140
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,500
Come on.

141
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
What's there to explain?

142
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,540
How can you explain

143
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,260
when you're alone?

144
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,300
It's even more difficult to explain.

145
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,620
Fine.

146
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,620
You saved me when I was in the archery class.

147
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,060
Today, I'll save you.

148
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,180
We'll be even.

149
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,820
What do you think?

150
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,580
Fine.

151
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,820
Search carefully.

152
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,900
Don't let anyone get away.

153
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,180
Yes.

154
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,380
You hide in this jade bucket.

155
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:47,700
Come on.

156
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,140
Get up.

157
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,460
Hold your breath.

158
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,180
Hold your breath.

159
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,100
Hold your breath. Go down.

160
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
You're so stubborn.

161
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,580
You...

162
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,180
You...

163
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,460
No need.

164
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,620
I have my own way out.

165
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,180
You just took a shower.

166
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,020
It doesn't stink.

167
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,460
Miss.

168
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,020
Miss.

169
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:04,940
Miss.

170
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,220
There was a thief in the mansion.

171
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,340
Are you okay?

172
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,940
I'm fine.

173
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,460
Go back to sleep.

174
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:09,900
Go.

175
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,820
Go.

176
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,140
Go back.

177
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,660
Young Master.

178
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Do you think Miss Sang will be in danger?

179
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,340
Don't be so careless.

180
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
Did the Jinzhao Mansion

181
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,980
find out the poison of the powder?

182
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,740
Not yet.

183
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,020
But Lord Yan has sent people

184
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,620
to search everywhere for it.

185
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,380
I'll let you know once I get news.

186
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,940
By the way, Young Master.

187
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,740
Lord Yan left a copy of it.

188
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,820
Please check it.

189
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,660
Look on the court.

190
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,460
If it's so serious,

191
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,740
understand that

192
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,620
this altered form does belong to you.

193
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,180
Since it's music class time,

194
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,180
let's play another game today.

195
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,100
The winner doesn't have to play the song

196
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,900
and change to play the song.

197
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,540
Play?

198
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,820
I don't know how to play.

199
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,900
I don't know either.

200
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,460
Don't worry.

201
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,900
It's not a rule class.

202
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,300
It won't be so easy to get caught.

203
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,180
Really?

204
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,340
Then I'm relieved.

205
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Is it?

206
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,860
You can do it all.

207
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,460
Go!

208
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,020
Sang Qi, you're right!

209
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,820
Luckily, it's not me.

210
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,620
Zhong Yan, didn't you say...

211
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,020
I've heard that all the ladies in Bianjing are good at music.

212
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,220
Sang Qi should be no exception.

213
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,220
Today, we're blessed.

214
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,420
Sang Qi, please.

215
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,820
How about I play a song for you?

216
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,820
No, I can do it myself.

217
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,220
Come on!

218
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,820
Sang Qi is so good.

219
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,020
That's right.

220
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,820
He can do this?

221
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,220
I didn't expect that.

222
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,020
That's right.

223
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,020
Great!

224
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Sorry.

225
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,220
I'm not good at music.

226
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,620
But I'm willing to lose.

227
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,020
How about I sing a song for you?

228
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,620
Is that okay?

229
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,820
No need.

230
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,220
No need.

231
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,220
No need.

232
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,820
Please sing.

233
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
Go on.

234
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,020
Sing.

235
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Yuxiu.

236
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Deputy Chief, please take my purse.

237
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
Great!

238
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Not bad.

239
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Not bad.

240
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
Not bad.

241
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
Great!

242
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Great!

243
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,020
Great!

244
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Great!

245
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,020
Great!

246
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,020
Great!

247
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Great!

248
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Great!

249
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Great!

250
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
Great!

251
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
Great!

252
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
Great!

253
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
Great!

254
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Great!

255
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
Great!

256
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,020
Great!

257
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
Great!

258
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
Great!

259
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,020
Great!

260
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Great!

261
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,020
Great!

262
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,020
Great!

263
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Great!

264
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,020
Great!

265
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Great!

266
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,020
Great!

267
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
Great!

268
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,020
Great!

269
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Great!

270
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Great!

271
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Great!

272
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Great!

273
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,020
Great!

274
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
Great!

275
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,020
What happened?

276
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
What happened?

277
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Let's go.

278
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Let's go.

279
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Let's go.

280
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Let's go.

281
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Hurry.

282
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Let's go.

283
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
Deputy Chief.

284
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Let's go to the shelter.

285
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
Deputy Chief.

286
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
How did you know this song?

287
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
You mean the song just now?

288
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,020
I just played it with the song you sang.

289
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
What's wrong?

290
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Do you know my brother?

291
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Sang Yu?

292
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,020
This is the birth of the son of the country.

293
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
Do you know him?

294
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,020
No.

295
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Impossible.

296
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,020
This song was made by my brother.

297
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
No one knows it.

298
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
How could you play it?

299
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
The same music.

300
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Maybe it's a coincidence.

301
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Think about it.

302
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,020
Deputy Chief.

303
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
Deputy Chief.

304
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
Go to the shelter and have a look.

305
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,020
Every time I mention my brother,

306
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Deputy Chief is so confused.

307
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,020
There must be something wrong.

308
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,020
Master.

309
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
Did Master Yan find out anything about the investigation?

310
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
They've checked all the prefectures.

311
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,020
They can't find the source of the powder.

312
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,020
We can only infer that the powder is from a kind of spider.

313
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,020
Even the government can't find it out.

314
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
What is it?

315
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,020
We can only depend on ourselves.

316
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Morning is like a golden dawn.

317
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,020
The clouds rise and fall.

318
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,020
The night is like the sun shining on the east.

319
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,020
The moonlight is like a snow-covered river.

320
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
What are you doing here?

321
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Deputy Chief.

322
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,020
Why are you here?

323
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
This is my study.

324
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
Yes.

325
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,020
Deputy Chief.

326
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Did you hear the song?

327
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,020
Did you think of any classmates?

328
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,020
You spent a time of learning together.

329
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Let's go.

330
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,020
I will find evidence.

331
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,020
I heard that the fitness list is in the classroom.

332
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,020
I think I can find the evidence that Yan Yun Zhi knows my brother.

333
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,020
Brother.

334
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
Wencao.

335
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,020
Wencao.

336
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,020
Qi.

337
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Minglu.

338
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,020
I can't find anything.

339
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
The word is in the book.

340
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,020
Heaven.

341
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Brother is so smart.

342
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
The book is in the book.

343
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
Oh no.

344
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,020
I knew it.

345
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,020
Brother is so smart.

346
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,020
He must be listening to...

347
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,020
I don't think it's Deputy Chief.

348
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
But Deputy Chief.

349
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
He is a classmate.

350
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
No, he is a classmate.

351
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,020
Why doesn't he admit it?

352
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,020
It's Yun's house.

353
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,020
But...

354
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
I came at the right time.

355
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Who is it?

356
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Who dares to break into the classroom?

357
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,020
It's me.

358
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,020
Without the doctor's permission,

359
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
you can't enter the classroom without permission.

360
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,020
You broke the rules and have bad character.

361
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,020
How could Guo Zi Jian have a teacher like you?

362
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
Do you know that

363
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,020
if I publicize this matter,

364
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
the doctors will definitely expel you from Guo Zi Jian.

365
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Who has bad character?

366
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,020
You broke into the women's room to see the female students taking a bath.

367
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
How could Guo Zi Jian have such a private opinion?

368
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
I also want to publicize it.

369
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
You better make it clear.

370
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Who saw you taking a bath?

371
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
I was...

372
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
I was...

373
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,020
I was...

374
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,020
I was...

375
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,020
Didn't you hide it from me

376
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,020
because you were ashamed?

377
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Why?

378
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Aren't you afraid of being embarrassed now?

379
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020
I can't even fulfill my brother's wish.

380
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,020
What's there to be ashamed of?

381
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
What's there to be ashamed of?

382
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,020
Okay.

383
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,020
Then I'll forgive you this time.

384
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,020
I'll do it again.

385
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,020
But to make you remember,

386
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
I'll punish you to copy Guo Zi Jian's rules.

387
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,020
I'll do it again.

388
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,020
I have one more thing to confirm.

389
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,020
Deputy Chief,

390
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,020
you know my brother.

391
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Why don't you admit it?

392
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,020
You also tore the name of this name, right?

393
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,020
A hundred names and a book.

394
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
I found it.

395
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,020
So what if I know him?

396
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
It's just a friend.

397
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,020
Do you want to hang it on your mouth?

398
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Why would a friend know this song?

399
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
Only you and I

400
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,020
know this song in Bianjing.

401
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,020
Are you trying to hide something?

402
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,020
I said that the melody of that song is very simple.

403
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
I'm just playing it.

404
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,020
Besides,

405
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,020
what can I hide?

406
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it now.

407
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
I will find out the truth.

408
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,020
When you find out the truth,

409
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,020
you have to admit that you are the little white.

410
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,020
If you don't disappear from my sight,

411
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,020
I'll punish you to copy twice.

412
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Why would I?

413
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
Ten times.

414
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
Here...

415
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
Twenty times.

416
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
Thirty times.

417
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Forty times.

418
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,020
Hold on.

419
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
Did you take something away?

420
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Fifty times.

421
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Twenty times.

422
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Twenty times.

423
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,020
Twenty times.

424
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,020
Twenty times.

425
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Twenty times.

426
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,020
Twenty times.

427
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
Twenty times.

428
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
Twenty times.

429
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Twenty times.

430
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,020
Twenty times.

431
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,020
Twenty times.

432
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
Twenty times.

433
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,020
Twenty times.

434
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,020
Twenty times.

435
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,020
Twenty times.

436
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,020
Twenty times.

437
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
Twenty times.

438
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,020
Twenty times.

439
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,020
Twenty times.

440
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
Twenty times.

441
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
Twenty times.

442
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,020
Twenty times.

443
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,020
Twenty times.

444
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,020
Twenty times.

445
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
Twenty times.

446
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,020
Twenty times.

447
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Twenty times.

448
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Twenty times.

449
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,020
Twenty times.

450
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,020
Twenty times.

451
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,020
Twenty times.

452
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,020
Twenty times.

453
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
Twenty times.

454
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,020
Twenty times.

455
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Twenty times.

456
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Twenty times.

457
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Twenty times.

458
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
Twenty times.

459
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Twenty times.

460
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Twenty times.

461
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Twenty times.

462
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Twenty times.

463
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,020
Twenty times.

464
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,020
Twenty times.

465
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,020
Twenty times.

466
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,020
Twenty times.

467
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
Twenty times.

468
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
Twenty times.

469
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,020
Twenty times.

470
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Twenty times.

471
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,020
Twenty times.

472
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,020
Twenty times.

473
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
Twenty times.

474
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,020
Twenty times.

475
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
Twenty times.

476
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
Twenty times.

477
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,020
Twenty times.

478
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
Twenty times.

479
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
Twenty times.

480
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,020
Twenty times.

481
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,020
Twenty times.

482
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,020
Twenty times.

483
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,020
Twenty times.

484
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
In this place

485
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,020
there are some people

486
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,020
who want to get home alone

487
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,020
to be together

488
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,020
every day.

489
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
And they've all

490
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
been from experience.

491
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,020
You should know

492
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
this is a desolate place

493
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,020
only for people

494
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,020
to meet for the first time.

495
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,780
Let's go.

496
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,500
It's early in the morning.

497
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,380
Let's go for a drink.

498
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,460
No.

499
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,100
I have to go back to copy books.

500
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,700
You're punished by the Deputy Chief?

501
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:18,900
Do you need help?

502
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,260
Don't help me.

503
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,540
If I get caught,

504
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,740
I'll have to double it.

505
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,660
Go.

506
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,420
Who is it?

507
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,300
Isn't she the Third Miss?

508
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,940
Why are you hugging the Master Zhuo

509
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,100
in public?

510
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,940
Song Jiayin,

511
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,500
you're being polite to me in public, aren't you?

512
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,580
You're not afraid of ruining the reputation of your family.

513
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,260
You're reminding me

514
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,260
that the Spring Festival is getting closer.

515
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,980
If you can't send out the pouch,

516
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,340
you'll lose the dignity of the Sang family.

517
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,620
I don't care.

518
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,300
You haven't figured out

519
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,860
how to send out the pouch?

520
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
What can I do?

521
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,860
I know that

522
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,740
she's a stubborn girl.

523
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,140
What can I do?

524
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,820
I have no idea.

525
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,220
If you don't send it out,

526
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,060
why don't you send it to me?

527
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,860
I need the pouch anyway.

528
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,060
If you like it,

529
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,100
I'll ask Lian Pian to sew you a snake.

530
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,940
Instant forest

531
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,060
Lian Pian,

532
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,200
how can I

533
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,220
make Ye Yunzhi

534
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,500
receive a pouch?

535
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
I can't think of a iad rice can.

536
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,180
Your Grace,

537
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,740
there's a saying that

538
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,860
ten thousand bags of pel Christians are better.

539
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,500
The unit weight less.

540
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Although the explanation is old-fashioned,

541
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
we have to believe in the experience of our ancestors.

542
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Right.

543
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
We haven't tried this trick yet.

544
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
Maybe it's better than it.

545
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Okay.

546
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,500
I'll leave this matter to you.

547
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Remember.

548
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Grab the appetite of Yan Yun Zhi.

549
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Do you understand what I mean?

550
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
I understand.

551
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Wait.

552
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
I'll be back in a minute.

553
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Grab the appetite of Yan Yun Zhi?

554
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Great.

555
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Let me go.

556
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Miss, I'm back.

557
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
You are robbers.

558
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Robbers.

559
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
I tied the cook of the Yan Mansion.

560
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Yan Yun Zhi loves to eat his dishes since he was a child.

561
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
You are robbers.

562
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
Shut up.

563
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Don't talk.

564
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
You are...

565
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
You are so good at grabbing Yan Yun Zhi's appetite.

566
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Of course.

567
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Otherwise?

568
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
You let him go.

569
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
It's embarrassing.

570
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Be careful.

571
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
Take him away.

572
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Take him away.

573
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
You are too much.

574
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
Go.

575
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
Go away.

576
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Deputy Chief.

577
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
I copied the sword cabinet.

578
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Yes.

579
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
What?

580
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,500
You haven't copied enough?

581
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
I've copied enough.

582
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
I'm about to vomit.

583
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
I remember that I was in the dining room.

584
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,500
I was a little serious.

585
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
I want to apologize to you.

586
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Deputy Chief.

587
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Can you have a lunch today?

588
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,500
What do you want to do again?

589
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
I'll cook you a meal.

590
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,500
I'm always anxious when I talk about my brother.

591
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
So I can't help but offend you.

592
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
So I don't know why you don't want to admit it.

593
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
But when I think of my brother in the Imperial College,

594
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I must be taken care of by you.

595
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
A meal of coarse tea and rice.

596
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
I'll take it as my thanks for you.

597
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Okay?

598
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,500
You want to cook for me.

599
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
You want to cook for me.

600
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Are you trying to trick me again?

601
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Are you afraid?

602
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Are you kidding?

603
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
How could I be afraid of you?

604
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Okay.

605
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
I won't see you again.

606
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,500
I'm busy.

607
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
See you in the kitchen.

608
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,500
Come early.

609
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
Did I promise you?

610
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,500
Hurry up.

611
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
I want to please Deputy Chief.

612
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
To meet my sister's bet.

613
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
It's not that easy.

614
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
You want to trick me.

615
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
You don't even have a door.

616
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
You...

617
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
Zi Ye.

618
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
It's just right.

619
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Here you are.

620
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Light this first.

621
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,500
This is a way to cook food quickly.

622
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
It does have some small fires.

623
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
But don't worry.

624
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Then you can cook.

625
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
Why are you shouting?

626
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
It's more interesting when I shout.

627
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I'm not shouting.

628
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,500
I'm just yelling.

629
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
I'm just yelling.

630
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
I'm just yelling.

631
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
I'm just yelling.

632
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
I'm just yelling.

633
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm just yelling.

634
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
I'm just yelling.

635
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
It's more interesting when I shout.

636
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
The dishes are different.

637
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Why don't you try it?

638
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Do you want to burn the Imperial College?

639
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Turn off the fire.

640
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Clean this up.

641
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Don't leave it in the fire.

642
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Try it.

643
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
You waste time.

644
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
It doesn't mean I want to waste time.

645
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
What...

646
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
What is this?

647
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,500
Chicken.

648
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,500
Of course I know.

649
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Chicken.

650
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Why is the chicken here?

651
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
Please.

652
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
The chicken isn't here.

653
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
It should have grown out of the ground.

654
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Go.

655
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Don't let them come.

656
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Go.

657
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
Go.

658
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Go.

659
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,500
Go.

660
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
I know.

661
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,500
Deputy Chief, you must have

662
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
a phobia.

663
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
In the Imperial College,

664
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
the evil devil

665
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
who made the dragon wind

666
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
and the death of the king

667
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,500
disappear,

668
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
is actually afraid of

669
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
dog and chicken.

670
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
It seems that it's time to let you know

671
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
what is the real fight.

672
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Come on.

673
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
What are you doing?

674
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
This...

675
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
You're good at hiding.

676
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,500
Don't bite me.

677
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Don't talk.

678
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
You're afraid of chicken?

679
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
Unbelievable.

680
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Don't talk.

681
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
Cover me.

682
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,500
Cover me?

683
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
You're so far away.

684
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,500
No.

685
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
It's too close.

686
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
How is it?

687
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Done.

688
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Let's go.

689
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,500
Deputy Chief,

690
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
I know I was wrong.

691
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
I shouldn't have laughed at you.

692
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,500
I won't tell anyone

693
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
about this.

694
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,500
It's okay.

695
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Just tell me if you have the guts.

696
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Anyway,

697
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
those who know my secret

698
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
have already gone.

699
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
And,

700
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,500
when it's almost done,

701
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
take all your things

702
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
and take them out.

703
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I don't want to see them.

704
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
Just have a taste.

705
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Just one.

706
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I said take them away.

707
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,500
Okay.

708
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
Don't blame me for being rude.

709
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,500
It's still not done.

710
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
It smells good.

711
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
It smells good.

712
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Okay.

713
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
Then, just eat.

714
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
You'll have more energy

715
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
to get more poisoned if you eat.

716
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
Just eat.

717
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Eat.

718
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Eat.

719
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
What's wrong?

720
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
You've already eaten.

721
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Go and get your hair done.

722
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Deputy Chief,

723
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
what's so good about this book?

724
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Should I look at the flowers?

725
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
What did you say?

726
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm sorry.

727
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
I'm sorry.

728
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
I'm sorry.

729
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
I'm sorry.

730
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
I'm sorry.

731
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm sorry.

732
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
I'm sorry.

733
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I'm sorry.

734
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I'm sorry.

735
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
I'm sorry.

736
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm sorry.

737
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,500
I'm sorry.

738
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Where are you going?

739
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,500
Who told you to leave?

740
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Why did you close the door?

741
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,500
Why did you lock the door?

742
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,500
It's windy.

743
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

744
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
I'm afraid it's hot.

745
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Go open the door.

746
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
I'll give you a fan.

747
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Sang Qin, what are you doing?

748
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Is it still hot?

749
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Nonsense.

750
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Stop right there.

751
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
Let me sit in your seat.

752
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
What do you want?

753
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Sit in your chair.

754
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
Sang Qin, you...

755
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
I'm soft.

756
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
I'm not yet.

757
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Shouldn't you be lying down?

758
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Get down.

759
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
This is going to explode.

760
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Don't push me.

761
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
I'm warning you for the last time.

762
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Get up.

763
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
Sang Qin,

764
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
come on.

765
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Did you hear me?

766
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Get down.

767
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
Sang Qin,

768
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
come on.

769
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Shi Yi,

770
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
are you in the room?

771
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
What's going on in the room?

772
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Are you in a dream?

773
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
Nothing.

774
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Mr. Feng, what's up?

775
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
Shi Yi,

776
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
are you free now?

777
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Let me go in

778
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
and discuss something with you.

779
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,500
No.

780
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
I'm sorting out the books.

781
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
I'll go find you later.

782
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Get down.

783
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Get down.

784
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Sang Qin.

785
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Sang Qin.

786
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Sang Qin.

787
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:30,500
The evidence he's holding

788
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
is similar to what he had two years ago

789
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
after being poisoned by Yujing.

790
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Young Master.

791
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Brother Dong.

792
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
As you expected,

793
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Miss Sang was indeed poisoned.

794
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,500
But the crime of using the silver needle

795
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
was not a sign of the poison.

796
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
No sign of the poison?

797
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Is it true?

798
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
How is Sang Qin now?

799
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Miss Sang.

800
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,500
After Miss Sang went back to the mansion,

801
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
she was unconscious.

802
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
The other doctors in Bianjing

803
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
were all helpless.

804
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Doctor Wen.

805
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
I heard Doctor Wen in the palace

806
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
is good at detoxification.

807
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Go and get her.

808
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
I've asked.

809
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Doctor Wen just left the city.

810
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
He left the city?

811
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Prepare the horse.

812
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
Yes.

813
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Brother Yu,

814
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
I couldn't save you back then.

815
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
I can't let Sang Qin get into trouble this time.

816
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Brother.

817
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Brother.

818
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
How is Sang Qin?

819
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,500
The imperial physician is trying his best to make a decree.

820
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Imperial physician.

821
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
How is it?

822
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Miss Sang's pulse is stable.

823
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
She's fine.

824
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
How is she?

825
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
She's fine.

826
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
How is she?

827
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
She's fine.

828
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
How is she?

829
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
She's fine.

830
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
How is she?

831
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,500
She's fine.

832
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
How is she?

833
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
She's fine.

834
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
How is she?

835
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
She's fine.

836
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
Miss Sang's pulse is stable.

837
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,500
She's poisoned too much.

838
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
I can't help her.

839
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
How could this happen?

840
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,500
Is there no other way?

841
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Doctor Wen who is good at detoxification

842
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
should have a way.

843
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
But it's not a coincidence.

844
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
She went back to her hometown today.

845
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,500
I'll have someone chase her.

846
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
I'm afraid it's too late.

847
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Master.

848
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Master.

849
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Master.

850
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
These are the medicines I've collected in the city.

851
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
They should help to relieve the poison.

852
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
They can help to relieve the poison.

853
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Take them to Sang Qi's mansion.

854
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Okay.

855
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Hurry.

856
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Go find Doctor Wen.

857
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Yes, Master.

858
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Doctor Wen is here.

859
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Hurry.

860
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Doctor Wen is here.

861
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,500
Doctor Wen is here.

862
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Doctor Wen, save her.

863
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Yan Siyi, you're so rude.

864
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
You've been in my way.

865
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
I...

866
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,500
I'll be back to apologize to you.

867
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Doctor Wen, save her.

868
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Dad, I'll go save her.

869
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
Where is the patient?

870
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
She's in the room.

871
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
Hurry.

872
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,500
Yan Siyi,

873
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,500
how did you

874
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
bring Doctor Wen here?

875
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
Did you hear that?

876
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,500
Doctor Wen is good at detoxification.

877
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I sent someone to the mansion to find her.

878
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
When she's on her way back to her hometown,

879
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
I'll go after her.

880
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I'm looking for her.

881
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
What about Yan Sanlang?

882
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,500
I just got the news that

883
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
the poison in her lover was poisoned.

884
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
I rushed here.

885
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,500
It's a French suicide.

886
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
We must kill her.

887
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
Thank you.

888
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
Zhou Yue.

889
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Zhou Yue.

890
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,500
How are you?

891
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,500
I'm here.

892
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,500

I'm here.

900
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
I'm here.

901
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500

902
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,500
