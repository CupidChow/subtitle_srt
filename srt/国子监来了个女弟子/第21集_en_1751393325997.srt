1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm always surprised by your beauty

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm a little bit of a mountain

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The wind is not over, look back at someone

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The star is in the sky

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm with you in the dream

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm a little bit of a mountain

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm a little bit of a mountain

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm a little bit of a mountain

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm a little bit of a mountain

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm a little bit of a mountain

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm a little bit of a mountain

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So be it

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,600
And don't fall

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
He's made a story

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,000
Who's speaking who's speaking

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,740
Vaibhavati

17
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,240
Vaswari

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,240
Difficult

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,560
From sunrise to dusk

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,680
Ch relations are the same

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,440
Episode 10

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,440
It seems that no one dares to come up.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,280
If no one comes up,

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,240
I'll let them

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,320
have the final match.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,600
Whoever wins

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,000
can marry

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,680
my Sang Qi.

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,080
Song Luo Tian can do it.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,560
No, sister.

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
You're a real man.

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,720
You're a real man.

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,600
Song Luo Tian.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,000
You're married.

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,240
You know nothing about it.

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,920
Yes.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,360
Deputy Chief.

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,200
Let Song Luo Tian follow the main character.

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,240
Qi also said that

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,440
Song Luo Tian is married.

41
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,360
He can't attend the wedding.

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,880
Yes.

43
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,080
How can I beat them?

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,760
No need to wait.

45
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,320
Just come in.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

47
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,680
I declare the rules of the game.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,440
Whoever loses

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,000
and who hits the target

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,160
lose.

51
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,320
I shouldn't have let my father

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
do such a thing.

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Anyway, no matter who loses,

54
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll only add a C.

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,760
Good.

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,640
Good.

57
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,280
Good.

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,000
Good.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I thought

60
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,840
the two men would have a big dialogue

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,040
before the match

62
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
to express their love for the new lover.

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,200
But they didn't say anything.

64
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
They just started to do it.

65
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,600
Yan Pian.

66
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,200
You've read too many books.

67
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,560
A real man never touches himself.

68
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,680
That's good.

69
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,200
At least they all want to fight for their beloved.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,800
Good.

71
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,640
Stop it.

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,240
Stop it.

73
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,320
Good.

74
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,060
Good.

75
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,040
Good.

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,520
Good.

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
i likeε raping the Tea Emperor.

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,480
i can deal with Max's attacks.

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,480

Bravo

93
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,280
Let's go

94
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,920
Go

95
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
You won Zhou Wen Yuan, right?

96
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,360
But you haven't taught me

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,280
the strongest one yet.

98
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Dad, he has won Zhou Wen Yuan.

99
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,880
The match is over.

100
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,760
What else do you want?

101
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,360
Qi.

102
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,080
It's okay.

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,600
But...

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,480
Uncle.

105
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,520
Please give me a lesson.

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,400
Dad!

107
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
The match is over.

108
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,680
I...

109
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,360
If you still want to fight,

110
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,040
just do it.

111
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,560
I...

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
I haven't used my strength yet.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,600
Hit me.

114
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,920
Hit me.

115
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,880
Qi.

116
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,760
Qi, I'm fine.

117
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,760
I'm really fine.

118
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,280
Look.

119
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm fine.

120
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,480
Uncle is the strongest one.

121
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,880
You're the strongest one.

122
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,880
You're really a good boy.

123
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,440
The winner is...

124
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,400
Yan Yun Zhi.

125
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,400
Good.

126
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,880
Good.

127
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,680
Good, good.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,360
Congratulations!

129
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
Your Highness, you're so brilliant.

130
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,760
Thank you.

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,680
You're more brilliant than me.

132
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,280
You're really...

133
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,440
Congratulations, Mr. Sang.

134
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,520
What?

135
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,960
You're out again?

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,680
I've been watching you for a long time.

137
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,960
I have a question for you.

138
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,080
What is it?

139
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,560
Mr. Sang,

140
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,160
have you ever thought

141
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
what if you fail?

142
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,680
Will you really

143
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
give up on Sang Qi?

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,360
It's impossible.

145
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
Because I've always believed

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm the only one who can take care of Sang Qi.

147
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,360
Do you understand what I mean?

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Thank you for your advice.

149
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,000
I didn't expect that I would be taught by you

150
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
after I left the Imperial College.

151
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,600
Yan Xiao Lang,

152
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,800
why are you here?

153
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm here to pick you up.

154
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,800
Aren't you afraid that Mrs. Yan will take you back?

155
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,600
No.

156
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,840
I don't want to depend on my family to choose a wife.

157
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
I only rely on you in my life.

158
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,000
So,

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,320
my mother,

160
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,000
Mrs. Yan,

161
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,680
doesn't recognize me as her son anymore.

162
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
Then you...

163
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,800
Then I'll be

164
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,720
the son of your family.

165
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,440
Father,

166
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,680
I'll be your son-in-law from now on.

167
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,000
Master.

168
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,880
Master.

169
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,680
Father.

170
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,880
Let's go.

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,400
Father.

172
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,480
Father, what's wrong?

173
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,040
Father.

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,120
Father,

175
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,240
what's wrong with you?

176
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,400
Today,

177
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,120
I've got a good news.

178
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
Master said

179
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,480
I must eat and drink more after I return.

180
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,520
In this way,

181
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
we can live a long life.

182
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,120
Okay.

183
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,880
By the way,

184
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,120
I found an important clue

185
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,520
on Song Jiayin.

186
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,040
Song Jiayin?

187
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,720
What clue?

188
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
The smell on her body

189
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,320
is exactly the same

190
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,760
as the smell I smelled in the Wolf's Nest that day.

191
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,280
He said the spices on her body

192
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,240
were brought back by her father, Grand Tutor Song.

193
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,040
It's all Bianjing's unique.

194
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,640
They look quite עelike.

195
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,560
But she is…

196
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,720
She is not mute.

and seeing a beret in the wall right now.

206
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,600
More!

207
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,240
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,280
Stop it.

209
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
We don't have much time

210
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,880
to be around her.

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,280
Besides,

212
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
the imperial court

213
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
is not the only one who can beat her.

214
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,520
If you want her to be on our side,

215
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,520
it will take a lot of effort.

216
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,000
I think you should marry Song Jiayin.

217
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,120
Then we will be closer

218
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,280
to Grand Tutor Song.

219
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,480
We will be more stable

220
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,080
in our work.

221
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,040
Aunt,

222
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,920
give me some time

223
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
to think of a way.

224
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,040
Ha ha.

225
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,240
Remember,

226
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,480
don't be emotional.

227
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,280
Yes.

228
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
This is the new Chief Stewardess.

229
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,560
I heard that

230
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,080
she just got promoted to the Grand Tutor.

231
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,200
It's really a great honor

232
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,280
to be promoted to the Chief Stewardess.

233
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
Exactly.

234
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
She is the new Chief Stewardess.

235
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,200
See?

236
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,440
Anyone can get promoted.

237
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,520
Yeah.

238
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,480
Nice.

239
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,400
He's so young.

240
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,360
He's so bright.

241
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,160
So much love.

242
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,680
Yes.

243
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,320
Yeah.

244
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Did he go out of the palace today?

245
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,040
Brother Guan Che, I'm here to report.

246
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,320
This brother...

247
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,680
What's your name?

248
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,120
It's really a house of the Yuan family.

249
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,440
Why are you here?

250
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,520
Did you have an accident?

251
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,640
You can't spit out the things that look like teeth.

252
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,240
I

253
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,440
am here to show off my skills.

254
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,600
So,

255
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
the goods in the city's warehouse

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,160
can be used to hang the Song family's goods.

257
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,600
Sang Qi also reminded me

258
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,760
that the ingredients he used

259
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,480
are unique in the whole Bianjing.

260
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,000
And when I smelled that fragrance,

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,200
I had a bad reaction.

262
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,440
It's exactly the same as that day.

263
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
No.

264
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,200
I remember that I was the only one

265
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,680
in the secret book.

266
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,800
Did you set up some trap again?

267
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,680
My father is a great man.

268
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,240
Why would he arrange me to live in a small mansion?

269
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
If you had been a little more clever,

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
you wouldn't have had to go through all the tests.

271
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm not that capable.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,280
But I'm good at playing the zither.

273
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,720
You...

274
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,080
You're a drunkard.

275
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,800
What?

276
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,720
You're so stubborn that you're being trusted by the Song family.

277
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,960
When Sang Lang comes to announce his position,

278
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,640
you'll be waiting to be my dog.

279
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,080
You're the dog.

280
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,760
You're the one who's still a dog.

281
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,800
You are.

282
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,480
You are.

283
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,160
You are.

284
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,760
You are.

285
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,560
You are.

286
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,240
You are.

287
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,960
You are.

288
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
You are.

289
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,800
You are.

290
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Push me.

291
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,400
I'll push you.

292
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,120
You want to be beaten by me, right?

293
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,000
I've never seen the capital's mansion so lively.

294
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,800
Qi Lang,

295
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,240
I haven't had the chance to tell you.

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,920
Song Luo Tian

297
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,440
has been put in my position.

298
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,720
According to what you said,

299
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm not a wolf in the wild.

300
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,520
I have a way.

301
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,200
Push me.

302
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
Do you want to fight?

303
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Who are you pushing?

304
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,040
You're pushing me.

305
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,800
You're pushing me.

306
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,720
You're pushing me.

307
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,680
I'm pushing you.

308
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,320
How dare you!

309
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,960
Where do you think

310
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,280
I'm in the capital's mansion?

311
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,080
Deputy Chief.

312
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Give me a reward.

313
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,840
Song Luo Tian is playing the yin-zhao again.

314
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:01,840
I...

315
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,440
Yin San.

316
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,720
Deputy Chief.

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,720
Tell me.

318
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,360
Who is the official of Song Luo Tian and I?

319
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,080
You're the left-hand man.

320
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,360
You're the right-hand man.

321
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,440
If people know

322
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,560
you're fighting with the left and right hands,

323
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,040
they'll laugh at you.

324
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,120
Did you hear that?

325
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,720
Left is the most important.

326
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,680
Now you know who's the one who's cheating.

327
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,400
Don't think that you can win

328
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,960
everything if you get the mission.

329
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,880
You need to get my approval

330
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,040
to be able to establish your family in the capital's mansion.

331
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:56,100
But since this is a secret

332
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,920
Jingzhao's mansion is a small place.

333
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,040
You can sit here.

334
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,120
It looks like wild vegetables.

335
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,600
I'm also a wild vegetable.

336
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,840
What's this smell?

337
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,880
Young Master,

338
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,640
do you think you came to Jingzhao's mansion to enjoy the luxury?

339
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,640
Qi Lang,

340
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
can this work?

341
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,560
What if he's pretending?

342
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,560
Although Song Luo Tian is a stubborn man,

343
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
he has a simple mind.

344
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,760
If he really has a ghost in his heart,

345
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,520
he will write it on his face immediately.

346
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
It seems that he really doesn't know his own family's background.

347
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,360
Now that we have checked,

348
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,520
the Song family must have received some news.

349
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,520
Qi Lang,

350
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,200
why don't we take Song Luo Tian

351
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,880
to inquire about the news inside the Song family?

352
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,760
And if we take his official post rashly,

353
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm afraid it will alert the enemy.

354
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,280
Yes.

355
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,040
We can consider it.

356
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,680
I want to go to the city bridge later.

357
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,760
I want to check if there is any way out.

358
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,560
Then, that's all.

359
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,240
No need.

360
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,040
Brother,

361
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,640
I come back to the Imperial College in a jiffy.

362
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,600
the new beginning and meaning of life.

363
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,840
I won't let you down.

364
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm Sang Qi.

365
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,880
I'm here to report to the Imperial College.

366
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,960
You're late.

367
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,280
I left half an hour earlier.

368
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,080
You're late because you're late.

369
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,880
Yan Siye went out today.

370
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,720
So,

371
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,120
I'll be in charge of your reporting.

372
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,520
Thank you, Dr. Feng.

373
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm still a newbie.

374
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
Please take care of me after I retire.

375
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,800
All right.

376
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,720
Sang Dianqi.

377
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,840
Hurry up.

378
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,800
I said, why is the click room lacking click?

379
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
I caught up with this.

380
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,720
It's a pity that so many valuable books

381
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,480
are wasted here.

382
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,560
The click room should be open

383
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,360
to the whole people.

384
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,760
Some men and women can read it.

385
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
I'm sorry.

386
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm sorry.

387
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
I'm sorry.

388
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm sorry.

389
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm sorry.

390
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
I'm sorry.

391
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,320
I'm sorry.

392
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Siye, you're here.

393
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,880
I'm not Yan Yunzhi.

394
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,880
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

395
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
How is it?

396
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
Does my outfit suit me?

397
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,880
You're confident.

398
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,280
This uniform

399
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,920
can hold you up.

400
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,360
But you came to me

401
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,440
to show off this outfit.

402
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
You don't welcome me?

403
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,520
I'm on duty today.

404
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
I still need to be careful.

405
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,280
The curtain...

406
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,760
I just lost the competition.

407
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,560
You're not going to break off with me, are you?

408
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
You don't even want to be my friend.

409
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,080
All right.

410
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm not teasing you.

411
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm here for work.

412
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm here to find a list.

413
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
It's here.

414
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
It's all here.

415
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
You can look for it yourself.

416
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,840
I have work to do.

417
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,680
Do your best at the ceremony.

418
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm sorry.

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm sorry.

483
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm very sorry.

484
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I'm very sorry.

485
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm very sorry.

486
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,760
I still don't understand how you feel.

487
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,800
My activity is over.

488
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,280
Thank you for being with me for such a long time.

489
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,520
An homebody.

490
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Yes.

491
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,760
I think he lives here.

492
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,480
That's just it. You're welcome.

493
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,720
It's getting late.

494
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,200
Let me take you home.

495
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,200
No need.

496
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,480
You go home first.

497
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,600
I have to lock the door.

498
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
The door is locked.

499
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,520
What?

500
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,400
The door is locked.

501
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,320
The door should be locked from outside.

502
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,760
Someone is trying to make fun of us.

503
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,800
All right.

504
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,000
We're trapped here.

505
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Please wait.

506
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,200
Yan San Lang is not a human.

507
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,880
He's just a prince of Yan.

508
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,960
I've been copying the case for more than five hours.

509
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
I haven't written so many words in the Imperial College.

510
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,800
You young people are too young.

511
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,800
You lack the real independence.

512
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Master.

513
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,920
If you draw a few more lines,

514
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,400
your skin will be thick.

515
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,240
Uncle is indeed an old senior.

516
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,320
Jin Zhao's manor

517
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,800
really collected five lines.

518
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,760
I think I'm not far from being isolated.

519
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,920
Not far.

520
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,640
Deputy Chief.

521
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,520
Uncle.

522
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,880
Why don't you see Sang Qi in the mansion?

523
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,960
I want to ask you.

524
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,280
You've been busy

525
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,160
with the job.

526
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
Guo Zi Jin hasn't started school yet.

527
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
In theory, he should be busy with the job.

528
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,600
I'll go find him.

529
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,320
Young Master.

530
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,280
The door is locked.

531
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,440
This is not the lock of Guo Zi Jin's manor.

532
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,320
Could it be the playhouse?

533
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,360
Qi is still in there.

534
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,640
Hurry up and find a way to open the lock.

535
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:06,800
Young Master.

536
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,880
This lock has a long history.

537
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,480
Ordinary mechanical locks are hard to open.

538
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,960
Not to mention these complicated and complicated

539
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,760
lotus locks.

540
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,800
Go away. Don't talk nonsense.

541
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,960
Qi.

542
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,480
Deputy Chief.

543
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,200
Deputy Chief.

544
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,720
It's not necessary, right?

545
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,360
It's necessary.

546
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,360
Zhuo Wen Yue.

547
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,760
Don't talk nonsense.

548
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,840
I won the proposal of marriage.

549
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,760
Qi is my wife now.

550
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,040
If you cross the line again,

551
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,680
I will never be like

552
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,600
the tears on the stage

553
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,520
and be affectionate to you.

554
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,000
If the persistence of love

555
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,800
deepens the love for each other,

556
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,800
I will have this life.

557
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
If the past is the past,

558
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,800
it will become my city.

559
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
My city.

560
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I will never be like the past.

561
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,440
Say whatever you want.

562
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,920
Don't make me feel bad.

563
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,640
I will have this perfect story.

564
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,040
Since you don't allow me to be alone with other women,

565
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I will be alone with you.

566
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
I will be alone with you.

567
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,320
You should do the same.

568
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
I am worried about you.

569
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,160
I care about you.

570
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
You know I am wrong.

571
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
You are not wrong.

572
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
I am wrong.

573
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,680
I failed to protect Zhuo Wen Yue.

574
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,160
So what if I want to marry her?

575
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
It's only been a day.

576
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,760
What else can I do?

577
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,040
She is here with her husband.

578
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,440
I can't stop her.

579
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,640
So to avoid the night dream,

580
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,360
I should marry you earlier.

581
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
The beginning of the end

582
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,840
is the beginning of the love.

583
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,440
I write down the words of the night.

584
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,040
I also accept the city of the corner.

585
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,440
The future is always bright.

586
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,440
It's a deep kiss.

587
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,440
The future is always bright.

588
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,440
It's a deep kiss.

589
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
Open the book.

590
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Really?

591
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
This is good.

592
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
It's so good.

593
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
It's so good.

594
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
Yes.

595
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
It's so good.

596
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Open.

597
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
It's so good.

598
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
It's so good.

599
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
It's so good.

600
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Open the book.

601
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,440
It's not for men and women.

602
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,240
Deputy Chief is acting so well.

603
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,440
Deputy Chief's idea is always good.

604
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,040
How can we guess it?

605
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,840
Come on. Let me make it up.

606
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
It's a big hit.

607
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
A big hit.

608
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,440
I knew it.

609
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Everything is under my control.

610
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,240
How did you find out?

611
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,640
The master said the book is open for the bookseller.

612
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Bookseller?

613
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Yes.

614
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,040
He also said women can go in.

615
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
Women can go in?

616
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
Then we can see Deputy Chief Yan.

617
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
Let's go back to the mansion.

618
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
So many people.

619
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
How did Deputy Chief come up with this idea?

620
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Guess.

621
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
I want to praise you.

622
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,640
You got me.

623
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
Everyone, line up.

624
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,240
Sign here.

625
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,440
But I guess

626
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,040
your idea is

627
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,240
to read the book secretly.

628
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,040
Read the book secretly?

629
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
What do you mean?

630
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,440
Deputy Chief continued to suggest

631
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
to recruit female reporters.

632
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,240
But the official didn't accept the proposal.

633
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,840
So you came up with this plan.

634
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
The book is one level.

635
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,640
The book is open for the bookseller.

636
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
It's part of

637
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,640
Guo Zijie's recruitment plan for the new year.

638
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,040
This is the way to earn money.

639
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
The book is one level.

640
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
With my status as a female reporter,

641
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,240
I can let the women in the city

642
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
go in and out freely in Guo Zijie.

643
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,240
Let Guo Zijie let everyone

644
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
take a break

645
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,040
and change their views slowly.

646
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,440
This is a secret warehouse.

647
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,840
Open the top room first

648
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,440
and then enter Guo Zijie's room.

649
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,840
How is it?

650
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,040
Right?

651
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Yes.

652
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,240
Qi really knows me.

653
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,640
But Deputy Chief

654
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,040
is really a good magician.

655
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
If we can make it,

656
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,240
my wish will come true.

657
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,840
Miss Sang, but...

658
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,240
What's wrong, Deputy Chief?

659
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,640
Nothing.

660
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,040
What's wrong?

661
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,640
Nothing.

662
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
He seems to be in a bad mood.

663
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,240
Qi.

664
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,440
Many people are waiting for you.

665
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
You will be busy today.

666
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Go and prepare.

667
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,440
Open the door.

668
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,240
Open the door.

669
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,040
You can go in.

670
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,240
Go in.

671
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,440
Come in and have a look.

672
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,640
Young Master, Miss Sang

673
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,040
seems to think differently from you.

674
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
That's what I think.

675
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
You are the only one who talks.

676
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
So good.

677
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,640
Young Master.

678
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,640
Young Master.

679
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,240
Are you still thinking about

680
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,840
the thing in the library today?

681
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
In my opinion,

682
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,440
today's thing is just a coincidence.

683
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
Next time, just tell Miss Sang

684
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,040
not to close the door of the library.

685
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,040
The standard is not the foundation.

686
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,840
What's important is not the door,

687
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,240
but the person.

688
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,040
Whether it's closing the door or opening it,

689
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,640
that person will keep pestering Qi.

690
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Then just

691
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,240
close the library.

692
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,040
It's easy.

693
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,640
You are being too much.

694
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Do you know

695
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
how much effort

696
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,840
Sang Qi has put into Guo Zijin

697
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
since the beginning?

698
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,040
He must have spent a lot of energy

699
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:25,860
to get the

700
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,340
Master of the

701
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,840
Hall of Mirage to open the library.

702
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,840
I think

703
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,640
Miss Sang is not

704
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,440
different from Childe Zhuo.

705
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,240
You don't have to worry about it.

706
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,840
I believe in Qi,

707
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,440
but that Zhuo Wenyuan

708
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,640
is always around Qi

709
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,840
like a fly.

710
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
I'm very annoyed.

711
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,840
What should we do then?

712
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,840
Should we keep opening the library

713
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,240
and let Childe Zhuo

714
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
pestering Miss Sang?

715
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,440
Yes.

716
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,040
Not only should we open it, but also open it in a big way.

717
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,640
Not only should we open it to Guo Zijin,

718
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,040
but also to the whole Bianjing City.

719
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,240
Here.

720
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,840
Thank you.

721
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,240
Here.

722
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,840
Thank you.

723
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,240
Here you are.

724
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,040
Thank you.

725
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,640
One by one.

726
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,440
Don't rush.

727
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,040
Here, this is yours.

728
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
I'll look for it again.

729
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Don't rush.

730
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
One by one.

731
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,640
Thank you.

732
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,240
Thank you.

733
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,040
Thank you.

734
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,640
Thank you.

735
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,440
Thank you.

736
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,240
Thank you.

737
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,040
Thank you.

738
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,840
Thank you.

739
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,640
Here.

740
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,240
Thank you.

741
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,840
Here.

742
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,040
Here.

743
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,640
I want that one.

744
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,240
Up there.

745
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,640
Thank you.

746
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
I want that one.

747
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
That one is good.

748
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,040
Thank you.

749
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,240
Here you are.

750
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
I understand, Childe.

751
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,440
Your big opening

752
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
is to let Zhuo Wenyuan

753
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,640
not have a chance to get along with Miss Sang alone.

754
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,440
Right, Childe?

755
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,840
You're so stubborn.

756
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
What are you talking about?

757
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Miss Sang is busy.

758
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,640
Of course she can't take care of Zhuo Wenyuan.

759
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
Zhuo Wenyuan wouldn't dare to

760
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,640
bother Miss Sang under the guise of being a mother.

761
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,840
Childe,

762
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
your move is so wonderful.

763
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,640
I'm flattered.

764
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,840
I just want to reform the Imperial College.

765
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,040
I'm just doing it for fun.

766
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Just for fun.

767
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,440
Is that all, Childe?

768
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,840
What's your opinion?

769
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,440
Hurry up.

770
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,440
I dare not.

771
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,840
Hurry up.

772
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,440
Why are you in such a hurry?

773
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,640
There are so many people. Let's wait for a while.

774
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,840
If we wait for a while, the store will close.

775
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
We won't see Miss Sang.

776
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,040
Come on.

777
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,640
Let's go.

778
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,840
Childe.

779
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
Zhuo Wenyuan can't enter the mountain.

780
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
But the flies around Miss Sang...

781
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,240
Here.

782
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,040
seem to be more.

783
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,040
Thank you.

784
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,440
Thank you.

785
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,040
I want this, too.

786
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,440
Here.

787
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:56,840
Here.

788
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,640
I want this.

789
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,240
Thank you.

790
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,040
Don't rush.

791
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,440
Here.

792
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,440
Thank you.

793
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
I want this.

794
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,240
Thank you.

795
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,640
Deputy Chief.

796
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,440
Did you see what happened today?

797
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Those people are so many.

798
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,640
Everyone has a lot of

799
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,440
expectations and curiosity about the fruit.

800
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,240
Deputy Chief, what's wrong with you?

801
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,640
Why are you so absent-minded?

802
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,640
I'm not.

803
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm not.

804
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,840
I know.

805
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,640
Is it because the man I met today is a bit jealous?

806
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,040
Are you jealous?

807
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,240
Don't worry, Deputy Chief.

808
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,640
There's no one

809
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,640
who can take you in a thousandth of a person.

810
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Even if there's no one

811
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
who can match you,

812
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
it won't be me

813
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
or my heart.

814
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Because in my heart,

815
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
there's only you.

816
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
What are you talking about?

817
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm just thinking

818
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,040
that the click event is open now.

819
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,840
Will it bring you a lot of burden?

820
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,240
I'm just afraid you'll be tired.

821
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,040
That's it.

822
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,240
Then you don't have to worry.

823
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,440
Click events like this

824
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
are easy for me to control.

825
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I don't believe it.

826
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
I can't handle those who are very skilled.

827
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,040
Then you should eat more.

828
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,840
Okay.

829
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Have some bitter melon.

830
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,240
Yan.

831
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,440
Are we really going to see Guo Zi?

832
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,440
Of course.

833
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,240
Now it seems that

834
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,640
Deputy Chief Yan has decided

835
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,240
to marry the wild girl of the Sang family.

836
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,440
I've found such a concubine.

837
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
It will be very difficult

838
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,040
for me to raise a family in the future.

839
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,440
It's not easy to see Yan Yun Zhi.

840
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
Now it's finally a chance.

841
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,640
I have to

842
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,440
make him realize my mistake

843
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,240
and make him understand me.

844
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,640
Yan,

845
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,840
don't you think it's too gorgeous

846
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
to be a concubine?

847
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,640
You don't understand, do you?

848
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,440
Guo Zi is the place

849
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,040
where my future husband will work.

850
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
If I wear a plain dress

851
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,840
and lose my face to Yan Si Yan,

852
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,240
it will be inappropriate.

853
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Besides,

854
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,840
that click event

855
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
is Sang Qi's territory.

856
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,040
I must win over him.

857
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Sang Qi.

858
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Sang Qi.

859
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Sang Qi.

860
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,840
I just said that it wouldn't be a problem.

861
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,640
But someone is here

862
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,040
and I'm having a headache.

863
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,040
Sang Qi.

864
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,640
Song Jiayin.

865
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,840
Can you stop

866
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
shouting in the click event?

867
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,840
Qi, where is Deputy Chief Yan?

868
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
He just left.

869
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,440
It's not appropriate

870
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
for you to wear a plain dress in the click event.

871
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,240
You'd better go back and change.

872
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,840
What's wrong with my dress?

873
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,240
Why should I change?

874
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Does it mean that

875
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Qi doesn't like the click event?

876
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,840
Someone is more beautiful than you?

877
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,040
But Deputy Chief Yan said

878
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,240
that men and women can come here

879
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,640
regardless of their gender.

880
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
Why do you dare to ask me?

881
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,440
I...

882
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm not trying to drive you away.

883
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,440
I doubt you.

884
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,440
The thing on your head

885
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
is so shiny

886
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,040
that it's disturbing everyone's reading.

887
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,040
Click event is a place for reading.

888
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
It's really not appropriate for you.

889
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,240
What's not appropriate?

890
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,240
You

891
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,040
just can't stand

892
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,240
someone being more attractive than you.

893
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,440
Miss Song,

894
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
you'd better go back first

895
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,240
and stop taking Qi away.

896
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,040
You all think about Qi.

897
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,440
I can't stand him.

898
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,840
I'm not leaving today.

899
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
If you have the ability,

900
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,640
you can beat me.

901
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,240
Zhou...

902
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
What are you doing?

903
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,040
Zhou Yuan.

904
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,440
Help me down, Zhou Yuan.

905
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
Help me down.

906
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,240
Help me down.

907
