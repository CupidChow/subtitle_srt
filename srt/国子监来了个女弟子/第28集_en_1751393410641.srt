00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,960
What are you doing?

6
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,840
She's still staying.

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,640
What about I take care of her for you?

8
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,960
She loves make-up.

9
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,500
I天 Jiming, it isn't some drug,

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:23,820

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,540
Young Master Guang.

12
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,400
Young Master!

13
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:53,420
Has the

Demon Jin,

17
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,980
give me that white restart

18
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,460
that Qian Jiuliu left.

19
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,780
this kind of Sang Qi.

20
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,940
In my heart,

21
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,660
only Ye Yunchi is Sang Qi.

22
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,100
Veterans 오십 swear

00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:23,260
the love

of our bond

25
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,880
and send the pouch yap of Hai Fei into Yan Yun's mouth.

26
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,620
I don't need to conceal

27
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,080
and let Xi hunt it down.

28
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,480
Lord,

29
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,220
there is Qian Jiu.

30
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:44,860
I know.

31
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,540
It's him.

32
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,260
Your Majesty.

33
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,900
I'm sorry.

34
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,740
Young Master, Miss Sang's illness...

35
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,260
From the symptoms,

36
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,740
it's the same as what Qian Jiu described.

37
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,060
I remember Qian Jiu said

38
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,220
this prescription is late-stage.

39
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,780
Even if you don't take the antidote,

40
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,020
there won't be any symptoms in three months.

41
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,980
Why would Miss Sang...

42
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,060
It's all my fault. I'm too obsessed with Yanyun.

43
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,700
The pouch is always with me.

44
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,900
That's why it's so fast.

45
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,060
But if that's the case,

46
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,420
why didn't you take the pouch away?

47
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,860
I took it with my bare hands.

48
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,580
It protected the pouch with all its might.

49
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,180
I didn't hesitate at all.

50
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,940
Besides,

51
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,140
what's the point of taking the pouch back?

52
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,820
She's no longer the Sang Xi I knew.

53
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,900
Are you going to let her go?

54
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,940
She chose her own path.

55
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,580
Let's leave it at that.

56
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,380
What I, Zhuo Wen Yuan, can't get

57
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,300
is what she can't get from Yanzhi.

58
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,540
I'm the one who will stay with A'qi in the end.

59
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,660
Keep on the order.

60
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,940
Keep investigating Yanzhi's whereabouts.

61
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,900
I want to see her dead or alive.

62
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,220
She knows too much.

63
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,740
If she doesn't leave for a day,

64
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,340
she'll have more trouble.

65
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,220
I understand.

66
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:48,980
Here.

67
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,740
Lanqi,

68
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,260
don't always sigh.

69
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,620
My wine is getting cold.

70
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:09,900
Here.

71
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,500
Smile.

72
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
Smile.

73
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,460
I didn't expect

74
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,860
you would smile.

75
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,780
Yanzhi is still alive.

76
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,500
I have to admit my guilt.

77
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,580
How can I smile?

78
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,180
I heard that your parents-in-law

79
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,260
went to see the officials.

80
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,620
They asked for a notice

81
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,100
that you had nothing to do with Qilang.

82
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,460
They even asked them

83
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,740
to terminate your engagement.

84
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,900
Is that true?

85
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,780
You really can't smile.

86
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,700
When will you stop?

87
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,980
Brother, are you still going to make fun of me?

88
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,700
I'm just teasing you

89
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,940
because I'm bored of you.

90
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,260
Brother,

91
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,580
aren't you worried about Yanzhi?

92
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
What's the use of worrying?

93
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,660
A funeral has been held.

94
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,740
You're obsessed with her again.

95
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,260
I didn't see Yanzhi

96
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,060
coming out of the grave.

97
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,460
All causes and effects

98
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,780
are destined to be known.

99
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,700
We just need to wait for the God's will.

100
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,940
See you.

101
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,860
It's really here.

102
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,380
Yes.

103
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,020
It smells so good.

104
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,020
The food is almost ready.

105
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,780
I'm going back.

106
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,220
See you.

107
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,500
My Lady,

108
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,620
it's going to be winter soon.

109
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,300
Yes.

110
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,780
I'll see you again.

111
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,900
Do you remember

112
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,820
when Deputy Chief Yan played the zither for you?

113
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,260
I remember that time,

114
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,180
Deputy Chief Yan came down from the sky in white clothes

115
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,980
and saved you from danger.

116
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,060
No wonder you still remember it.

117
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,060
But for so long,

118
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,780
there has been no news from Deputy Chief Yan.

119
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,740
That's a good thing.

120
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,700
My Lady, be careful.

121
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,660
Why don't we go back to our room?

122
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,980
The doctor said that you're fully recovered,

123
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,220
but you seem to be getting weaker.

124
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,740
The room is really hot.

125
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,100
I'm suffocating in the room every day.

126
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,340
Qi.

127
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,860
Yuan Xiaolang, why are you here?

128
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,580
Go ahead.

129
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,740
I can do it alone.

130
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,900
My Lady,

131
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,580
how can I leave you alone?

132
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,100
I'm looking for you, Qi.

133
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,740
Any news from Deputy Chief Yan?

134
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,140
I'll be honest with you.

135
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,900
You were sick before.

136
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,020
I didn't dare to tell you.

137
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,900
Zhuo Wenyuan took over the post of Deputy Chief Yan

138
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,660
on behalf of Yan Yunzhi.

139
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,540
He took over and changed the post.

140
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,300
The position of Deputy Chief Yan is now in the right place.

141
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,500
Besides,

142
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,220
I just heard that

143
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,500
he didn't follow the rules

144
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,180
and exempted you from the position of the point-of-sale.

145
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,580
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,380
My Lady.

147
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,020
What?

148
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,300
Tell me about it tomorrow.

149
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,580
Get a carriage ready.

150
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,180
My Lady, you're not allowed to go out now.

151
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,180
Get a carriage ready.

152
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,500
Stop.

153
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,540
A post?

154
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,980
The post of the Imperial College.

155
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,940
It's important.

156
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,540
No one can get in here.

157
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,180
That's strange.

158
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,820
I've been here for a year.

159
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,220
I've never heard of any post.

160
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,060
If there's no post, just leave here.

161
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,860
Cut the crap.

162
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,540
Let's go.

163
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,060
Let's go.

164
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,620
I'm not going in.

165
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,420
You're not going in?

166
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,780
Didn't you get exempted from the post?

167
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,580
Why are you here again?

168
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,500
By the way,

169
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,620
how's your illness?

170
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,460
I came here to ask about it.

171
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,420
I just got here a moment ago.

172
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,140
What's wrong with the Imperial College?

173
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,220
Why didn't you let me in?

174
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,620
It's like a government office.

175
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,900
They even sent someone to guard it.

176
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,860
Don't mention it.

177
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,620
It's the rule of Zhou Wen Yuan's financial power

178
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,020
when Sang Qi was ill.

179
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,220
In order to prevent any treachery,

180
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,140
they actually

181
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
gave a post to some other subjects

182
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,260
and sent some good students out.

183
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,860
Isn't he making a fuss?

184
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,700
What does he want?

185
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,820
More than that.

186
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,060
You and Deputy Chief

187
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,220
made a lot of new rules.

188
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,300
They were all canceled.

189
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,100
The scholars didn't dare to say anything.

190
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,380
Since Zhou Wen Yuan

191
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,660
took over the Imperial College,

192
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,020
the Imperial College has become more strict and narrow.

193
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,460
They have high expectations of the family.

194
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,220
They can do whatever they want with the rich.

195
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,500
They've become

196
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,660
the so-called rich and high-class scholars.

197
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,380
Nonsense.

198
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,820
Is Zhou Wen Yuan in there?

199
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,540
I'll go find him.

200
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,740
It seems to be in Deputy Chief Yan's study.

201
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,940
Why are you back?

202
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:52,940
What?

203
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,900
You want to break in?

204
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,620
Yes.

205
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,620
I want to break in.

206
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:58,860
Stop.

207
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,340
Go.

208
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,900
Stop.

209
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,740
Go.

210
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,700
Go.

211
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,180
Zhou Wen Yuan.

212
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,900
Qi.

213
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,060
Why are you here?

214
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,420
What do you want to do?

215
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:18,900
Sit.

216
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,620
Sit here.

217
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,300
Qi means

218
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,700
to avoid getting a promotion?

219
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,060
This is one.

220
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,460
Second,

221
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,740
I've been working with Deputy Chief Yan for so long.

222
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,500
Why do I have to

223
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,260
repeat the same idea?

224
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,500
Look.

225
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,820
You know it's Yan Yun Zhi's doing.

226
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,860
I made this decision

227
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,620
after considering this.

228
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,100
Yan Yun Zhi has been in the Imperial College for many years.

229
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,020
His purpose is unclear.

230
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,020
No one knows why he abandoned the family relationship.

231
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,860
During the security period,

232
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,980
I abandoned him.

233
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,580
The official's family

234
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,580
is sure about this.

235
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,660
Why?

236
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,740
What can he achieve

237
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,980
by opening the Imperial College?

238
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,580
Zhou Wen Yuan.

239
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,980
This is just my brother's wish.

240
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,540
But even if this is your wish,

241
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,140
it's also Yan Yun Zhi's doing.

242
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,060
Who can guarantee that he's not lying to you?

243
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,780
Then tell me.

244
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,860
How can you give up?

245
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,740
It's the Spring Festival in a few days.

246
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,780
If you're willing to accompany me,

247
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,540
maybe I'll be in a good mood

248
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,340
and things will change.

249
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,020
Okay, I promise.

250
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,900
What about the rest of your life?

251
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,380
It's up to you.

252
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,220
As long as you can keep my brother's wish.

253
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,780
Okay.

254
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
It's a deal.

255
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,580
Qi.

256
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,540
Now the city is in chaos.

257
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,820
Do you still believe in Yan Yun Zhi?

258
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,660
Lan Jin, what you said,

259
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,580
when did I not believe him?

260
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,700
Qi.

261
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Even now,

262
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,620
I'm not hiding it from you.

263
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,620
I'm just

264
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,660
blaming you.

265
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,100
After all,

266
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
I've always admired the life of

267
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,100
a husband and a wife in the future.

268
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,940
And I also regard Yun Zhi

269
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,020
as my husband.

270
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,140
And your appearance...

271
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,820
But now I think about it,

272
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,620
I also understand

273
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,580
why I can't win you over.

274
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,020
Because you and he

275
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,820
share life and death.

276
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,460
You're meant to be together.

277
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,660
I ask myself,

278
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,380
if it were me,

279
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,740
I might not be able to

280
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,580
go through so many ups and downs with Yan Yun Zhi

281
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,820
and keep going to this point.

282
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,420
Sang Qi,

283
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,180
I actually

284
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,300
envy you.

285
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,220
You dare to love, dare to hate,

286
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,380
dare to think, dare to do,

287
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,980
and even face the storm without changing your face.

288
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,940
And me?

289
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,380
Although I'm

290
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,980
the most talented woman in the world,

291
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
in fact,

292
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,540
I'm just a normal woman.

293
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,500
Ren Ji,

294
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,420
don't be so self-righteous.

295
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,500
It's also a way to live a life.

296
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,140
It's also a way to live a life.

297
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,540
As long as you're happy and comfortable,

298
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
you're all good.

299
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,420
There's no high or low.

300
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,540
I believe one day,

301
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,380
you'll meet someone

302
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,140
who will take you wholeheartedly

303
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,580
and truly love you.

304
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,340
Then I'll take Qi's word.

305
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,780
Qi,

306
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,100
I know that you're having a hard time

307
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,460
these days.

308
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,980
If there's anything I can do to help,

309
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,020
just tell me.

310
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,500
I'll do my best.

311
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,740
Thank you, Lan Jin.

312
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,380
Good!

313
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,260
Good!

314
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,540
Good!

315
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
Good!

316
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,540
Good!

317
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,580
Good!

318
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,780
Look.

319
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,740
A kite.

320
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,980
What do you want? I'll buy one for you.

321
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,300
Good!

322
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,540
Good!

323
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,500
Good!

324
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,180
Good!

325
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Good!

326
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,300
Good!

327
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,380
Good!

328
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,300
Good!

329
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,580
Good!

330
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,500
Good!

331
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,420
Good!

332
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Good!

333
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,420
Good!

334
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Good!

335
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,580
Good!

336
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
Good!

337
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Good!

338
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,340
Good!

339
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
Look.

340
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,660
Good!

341
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,900
Good!

342
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,900
Good!

343
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,260
Good!

344
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Good!

345
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Good!

346
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Good!

347
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,660
Qi,

348
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,660
do you like it?

349
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,140
I don't like it.

350
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,620
I just want to see it.

351
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,500
Good!

352
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,420
Good!

353
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,460
Give me one, boss.

354
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,700
Good!

355
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,460
Good!

356
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,620
Give me one!

357
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,580
Good!

358
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Good!

359
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,740
Good!

360
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,660
Qi.

361
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,900
Qi.

362
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,500
Qi.

363
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,820
Good!

364
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,700
Good!

365
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,620
Good!

366
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,060
Qi.

367
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,180
Good!

368
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,900
Qi.

369
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,380
Deputy Chief.

370
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Don't call me Deputy Chief.

371
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,500
From now on,

372
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,740
I'll call you Mrs. Zhuo.

373
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,420
Deputy Chief.

374
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,820
I can't believe

375
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,220
As expected, you are such a

376
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,460
annoying woman.

377
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,460
there is an engagement between us

378
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,260
and you try to help me

379
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,820
and you want to take a Licorice lawsuit!

380
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,780
What is the matter?

381
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,340
You left the Imperial College

382
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,500
and received the Jiaminhегi Shrine.

383
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,740
Do you really not want me

384
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,700
in your life?

385
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,800
exhibits you

386
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,960
are a pleasant sight.

387
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,020
Let me tell you

388
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,100
Hueryun Zhi,

389
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:55,900
Don't come near me

390
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,140
Fourth sister, let go of Sanqi

391
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,060
Let go of Sanqi

392
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,600
You have reached the limit

393
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,440
Even withoutZhuから

394
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,900
I lead the imperial army into the machinations

395
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,820
But I didn't teach you teach you withoutWining

396
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,660
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,980
Wait.

398
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,260
Don't move.

399
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,660
Don't hurt Sang Qi.

400
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,140
Don't move.

401
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,660
Ruo Yuan,

402
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,940
you're so kind.

403
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,980
But I'm here to

404
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,260
persuade you.

405
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,980
Such a heartless woman.

406
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,460
I don't want to have anything to do with her.

407
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,580
I...

408
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,180
I suggest you

409
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,220
think about it.

410
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,380
Qi.

411
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,980
Qi, are you okay?

412
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,380
Of course I'm not.

413
00:22:51,020 --> 00:23:16,300
Well...

414
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,540
Leng очень

415
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,180
Qi.

416
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,580
Qi.

417
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,940
Deputy Chief Yan.

418
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,840
Here.

419
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,340
You're quite arrogant

420
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,100
when you use the topic.

421
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,380
I'm not. I dare not.

422
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,980
You forgot what happened in the yard just now.

423
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,620
You said

424
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,140
the water is like a flower.

425
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,900
You said

426
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,340
you're ungrateful

427
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,420
and you're a man of your own.

428
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,780
You're shameless.

429
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,300
No, no, no.

430
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:09,940
I can't say that.

431
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,860
You're still talking back.

432
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,780
I...

433
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,580
You pushed me so hard just now.

434
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,980
Aren't you afraid that you'll hurt me?

435
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,140
How do you explain it?

436
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:18,900
Qi.

437
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,540
Qi.

438
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,380
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

439
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,460
I didn't control my strength just now.

440
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,500
I almost hurt you.

441
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,780
You hurt my heart?

442
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,540
Yes.

443
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,820
I hurt your heart.

444
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,700
But I really have no choice.

445
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,460
What I said just now,

446
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,780
when I pushed you back,

447
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,100
my heart was very painful.

448
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,580
It really hurts.

449
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,460
Yan Siye's mouth is

450
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,460
quite sweet.

451
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
But I don't know if it's true.

452
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,180
Of course it's true.

453
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,100
Qi.

454
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,460
But...

455
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,700
Your skills of picking thorns

456
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,300
are getting better day by day.

457
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,660
You don't like me?

458
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,260
You don't like me?

459
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,900
At that time,

460
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,780
I shouldn't have saved you back.

461
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:14,300
Master.

462
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,100
We've been running outside for a day.

463
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,620
Let's go back early.

464
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,740
I feel bored.

465
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,820
I want to go out for a walk.

466
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,020
You can't control

467
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:24,860
my little brother.

468
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,620
I can't control you.

469
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,500
But if you keep being like this,

470
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,860
Miss will be worried.

471
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,020
You're tired and don't want to go.

472
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,580
You have to take Miss with you.

473
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:38,140
It's a pity that I don't have any clues now.

474
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,340
It's great that

475
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,820
a person who can fall from the sky

476
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,340
and know everything.

477
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:45,820
Come.

478
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:48,860
Master.

479
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,940
Look.

480
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,620
There's a person.

481
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,700
Help me up.

482
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,420
Master.

483
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,180
Deputy Chief Yan.

484
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,740
It seems that this person

485
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,420
may not fall from the sky.

486
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,060
He may also float from the river.

487
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,220
Master, what should we do now?

488
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,020
What should we do?

489
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,660
Help me.

490
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,180
Someone.

491
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,420
You come to your brother whenever you need help.

492
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,820
Can't you come to me?

493
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,100
Deputy Chief.

494
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,780
Why are you in my room?

495
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,460
You must have a hallucination.

496
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,780
Why is he here?

497
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,300
Although it's unreasonable,

498
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm here.

499
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,900
Qi, I'm still injured.

500
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,540
Where are you injured?

501
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,860
Shouldn't you

502
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,700
come to me and hug me?

503
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,980
Why did you hit me?

504
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,900
You didn't tell me anything.

505
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,820
You made me worry for so long.

506
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,860
Sorry.

507
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,620
Sorry that I made you worry.

508
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,460
I'm sorry.

509
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,740
I'm sorry that I made you worried.

510
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,500
I'm sorry.

511
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,140
I'm sorry.

512
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,980
I'm sorry.

513
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,700
I'm sorry.

514
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,380
I'm sorry.

515
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,140
I'm sorry.

516
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,940
I'm sorry.

517
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,700
I'm sorry.

518
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,460
I'm sorry.

519
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,380
I'm sorry.

520
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,180
Qi is injured on the back.

521
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,220
You didn't tell me anything.

522
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,740
You can't find anyone after you leave the city.

523
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
You turned into a wanted criminal.

524
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,140
When I was in the police station,

525
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,460
you suddenly appeared in my room.

526
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,220
When I saw you,

527
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,100
you scared me to death.

528
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,260
I was forced by the situation.

529
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,340
I didn't have time to discuss with you.

530
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,980
Now,

531
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,260
I've told you everything.

532
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,340
You can't lie to me anymore.

533
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,820
You have to tell me everything.

534
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,140
Coming.

535
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,980
Mr. Zhuo.

536
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,420
Master, Mr. Zhuo is here.

537
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,500
Zhuo Xianzhi

538
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,620
Isn't this Zhuo Xianzhi?

539
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,620
What made you come here?

540
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,860
I thought you were busy

541
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,580
and busy with everything.

542
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,660
I didn't expect

543
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,580
you would come to my house.

544
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,860
What Grand Commandant Sang said

545
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,980
is too polite.

546
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,740
No matter how busy I am,

547
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,700
I won't forget Grand Commandant and Sang Qi.

548
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,420
In the future,

549
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,060
I will be more than enough to disturb others.

550
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,380
But I don't think

551
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,420
you are disturbing others.

552
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,780
Grand Commandant is a wise man.

553
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,860
Well,

554
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,460
Sang Qi and I just met

555
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,660
Yan Yunzhi on the way.

556
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,300
Wait.

557
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,500
You said

558
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,740
you found Yan Yunzhi?

559
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,820
Not only that.

560
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,100
He wanted to take Sang Qi away.

561
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,380
He almost hurt him.

562
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,700
Is that true?

563
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
Absolutely.

564
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,780
I brought these people here

565
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,260
to prevent Yan Yunzhi

566
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,460
from giving up.

567
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,140
They came to Grand Commandant's mansion

568
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,100
to disturb Sang Qi.

569
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,620
After all, Yan Yunzhi

570
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,940
is wanted now.

571
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,940
What if he gets angry and jumps the wall?

572
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,660
What?

573
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,940
I am the Grand Commandant.

574
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,060
Can't I even protect

575
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,100
my own mansion

576
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,420
and my own daughter?

577
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,700
Of course we can trust Grand Commandant.

578
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,780
But we came here with a mission.

579
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,660
Grand Commandant can't

580
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,380
resist.

581
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,860
Miss.

582
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:52,900
Bad news.

583
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,460
Mr. Zhuo said

584
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,140
he brought people here to protect you.

585
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,540
What?

586
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,740
Mr. Zhuo.

587
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,540
Mr. Zhuo, Miss is asleep.

588
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,180
Mr. Zhuo.

589
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:32,740
Qi.

590
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,780
Why are you here?

591
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,140
I am about to sleep.

592
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,940
I can't come out to see you.

593
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,060
It's okay.

594
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,860
Didn't you meet Yan Yunzhi just now?

595
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,220
I'm afraid he will disturb you again.

596
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,620
So I sent someone to guard you.

597
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,700
I'm fine.

598
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,220
Don't worry.

599
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,860
It's okay.

600
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,420
I also got the order from the government.

601
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,220
Just have a good rest.

602
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,060
Okay.

603
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,780
Thank you.

604
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,140
Mr. Zhuo.

605
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,820
Miss is asleep.

606
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:15,820
Miss.

607
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,700
What's wrong?

608
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,420
Nothing.

609
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,460
I just heard a noise in the room.

610
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,980
I'm worried. Come in and have a look.

611
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,700
I didn't move after I lay down.

612
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,260
There was no noise.

613
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:32,900
Really?

614
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,340
Zhuo Wenyuan.

615
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,780
At this time,

616
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,420
you broke into my room.

617
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,700
And brought so many people.

618
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,700
It's not good, right?

619
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,980
I'll leave at any time.

620
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,500
But don't worry, Qi.

621
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,700
I'll be guarding the door all night.

622
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,540
As long as you hear any noise,

623
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,260
you can call me anytime.

624
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,380
Lin Tian.

625
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,500
Mr. Zhuo.

626
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,660
Please.

627
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,620
He's gone.

628
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,500
He's gone.

629
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,340
Qi.

630
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Look at this.

631
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,820
I can only sleep here tonight.

632
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,260
What?

633
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,140
You feel wronged?

634
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,180
No.

635
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,500
I feel wronged because of you.

636
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,060
I'm sorry.

637
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,020
I'm sorry.

638
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm sorry.

639
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:46,860
I'm sorry.

640
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,740
I'm sorry.

641
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,740
I'm sorry.

642
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,740
I'm sorry.

643
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,700
I'm sorry.

644
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,540
I'm sorry.

645
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,340
I'm sorry.

646
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,380
I'm sorry.

647
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,820
Lie down.

648
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,420
I'm here to guard you.

649
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,980
But I really need a reason.

650
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,020
Don't worry about others.

651
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,580
Let's think about what to do next.

652
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,660
According to our previous plan,

653
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,980
Zhuo Wenyuan will be sure

654
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,780
as long as you show up.

655
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,620
It seems that

656
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,820
our guess is right.

657
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,100
By then, she'll probably

658
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,580
order the troops of Jingzhao Mansion

659
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,580
to arrest me.

660
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,340
When we're empty-handed,

661
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,620
she'll also kill Yan Sanlang.

662
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,820
Have you made a plan?

663
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,820
I'm not joking.

664
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,860
Don't worry.

665
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,180
Everything will be fine.

666
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:23,940
I've asked Yan Yan

667
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,340
to prepare in advance.

668
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,380
Third Wolf has been taken away by Second Uncle.

669
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,420
Your master will take care of him.

670
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,460
Don't worry.

671
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,180
As long as Yan Sanlang is safe.

672
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,020
How long will he wake up?

673
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,500
I'm still waiting for him

674
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,340
to clear your name.

675
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
I don't know.

676
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,340
So I can't

677
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,340
put all my hopes

678
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,620
on him now.

679
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,620
Although you're long-suffering,

680
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,020
I couldn't just wait it out.

681
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,180
Jing Alicia.

682
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,240
I hurt myself.

683
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,920
My neck.

684
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:08,860
Are you OK?

685
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:11,620
Don't worry.

686
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,260
Keep speaking.

687
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,560
So it looks like

688
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,020
and the three old men who attacked the mountain outside the school.

689
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,260
These things are not enough to move to the Zhou Manor.

690
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,140
We can only stay in the manor.

691
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,900
You're just like me.

692
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,140
We can start the investigation from the road.

693
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,780
As long as we find the evidence of his personal crime,

694
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,780
there will be no problem.

695
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,300
How can we make him start to take control of these things again?

696
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,540
We have to find a way

697
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,340
to let him relax.

698
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,340
Only in this way can we catch him.

699
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,980
A Ji.

700
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,460
Tonight should be the last night I spend with you.

701
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,620
Today, Zhu Wen Yuan didn't find me.

702
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,140
But he should be found soon.

703
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,380
Have a good rest.

704
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,540
This is still a long memory.

705
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,500
Honey.

706
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,820
What's wrong?

707
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,540
Julia said

708
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,540
if you miss me deliciously,

709
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,380
there'll be no chance for us to meet again.

710
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,660
Jerk.

711
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,340
Thank you, everyone.

712
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,340
Go back and rest early.

713
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
You should go back early too.

714
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,460
Brothers, let's go.

715
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Yan Yanzi

716
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:24,860
Young Master.

717
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,580
How is it?

718
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Things are not going well.

719
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,340
According to Young Master's arrangement,

720
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,660
we went to assassinate Yan Sanlang.

721
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,300
Our men were ambushed.

722
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,340
Yan Sanlang in Jingzhao Mansion

723
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
was kicked out by Grandfather Yan.

724
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,580
But fortunately,

725
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,340
the assassin we sent

726
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
was a dead body.

727
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,500
He was killed immediately after he was caught.

728
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,700
He didn't leave any tail.

729
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,980
Yan Yanzi is not that smart.

730
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,500
How dare he play tricks on me?

731
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
In my opinion,

732
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,500
it's still Yan Yanzi who is the culprit.

733
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,620
The people we sent

734
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,500
searched the whole Bianjing City.

735
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,940
But they didn't find Yan Yanzi.

736
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,980
Young Master stayed in Taiwei Mansion for a night last night.

737
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
He didn't find anything.

738
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,580
Could it be that

739
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,980
he didn't fall into the city?

740
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,380
It's possible.

741
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,260
Where did my husband go last night?

742
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,500
Why didn't he come back last night?

743
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:19,980
Jiayin.

744
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,260
What's going on?

745
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,580
Don't mention it.

746
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,260
My favorite headdress is missing.

747
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,300
It's just a headdress.

748
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,580
You can't buy it again.

749
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,700
No way.

750
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,100
It's unique in the city.

751
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:30,780
You can't buy it.

752
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,020
Then find it.

753
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,180
I went to the restaurant and restaurant yesterday.

754
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,340
I've been looking for it over and over again.

755
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,620
It's all gone.

756
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,420
We just need to dig a third one.

757
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,980
Madam.

758
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,460
I found the headdress.

759
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,180
Where did you find it?

760
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,380
I found it in Madam's room.

761
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,900
I stayed in the room for so long.

762
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,940
How could it be there?

763
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,500
Right.

764
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,500
It's all gone.

765
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,100
Isn't it under the cover?

766
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,460
Jinmu.

767
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,780
Find someone to find Taiwei Mansion.

768
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,660
Master.

769
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,900
Mr. Zhou is here again.

770
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,140
Why are you here again?

771
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,980
Are you done?

772
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,060
My daughter is with me.

773
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,500
Are you still worried

774
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,460
that she was caught by Ye Yunchi?

775
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,180
We received a report that

776
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,540
the wanted criminal Ye Yunchi

777
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,140
is hiding in your Taiwei Mansion.

778
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,620
What report?

779
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,580
It's not convenient to reveal it.

780
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,580
Qi.

781
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,260
What's the matter?

782
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,460
I'm worried about the headdress.

783
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
I'm worried about the headdress.

784
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,420
Qi.

785
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,940
Can you stop

786
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,780
my work?

787
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,780
Zhou Wenyuan.

788
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,220
You broke into my room yesterday.

789
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,460
I didn't argue with you.

790
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,820
You came to my mansion again today.

791
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,700
What do you want to do?

792
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,140
It's just a work.

793
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,580
Are you feeling guilty?

794
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,340
I'm

795
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,100
guilty.

796
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,460
Good.

797
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,340
Search.

798
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,220
Search.

799
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:16,940
How's Xia NGO?

800
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,440
They've got key jesters now.

801
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,420
vividle.

802
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,660
The bad guys are probably

803
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,140
ta vicis 57.

804
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,380
They're points four.

805
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,200
The weak ones are

806
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,780
to the left of him.

807
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,760
Go to the room.

808
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,140
Search.

809
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,260
Sir, we didn't find him.

810
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:55,860
No.

811
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,460
Retreat.

812
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,180
No.

813
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,300
No, sir.

814
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,180
Retreat.

815
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,020
Sir,

816
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,700
the whole Sang's Mansion has been searched.

817
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,420
Nothing unusual.

818
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,940
Where is Sang Qi's room?

819
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,620
Sir, we've searched it.

820
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,260
Are you satisfied now?

821
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,620
Qi.

822
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,380
Stop talking.

823
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,620
Let him go.

824
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,260
A Ji.

825
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,900
A Ji.

826
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,100
A Ji.

827
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,060
What's wrong with you?

828
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,580
A Ji.

829
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,220
A Ji.

830
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:54,980
A Ji.

831
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,220
A Ji.

832
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,340
A Ji.
