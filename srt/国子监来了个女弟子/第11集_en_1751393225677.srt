00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Deputy Chief!

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Second Uncle.

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Shut up!

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you doing?

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Deputy Chief!

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Deputy Chief, how are you?

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm fine.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll take care of him.

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You go.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Get him!

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Go!

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Go!

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Deputy Chief.

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
As long as you're happy.

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Are you okay?

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think we've escaped from the ghost house.

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It might be the end.

20
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
How about you...

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's...

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You go out first.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

26
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But it was a helpless move.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You didn't mean to bully Mo Yuan.

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't misunderstand.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's okay.

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not the first time anyway.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
First...

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Last time I was poisoned in the study.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It wasn't a dream, right?

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then your mouth...

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I...

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's okay.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You were poisoned.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You can understand everything.

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Of course it's okay.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I won't take it to heart.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You won't take it to heart either, right?

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's find Master.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I've taken it to heart long ago.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I just don't know

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
if I can do this.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yanyan!

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Lian Pian!

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yanyan!

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What are you doing?

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yanyan!

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's okay.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I've learned the martial arts of the Ghosts.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I won't let you get hurt.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yanyan!

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yanyan, go away!

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yanyan, go away!

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Go away, Yanyan!

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Go away, Yanyan!

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Go away!

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yanyan!

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yanyan!

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Miss!

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Master!

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm tired from fighting.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Get up.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Get up.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I heard that your field trip is coming to an end.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm here to test your martial arts.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
See if you can get off the mountain.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't spread the word

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
that I'm not good at the Yanhe-Qing.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Or you'll ruin my reputation.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Master,

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you're good at martial arts.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But you're too dark.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're not talented.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're just good at fighting.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm trying my best.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm just a footman.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm just being polite.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When you leave Lin Wufeng,

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you'll be in trouble.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're not as sharp as me

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
when you're not good at swords.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Deputy Chief.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You've known that

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm the one who's dark.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I didn't see him get through.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Although he didn't get through,

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
he knew it was me

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
when he fought with me.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He even tried to hit me.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He pretended to be injured

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and asked you to carry him away.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's it.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm embarrassed for him.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Who pretended to be injured?

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I didn't want to ruin

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
your test.

101
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's why I quit.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Who knew Qi would carry me away

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
without saying a word?

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Deputy Chief,

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you mean you blame me?

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Fine.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
When it's dangerous,

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll throw you out there.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You'll have less burden.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You'll be long and heavy.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You'll have to do this in the future.

112
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a deal.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's hard to keep up with the horse.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Enough.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
After all, it's just a test.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Lastly,

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll send you my best wishes.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I hope you guys

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
won't have to

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
spend the rest of your life

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
in the way I taught you.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Have a safe life

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and live a good life.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's great.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
From tomorrow,

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I, Lin Wufeng,

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
will be able to get back to peace.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you, Master.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Thank you, Master.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yan Yan, are you okay?

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm fine.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We're in the same boat.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yan Yan,

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
when we get to Bianjing,

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll treat you to a good meal.

136
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sure.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You must keep your word.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I will.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Did you have a good time

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
at Tian Ji Ya?

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm fine.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm fine.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm fine.

144
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm fine.

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm fine.

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Me too.

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I had a good time too.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No one asked you.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Anyway, it was worth it.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Deputy Chief, Sang Qi,

151
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
let's have a school trip.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I believe after

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
this field trip,

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
many things

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
will be different.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It will be different.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
By the way, Deputy Chief,

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
after I start school,

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll be the next one.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't think about it.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I won't give you

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
any special treatment.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm not thinking about it.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You haven't gone down the mountain yet.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are you turning around?

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Deputy Chief.

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Deputy Chief,

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
please forgive me.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Deputy Chief.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Father.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your daughter is back.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do you remember your father?

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How can I forget him?

174
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My Lady,

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Master has already told the cook

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to prepare

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
your favorite dishes.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I've been wanting to eat

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
this reunion meal.

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Luckily, Father prepared it.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's go.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hurry up.

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't get cold.

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's go.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Father.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Father.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Father.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Father.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Father.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Father.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I feel like

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you've lost weight

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
during the time you went up the mountain.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Lose weight?

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There's a kind of weight

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
that your father thinks you've lost.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't want to lose weight.

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I want to be strong.

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You've been working out every day.

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You don't have time to do it.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Really?

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
How is it?

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I can even

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
eat all the dumplings now.

205
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You've improved a lot.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But you didn't tell me

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
before you went up the mountain

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that there were other people.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Father,

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
before I went up the mountain,

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I didn't know

212
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
that Master Yan was there.

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I didn't mean to

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
lie to you.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Master Yan was there?

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You mean Yan Yan?

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yan Xiaolang was there too.

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Didn't I tell you?

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Even if you don't want to lose weight,

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
if it's known that

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
you spent a month

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
with a few young men

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
on the mountain,

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
do you think it's good for your reputation?

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's okay, father.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They haven't got married.

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
They care more about their children than I do.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I won't tell anyone.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Nonsense.

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
From today onward,

231
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
until Guo Zijian's blood pressure is at its peak,

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
you're not allowed to go out

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
without my permission.

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't be so rude to me.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If I find out that you sneak out,

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll punish him.

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Punish him for not eating meat.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Master, I'm innocent.

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Miss,

241
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm begging you.

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Just stay at home.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't go anywhere.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I know.

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
If you want to be free,

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
keep an eye on Miss.

247
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Yes.

248
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Eat some bean sprouts.

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Here.

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
After you went down the mountain,

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you look bright and handsome.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You must have a lot of hair.

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I wish you

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
a lot of strength.

255
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please get up.

256
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Here.

257
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's Lanji's birthday.

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're not helping me.

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There are many gifts in the birthday.

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I won't go to the banquet.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If I go,

262
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll be misunderstood.

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You won't go?

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I heard

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that the one from Sang's family was grounded after going down the mountain.

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I guess you didn't have a chance to meet.

267
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He went this time.

268
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's why I called you.

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you don't appreciate it, then forget it.

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The banquet hasn't ended yet.

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll go.

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll go.

273
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Your martial arts

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
are getting more and more amazing.

275
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yanqi,

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I didn't know you had this side.

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm still in the process of self-understanding.

278
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What I didn't expect is

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
that you would help me and Sangqi.

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
After all, you are Lanji's brother.

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So what?

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You don't have that kind of affection for my sister.

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You forced her to pull her out and added to her troubles.

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You'd better see through it early

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and get rid of it early.

286
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I hope so, too.

287
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Although I've made it clear to Lanji,

288
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
we are just friends since childhood.

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
At most, it's just brother and sister affection.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There's nothing else.

291
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm willing to say

292
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that it's just a joke between the two elders.

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It doesn't count at all.

294
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But Lanji seems to have not heard it at all.

295
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
She still lives on the identity of my wife, Wei Guomen.

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'd like to explain it to her in public.

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But I'm afraid it would hurt her reputation.

298
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't be afraid.

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
To explain it in public

300
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
is to make her stop thinking about it.

301
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You two brothers and sisters

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
are really affectionate.

303
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's because of the deep affection

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
that I understand her personality better than anyone else.

305
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't look at her usual speech.

306
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
She's soft and soft.

307
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
She's stronger than anyone else.

308
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
She's strong in everything.

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you don't reject her

310
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and let her have hope,

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
you'll be the one who's going to be ruined.

312
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So, you have to be cruel and reject her.

313
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You have to hurt her.

314
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's the real way to help her.

315
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I didn't expect you to have such a good sense of humor.

316
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on.

317
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm happy that you have more friends

318
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
than I do.

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Choose a birthday gift for her.

320
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't be late for the invitation.

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yes, father.

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Miss, be careful.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Lianmian.

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Ning'er.

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What's this smell?

326
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Fried stinky tofu is ready.

327
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is freedom.

328
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
This is the smell of freedom.

329
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's the smell of freedom.

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Miss, you're exaggerating.

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You've been in the Taiwei Prefecture for three days.

332
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You didn't practice martial arts in the yard.

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You just talked to young master in the study.

334
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You even worked in the kitchen to steal the cook.

335
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How can you be not free in such a big Taiwei Prefecture?

336
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Lianmian, you have to be kind.

337
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I stayed because of you.

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Otherwise, do you think father can hold me back?

339
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Fortunately, it was Sister Su's birthday gift that invited us.

340
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Today, we two

341
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
went to the Qingfeng House in a hurry

342
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and had a wedding.

343
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
We have to get these three days back.

344
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Let's go.

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hurry up.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Miss, it's almost done.

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Miss, you've been here for almost two hours.

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's almost time to go back.

349
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm going to prepare a birthday gift for Miss Su.

350
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How can it end so soon?

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You picked a gift for Miss Su.

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
How can you take a street stall for a walk?

353
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Besides,

354
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
how could Miss Su like these things?

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I think you're just making yourself happy.

356
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Master Sang.

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Master Sang.

358
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Master Sang.

359
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why are you so anxious to be scolded by a ghost?

360
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Miss.

361
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's scary to be scolded by a ghost.

362
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
My mother, she...

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She...

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Say it.

365
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You're not going to say it?

366
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's not talk about my family matters.

367
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But you two...

368
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I heard that Master Sang has been keeping you in the mansion

369
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and not allowing you to walk around.

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You know that?

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I made you think you didn't know.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You know you're not coming to pick up the thunder.

373
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I helped you?

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not that good at calculating.

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Your father sent someone to my mansion to say hello.

376
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He didn't want me to take you up the mountain and down the sea.

377
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you think I'm wrong?

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I was the one who was dragged up the mountain by you.

379
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But in the end, it was my fault.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So you mean

381
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
that you learned martial arts by me?

382
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's my fault instead.

383
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Fine.

384
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You go up the mountain with me.

385
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No.

386
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
We're all fellow disciples.

387
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't think about that.

388
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Go away.

389
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Master Sang, why did he send you out today?

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We're here to prepare a birthday gift for Lan.

391
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
We're here to take a walk.

392
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I remember now.

393
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I didn't prepare anything.

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go shopping together.

395
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Sure.

396
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know what you girls like.

397
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Please give me a model.

398
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're good at playing tricks.

399
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Girls like different things.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We can't decide for ourselves.

401
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let alone you.

402
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's better than me.

403
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Just tell me what you like.

404
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What I like?

405
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What if I choose something that's not suitable?

406
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What you like is not suitable.

407
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Then...

408
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Then...

409
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Then...

410
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What?

411
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You two are so good at playing tricks.

412
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm done dancing in the city.

413
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Miss, you don't even look at it.

414
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
How long have you been playing tricks on yourself?

415
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're lying again.

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
My brother is so...

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Master Sang, do you like this?

418
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It looks very suitable for your temperament.

419
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll buy it.

420
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For you.

421
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How much is it?

422
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This is too long.

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is three dollars.

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Here.

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Thank you.

426
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No need to find it.

427
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Thank you.

428
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Take it, Master Sang.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Tell me if you need anything else.

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's go and have a look.

431
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Miss.

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Look at this.

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's normal.

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll buy it.

435
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No.

436
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't sell me things.

437
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I...

438
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Miss.

439
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The bracelet is not paid yet.

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What do I pay for what they take?

441
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't care.

442
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What do I pay for what they take?

443
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Miss.

444
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll give it to you.

445
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Lian Pian.

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Lian Pian.

447
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You...

448
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Lian Pian.

449
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You left without paying.

450
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You left me alone again.

451
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Miss, I'll pay now.

452
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes.

453
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Wait for me at the silk shop.

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll be right back.

455
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll go with him.

456
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll go with him.

457
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Lian Pian.

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Lian Pian, give me the bag.

459
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No.

460
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Give me the money bag.

461
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll buy you a pair.

463
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No.

464
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Lian Pian.

465
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Isn't this Qi?

466
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Qi.

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I didn't expect to see you here.

468
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I was just talking to my sister.

469
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I heard you were grounded by Grand Commandant Sang.

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Did you get into trouble again?

471
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I just left home for a few days.

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Dad missed me too much.

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So I stayed at home for a few days.

474
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But you...

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You always like to gossip behind others.

476
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You'll get into trouble one day.

477
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Qi is really a sharp-tongued.

478
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Miss Song is still the same.

479
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
She gets into trouble everywhere.

480
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I picked a good gift today.

481
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I can't let you break it.

482
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
A birthday gift for Lan Ji?

483
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I thought Qi was in the deep mountains a few days ago.

484
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I didn't know there was a birthday party.

485
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I picked this gift with all my heart.

486
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Sister Su will understand my heart.

487
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Others will also be hit by my ice and snow.

488
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Since I met you,

489
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll let you open your eyes.

490
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This is the dragon incense ink I ordered from Xuanzhou.

491
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Don't touch it.

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Qi, do you know the sound of the dragon incense ink?

493
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I guess Qi doesn't know it.

494
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Su's family is a literary family.

495
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Sister Su is the most talented woman in Bianjing.

496
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
A good ink cake

497
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
naturally suits Sister Su's heart.

498
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This is Qi.

499
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What about Qi?

500
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Qi is...

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I hope Sister Su can understand.

502
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
When she enters Yan's mansion,

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll be the right person.

504
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I must keep my word.

505
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I can't let her be deceived by her talent.

506
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Ayi,

507
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
you're really thoughtful.

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You're not only thoughtful, but also thoughtful.

509
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Qi, don't praise me.

510
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I wish Qi could witness this.

511
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But Sister Su

512
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
won't invite a woman like Qi.

513
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Ayi,

514
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
don't be too disappointed.

515
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Although I haven't seen Sister Su for a few times,

516
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
she's a lucky girl.

517
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I've already received the invitation.

518
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Then I have to remind Sister Su

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
that she can't invite anyone in the future.

520
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I can't afford to lose her.

521
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Da, da, da.

522
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Da, da, da.

523
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Da, da, da.

524
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Grandpa,

525
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
we've arrived at our mansion.

526
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You should go back.

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's go, Lianping.

528
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Wait.

529
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You...

530
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What are you doing?

531
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Take it.

532
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
These are all girls' stuff.

533
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't need them.

534
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't like them.

535
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't like them. I don't want them.

536
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Don't lie to me.

537
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You've taken good care of them.

538
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You can tell that they like them.

539
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm leaving.

540
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Are you sure, Lianping?

541
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Are you sure, Lianping?

542
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Look at Yan Yan.

543
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
She was...

544
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
She was like this.

545
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
How disgusting.

546
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Miss.

547
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Listen.

548
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I can buy what Yan Yan bought for you.

549
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You don't have to be so happy.

550
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What's the big deal?

551
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yan Yan.

552
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Miss.

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Miss.

554
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What are you thinking about?

555
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm thinking about Song Jiayin.

556
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Song Jiayin?

557
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Did you just argue with him?

558
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Impossible.

559
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Miss Song has always been your enemy.

560
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Besides, you never put your heart into it.

561
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What's going on?

562
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I put my heart into it.

563
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Not him.

564
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's what he said.

565
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
No.

566
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I have to go out.

567
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You're going out again?

568
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Where are you going?

569
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm going to Su's house to find Lan Ji.

570
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's the birthday party.

571
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Why do you have to go in advance?

572
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's because I have something to say.

573
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm afraid it's not appropriate to say it at the birthday party.

574
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Miss.

575
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Qi.

576
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's so late.

577
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
What do you want to talk to me about?

578
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Why don't we go inside and talk?

579
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Lan Ji.

580
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I've been thinking about it.

581
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I think I should have told you before your birthday party.

582
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Qi, please.

583
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Although we haven't known each other for a long time,

584
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you treated me sincerely.

585
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You didn't hide anything from me.

586
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It's called a heart-to-heart.

587
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Since I have other thoughts in my heart now,

588
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I think I should tell you.

589
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Do you remember the heart-to-heart we talked about before?

590
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Why do you mention this all of a sudden?

591
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I've been staying with Deputy Chief for a while.

592
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I suddenly found that I have a little different feelings for him.

593
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
But it's not the kind of you-me-you,

594
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
and you're so cold-hearted.

595
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I think he's like...

596
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
He's like...

597
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He's like the wind blowing on people after noon.

598
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's cool and cool.

599
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
It's like the smell of firewood.

600
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It smells warm and fragrant.

601
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No, it's not.

602
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
It's like the milk wine in the wine tank.

603
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
It makes people drunk and warm.

604
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I don't know if I've made myself clear.

605
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Anyway,

606
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Aqi, are you hungry?

607
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
No, I'm not hungry.

608
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I just think I should tell you clearly.

609
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
That's why I'm worthy of your honesty to me.

610
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm happy that you're willing to tell me this.

611
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
In my opinion,

612
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
you still need some time to sort out your thoughts.

613
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Maybe you can find the answer at my birthday party.

614
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay.

615
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Hello, Miss Sang.

616
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Miss has been waiting inside for a long time.

617
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Please come with me.

618
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Miss Sang.

619
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Miss Sang.

620
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Miss Sang.

621
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Miss Sang.

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Miss Sang.

623
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Miss Sang.

624
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Miss Sang.

625
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Miss Sang.

626
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Miss Sang.

627
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Miss Sang.

628
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Miss Sang.

629
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Miss Sang.

630
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Miss Sang.

631
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Miss Sang.

632
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Miss Sang.

633
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Miss Sang.

634
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Miss Sang.

635
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Miss Sang.

636
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Miss Sang.

637
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Miss Sang.

638
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Miss Sang.

639
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Miss Sang.

640
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Miss Sang.

641
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Miss Sang.

642
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Miss Sang.

643
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Miss Sang.

644
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Miss Sang.

645
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Miss Sang.

646
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Miss Sang.

647
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Miss Sang.

648
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Miss Sang.

649
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Miss Sang.

650
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Miss Sang.

651
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Miss Sang.

652
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Miss Sang.

653
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Miss Sang.

654
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Miss Sang.

655
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Miss Sang.

656
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Hi.

657
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Good to see you, Miss Sang.

658
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Are you make friends?

659
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Who are you?

660
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I've...

661
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Always wanted to meet you.

662
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:32,540
Formation is

663
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,840
Oath

664
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,300
Right

665
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,480
Dress

666
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Please sit down.

667
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Please sit down.

668
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,040
Su,

669
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,840
this is my birthday gift for you.

670
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,480
This is a special incense wood

671
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,560
I prepared for you.

672
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,080
I hope you'll like it

673
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,240
and understand what I mean.

674
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,680
Thank you, aunt.

675
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,600
Su.

676
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
This is...

677
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,400
This is the grassland landscape

678
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,840
I embroidered with Lian Pian.

679
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,920
Although the embroidery is not very good,

680
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,840
it's still my heart.

681
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,560
This is the best one

682
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,400
I've ever done.

683
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,840
Thank you, Qi.

684
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,320
The pattern is very special.

685
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
I like it.

686
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,760
Wen Yuan, please put it away.

687
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,680
It's okay.

688
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,160
Here it is.

689
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,240
I knew it.

690
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
Mr. Yan knows that

691
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,000
you're good at playing the zither.

692
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,280
You'll definitely get this.

693
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,560
Not only that.

694
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,600
This zither looks ordinary,

695
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,120
but it's made by a famous craftsman.

696
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,360
It's 100 years old.

697
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
It was used by a famous craftsman.

698
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
It's not ordinary.

699
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,680
It's even called the rare treasure.

700
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,920
I heard that

701
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,800
Mr. Yan bought it

702
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,480
with a lot of money.

703
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,880
Mr. Yan is really generous.

704
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
Of course.

705
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,600
Think about it.

706
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,760
Does this zither sound like zither?

707
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,960
It makes sense.

708
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,360
The zither is bright and bright.

709
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,480
Mr. Yan, are you going to

710
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,840
propose to the Su family?

711
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,320
I...

712
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,360
Thank you for your gift, Mr. Yan.

713
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,600
This is my favorite gift today.

714
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
I'm flattered.

715
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,320
I'm in the mood now.

716
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,840
Why don't I play a song for you?

717
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,840
I really envy you.

718
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,760
Since it's a zither from Mr. Yan,

719
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,520
let's play a song called Phoenix.

720
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,720
Sister Su should play the song

721
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,160
of Phoenix.

722
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,280
I think it's best to sing it in a long time.

723
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,760
You're right.

724
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,680
One mountain, two mountains.

725
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,160
The mountain is high and the water is cold.

726
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,720
The song is a night-long song.

727
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Sister Su is so elegant.

728
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,600
I wonder which one

729
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
is the best man in the world.

730
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,600
The one who blocks the star from the clouds.

731
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
Are you the same?

732
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,960
Miss.

733
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Yes.

734
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,520
I have something to tell you.

735
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,840
My mother arranged a wedding for me.

736
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,280
I'm going to propose to her in a few days.

737
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,640
Lin Pian.

738
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,520
Yun Zhi.

739
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,880
Yun Zhi.

740
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,120
It's a rare opportunity.

741
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,480
How about we work together?

742
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,760
Speaking of being good at music,

743
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,120
your brother, Qing Xuan Jun,

744
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,280
is better than me.

745
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:02,640
I...

746
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,000
How about he work with you?

747
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,160
You gave me this zither.

748
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,960
It's the best if we work together.

749
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,640
Anjie.

750
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,760
You and I grew up together.

751
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,040
We're like brothers and sisters.

752
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,360
In this way,

753
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,640
Qing Xuan and I are like brothers.

754
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,120
What's the difference

755
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,640
between me and him

756
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:24,680
when we work together?

757
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:25,960
Besides,

758
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,480
I gave you this zither

759
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
because I hope

760
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,720
you can find your soul mate soon.

761
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,480
If I play the zither with you,

762
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,240
I'll be the one

763
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,480
who can play the zither with you.

764
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,720
Excuse me.

765
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,680
What's going on?

766
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,400
They're like brothers and sisters.

767
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,760
Does Yan Si Ye mean

768
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,280
he doesn't want to marry Sister Su?

769
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,320
Then Sister Su...

770
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,560
Yan.

771
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,360
Why are you suddenly unhappy?

772
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,480
Yan Si Ye gave Sister Su

773
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
such an expensive gift.

774
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,640
How can I be happy?

775
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Didn't you also

776
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,160
prepare it with a lot of effort?

777
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,480
Of course.

778
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,160
I gave Sister Su a gift.

779
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,040
It's to show my attitude.

780
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
Yan Si Ye is different.

781
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
He's showing his love.

782
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,080
He's like this before he comes in.

783
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,280
If he really comes in,

784
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,680
he'll take advantage of his own favor.

785
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
He'll take advantage of his own favor

786
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,320
and get a kind of revenge.

787
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,480
But I don't think

788
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,880
Sister Su is like that.

789
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,080
You don't understand.

790
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,480
She's a girl from a poor family.

791
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,560
She's not easy to deal with.

792
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,680
What's wrong with you?

793
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,680
She looks unhappy.

794
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
She wasn't happy at first.

795
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,200
Now she's even more angry.

796
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,480
Let's go.

797
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,000
Give it to me.

798
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Give it to me.

799
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,240
You're not a good person.

800
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,480
You're so hard to comfort.

801
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,360
You're not worth it

802
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,160
to scold me.

803
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,560
It's all my fault.

804
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
It's all his fault.

805
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,400
It's not because of him.

806
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,080
It's all his fault.

807
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,440
What's my fault?

808
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,240
Shouldn't you be playing the zither

809
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,800
with Sister Su in the front hall?

810
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,480
Why are you here?

811
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,480
I'm looking for you.

812
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,160
What?

813
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Why are you looking for me?

814
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,600
You're just sitting around in the house.

815
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
You can't leave.

816
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,240
Why don't you go back and stay with him?

817
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,960
There are so many people with him.

818
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm not alone.

819
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,840
Lian Pian.

820
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,760
Lian Pian.

821
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,240
Lian Pian.

822
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,320
Lian Pian, wait for me.

823
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,840
Lian Pian.

824
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,760
You're the protagonist.

825
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,560
Why are you asking me?

826
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,320
Lian Pian.

827
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,640
Listen to me.

828
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,880
What's there to explain?

829
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,960
It's your business to decide who to marry.

830
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't care.

831
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,960
You really don't care?

832
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,480
Why should I care?

833
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,240
Just because...

834
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Just because...

835
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,200
Just because of our relationship.

836
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,880
Lian Pian.

837
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
Mr. Yan, that's what you said.

838
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,640
What's the relationship between us?

839
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,480
You insist on saying

840
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,040
it's because of the family.

841
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
It's your business.

842
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,160
It's not my turn to ask.

843
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,240
Are you mad at me?

844
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,880
Why should I be mad?

845
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,840
I'm not.

846
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,000
I don't have an attitude.

847
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,120
This marriage

848
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,840
is arranged by the family.

849
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,320
I don't agree.

850
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,040
What are you going to do?

851
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,080
Take it off first.

852
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,280
Take it off for a day.

853
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,960
Take it off?

854
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,160
That's your attitude.

855
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,560
You're so good at

856
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,480
turning things around.

857
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,520
It's really good to

858
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,640
talk about him.

859
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,960
I didn't mean that.

860
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,520
Lian Pian.

861
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,760
Go away.

862
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Lian Pian.

863
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll talk to my mother when I get back.

864
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,320
Young Master.

865
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Young Master.

866
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Young Master.

867
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
Young Mistress.

868
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Deputy Chief.

869
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,240
Young Mistress, why are you here?

870
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,760
Did you run into a wall?

871
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Deputy Chief.

872
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,120
How much did you hear?

873
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,320
From the time you explained.

874
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,880
I didn't hear it.

875
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,280
I heard everything.

876
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Young Master.

877
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,760
Lord Qingxuan wants to see you.

878
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,280
I'll go with you.

879
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,920
Let's go.

880
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Young Mistress.

881
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,240
Since you're here,

882
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,160
why don't you say something?

883
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,920
I'm afraid I'll disturb you.

884
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Forget it.

885
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
Let's go back.

886
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
It's really weird.

887
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
Yes.

888
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
It's really weird.

889
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
Yes.

890
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
It's really weird.

891
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
Li Xiang is right.

892
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
I've seen it before.

893
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Song Jiayin.

894
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,760
What's going on?

895
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Su said she's not feeling well.

896
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,280
We can't stay long.

897
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
We'll leave.

898
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,560
What's wrong with her?

899
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,440
Is she okay?

900
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,600
She's fine.

901
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Don't worry.

902
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,440
You're really

903
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,760
a weird person.

904
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,520
You were upset just now.

905
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,840
You're so happy

906
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
when you hear that Su is not feeling well.

907
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,040
Su said she's not feeling well.

908
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
But in fact,

909
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,440
she's not in a good mood

910
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,800
because Yan Siye

911
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,320
rejected the engagement.

912
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,680
What?

913
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,120
We both went to the garden

914
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,040
and missed the wonderful part.

915
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,600
Yan Siye

916
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,280
didn't say that,

917
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,480
but that's what she meant.

918
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,520
I was worried

919
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,200
that she would seduce Yan Siye

920
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,120
and make him a concubine.

921
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,560
But now,

922
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,440
she doesn't even have a chance to come in.

923
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,840
How can I be unhappy?

924
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
I'm leaving.

925
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Miss,

926
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,040
what are you thinking?

927
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,120
I know.

928
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,720
I like Yan Siye.

929
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
You finally understand.

930
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
But,

931
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,120
what do you think Yan Siye will think?

932
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,320
He's a man

933
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,520
who is hard to guess

934
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,120
and has a bad heart.

935
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
He's a man

936
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
who is hard to guess

937
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
and has a bad heart.

938
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,920
He's a man who is hard to guess

939
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
and always tries to

940
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,120
go against me.

941
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Well,

942
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
in other words,

943
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,520
he always helps me

944
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,120
and always thinks for me.

945
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,520
And

946
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
he knows what I want.

947
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,520
Miss, you said that

948
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Yan Siye

949
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,920
must be interested in you.

950
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,320
That's not right.

951
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,920
He always emphasizes that

952
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,120
he's so nice to me

953
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,920
for my brother.

954
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,720
That's also possible.

955
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
After all, Siye and Young Master

956
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,320
are not close.

957
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,720
They...

958
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,120
Lin Pian,

959
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,720
which side are you on?

960
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,520
I...

961
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
You said that yourself.

962
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Besides,

963
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,920
it's none of my business.

964
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,120
It's between you two.

965
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Yes.

966
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,720
You're right.

967
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,320
It's also a matter of life and death.

968
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,920
I'll go to Guo Zijian tomorrow

969
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,320
to ask him.

970
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Okay.
