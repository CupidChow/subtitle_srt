1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The sound of the zither is like water, the shadow is like a cat

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Whose smell is it?

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The rain falls, the waves are strong, the water is clear

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The rain is strong, the wind is not strong, the city is lively

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The spring is coming, the flowers are blooming

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The spring is coming, the flowers are blooming

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 16

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then tell me, what happened recently?

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Nothing, maybe I'm just too tired.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Who is it?

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it the Fourth Master?

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Fourth Master?

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hurry up!

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hurry up!

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hide!

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hide!

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Coming!

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Right now!

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Put on your clothes!

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yan Yan, what are you doing here?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Song Xiao Tian is hurting me.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm telling you, he's forcing a big blow.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He wants to get me out of the dark and he's trying to catch me.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's just pretending, maybe there's an assassin outside.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sang Qi, you have to save me!

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Save you?

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh no, they've already caught up.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know what to do.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Just follow me and escape!

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hide!

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hide!

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hurry up!

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come in.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Not bad.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Fourth Master,

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
what brings you here so late at night?

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm on a field patrol and I heard something from you.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I came to check.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you alright?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm fine.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you, Fourth Master.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sang Qi,

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm a bit thirsty.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll have some tea.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're drinking tea?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Do you like living here?

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have Fourth Master to take care of me.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I feel comfortable living here.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I like it.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's really nice.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's late.

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Who is it?

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who is it?

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's me, Lan Ji.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Isn't she going down the mountain?

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I suddenly want to talk to Qi.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can I come in?

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Fourth Master,

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
why don't you hide first?

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hide?

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's so late.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll sleep.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll sleep.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll sleep.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What are you hiding from?

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's so late.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's so easy to sleep.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If she misunderstands,

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
it's better to hide.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's fine.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can talk to her.

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hide.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right away!

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why should I hide?

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Where should I hide?

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
One, two, three.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll hit you.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Why are you here?

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I...

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Lan Ji.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Sorry to bother you.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Lan Ji, what do you want to say?

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go to the tea garden.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Watch the view at night?

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The tea garden at night is better.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's comfortable.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go inside and talk.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're so thoughtful.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Your room

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
must be carefully decorated.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
All the students are like this.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Fourth Master, thank you.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What's wrong, Qi?

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you feeling unwell?

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I just finished my martial arts.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I feel so refreshed now.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Lan Ji,

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
what do you want to say to me?

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's about

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
the thing you asked me before.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I want to talk to you.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Lan Ji,

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
we can talk about it another day.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Qi,

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I came here today

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to make it clear.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Only you and I are comfortable here.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's the best place.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You told me before

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
your feelings for Yun Zhi.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I was not feeling well that day.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I couldn't talk to you clearly.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But later,

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I thought about it.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
you don't really like him.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Maybe

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
you just transferred

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
your feelings and trust

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to him.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's just a love story.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Qi,

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
since we are honest with each other,

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I want to make it clear to you.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't want you to be hurt.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I know Yun Zhi.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He values friendship the most.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You are Sang Yu's sister.

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He takes care of you.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He did it to fulfill his old friend's request.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Maybe

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
he just treats you as his sister.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you tell him about it,

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
it might be awkward.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Just like Song Jiayin.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But you are different from Song Jiayin.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
After all,

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you will still

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
study in the Imperial College.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If you are like this,

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
you will only add to our troubles.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Qi,

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have a piece of advice for you.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't think too much.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Put your heart

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
on someone who has no result.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mr. Yan.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Miss Su.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why are you here?

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I...

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Not only me,

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but also...

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Mr. Zhuo.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Zhuo Wenyuan is here too.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What a coincidence.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Zhuo Wenyuan, come out.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mr. Zhuo.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's so lively.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's so lively.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Miss Lan.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You three...

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You three...

174
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You three...

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You three...

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You three...

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You three...

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You three...

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You three...

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You three...

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You three...

182
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Drink.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You three...

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Drink.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let's drink.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's drink.

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I was too impolite.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I disturbed your mood.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No.

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then,

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll leave now.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll see you out.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Deputy Chief.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Deputy Chief.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You two

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
are so rude.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go back.

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Deputy Chief,

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
why don't you go with us?

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
After you leave the mountain,

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I have something to tell you.

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Rest early.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Qi.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Are you really

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
interested in Deputy Chief?

206
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How is that possible?

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Lan Ji must have misunderstood me.

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Deputy Chief.

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Go back to your work.

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Deputy Chief,

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
aren't you going with us today?

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I have something

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
to discuss with the tea farmers.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Deputy Chief is a bit unusual today.

215
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Isn't he like this every day?

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's normal.

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll go with you.

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Young Master.

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Have you found anything?

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
According to your instructions,

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I found that there is a very different seed

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
in the tea garden of the Song family.

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's very hard to guard it.

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's time to guard it.

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let Ye Sanlong lead the people up.

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Go.

228
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Go.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is the photo of the tea garden of the Song family

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
that I took a look at the mountain these days.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's a collection of white stone.

232
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I marked a few suspicious places on it.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tomorrow morning,

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'll attack the tea garden of the Song family

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
in the name of arresting the fugitive.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's better to search the tea garden.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't worry.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll go with you.

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll go with you.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll go with you.

242
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll go with you.

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll go with you.

244
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll go with you.

245
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'll go with you.

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll go with you.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll go with you.

248
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't worry.

249
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I've sent people to guard the tea garden of the Song family.

250
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I promise

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that I won't fly out of the tea garden.

252
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's warm.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's so late.

254
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why don't you go to bed?

255
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm fine.

256
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll cover you with a blanket.

257
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Go to bed.

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Go to bed early.

259
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Three Banner

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Sanqi.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Sanqi.

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What are you doing?

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Something happened to the tea garden of the Song family.

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hurry up.

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hurry up.

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Seal the evidence.

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes.

268
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Don't move.

269
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why did you burn the tea garden of the Song family?

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Why?

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What's the matter with the silk and silk silk

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,180
and the pearl of the forbidden

273
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,000
to plant in the Western Zhao?

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Go back and tell my father

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
that we're waiting for the official to punish us.

276
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's impossible.

277
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Someone must have framed the Song family.

278
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You acted recklessly

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and didn't help my father.

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Mr. Song.

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Now the evidence is clear.

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I advise you not to make trouble again.

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Otherwise,

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
don't blame me for being insincere.

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Sir.

286
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This matter

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
is indeed unrelated to Mr. Song.

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The pieces of the pearl

289
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
that you copied

290
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
were all made by Mr. Wei.

291
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We don't know

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
what's going on inside.

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're just saying it

294
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
to help you get rid of the crime.

295
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I dare not.

296
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
There are some documents and documents.

297
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Everything is in the account book.

298
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I can show it to you.

299
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's okay.

300
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,160
The

301
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll figure it out

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
when I get back to the capital.

303
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Put the evidence in the carriage

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and send it to the capital.

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Wei Zhan Hong.

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Don't worry.

307
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll beg my father

308
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
to help the Wei family.

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mr. Song.

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You must help my father.

311
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why did the farm end so suddenly?

312
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's too sudden.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Mr. Xu Chi thinks

314
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
this place is too dusty

315
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and it's not easy to stay here for long.

316
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The government will search the mountain later.

317
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's inconvenient for us

318
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
to stay here.

319
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Why didn't you come with us?

320
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I saw you

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
went out with Mr. Yan.

322
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Did you come here

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
to investigate the case?

324
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Wu Nong is just a liar.

325
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's hard to say.

326
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He's always thoughtful.

327
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can't figure out

328
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
what he thinks.

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Mr. Song

330
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
must have something to do with this case.

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I didn't expect

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
he would leave Mr. Wei

333
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to be the shield.

334
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The government is not willing

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
to investigate this case.

336
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We just want to solve the case.

337
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There's something strange about this.

338
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The low-level government

339
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
is old-fashioned.

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's not a temporary thing.

341
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Maybe Mr. Song

342
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
has already set up

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
the backer of this abandoned mansion.

344
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Or Mr. Wei

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
is not willing to help.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He's not willing to help.

347
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He's not willing to help.

348
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's not willing to help.

349
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's not willing to help.

350
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Or Mr. Wei

351
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
has something wrong with him.

352
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There's someone else behind it.

353
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Qi Lang,

354
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
what do you mean?

355
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Can you arrange

356
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
for me to meet Mr. Wei alone?

357
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Mr. Wei is in the prison now.

358
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's not a temporary thing to see him.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
How about this?

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I have a private relationship

361
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
with a prison guard in the prison.

362
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll arrange for you to meet

363
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
when he's in the office.

364
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You know how to arrange.

365
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Thank you, Mr. Song.

366
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I have something else to do.

367
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll leave now.

368
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Thank you, Qi Lang.

369
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Qi Lang

370
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Deputy Chief.

371
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You're here.

372
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Deputy Chief asked me

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
for the case of the Chayuan.

374
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I saw Mr. Yan.

375
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Cang Qi,

376
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I've called you here

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
from afar.

378
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Do you think I'm talking to you about a case?

379
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's...

380
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I've been working hard lately.

381
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I haven't dropped my homework.

382
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Don't worry, Deputy Chief.

383
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You can just

384
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
stay in the Imperial College.

385
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Why bother to come here?

386
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Madam,

387
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I think

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
it's about my brother.

389
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No.

390
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It must be Master

391
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
who caused trouble

392
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and asked us to go back to Linwu Peak.

393
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Cang Qi,

394
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
we're the only two of us

395
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
except Gu Zi Jian,

396
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
except Yu Xiong,

397
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Tan An,

398
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and Lian Wu.

399
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is there nothing else

400
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
to say?

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We...

402
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Nothing else...

403
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The weather is so nice today.

404
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's so beautiful.

405
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

406
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There are good weather,

407
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
beautiful scenery

408
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and family.

409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Family?

410
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You want

411
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
to treat me

412
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
as your family?

413
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You want to see me as your sister?

414
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's just like what Lan Ji said.

415
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You always see me as your sister.

416
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Qi.

417
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I think...

418
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What do you think?

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I think you've already

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
understood my feelings.

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Right?

422
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't want to guess anymore.

423
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I want you to tell me clearly

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and clearly.

425
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Do you understand now?

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Cang Qi,

427
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I like you.

428
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It was so sudden just now.

429
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I didn't feel it.

430
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
How about

431
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
doing it again?

432
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

461
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Siye,

469
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
did you plan it in advance?

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
After checking the case,

471
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
you'll show me your true intention, right?

472
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Walk and take your way.

473
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't need to.

474
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I know you'll help me look at the road.

475
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
All I want to do is look at you.

476
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,240
When did you fall in love with me?

477
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,320
Is it important?

478
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,080
Yes, I want to know.

479
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,880
I can't remember.

480
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,760
You can't remember?

481
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,040
I think you obviously forgot.

482
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,720
What about you?

483
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,960
When did you fall in love with me?

484
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,600
Do you remember?

485
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,800
Of course I remember.

486
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,600
When?

487
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,720
I'll tell you.

488
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,280
From now on,

489
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,560
only you and I

490
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,840
call me Yun Zhi.

491
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,560
Yun Zhi?

492
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,680
No, it's too awkward.

493
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,480
I'll call you Deputy Chief from now on.

494
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,480
Call me whatever you want.

495
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,040
Deputy Chief,

496
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,920
do you have any plans in the future?

497
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,640
I'll get engaged with you.

498
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,200
After you graduate,

499
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,280
I'll marry you and marry you into the mansion.

500
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,400
Deputy Chief,

501
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,440
can you not tell everyone about us first?

502
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,760
Let's talk about it after graduation, okay?

503
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,720
Do you have any concerns

504
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,440
or are you afraid of their rumors?

505
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,080
I want to use my own ability to get over the Imperial College.

506
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,040
Just promise me.

507
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,320
Okay.

508
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,600
From now on,

509
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,120
I'll do whatever you say.

510
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
Let's go to the school.

511
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Slow down.

512
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,840
The spring breeze blows through the world.

513
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:51,720
The essasary bubbles bloom left by the six

514
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,360
Endless love view

515
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,200
How could you let the date

516
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,880
But I dare not take it

517
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,160
She left a deep impression on me.

518
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,920
The sound of the zither and the sound of the flute are so beautiful.

519
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,760
Deputy Chief!

520
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,120
Who is singing?

521
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,840
You two came so early.

522
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,440
We ran into each other.

523
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,440
It's early in the morning.

524
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,160
You two are here.

525
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,200
Practicing martial arts?

526
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,480
Who doesn't know

527
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,200
will think you're having a secret meeting.

528
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,760
Come on.

529
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,520
What are you talking about?

530
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,200
Do you want to join us?

531
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,440
I'm not joining.

532
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,360
You guys practice.

533
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,240
Take your time.

534
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
Even Yan Yan can see it.

535
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,120
Don't worry.

536
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,360
I have a way.

537
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,440
You go in first.

538
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,680
I'm leaving.

539
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,520
Okay.

540
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,720
Go ahead.

541
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,560
I'm leaving first.

542
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,280
Go ahead.

543
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,720
Deputy Chief.

544
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,320
Deputy Chief,

545
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,280
how all different is it going at once.

546
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:52,880
Ye Lin's

547
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,920
Walk in a bad way.

548
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,880
Run three laps.

549
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,560
Bad way?

550
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Yan Yanzhi,

551
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,920
are you afraid that others won't see you?

552
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,600
I have no choice.

553
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,480
I'm just pretending to be you and me.

554
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,600
That should be a normal reason.

555
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,760
You always have the guts

556
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
to do such a little thing.

557
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
What will others think if they see you?

558
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
Wait a minute.

559
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,720
But if I don't do that,

560
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,240
how many chances will I have

561
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,840
to say something to you and me?

562
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,640
You can't scold me.

563
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,040
Don't be so shy.

564
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,240
All right, Qi, I know.

565
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,160
I won't make any more decisions.

566
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,640
I'll do as you say.

567
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,720
Don't be angry.

568
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,440
Don't be unhappy.

569
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,160
Look.

570
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,040
You're blushing.

571
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,920
It's not good.

572
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Siye.

573
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,480
You hit me.

574
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,080
You know you're wrong.

575
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,080
I...

576
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,160
I'll be mad at you for sure.

577
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Siye.

578
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,800
You should be

579
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,000
polite to your students.

580
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,600
Be nice to them.

581
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,040
Don't be too hasty.

582
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Sang Qi.

583
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,480
I heard that you've been more naughty lately.

584
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,960
You need to be more reserved.

585
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Siye.

586
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,800
You're just being impatient.

587
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,080
Right?

588
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,320
Don't hate him.

589
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,280
You've been together for a long time.

590
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,440
You're always in a rush.

591
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Right?

592
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
It's good that you're open to him.

593
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
You're not single, right?

594
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Siye.

595
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,760
You should talk to him.

596
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,560
Don't hit him again.

597
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,280
You're so stubborn.

598
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,480
How dare you hit me?

599
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,960
You hit me with your bare hands.

600
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,000
I was acting in front of him.

601
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,200
I didn't do anything.

602
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,000
I really didn't.

603
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,360
You're not even pretending.

604
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Qi.

605
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,560
It's good that we don't

606
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,280
care about each other.

607
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,400
You think I'm lying?

608
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,680
It's really inconvenient during the day.

609
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,360
Why don't I wait for you

610
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,960
outside your house when it's night?

611
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,960
You mean

612
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'll be too excited

613
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,680
to come out at night?

614
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Okay.

615
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,200
It's settled then.

616
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,160
How should I inform you tonight?

617
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,520
We'll...

618
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,840
We'll use cat's call.

619
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,160
Do you know how to do that?

620
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Meow.

621
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
A hundred times.

622
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Qi.

623
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
I...

624
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,840
I didn't use my strength.

625
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,120
Let me see.

626
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Let me see.

627
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
Call me back.

628
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
I won't hide.

629
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,560
I know you can't bear it.

630
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I can't bear it either.

631
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,160
Miss.

632
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,760
It's cold at night. Don't blow on it.

633
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,760
Let me see.

634
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Remember to call me.

635
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Okay.

636
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,920
Wait.

637
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I need to apply some powder.

638
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,960
Is it okay?

639
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Perfect.

640
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Master.

641
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,000
Father.

642
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,080
What are you doing?

643
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
What are you doing?

644
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,320
You're scaring me.

645
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Go to sleep.

646
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,520
What are you doing here?

647
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
I...

648
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I'm looking for a cat.

649
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,600
I just went to bed.

650
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,400
I was woken up by a cat.

651
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,520
It'll delay my training tomorrow.

652
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,160
I'll go clean it up.

653
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,400
Father.

654
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,160
Father.

655
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,120
It's not necessary.

656
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,720
We don't need to be like animals.

657
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,280
Besides, you just practice.

658
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,120
It's not necessary.

659
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
Why not?

660
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,400
I've promised the old people

661
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,160
to learn boxing from me.

662
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,680
If I don't perform well tomorrow,

663
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,120
I'll be laughed at by the aunties.

664
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Father.

665
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,720
See?

666
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,520
You're strong now.

667
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,480
You're making fun of me.

668
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,040
Father.

669
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,840
Father.

670
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,600
Listen.

671
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
We need to discuss everything.

672
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:17,920
Okay?

673
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,400
I'll talk to it.

674
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,640
Can we talk?

675
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
Talk.

676
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,800
There's a wild cat outside.

677
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
Stop.

678
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,240
Did you hear that, cat?

679
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,240
My father is holding a big knife.

680
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,120
Cat.

681
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Be careful or I'll kill you.

682
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,920
Did you hear that, cat?

683
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
Go now, cat.

684
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Keep calling me.

685
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,440
What are you talking about?

686
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,440
How can a cat understand you?

687
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Let me do it.

688
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Stop.

689
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Stop.

690
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,440
There's no sound.

691
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Meow.

692
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,960
It's coming again.

693
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
It's coming again.

694
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
Stop.

695
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Call it.

696
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
The cat is killing the chicken.

697
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
I'll use this knife

698
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,960
to cut it.

699
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
Okay?

700
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
Don't worry.

701
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Be careful.

702
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Stop.

703
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
I'll cut it.

704
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
A little higher.

705
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Meow.

706
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
Meow.

707
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Meow.

708
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
You...

709
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
Go now.

710
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
My father is coming.

711
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
I'll do it.

712
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Did you see that?

713
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
I saw it.

714
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,960
The cat bit me.

715
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,960
I'll cut it.

716
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,960
I'll do it.

717
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Go now.

718
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
Go now.

719
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
I'll cut you with the knife.

720
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
Right.

721
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Go now.

722
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Go now.

723
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Go.

724
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
Go.

725
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Go.

726
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
You...

727
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Go now.

728
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Young Master,

729
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
you're in the hospital.

730
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,480
My voice is hoarse.

731
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Go.

732
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
I'll cut it.

733
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Go now, father.

734
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
You can sleep now.

735
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,480
Practice boxing tomorrow.

736
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Okay.

737
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Okay.

738
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Third Master.

739
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Qi Lang.

740
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
What's up?

741
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
The old man is going to change his clothes tonight.

742
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I can arrange for you to meet Mr. Wei.

743
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Okay.

744
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Come.

745
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Come.

746
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Come.

747
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Come.

748
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Come.

749
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Come.

750
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Come.

751
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Come.

752
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Come.

753
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Come.

754
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Come.

755
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Come.

756
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Come.

757
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Come.

758
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Come.

759
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Come.

760
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Come.

761
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Come.

762
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Come.

763
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Come.

764
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Come.

765
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Come.

766
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Come.

767
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Come.

768
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Come.

769
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Come.

770
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Come.

771
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Come.

772
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Come.

773
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Come.

774
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,520
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Wei.

775
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
It's the son of Yan Xiang.

776
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Mr. Wei.

777
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,520
Don't you have anything to tell me?

778
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,520
I'm willing to clear your name.

779
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,520
I've been through a lot.

780
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
I've failed Hua En.

781
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,520
I've also failed the trust of the Grand Tutor.

782
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Now I have nothing to say

783
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,520
about my own achievements.

784
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
Grand Tutor?

785
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
Mr. Wei.

786
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,040
What you're doing now is a death sentence.

787
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Aren't you afraid of death?

788
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I have nothing to tell you.

789
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Mr. Yan, you don't have to talk anymore.

790
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,040
Since it's like this, I'll take my leave.

791
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,040
The new news.

792
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Mr. Wei colluded with the Xizhao case.

793
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
He was interrogated.

794
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,040
You think you can escape from the case?

795
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,040
I'm not afraid of death.

796
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,040
I'm not afraid of death.

797
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
I'm not afraid of death.

798
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
I'm not afraid of death.

799
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,040
I'm not afraid of death.

800
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm not afraid of death.

801
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Is it really Mr. Wei's fault?

802
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
He's been labeled as a criminal.

803
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,560
He was seduced by the Xizhao case.

804
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,560
The court has served the court for many years.

805
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,560
He was exempt from death.

806
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
He was sentenced to exile.

807
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,560
What about Grand Tutor Song?

808
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
He was punished.

809
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Grand Tutor Song used people to investigate.

810
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
He was punished.

811
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
He's on the side.

812
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,560
No one in Bianjing knows he's a traitor.

813
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
It happened in his place.

814
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560
If it's not related to him, who would believe it?

815
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,080
The most unfortunate person is the tea farmer of Song's family.

816
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
He lost his job for no reason.

817
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
The tea garden was sealed.

818
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Isn't Deputy Chief good at solving cases?

819
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,080
Can't you help the Jinzhao family find out the truth?

820
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,080
Deputy Chief is a son of Yanxiang.

821
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
It's not convenient to interfere.

822
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Maybe he's hurt by the peace.

823
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,080
Don't talk nonsense.

824
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,080
Deputy Chief is not that kind of person.

825
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Sang Qi.

826
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
We know Deputy Chief is not that kind of person.

827
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm afraid he's under pressure from Yanxiang.

828
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,600
It's not easy to get involved in this.

829
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
Why are you so excited?

830
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,600
Am I excited?

831
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Yes.

832
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Very excited.

833
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,600
I just think it's strange.

834
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
I feel unfair for these tea farmers.

835
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
I understand.

836
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
Take me to Deputy Chief.

837
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120
He must have his reasons.

838
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Good point.

839
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Move.

840
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Deputy Chief.

841
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
Does it really have nothing to do with the tea farm?

842
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Let's talk about it later.

843
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
You're always arguing with me.

844
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
Why?

845
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Why don't you help the Jinzhao family find out the truth?

846
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
Why?

847
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,120
There's no doubt about this case.

848
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Do you want to be someone else?

849
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120
Forget it.

850
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,120
I don't want to argue with you.

851
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
Jinzhao decorroom

852
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Qi.

853
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,240
I'm sorry.

854
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,040
Can you tell me now?

855
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,480
I met Mr. Wei in the prison.

856
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,520
He is a person

857
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,440
who even put his life on the chair

858
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,760
and is very sincere.

859
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,840
I think

860
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,720
he must be a person who really loves life.

861
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,800
And colluding with Xi Zhao is a serious crime.

862
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,840
He can't escape death.

863
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,360
But he did nothing.

864
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,840
He didn't even defend himself.

865
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,080
He acted too abnormally.

866
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,280
Unless...

867
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,320
Unless

868
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,160
he knew he could die.

869
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,200
He must have reached a certain agreement with the person behind it.

870
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,640
As long as he is willing to give up,

871
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,160
he can escape death.

872
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,360
I see.

873
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,440
I think the person behind it won't just let it go.

874
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,440
Mr. Wei must have done something

875
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,840
on the way out.

876
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,480
I plan to follow him secretly

877
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,920
and get rid of the person behind it.

878
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,520
You want to follow him secretly?

879
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,280
And I'm still in the country.

880
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,360
It's inconvenient to know.

881
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,400
If I leave Bianjing rashly,

882
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,880
I will definitely raise suspicions.

883
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,520
So I need a reason

884
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,360
to leave Zijian.

885
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,840
I need you to play a role with me.

886
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,960
I understand.

887
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,440
Then why did you ask me to meet here?

888
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,120
I want to tell you the truth

889
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,160
about us.

890
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,120
Yuxiu.

891
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,360
I, Yan Yunzhi, will never

892
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,000
give up on mourning.

893
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,960
As long as I live,

894
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,680
I will protect the mourning.

895
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,400
Qi.

896
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,880
Are you sure no one knows us here?

897
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,240
I asked Lian Pian.

898
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,880
He said the young ladies in the mansion

899
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,320
won't come out here to hang out.

900
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,240
So don't worry.

901
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,880
No one will recognize us.

902
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,360
Then don't you need to pay attention to it?

903
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:06,880
Of course.

904
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,800
Just relax and be yourself.

905
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,160
Two bowls of noodles.

906
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,200
Are you satisfied?

907
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:26,880
Boss.

908
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,320
Wait.

909
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,680
Get some hot water and blanch the chopsticks.

910
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,680
Well.

911
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
There's no hot water.

912
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,360
Blanch the chopsticks?

913
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,840
Wait.

914
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,960
You don't need to be so particular.

915
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,200
I...

916
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,280
I'm starting to doubt

917
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,560
if I can eat this bowl of noodles.

918
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,560
Mr. Yan.

919
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,560
This is not a bar.

920
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,160
Don't be so particular.

921
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,600
Taste it first.

922
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,120
Okay?

923
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,440
It's done.

924
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Mitte 이제.

925
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,240
Eat.

926
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,280
Eat.

927
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,160
It's so good!

928
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,520
It's so delicious.

929
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,360
Is it delicious?

930
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,080
Yes.

931
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,520
Where are we going later?

932
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,920
How about

933
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,200
we walk and think?

934
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,280
Let's go.

935
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:11,960
Shopkeeper.

936
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,600
Wait a minute.

937
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,960
Oh, no.

938
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,920
Oh, no.

939
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,960
Don't tell me you don't have money.

940
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,680
I don't have money.

941
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,640
I usually go out to eat.

942
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,440
I don't need to bring money.

943
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,200
Just a few shops

944
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,560
can be robbed once a month.

945
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,960
No.

946
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,200
You're really a gentleman.

947
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:31,880
Have you done it?

948
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,640
I usually

949
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,680
just have to do it.

950
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,400
You're really a daughter-in-law of the Taiwei family.

951
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,600
What should I do now?

952
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,720
Meng Hua.

953
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:45,920
I have a way.

954
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,920
I have a friend.

955
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,320
I've met this before.

956
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Come on.

957
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,280
Guys.

958
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,160
It's ready.

959
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,880
It's delicious.

960
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,480
Shopkeeper.

961
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,920
Let me ask you something.

962
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Do you know me?

963
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,400
No.

964
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,680
Then do you know this one?

965
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:08,880
I don't know.

966
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,320
He doesn't know us.

967
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,880
He doesn't even know us.

968
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,640
Us?

969
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,920
He doesn't even know us.

970
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,720
Go.

971
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,480
I didn't give you money.

972
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,480
Stop.

973
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,880
Guys.

974
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,360
This is the love for you.

975
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,200
You will not leave my eyes.

976
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
But I'm dirty.

977
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,320
relationship

978
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,000
The guy I'm loving so much

979
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,440
It's been a while

980
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,600
How long have you been married ?

981
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,720
The city is full of rumors.

982
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,040
There's always a heart-throbbing experience.

983
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,360
Are you okay?

984
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,200
I don't think so.

985
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,520
What should I do

986
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,960
to get the noodle and the peach-flavored cake?

987
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,160
I'll ask them to pay the bill tomorrow.

988
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,640
When tomorrow comes,

989
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,800
there will be a big crowd of people

990
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,320
who will buy the noodle

991
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,680
instead of paying the bill.

992
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,840
They'll eat and drink it.

993
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,760
What are you doing, Yan Zhi?

994
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,760
Since we're brothers,

995
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,720
I should do something

996
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,120
that the judges wouldn't dare to think about

997
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,720
or do.

998
00:45:50,880 --> 00:46:04,400
bicycle

999
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,320
At the beginning of life

1000
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,000
Fermenting the cup, we met

1001
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,320
A thousand worries left an unknown reason

1002
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
If love is a persistence,

1003
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,600
which makes us love each other.

1004
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
I'm the one who has this vision.

1005
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,600
If ten years become nine years,

1006
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,600
it becomes my time.

1007
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,600
My time.

1008
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,600
I can never be unknown.

1009
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,600
I'm a perfect story.

1010
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,600
It's the way I feel when I'm in the wind.

1011
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
My heart is in the city of unknown.

1012
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
Changed the beginning.

1013
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,600
I'm the one who has this vision.

1014
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,600
I write down the words of the lucky.

1015
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,600
I also end this life of a broken city.

1016
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
In the future, from the short and short,

1017
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,600
it becomes a deep kiss.

1018
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
In the future, from the short and short,

1019
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,600
it becomes a deep kiss.

1020
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,600
A kiss.
