1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of the waves are like the sound of waves

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The sound of the flute is like the sound of water, the sound of waves

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Sound of Providence

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 16

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I forgot you were injured. Are you alright?

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Qi, if you don't let me go,

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I won't go.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
My brother's will is not yet complete.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not going to let you go.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not going to let you go.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My brother's will is not yet complete.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Besides, I didn't find out about the bath.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm asking you.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Get lost!

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let me get lost.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No, this... Let him get lost.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Then answer me.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't want you to go. I want you to stay.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Actually, I know what you're thinking.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What you're thinking is also what I'm thinking.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What you're thinking is also what I'm thinking.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wish you have also gotten out of the investigation under the law.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
However, at this stage,

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know that you're going to get caught直 out of the details and deal with it again.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Also, even with Qi's property,

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,600
If you don't mind,

35
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,360
I want to take back the wall of the mansion.

36
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
It seems that

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,200
Yan Siyue left Guo Zijian

38
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,400
has a deep impact on the students' academic career.

39
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,680
I just don't know when Yan Siyue will come back.

40
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
Is there any way?

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,400
Although I have a high reputation in the sword world,

42
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,640
they may not be willing to

43
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,120
leave me alone.

44
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,080
I won't teach them.

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,000
But if they want to,

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,640
I will tell the officer

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
about this.

48
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,320
I didn't expect that he is so healthy.

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,200
He must be happy if he knows it.

50
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,560
He is excited to sign.

51
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,880
Brother Zhuo, come here.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,680
I just...

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,800
Come here.

54
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,320
Brother Zhuo, sign it.

55
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,480
Here.

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,200
I still want to go.

57
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,720
Brother Zhuo, if you don't sign it,

58
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,000
we will be in trouble

59
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,240
if we are in Fengbo City.

60
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,240
Sign it.

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,800
Sign it.

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Just sign it.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,200
You have already signed it.

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Yes.

65
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,400
Come on.

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,120
Sign it.

67
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
It's coming.

68
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,200
It's exciting to think about the signature.

69
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,800
Yes.

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,520
What is the reason for the officer's invitation?

71
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,320
The students of Guo Zijian came to the sword world together

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,400
and called Yan Yunzhi to return to Guo Zijian.

73
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,480
What is your opinion, Grand Tutor Song?

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,920
Well...

75
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,400
Well...

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,920
It's not within the jurisdiction of the lower class.

77
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,040
It's the decision of the official.

78
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,840
It's the most popular speech

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
of Grand Tutor Song

80
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
when he drove Yan Yunzhi out of Guo Zijian.

81
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,720
I think education is a big thing.

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
It can't be done only by feelings.

83
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,520
It needs ten levels of speaking to get back to the bottom.

84
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,480
If Guo Zijian can't get more than

85
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,280
the previous year's number of students in the upper class,

86
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,480
it's useless for Yan Yunzhi to return.

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,760
Good.

88
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,880
Grand Tutor Song is right.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,800
Then we should test the exam this year

90
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
to see whether Yan Yunzhi is qualified

91
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,280
to be the private master of Guo Zijian.

92
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,680
Is there anyone who can do it?

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,280
I don't know.

94
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I told you.

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,080
The memorial was handed over for a while.

96
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Why hasn't the private master returned yet?

97
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
Maybe the official is too lazy

98
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,080
to return the memorial.

99
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,680
He's a child.

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,480
He will believe you.

101
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,480
Don't scare me.

102
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
Deputy Chief.

103
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,680
Deputy Chief.

104
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Deputy Chief is back.

105
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Deputy Chief is back.

106
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
Who cares about me?

107
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Deputy Chief.

108
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
Deputy Chief.

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
Deputy Chief.

110
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Deputy Chief.

111
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Deputy Chief.

112
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Deputy Chief.

113
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
Deputy Chief.

114
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Deputy Chief.

115
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
Deputy Chief.

116
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
You're finally back.

117
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,280
Deputy Chief.

118
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,280
Our hard days are over.

119
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Yes.

120
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,280
Yes.

121
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,480
It's different from what I imagined.

122
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,880
Deputy Chief.

123
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,280
Don't forget our brotherhood.

124
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I invited everyone to sign the memorial for you.

125
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Yes.

126
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Yes.

127
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,280
Everyone is very energetic.

128
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
It seems that

129
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,280
Dr. Feng has taught you well.

130
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
But now I'm back.

131
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
I must bring you a new aura.

132
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Let's go.

133
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Let's go to the hall to gather.

134
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
Let's go.

135
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
Let's go to the hall to gather.

136
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Let's go.

137
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Let's go.

138
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Let's go.

139
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
The official agreed

140
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,280
to let me stay in the Imperial College.

141
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Great.

142
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
Great.

143
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Great.

144
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Great.

145
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Great.

146
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
Great.

147
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Great.

148
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
But

149
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
the condition is

150
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
that the results of the Imperial College's exam this year

151
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
will exceed the net sales.

152
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
What about me?

153
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
It's okay.

154
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
You have your own way.

155
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280
You know how to teach your students.

156
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
It's not difficult.

157
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Why am I not

158
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
a child of the Heavens?

159
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
I just didn't use my martial arts

160
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
in my studies.

161
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Otherwise, you...

162
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,280
This is a big deal for the Imperial College.

163
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,280
We can't rely on the power of the Heavenly Class.

164
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280
I have discussed with Dr. Feng.

165
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
From now on,

166
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,280
the Heavenly Class and the Imperial Class will be in the same room.

167
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,280
The Earth Class and the Xuan Class will be in the same room.

168
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
We are all friends.

169
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
We need to support each other.

170
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
It's going to be a tough day.

171
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Help each other.

172
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I want to stay with the Heavenly Class.

173
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Help each other.

174
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Help each other.

175
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Help each other.

176
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Help each other.

177
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Help each other.

178
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
Help each other.

179
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Let me do it.

180
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Thank you, Dr. Feng.

181
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
Xing Cai,

182
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
you are the only one who can do it.

183
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Xing Cai, you copy.

184
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
How could you do it so shamelessly!

185
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,280
So well-mannered!

186
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
The very best!

187
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Why were they all born by your parents?

188
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
How could you do it so well!

189
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,040
Handsome.

190
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,560
How can you talk?

191
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,840
Xiao Er.

192
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,440
Zhou Wen Yuan.

193
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,720
This is the rush hour.

194
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Don't mind me.

195
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
I might be misled.

196
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,160
Since you came here,

197
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,160
I've decided to leave.

198
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,360
But

199
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,520
I'm willing to.

200
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,720
I owe you.

201
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,560
Sang Qi.

202
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,200
Deputy Chief.

203
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,280
There's something wrong with your composition.

204
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,080
Go to my study.

205
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,040
I'll think about it.

206
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,680
Okay.

207
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,720
Deputy Chief.

208
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,880
It's self-study time.

209
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,560
You have to wait

210
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,640
until I finish talking to Sang Qi.

211
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,240
Since Sang Qi has doubts,

212
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,360
I'll talk to him.

213
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,360
Deputy Chief.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,560
There's something wrong with my composition.

215
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,320
How about I go to your study with Sang Qi

216
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
and you talk to him?

217
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
Don't be so unconfident.

218
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,720
Your composition is good.

219
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,920
I've decided to

220
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,960
put it as the top class composition.

221
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,480
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

222
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,120
But I want to ask for your help.

223
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Otherwise,

224
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,480
the top class composition will be taken away.

225
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,320
No.

226
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,940
This way, please.

227
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,440
Chu Wen Yuan.

228
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,720
You have to be blogsarish.

229
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,780
Why don't you talk about your tätä

230
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,840
and I'll come back.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
I'll be back soon.

232
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,300
then we've support her so much.

233
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,280
�

234
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,380
It's done so quickly.

235
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,260
Nice.

236
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,900
I'm sorry.

237
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,540
Your behavior is smooth and clear.

238
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,260
You've taken the key points

239
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,260
into account.

240
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,060
Deputy Chief.

241
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,260
Can I get a place in the exam?

242
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,660
Qian.

243
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,500
The most important thing in the exam

244
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,500
is not the place.

245
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,580
This time, it's a test for me.

246
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,820
It's a test for you too.

247
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,460
Can a tough girl

248
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,540
study in public?

249
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:27,980
Be confident.

250
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,300
There are still some days

251
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,620
when it's not just you.

252
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,820
I hope the whole country

253
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,660
can take a step

254
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,180
in the field of knowledge.

255
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,660
By the way, Deputy Chief.

256
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,780
After the Jinzhou Wei family was killed,

257
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,660
you haven't told me

258
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,740
the progress of the case.

259
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,980
I haven't got the clue yet.

260
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,620
During this period,

261
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,500
you should do your job well.

262
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,660
We'll talk about other things later.

263
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,180
Yes.

264
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
I've been preparing for so long.

265
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,900
Just for this moment,

266
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,460
I can't fail.

267
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,620
So,

268
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,620
after the exam,

269
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,140
what do you want to do?

270
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,620
Eat and drink a lot.

271
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,260
Then,

272
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,020
tell everyone about us.

273
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,260
How can a girl

274
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,220
talk about this kind of thing?

275
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:15,940
Let me do it.

276
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,860
Actually, I've thought about it.

277
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,780
I'd better say it.

278
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,380
If you say it,

279
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
everyone will say

280
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,700
you took advantage of me

281
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,940
because of the job.

282
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,300
If I, Sang Qi,

283
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,380
say it loudly,

284
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,500
no one will be afraid of me.

285
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,980
I didn't expect you to think so carefully.

286
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,540
I'll follow your advice.

287
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:33,940
Yes.

288
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,700
I have to go up the mountain.

289
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,460
Go up the mountain?

290
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,140
Lin Wu Feng?

291
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,580
Yes.

292
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,580
I want to tell Master

293
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,140
that I'm not only his disciple,

294
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,980
but also his wife.

295
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,460
I want him to stop teasing me.

296
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,180
If he dares to tease you again,

297
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,780
I'll help you

298
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,780
to remove his beard.

299
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,380
Deputy Chief.

300
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,940
Time flies.

301
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,100
There's something else.

302
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,780
After the college entrance examination,

303
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,020
I'll marry you.

304
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,660
I'm telling you.

305
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:11,860
Qi.

306
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,580
If there's a problem in the school,

307
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,620
just call me.

308
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,780
Don't be nervous about other men.

309
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,220
Did you smell

310
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,660
who's eating dumplings?

311
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,060
It has a strong smell.

312
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,220
Promise me.

313
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,140
Okay.

314
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,860
One jin of beef,

315
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,940
one jin of pig's trotters,

316
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,740
and a pot of wine.

317
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:44,780
That's all.

318
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,620
Don't rush to serve.

319
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,100
Okay.

320
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,100
Qi Lang.

321
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:51,780
No.

322
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:52,980
Deputy Chief Yan.

323
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,420
Finally, I can call you Deputy Chief Yan again.

324
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
You came back to the Imperial College.

325
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,620
You must be tired from the long trip.

326
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,500
It's rare for you to invite guests.

327
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,700
I have to come.

328
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,820
How's the situation?

329
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,020
It's not a good thing.

330
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,420
The father of the Wei family

331
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,540
and the Xizhao family are very close.

332
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,820
I found out that

333
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,620
there's a pattern on Master Wei's shoulder.

334
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,700
He's the spy

335
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,940
that Xizhao has been

336
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,140
hiding from for years.

337
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,900
Although Wei Zhanhong is still alive,

338
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,820
he was the one who was

339
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,580
poisoned by the Sangqi sword.

340
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,900
He has nothing to do with it.

341
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,980
You want to poison me?

342
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,020
Will they be at peace

343
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,140
after I die?

344
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,260
No.

345
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,740
I guess

346
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,140
they're planning to frame the Wei family

347
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
to make Qi do the crime.

348
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,380
Then they'll wait for you to

349
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,980
protect them secretly.

350
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,700
Then they can kill the Wei family

351
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,980
and you.

352
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,420
If I'm as blind as Master Wei,

353
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,660
I can't prove my innocence,

354
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,820
I'm afraid that

355
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,660
I've been

356
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,340
deceived by them.

357
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,340
Now that there's a big storm,

358
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,980
the court is investigating it seriously.

359
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,420
Recently,

360
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,700
they won't take any action.

361
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,460
All in all,

362
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,020
we should be careful.

363
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,140
Since Xizhao has been investigated,

364
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,620
we should change our mind

365
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,420
and focus on the Song family.

366
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,140
They'll definitely show up.

367
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,220
Qi Lang,

368
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,340
you've changed.

369
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,940
You must have been

370
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,700
on the lookout.

371
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,700
You won't...

372
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,700
You won't be

373
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,140
bullied by me anymore.

374
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,140
Listen,

375
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,580
I look down on you.

376
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,540
You're a

377
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,460
single man forever.

378
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:32,980
I...

379
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,900
Don't be a bad girl.

380
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,700
Your Highness.

381
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:03,900
Young Master,

382
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,260
since the accident,

383
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,580
it's the first time

384
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,020
you asked for an 911一起来 anxious Ting dunk了

385
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,180
Did youIONG

386
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,660
blame the loss of sense of duty

387
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,060
and order them to come

388
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,140
to beg so much trouble.

389
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,700
onlight worship

390
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,060
If・

391
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,140
take a lucky spell.

392
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,180
Don't care about it.

393
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:21,220
If・

394
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:21,460
be prepared for that case.

395
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,460
Anyway, this time, it's not the end of the game.

396
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
At least, we still have Chou Mo in our hands.

397
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
But

398
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,900
you should be more low-key recently.

399
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,020
Yes.

400
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,060
Yan Yun Zhi returned to the Imperial College of the Imperial College of the Imperial Family.

401
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,540
He is very reliable.

402
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,620
He has both held his energy

403
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,700
and my energy.

404
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,300
I need a high ranking leader

405
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,260
so as not to fail my aunt's expectation of me.

406
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,540
With your talent,

407
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,940
you must be a great leader.

408
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,060
There is one thing

409
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,740
I need to tell you in advance.

410
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,700
We didn't move Yan Yun Zhi

411
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,380
or Sang Qi

412
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,420
because we didn't want to get out of the way.

413
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,060
But if he gets to our base again,

414
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,020
no matter what kind of son he is,

415
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,180
or the daughter of the Grand Commandant,

416
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,580
we will deal with him on the spot.

417
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,300
Even if the son comes out,

418
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,860
I'm afraid it's hard to talk to him.

419
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,220
I told you

420
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,820
Sang Qi is my top priority.

421
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,180
You can't touch him.

422
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,300
It's also a long-term task

423
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,220
to make sure our cooperation goes smoothly.

424
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,580
If it really happens,

425
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,660
maybe

426
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,420
you and I will be in a close relationship.

427
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,740
Are you really going to do this?

428
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,700
I'm not joking about Sang Qi.

429
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,860
This wine is not tasty.

430
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,340
I'm not drinking it.

431
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,740
Look.

432
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,700
New rules.

433
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,020
It's too strict.

434
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,380
How can they do this?

435
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,100
I've never seen this before.

436
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
What happened?

437
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,940
Excuse me. Let me see.

438
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,340
Rules.

439
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,780
Deputy Chief issued

440
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,660
the new rules of the Imperial College.

441
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
From today,

442
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,100
the learning time will be extended by two hours.

443
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,740
All classes have doctor's license.

444
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,660
The management is arranged by the exam every day.

445
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,420
In order to maintain good physical strength,

446
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,820
the class will be changed into a collective training.

447
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,300
All students are not allowed to wear toys

448
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,020
to influence their learning.

449
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,260
Those who violate the rules will be punished.

450
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,540
Those who ignore the rules will be punished.

451
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,420
Those who are mischievous will be punished.

452
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,780
Those who do the fake class will be punished.

453
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,140
The exam is a serious punishment.

454
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,260
It's okay.

455
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
What should we do?

456
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,860
I'm here.

457
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,540
I'm here.

458
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,740
Special times and special ways.

459
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,420
There are blessings in the history of love.

460
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,860
Pisces.

461
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,460
who hold back your sorrow,

462
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,260
who hold back your Max.

463
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,740
I'll eyelet in whatever arm quickly.

464
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,380
D White Night

465
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,020
Salty brothers

466
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,540
in Laughs

467
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,780
called most Innen I've never heard of.

468
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,780
I want to turn my face to a stirring pot.

469
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,620
Choose for yourself.

470
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,620
interacts very well with immerse.

471
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,860
Leave lyrics for yourself

472
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,860
I'm not a good singer.

473
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,860
I'm not a good singer.

474
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,860
I'm not a good singer.

475
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,860
I'm not a good singer.

476
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
I'm not a good singer.

477
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,860
I'm not a good singer.

478
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,860
I'm not a good singer.

479
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,860
I'm not a good singer.

480
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,860
I'm not a good singer.

481
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,860
I'm not a good singer.

482
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,860
I'm not a good singer.

483
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,860
I'm not a good singer.

484
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm not a good singer.

485
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
I'm not a good singer.

486
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
No matter how the wind blows,

487
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
I'm still a good singer.

488
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
Strengthen your body.

489
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,860
Keep in a good state.

490
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,860
The test is like a battlefield.

491
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
If you stick to it, you win.

492
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
You won't go to hell.

493
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Who's going to hell?

494
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,860
If it was like this,

495
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,860
you would be better off not coming back.

496
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,860
Why did I forget that I'm a woman?

497
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,140
I have a good reason to win the throne.

498
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,620
Deputy Chief.

499
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,420
Your Highness.

500
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,500
Strengthen your body.

501
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,460
Keep in good condition.

502
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,460
The exam is like a battlefield.

503
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,460
If you persist, you will win.

504
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,020
If you don't go to hell,

505
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,700
who will go to hell?

506
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,420
The exam...

507
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,420
The exam is like a battlefield.

508
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,220
If you persist, you will win.

509
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,820
If you don't go to hell,

510
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,780
who will go to hell?

511
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,660
I have been in the Imperial College for so long.

512
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,980
I have never seen him resting.

513
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,780
Is it beautiful?

514
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,100
Yes.

515
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,460
Do you like it?

516
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,100
Yes.

517
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,580
Sometimes it's annoying.

518
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,100
When did I get annoyed?

519
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,500
No.

520
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,700
It's annoying to look at it.

521
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,860
Why is it annoying?

522
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,540
This is for you.

523
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,460
The exam is coming.

524
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,700
I wish you all the best.

525
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,180
Should I thank you?

526
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,860
You just said it.

527
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,300
After the rush of time,

528
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
the results of the Sword Mountain Sect have been significantly improved.

529
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,140
The answers on the exam paper

530
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,220
are just as good as the standard.

531
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,780
Then you can do your job well.

532
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,740
No.

533
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,060
I have never treated education as a job.

534
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,860
Although the study results are up,

535
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,740
you still don't understand the true meaning of study.

536
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,500
What do you mean?

537
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,060
I and Dr. Zhong

538
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,220
work hard,

539
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,140
know the reason,

540
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,660
and serve the people.

541
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,380
It's not just about getting a job.

542
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,580
Indeed, if it's just about getting a job,

543
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,140
it's enough to get good grades.

544
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,780
But the court doesn't need such people.

545
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,100
What do we need to do?

546
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,380
Although the Sword Sects are all young,

547
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,300
they have a lot of revenge.

548
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,820
Of course I understand.

549
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,100
I also came from the Sword Sect

550
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,980
to work for the people.

551
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,980
But when I really got the job,

552
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,860
I found that it was just the beginning.

553
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
But I'm still here.

554
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,500
I hope

555
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,940
you can learn the knowledge and principles

556
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,220
that you've learned from the Sword Sect.

557
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,140
When you're lost,

558
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,820
I'll keep encouraging you.

559
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,460
Don't forget to keep going.

560
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,460
Thank you for your advice.

561
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,620
Recently,

562
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,700
the Sword Sects have been working hard to prepare for the exam.

563
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,580
We hope to have a good result in the exam.

564
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,620
The exam is also finished.

565
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,580
We've strengthened the supervision system.

566
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,940
We'll ensure the fair and justness of the exam.

567
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,460
I heard that Mr. Yan's words are a little confusing.

568
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,340
The exam of the Imperial College of Arts

569
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,620
is always held by men.

570
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,060
Now there's a Sang Qi.

571
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,620
Sang Qi can't get into the exam.

572
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,100
No matter how hard a woman tries,

573
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,260
will she

574
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,540
also

575
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,620
get a position?

576
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,940
My Sang Qi...

577
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,620
If a woman can get an official position,

578
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,020
it's a good thing.

579
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,700
It proves that her academic ability

580
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,660
is not inferior to

581
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,020
or even better than men.

582
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,700
I think if Sang Qi takes the exam,

583
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,940
it's also an encouragement to women all over the world.

584
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,780
Everyone should learn from it.

585
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,180
I agree.

586
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,740
My Sang Qi has worked hard for many days.

587
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,100
She didn't get a title,

588
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,180
but she still got into the exam.

589
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,540
This is also the result

590
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,500
of my wish to have a son.

591
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,300
I'm sorry.

592
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,140
Don't worry.

593
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,140
Just do as Mr. Yan said.

594
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,100
Sang Qi will take the exam.

595
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,420
Thank you, sir.

596
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,420
Thank you, sir.

597
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,300
Brother.

598
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,020
I'm going to the exam tomorrow.

599
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,860
I'll help you

600
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,220
fulfill your wish.

601
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,340
Bless me.

602
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,180
May everything go well.

603
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,140
Qi.

604
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,340
Lin Pian, where's Qi?

605
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,380
She's in Young Master's study

606
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,660
talking to him.

607
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,380
Well,

608
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,700
I'll leave her alone.

609
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,420
I've prepared a special treasure for her.

610
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,420
Please give it to her.

611
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,060
Tell her

612
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,740
I'll wait for her outside the park gate tomorrow.

613
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,700
She won't go to the exam alone.

614
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,100
Thank you.

615
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,300
Miss,

616
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,740
Mr. Zhuo sent it to me last night.

617
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,660
I think I should tell you.

618
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,460
Keep it.

619
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,380
I've got it.

620
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,380
I'm changing it.

621
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,300
Come on.

622
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,060
Jing.

623
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,780
If you don't want to write,

624
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,100
let's just write it down.

625
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,500
Walk out boldly.

626
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,340
Don't be stubborn.

627
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,580
Dad, what are you talking about?

628
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,340
Miss,

629
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,620
I've made you some food.

630
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,300
Give it to me.

631
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,620
You mustn't starve.

632
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,380
If you starve, you'll lose everything.

633
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,980
Open the door.

634
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,180
Let's go.

635
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,420
Come on.

636
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,140
Study hard.

637
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,020
Study hard.

638
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,580
You'll get a new name.

639
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,060
It's time.

640
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,940
Let's go in together.

641
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Don't be stubborn.

642
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,660
Let's go.

643
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,140
Master Sang.

644
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,660
Yanyan.

645
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,100
I didn't sleep all night.

646
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,540
I prepared this for you.

647
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,340
Look at them.

648
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,140
Thank you.

649
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,460
I'm not afraid of anything else.

650
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,020
With your kindness,

651
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,660
I'll win everything

652
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,940
and repay you.

653
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,300
I don't believe in your lies.

654
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,580
I just hope you and Miss can be safe and sound.

655
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,940
I never talk about

656
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,220
public and private matters.

657
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,500
Go.

658
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:22,860
Let's go.

659
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,580
Miss.

660
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,420
Let's go.

661
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,140
Come on.

662
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,180
What's wrong?

663
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,020
Shouldn't we say

664
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,540
we'll forget each other before we go in?

665
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,700
Peace and harmony.

666
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,820
Everything goes as planned.

667
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,460
Sang Qi.

668
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,980
Master Sang.

669
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,620
Yanyan.

670
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,020
Please enjoy these delicious dishes.

671
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,660
You're welcome.

672
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,620
What are you going to make?

673
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,140
Probably Classic Sit Kui.

674
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,900
But it's a bit Lunar New Year.

675
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,660
So I'll try it on my own with Ye Yanyan.

676
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:14,980
She's so good that

677
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,220
I can't live without her.

678
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,140
Continue eating.

679
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:31,380
Han

680
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,620
People expressed their humble wait

681
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,520
In thousands of the years they have lived

682
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:58,240
Members Мы�...,

683
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,000
Alright.

684
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Enough.

685
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,240
No matter how you swing,

686
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,600
they can't get out

687
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,080
even if you don't say anything.

688
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,440
Everyone knows the truth.

689
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,880
But I'm worried.

690
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,920
Alright.

691
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,600
Zhou Meng Yuan.

692
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,280
Sir.

693
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,080
Leave it to me.

694
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,800
Zhou Meng Yuan.

695
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,680
Although you're in the Imperial School,

696
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,080
in this school,

697
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,640
I think you're the best.

698
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,720
I'm kind to you.

699
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,800
How do you feel?

700
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,760
Dr. Wei.

701
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm doing well.

702
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,200
You can't be worried.

703
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,720
You can be proud in the future.

704
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,960
You're right.

705
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,480
You're so brave.

706
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,040
I feel relieved.

707
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,960
Let's go home first.

708
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,080
It seems that it's not good.

709
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,840
Sir.

710
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,560
Dr. Feng.

711
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,320
Dr. Bo.

712
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,040
You've worked hard.

713
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,120
How's the exam?

714
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,880
Dr. Wei.

715
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,640
I'm doing well.

716
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,720
Mr. Tong.

717
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,320
Just do your best.

718
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,920
Come on.

719
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,240
Let's go.

720
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Yanyan.

721
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,320
Yanyan.

722
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,160
How's the exam?

723
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,480
I think it's good.

724
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,640
I've put all the things

725
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,920
I've learned in my eyes.

726
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,680
That's good.

727
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,880
And I didn't leave anything behind.

728
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,600
How's the exam?

729
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,000
Just do it normally.

730
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,920
That's good.

731
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,920
Do it normally?

732
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,360
But...

733
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,880
Isn't that hopeless?

734
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,040
You...

735
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,280
Yanyan.

736
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,680
Don't talk nonsense.

737
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,840
It's not easy to do a normal exam like this.

738
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,240
How could I talk nonsense?

739
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,320
I don't know about others.

740
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,840
Except for him.

741
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,080
To be honest,

742
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,920
even if you do it very often,

743
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,080
you can't pass the exam.

744
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,480
Come on.

745
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,800
You two have been fighting since you entered the Imperial College.

746
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,840
It's almost the night of the festival.

747
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,720
You haven't finished your study yet.

748
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,440
When you all

749
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,960
get on the test,

750
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,200
you'll know

751
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,480
how precious

752
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,660
the

753
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,480
I guess

754
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,440
it should be soon.

755
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,840
Qi.

756
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,200
Deputy Chief.

757
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,880
Qi.

758
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,800
Why are you so low?

759
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Are you not feeling well?

760
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,920
I can never

761
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,160
break the perfect story.

762
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm a stubborn person.

763
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,640
My heart is in a small town.

764
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640
I've changed my start.

765
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,200
I've lost the person I love.

766
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,720
I've written the words of the new moon.

767
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,400
I've also finished the life in this world.

768
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,640
In the future, we'll be in love.

769
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,640
We'll be in love forever.

770
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,720
In the future, we'll be in love forever.

771
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,520
We'll be in love forever.
