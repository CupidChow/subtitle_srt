00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,600
Baishi,

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
did you bring the painting to Qingquan Jun?

5
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,400
Why hasn't he come yet?

6
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,400
I did tell Qingquan Jun,

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,000
but...

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,080
Time is flying

9
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,960
No one is worth anything

10
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,960
His Majesty assessments me

11
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,280
Being a grown man,

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,960
is there a tether to my position?

13
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,480
Yes

14
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,880
It has always been the young master

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,400
raise the child

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
If Yuanzhi found out

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,680
about this,

18
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,000
your whole family

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Are you Trance Oh, Don't, or else?

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,080
Sang Qi,

21
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,320
so much is law wound now.

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,260
You have no other options.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,120
The investigation is over.

24
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,160
It's obvious that Wei family is a puppet.

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
But there's no direct evidence

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,040
that it's the Song family.

27
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,560
It's obvious that

28
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,240
it's related to Xizhao.

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,480
But brother and Song family

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,960
have nothing to do with each other.

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,680
Brother.

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,480
It's like there's a hole here.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,320
The news is scattered.

34
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,920
There's no way to push it.

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,440
Or there's a part of the dead leaves

36
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,120
that didn't tell me about brother.

37
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,240
How dare you

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,680
call me the Song family?

39
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't care about the Song family.

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,600
Give me a place to eat and drink.

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,440
Yeah.

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,160
What's going on?

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,720
What's going on?

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
There's really no place.

45
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,920
Song Ruotian,

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,440
why are you so insolent?

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,720
What's going on?

48
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,920
I don't know what's going on.

49
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
Are you alone?

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,080
What?

51
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,160
May I ask for your help?

52
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,560
Song Ruotian,

53
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
although we both

54
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,400
are in the same field,

55
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,800
most of the time,

56
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,320
we are not in the same field.

57
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,120
You're willing to drink with me today.

58
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,160
You want to find someone

59
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,040
who's familiar with you, right?

60
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,880
I don't care.

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,160
Even if it's you, Sang Qi,

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,760
I'm fine with it.

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Then you can go out.

64
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
I just found out

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,680
that Wei Zhanhong's joke

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,960
is about to be revealed.

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Wei Zhanhong?

68
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
How is he doing now?

69
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,760
He's not doing well.

70
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,640
Before he left,

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,080
I gave some money to the officials

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,320
of the Wei family.

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
I told them to take care of Wei Zhanhong.

74
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
But I just got a message from the station.

75
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
They said they would arrive at the capital soon.

76
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,840
Does Grand Tutor know about this?

77
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,360
No.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,280
No?

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,480
My father didn't allow me

80
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
to mention the Wei family.

81
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,080
His relationship with the Wei family

82
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,960
is very clear.

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,520
So I have to come alone

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,400
and get rid of it.

85
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,440
Before this, I thought

86
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,720
Song Ruotian,

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,880
Wei Zhanhong is just a junior in your class.

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
But now it seems

89
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,200
you have some feelings for him.

90
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
It's a sight to behold.

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,040
However...

92
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,840
Just say it.

93
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,840
Wei Zhan Hong is not loyal to you.

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,080
But it's true that the Wei family is guilty.

95
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,360
With your trust in Wei Zhan Hong,

96
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,360
you can help Wei family.

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,360
I've been trying to break him up.

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,080
But we've known each other for years.

99
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,920
My father is strict.

100
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm a little stubborn.

101
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,200
So I can only ask Wei Zhan Hong to do some work for me.

102
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,000
Speaking of which,

103
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,880
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Get up!

105
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,200
Can't you say half of it?

106
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,240
You have to finish it.

107
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,360
What work?

108
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,760
I asked him to do it.

109
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,480
I played tricks on you.

110
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,960
But he messed it up.

111
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,000
You're so annoying.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,640
Let him go.

113
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
Please forgive me this time.

114
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,880
I forgive you.

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,040
But you have to tell me

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,800
which one is it, right?

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,680
It's the time when you were poisoned by Guo Zi Jian.

118
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,760
I asked Wei Zhan Hong to put the medicine in the food.

119
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,200
You insisted on cooking for Deputy Chief.

120
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,200
I put the medicine in the bowl.

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,280
What did you ask Wei Zhan Hong to do?

122
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,600
I asked him to do something.

123
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,320
What did you ask Wei Zhan Hong to do?

124
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,040
The medicine.

125
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,600
Look at this.

126
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,360
No.

127
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
I didn't eat the medicine.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
It's the poison powder from Xizhao.

129
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,440
It can kill people.

130
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
So,

131
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,400
Wei Zhan Hong

132
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,360
must have something to do with Xizhao.

133
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,160
Oh, no.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
We're being plotted.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,640
Wait.

136
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,560
We agreed that

137
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,720
we'll be good friends after drinking.

138
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,280
In the future,

139
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,680
I'll drink with you if I have a chance.

140
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,760
No.

141
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,600
No.

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
Sang Qi.

143
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,040
Come back.

144
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
I, Song Luo Tian,

145
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,840
don't have friends after all.

146
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,280
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,720
My Lady.

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
My Lady.

149
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,280
My Lady, why are you going to Jinzhou?

150
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,880
Qi.

151
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,760
Mr. Zhuo, you're just in time.

152
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,000
Help me convince my Lady.

153
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,440
Why are you going to Jinzhou?

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,680
Deputy Chief is hiding something from me.

155
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,760
I'm going to save him.

156
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,840
He's in trouble.

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,640
It's worth your life.

158
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,360
It's worth it.

159
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,680
My Lady.

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
Wait, I'll go with you.

161
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,440
Childe,

162
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,040
it's been a while since we came out of the camp.

163
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,320
Why haven't they arrived yet?

164
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
Did something happen on the way?

165
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,720
The enemy is a tough one.

166
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,560
It won't be that fast.

167
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Hurry up.

168
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,680
Do it.

169
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:21,760
Help!

170
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,080
Help!

171
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,280
Childe,

172
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,240
there's an enemy ahead.

173
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,240
Retreat!

174
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,240
Help!

175
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,160
Help!

176
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,160
Help!

177
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,480
Help!

178
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,480
Help!

179
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,360
Your Grace...

180
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,680
Go, quick.

181
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,720
Yu Jerk Kai,

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,560
you have tutor's цๆosion now!

183
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,440
For you,

184
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
Yanwnan Jue's

185
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,360
little sister has

186
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,560
the same strong medicine ceremony as Yuанные!

187
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,880
Duke Wei,

188
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,600
leave!

189
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,440
Run!

190
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,160
Are you okay?

191
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,880
Why are you here?

192
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm fine.

193
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,440
Zeyan.

194
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,440
Zeyan.

195
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,240
Zeyan.

196
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,620
Step back.

197
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,080
Master Yan,

198
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,480
We're here under Lord Yan's order.

199
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Don't worry about the past. Go after them!

200
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,640
Follow me!

201
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,200
Yes!

202
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,840
Master,

203
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
call a young master.

204
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,520
Brother,

205
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,440
go after Master Wei.

206
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,400
I'll go after Master Wei.

207
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,200
Be careful.

208
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,400
Qi.

209
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,280
Qi!

210
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,360
Young Master!

211
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,440
Sang Qi!

212
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,640
Go!

213
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,160
Go!

214
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,760
Go!

215
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,400
Go!

216
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,920
Go!

217
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,440
Go!

218
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,040
Go!

219
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,640
Go!

220
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,400
Go!

221
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,960
Go!

222
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,480
Go!

223
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,160
Go!

224
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,720
Go!

225
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,480
Go!

226
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Go!

227
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Go!

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Go!

229
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,200
Go!

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,600
Go!

231
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,200
Go!

232
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,000
Go!

233
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,520
Go!

234
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,120
Go!

235
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,360
Stop!

236
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,840
Go!

237
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
I'm late.

238
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,840
Sir,

239
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,880
please go after them.

240
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,960
I have to go back to the canal.

241
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,880
Yes!

242
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,520
Go!

243
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,720
Go!

244
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,320
Go!

245
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,840
Go!

246
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,480
Go!

247
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,400
Go!

248
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,920
Go!

249
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,520
Go!

250
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,800
One!

251
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,320
One!

252
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,920
One!

253
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:24,980
Go!

254
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,960
Go!

255
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,700
Go!

256
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,660
говорю

257
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,520
Young Master, are you feeling better?

258
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,800
Allある

259
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,640
How is it?

260
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,720
I'm late.

261
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Master Fei is dead.

262
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Baishi.

263
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,800
His injury is so serious.

264
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
We need to go back to the city to save him.

265
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,880
It's not a good idea to drag him out.

266
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,400
Let's go.

267
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,520
Qi, you go back first.

268
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,440
Don't worry about me.

269
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,960
The people from the medical department are attacking again.

270
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I want you to be safe.

271
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,080
Ning Yunche.

272
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,880
This is not the Imperial College.

273
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,080
I don't want to hear this from you.

274
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,520
Are we still waiting for Mr. Zhuo?

275
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,880
He should be fine.

276
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,040
Those people didn't go there for him.

277
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
They won't do it alone.

278
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,080
There are so many people waiting for him.

279
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,360
Let's go.

280
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,360
Be careful.

281
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,880
Come on.

282
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,440
Let's go.

283
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,640
I'll take you.

284
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,200
No.

285
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,200
I don't want to do it with you.

286
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,120
But...

287
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,000
You should have said it earlier.

288
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,280
Be careful with your wound.

289
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm afraid we can't bring Wei Zhanhong back.

290
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,520
Don't worry.

291
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,600
The plan has failed.

292
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,400
He has no reason to live.

293
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,640
According to our original plan,

294
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,400
after Yan Sanlang received the news

295
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,360
that the Wei family was arriving in Jingzhou,

296
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,720
Yan Yunzhi would surely follow them secretly.

297
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,960
I just didn't expect

298
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
that he would kill a funeral instrument halfway.

299
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
So far,

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,920
I have no idea

301
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,240
what Yan Yunzhi is up to.

302
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,280
So far,

303
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,560
I think we should forget about it.

304
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
I have already figured out

305
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,440
the possibility of the plan's failure.

306
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
I have ambushed people on the way back.

307
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
I will not let it go.

308
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,560
You can't hurt the funeral instrument.

309
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,360
I know that you have

310
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,920
already told me

311
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,560
that you will never hurt your little funeral instrument.

312
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,960
I won't hurt it again.

313
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,320
Yourmaybe is hurt.

314
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,860
How can you stens the strength as the strength stops?

315
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,860
I said that you should be here.

316
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,160
Why were you running back?

317
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,040
There are ghosts in the Wei family.

318
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,280
You must be in danger with them.

319
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,080
Do you know why they're not here?

320
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,720
You know she's not a ghost.

321
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Su Lotian told me

322
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
that she gave me the antidote.

323
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,280
After Wei Zahong's hand,

324
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,880
she changed to the poison powder of Xizhao.

325
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,640
It must be something serious.

326
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,080
%%

327
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,160
Sean.

328
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,720
Yeah.

329
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,280
Come on.

330
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,920
Come here.

331
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,280
Look at me.

332
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,880
It's really Xizhou's men.

333
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,600
They want to kill us.

334
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,720
They really don't know what to do.

335
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,800
He Qi.

336
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,040
Young Master.

337
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,920
How could this happen?

338
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,360
Young Master.

339
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,920
We only have one horse now.

340
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,280
It might be difficult to get back to the city together.

341
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,520
He Qi.

342
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,240
It's dangerous here. You should go back first.

343
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,680
We'll wait for you here after we get the doctor and horse.

344
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,680
I'll stay with you.

345
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,000
Baishi.

346
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,240
Please go to the village.

347
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,960
I...

348
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,920
Okay.

349
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
I'll leave it to you.

350
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,720
Be careful.

351
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,200
He Qi.

352
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
Don't look at me like that.

353
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm fine. I know what I'm doing.

354
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,280
You're badly injured.

355
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,760
Take a good rest. Don't talk.

356
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,600
I want to talk.

357
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,240
If you want to talk,

358
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,240
tell me

359
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,040
what's the connection between you and Xizhou.

360
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,040
Yuxiu.

361
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,120
To make you feel better,

362
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,760
I'll give you a massage.

363
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,720
To make you feel better,

364
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,000
I stole the best wine of my father.

365
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,880
Yuxiu.

366
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,720
What's wrong?

367
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,560
You look happy in the daytime.

368
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,080
What happened to the competition?

369
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,560
One thought is a mistake.

370
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,200
One thousand miles is a medicine.

371
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,360
One thought is a mistake. One thousand miles is a medicine.

372
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,920
What does it mean?

373
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,640
I've been thinking about it for a while.

374
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,680
Yuxiu died in front of me the next day.

375
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,320
According to what I said,

376
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,960
Yuxiu was ill and had a heart attack.

377
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,880
But Yuxiu told me

378
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,760
that he was getting better.

379
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,600
When I wanted to

380
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,480
find out the truth

381
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,280
and find clues,

382
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,120
I found that all the traces of Yuxiu

383
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,200
were cleared.

384
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,920
Could it be

385
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,720
because Yuxiu knew something

386
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,480
that was important to me?

387
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,720
What are you doing?

388
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
Who told you to burn Yuxiu's stuff?

389
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,800
We don't know.

390
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,520
A man who claimed to be a government official

391
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,600
told us to burn it.

392
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,120
He told us to clean up the mess.

393
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,800
Those who burned clothes

394
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,480
can't be investigated, right?

395
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,800
Yuxiu's case was soon over.

396
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,600
From Guo Zijin to Taiwei Prefecture,

397
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
I knew that

398
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
he died of illness.

399
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,760
I knew it clearly.

400
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,720
But I knew that

401
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,000
someone must have

402
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,600
killed him behind his back.

403
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,120
But he was a secret.

404
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,760
I was a student at that time.

405
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,920
I couldn't pursue him

406
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,080
and I couldn't fight him.

407
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,760
It's because of your persistence

408
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,160
that I didn't get away from death.

409
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,800
But

410
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
how did you find the clue

411
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,640
that Xizhao knew?

412
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,240
Since I knew Zijian,

413
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,600
I've been investigating.

414
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,080
I've been secretly noticing

415
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,960
the state of death

416
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
between Yan Sanlang and Yuxiu

417
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
using the information of the plant.

418
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,040
Just before you entered Zijian's study,

419
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,440
we found

420
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,880
a crime scene that looked very similar.

421
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,600
We found the powder of Xizhao there.

422
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,880
How could it be so coincidental?

423
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,080
Now the clue points to the Song family

424
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,440
and the Wei family.

425
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,680
Although they are in the dark,

426
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,840
I can assure you that

427
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,080
they are very powerful.

428
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,240
When I entered Zijian's study,

429
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,560
you made me suffer a lot.

430
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
Later, you arranged me to go to Lingwu Peak to pray.

431
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,960
Actually, it's all for...

432
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,800
Protect you.

433
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,760
It's all for protecting you.

434
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,560
Hmm.

435
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Who on earth are you?

436
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,680
I just hope

437
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,480
you can barrier yourself

438
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,000
after you get experienced.

439
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm afraid it'll finally end

440
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,960
as soon as you become like this.

441
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,260
Deputy Commander.

442
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,520
Deputy Commander.

443
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:31,800
Well,

444
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,640
Deputy Commander, are you alright?

445
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,880
Qi,

446
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,120
I suddenly

447
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,960
I want to...

448
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,880
I want to rest.

449
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,680
No, no.

450
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,880
You can't rest.

451
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,040
Ye Yunchi!

452
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,440
Look at me!

453
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,920
Open your eyes and look at me.

454
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,600
If that's the case,

455
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,480
how can we meet?

456
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,480
Are you really willing to let me live with this feeling?

457
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,240
When can we meet?

458
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,080
You know that.

459
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,840
Yes, sir!

460
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,520
Who says she know you last?

461
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,720
She just came to visit her.

462
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,120
much better than you.

463
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,280
Let her go.

464
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:25,760
All right.

465
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
Is it not you?

466
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,080
She seems like other woman.

467
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,040
Who is she?

468
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,720
Get out!

469
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,760
Come on.

470
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,120
This is my sword.

471
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,960
Okay.

472
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:06,760
Go.

473
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:30,640
Sir.

474
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,680
Mr. Yan.

475
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,320
How's the investigation going?

476
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,520
Sir.

477
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,800
Mr. Wei is dead.

478
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:36,960
The coroner found

479
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
a pattern of Xizhao on Mr. Wei's shoulder.

480
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,600
Wei Zhanhong is missing.

481
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,600
His life is still unknown.

482
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,400
The Wei family's charge is settled.

483
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
But the scene has been cleared.

484
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,640
I wonder

485
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
who the upper family is connected to.

486
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,400
Yan Yunzhi went to investigate the Wei family.

487
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,080
How is he now?

488
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,200
Mr. Yan.

489
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,680
He was seriously injured

490
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,160
to find out the truth.

491
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,240
Yan Yunzhi

492
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,960
Morning, Deputy Chief.

493
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,360
Morning.

494
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,400
Deputy Chief.

495
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,240
Deputy Chief.

496
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,080
Morning, Deputy Chief.

497
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,920
Morning.

498
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,600
Deputy Chief.

499
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,320
Mr. Yan.

500
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,480
Yunzhi.

501
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,600
You're here.

502
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,560
Why are you so serious about studying?

503
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,040
We're just doing our daily tasks.

504
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,720
We don't want to be

505
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,160
in a mess on the exam.

506
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,280
I brought some food for you.

507
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,240
Sir.

508
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,320
After you put it down, I'll get you some water.

509
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,800
Be careful.

510
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,960
Let's wash our hands before eating.

511
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,960
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

512
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,560
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

513
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,600
You're so popular now.

514
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,120
When you were writing the article,

515
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,720
why did you hang some shoes?

516
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,240
My father has been

517
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,920
missing you all.

518
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:01,640
Yan Yan.

519
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
I was going to ask you to go to Xiaozhuo

520
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,840
for a drink.

521
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,760
But Dr. Feng is so strict with you.

522
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,720
I think we should forget it.

523
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,280
No, no.

524
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,880
Xiaozhuo is a man of his word.

525
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,960
Let's go.

526
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,400
Dr. Feng asked you to study

527
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,320
for your own good.

528
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,440
You must learn to be a man of your word.

529
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,080
Understand?

530
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:19,920
Yes.

531
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,960
Yes.

532
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,640
Look.

533
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
The words of Mr. Guo Chengjun

534
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,320
are all written on the paper.

535
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
I don't need to read the article.

536
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,720
I know you've improved.

537
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,160
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

538
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,720
Water is coming.

539
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,320
Water is coming.

540
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,800
Let's take a break.

541
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,640
Let's eat something.

542
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:37,640
Let's go.

543
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,080
Let's go.

544
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,600
Come on.

545
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,240
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

546
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

547
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,720
Come on. Let's wash our hands.

548
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,360
Hurry up.

549
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,120
Let's fly.

550
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,000
What's this?

551
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,400
Let me see.

552
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,880
Hurry up.

553
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,520
So many.

554
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,080
Deputy Chief, this is a secret box.

555
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,520
Where is it?

556
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,080
Where is it?

557
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,640
It's in the hole.

558
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,520
There's a hole in the door.

559
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,720
It's so dark.

560
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,040
What's this?

561
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,000
Don't worry.

562
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,960
We'll play the game.

563
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,640
Look.

564
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,840
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

565
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,480
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

566
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,120
Come on.

567
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,720
I want this.

568
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,520
Here you are.

569
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,600
Qi.

570
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,880
I want to talk to you later.

571
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,120
There's more.

572
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,360
Here.

573
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,200
I ate one.

574
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,160
This is delicious.

575
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,880
Try it.

576
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,760
This is delicious.

577
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,280
Try it.

578
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,920
Try it.

579
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:26,960
Qi.

580
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,160
Master Sang.

581
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,960
Hello, Deputy Chief.

582
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,560
Qi.

583
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,840
Master Sang.

584
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,480
Why are you here alone?

585
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,440
What are you doing here?

586
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,600
What are you looking at?

587
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,800
You're robbing me.

588
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,040
Give it back to me.

589
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,920
Take a look.

590
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,680
What's so good about you that I don't understand?

591
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,400
What's wrong?

592
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,560
What's wrong?

593
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,400
Nothing.

594
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,720
You're bored by yourself.

595
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,360
Exactly.

596
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,160
I'm not bored.

597
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,120
You can go back.

598
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,560
Deputy Chief Yan.

599
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,520
Zhuo Yunyuan isn't in, is he?

600
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,200
No.

601
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,120
Mr. Zhuo isn't here.

602
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,400
Master, Mr. Yan is here.

603
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,520
Grand Commandant Sang.

604
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,120
I'm sorry for the sudden visit.

605
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,040
What's up?

606
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,600
I'm here to talk about

607
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,120
Sang Qi's study.

608
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,440
But I remember

609
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,520
you're no longer the Deputy Chief of the Imperial College.

610
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,400
You're at home now.

611
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,200
Grand Commandant is right.

612
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,480
I don't have any work to do now.

613
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,160
So I'm doing some private activities

614
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,800
for my uncle's family.

615
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,600
I think

616
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,480
Sang Qi needs support

617
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,920
at school.

618
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,840
Yang Yanzhi.

619
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
Just tell me what you want to say.

620
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,880
I'll tell you the truth.

621
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,400
I'm old enough to get married.

622
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,640
I've been in love with Sang Qi for a long time.

623
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,440
I hope Grand Commandant Sang

624
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,400
can consider me as

625
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,000
the future husband-to-be of Sang Qi.

626
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,840
Lin Ping.

627
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,120
What are you eating tonight?

628
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,720
Today, the third young master of the Li family

629
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
prepared a big plate.

630
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,600
I've asked the chef to make it.

631
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,240
You always send these to our house.

632
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,440
It seems that Grand Commandant's Mansion

633
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,680
is lacking this dish.

634
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
I can only say

635
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,440
that our Qi is very popular.

636
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,240
Now the young girls in Bianjing

637
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,680
don't know what they're thinking.

638
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,600
What four young masters and four beautiful ladies?

639
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,480
In my opinion,

640
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,720
they're far from me

641
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,920
as I was back then.

642
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,920
They all look like

643
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,800
a bad girl.

644
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,000
They even play the role of the peaches and the bees.

645
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,720
Grand Commandant.

646
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,960
Our young master is...

647
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,400
Look at my memory.

648
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,120
I forgot that you're still here.

649
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,600
I'm listening.

650
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,680
Shulan.

651
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,480
The two families of Yan Sang

652
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,320
are the two big families of Bianjing.

653
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
They're a family of two.

654
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,800
But everything has its own side.

655
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,360
If they get married,

656
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,960
I'm afraid they'll be in trouble.

657
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,680
I understand Grand Commandant Sang's intention.

658
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,120
But marriage is a big thing for life.

659
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,040
You should consider Sang Qi's feelings.

660
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,400
Yuan Ping.

661
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,840
Young Master Yan has been here for a long time.

662
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,240
Why can't you even bring a cup of tea?

663
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,160
How do I teach you?

664
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,000
Yes. Yes. Yes.

665
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,160
I'm going to get it.

666
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,920
No need.

667
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,240
I'll wait until Sang Qi has made up his mind.

668
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,360
I'll visit him in person at that time.

669
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,360
Thank you, Grand Commandant.

670
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,320
I'll leave now.

671
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,760
Okay.

672
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,280
What did he say?

673
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,520
He's really a man of his word.

674
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,920
I've heard that

675
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,080
he's a bad man.

676
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,080
Now he's put down his armor

677
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,720
and is laughing so hard.

678
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,920
It seems that it's not good.

679
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,200
Qi will be taken away by him sooner or later.

680
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,120
Master.

681
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,080
You just drove him away.

682
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,120
What do you know?

683
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,160
He'll come sooner or later.

684
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:06,960
Father.

685
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,240
Master.

686
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,920
You're just in time.

687
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,120
Look at this.

688
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,040
I heard that Chen Liu has a position.

689
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,440
He's free and needs someone.

690
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,720
So I recommended your name to the Ministry of Personnel.

691
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,400
Chen Liu?

692
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,200
Although the place is small,

693
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,760
it's close to Bianjing.

694
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,720
It's a job.

695
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,280
Think it over and you'll get the job.

696
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,200
If you keep being so reckless,

697
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,040
you won't even be able to get a wife.

698
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,920
I'll marry a fairy too.

699
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,040
Go get her.

700
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,880
Is life so Graphic porphyr ports?

701
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,520
Steve Ye has really left?

702
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,480
Left?

703
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,240
To where?

704
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,960
N small chat Reports from Ministry of Power

705
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,200
said he's gonna serve their train in Chen Liu.

706
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,240
He'll be leaving for the office in a few days.

707
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,040
Our fate is so close.

708
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,840
I have a good idea.

709
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,520
What idea?

710
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,520
Wait for the test.

711
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,720
Don't be too concerned.

712
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
Just deal with it.

713
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,600
You mean

714
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,880
Dr. Feng will feel that Dr. Feng is not here.

715
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,040
We are all out of our mind.

716
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,960
Sang knows me well.

717
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,120
Dr. Feng will be angry

718
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,200
and tell the officials.

719
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,600
The rest

720
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,640
will be settled.

721
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,040
Yes.

722
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,760
Yes.

723
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,480
Yes.

724
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,360
Brother Zhuo,

725
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
especially you,

726
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,480
don't always be a stubborn person.

727
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,400
We need to

728
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,640
work together to solve this.

729
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,400
Am I right?

730
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,640
Yes. Yes.

731
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,080
I don't know what you are worrying about.

732
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,160
The Imperial College is not as good as

733
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,520
Yan Yun Zhi.

734
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,440
You don't want Yan Si to come back?

735
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,520
I come to study.

736
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,320
I don't come to follow him.

737
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,200
You are still too young.

738
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,240
What's wrong with him?

739
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,600
He is really young.

740
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,240
Yes.

741
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,040
What does he mean?

742
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,240
Stop writing.

743
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,040
Ruo Boyuan.

744
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,000
Ruo Boyuan...

745
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,440
Put these here.

746
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,320
Go to the 不血 regardless.

747
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,960
Go back quickly.

748
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,320
Wait for good news.

749
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,160
Okay.

750
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,880
Let's go.

751
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,680
A'Qian,

752
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,920
do you want to go back so easily?

753
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,880
Not only me,

754
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,680
all the swordsmen want to go back.

755
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,480
In fact, they are

756
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,800
very afraid of Deputy Chief.

757
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,160
But in their heart,

758
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,280
they all agree

759
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
with his teaching philosophy.

760
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,160
They think Dr. Feng

761
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,800
is too old-fashioned.

762
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,880
I'm asking you,

763
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,160
not others.

764
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:43,880
Forget it.

765
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm in a bad mood today.

766
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,080
Go to the Qingfang Restaurant with me to have a drink.

767
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,800
But I have something to do today.

768
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,600
You go by yourself.

769
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,400
Now the old man who killed my brother

770
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,800
is in the same place as me.

771
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,040
Now the murderer who killed my brother

772
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,960
is in danger.

773
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,120
The danger is close.

774
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,720
Is Deputy Chief going to Chenliubin?

775
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
Someone has come.

776
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
It's really a good thing.

777
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,760
We meet again after a long distance.

778
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,240
You are so sneaky.

779
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,280
Aren't you afraid that I'll be shot and fly out?

780
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,360
Don't forget that

781
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,600
I'm your senior in martial arts.

782
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:45,960
Besides,

783
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,160
you can't win.

784
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,720
You are going to Chenliubin.

785
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,440
Why can't I win?

786
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,440
You already know it?

787
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,960
Of course I know it.

788
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,600
I know it from others' mouth.

789
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,280
I was still against it a few days ago.

790
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,160
Now such an important plan

791
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,920
doesn't know how to tell me.

792
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,360
I'm still a stranger.

793
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,400
Qi,

794
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,920
I only went to Chenliubin

795
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,440
to guard that official post.

796
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,040
I have the courage

797
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,280
to go to your mansion

798
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,880
and propose to your father.

799
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,360
Propose?

800
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,120
Who said I would propose to you?

801
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,040
I held it back.

802
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,120
I held it back

803
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,560
and you are going to be my wife.

804
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,040
I forgot that you are injured.

805
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,000
Are you okay?

806
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,800
Qi,

807
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,760
if you don't let me go,

808
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,680
I won't go.

809
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,000
My brother's will is not completed yet.

810
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,280
Besides,

811
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
I didn't find out about the wedding.

812
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,400
You can't avoid it.

813
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,160
I'm asking you.

814
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,160
There are various ways to and from others' mouth.

815
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,880
Qi,

816
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,800
look.

817
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,600
You should do it later.

818
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,560
You are prettyyself

819
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,960
who is willing

820
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,640
to Asheum to hurry to detail with you.

821
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,160
Go.

822
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,160
From the day I die, I will never forget

823
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,160
I will use this cup to exchange for the time we met

824
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,160
To leave my position in the past

825
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,160
If the persistence of love has made us fall in love

826
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
I will have this vision

827
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,160
If ten years have become my time

828
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,160
I will never be able to make it

829
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,160
To write a perfect story

830
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,160
To look determined in the wind

831
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
The heart is in the city of unknown

832
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Changed the beginning

833
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,160
Lost the vision of love

834
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,160
I wrote the destiny of the stars and the moon

835
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,160
I also finished this life and death

836
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:34,160
In the future, from the short and short, it will be a deep kiss

837
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:43,160
In the future, from the short and short, it will be a deep kiss

838
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,160
I will never forget

839
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,160
I will use this cup to exchange for the time we met

840
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,160
To leave my position in the past

841
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:08,160
If ten years have become my time

842
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,160
I will never forget

843
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,160
I will use this cup to exchange for the time we met
