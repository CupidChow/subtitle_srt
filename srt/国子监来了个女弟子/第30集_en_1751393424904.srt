1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,720
Someone called Xiao Yan Ran

2
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,120
The star is in the sky, a touch of light

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,560
The dream is in the sky, you are with me

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,920
The wind is in the sky, the sand is in the sky, the ice is in the sky

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,320
I won't regret it for the rest of my life

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,720
The moon is in the sky, the white lotus

7
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,280
The past is in the sky, the young man

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,520
The moon is in the sky, the wind is in the sky, the six years

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,920
The morning is in the sky, the dream is in the sky, the morning is in the sky

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,080
It turns out that the love is like a dream

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,720
How can I say that I have been thinking about it for a year

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,160
He is in the sky, the ground is covered with ink

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,560
He left a story

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,560
The sound of the flute is like a dream

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,720
The smell of the world

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,480
The moon is in the sky, the water is in the sky, the sky is in the sky

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,000
I won't regret it for the rest of my life

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,400
The white lotus is in the sky, the wind is in the sky, the ice is in the sky

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,120
The morning is in the sky, the young man

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,720
The moon is in the sky, the wind is in the sky, the ice is in the sky

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,300
Road to Rebirth

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,840
Episode 22

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,080
wer're the secret order

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,400
look for it

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,360
yes

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
Your Excellency, we have found something.

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,080
Your Excellency, we have found something.

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,840
Your Excellency,

29
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,360
we have caught the spy from Jingzhao Prefecture.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,600
How did you catch him?

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,200
It's...

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,920
You're so clumsy.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,640
Tell me.

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,120
I think I saw it clearly.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,560
But it's impossible.

36
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
Because it doesn't look like you,

37
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,320
so I just give it to you.

38
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
You're a retarded man.

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,400
You take notice of your life,

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,760
I think it's not a good thing.

41
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,640
Where are we lying to?

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,920
Look.

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,920
As the sample researchers,

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,520
it's hard to ever find the spy.

45
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,740
Such an ordinary guy like Mr. Gu

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,040
and Mr. Xu do such a good thing.

47
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Let's go to Jingzhao and have a chat.

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,640
Okay.

49
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm afraid that the people who went to the Imperial College of War will find out.

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
They said that

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
someone saw Yan San Lang.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
What?

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
He's awake?

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Oh, no.

55
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
He's been attacked.

56
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
Yan San Lang definitely didn't wake up just now.

57
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
He's not awake.

58
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
He's not awake.

59
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
He's not awake.

60
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
He's not awake.

61
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
He's not awake.

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
He's not awake.

63
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
I think he's already awake.

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
He even proved his innocence for Yan Yun Zhi.

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
It seems that Yan Yun Zhi

66
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
is being hidden from me

67
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,640
by being caught and killed.

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
I thought

69
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,640
Sang Qi would lose his fighting spirit.

70
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,640
It seems that he's going to fight against me to the death.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Young Master,

72
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,640
before the officials' attitude becomes clear,

73
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,640
you'd better keep your head down.

74
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I'll call all the people in the mansion.

75
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,240
We can temporarily...

76
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,640
It's not the time to admit defeat.

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,640
Tell everyone

78
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,640
to burn all the tickets in the mansion.

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
Take out the equipment in your hands.

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
If it's a false alarm,

81
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,640
we'll pretend to be in the hands of a woman.

82
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
If she's Yan Yun Zhi,

83
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
and really wants to catch me,

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
she'll just let go.

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,640
I can kill Yan Yun Zhi

86
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
with the name of Qin Jun Ce.

87
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,640
This time,

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
I won't let her live.

89
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
Yes.

90
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
What about Madam and Mr. Song?

91
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
I can even think about it.

92
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
What does Dr. Song mean?

93
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Someone has to

94
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
bear the blame.

95
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,240
Yes.

96
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
I understand.

97
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
I'll arrange it immediately.

98
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Yan Yun Zhi

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,640
On the order of the Yan Hua of the Jingzhao Mansion,

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm here to arrest Dr. Song

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
and cooperate with the investigation.

102
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
The Yan Hua of the Jingzhao Mansion

103
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
is also sent to my father.

104
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
You're a big man.

105
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,640
Why don't you ask Dr. Song to come?

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
My father is gone.

107
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
But I have a life.

108
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
Should I

109
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
leave everything to him?

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Today,

111
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
I, Song Luo Tian,

112
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
won't let you arrest anyone in the Song family.

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Are you forcing me to do it?

114
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
We're from the same family.

115
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Don't you dare to do that to me.

116
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Why are you pretending to be kind?

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
We used to fight and make trouble.

118
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
We never met each other.

119
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Yan Yan.

120
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
I knew I would fight with you.

121
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
But I didn't expect it to be like this.

122
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,640
It's over.

123
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
It's meaningless to say more.

124
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
This is our destiny.

125
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Then think it over.

126
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
You really won't let me?

127
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
OK.

128
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
I've always wanted to fight with you.

129
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
This is between us.

130
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
You don't have to interfere.

131
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Yes.

132
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,640
You too.

133
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Don't act rashly.

134
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Let me and Yan Xiao Lang

135
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
have a good ending today.

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
Yes.

137
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

138
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

139
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

140
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

142
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

143
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

144
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

145
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

146
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

147
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

148
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

149
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

150
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

151
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

152
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

153
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

154
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

155
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

156
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

157
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

158
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

159
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

160
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

161
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

162
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

163
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

164
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

165
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

166
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

167
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

168
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

169
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

170
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

171
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

172
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

173
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

174
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

175
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

176
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

177
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

178
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

179
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

180
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

181
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

182
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

183
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

184
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

185
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

186
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

187
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

188
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

189
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

190
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

191
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

192
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Yan Xiao Lang.

193
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Song Luo Tian.

194
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Song Luo Tian.

195
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Am I going to die?

196
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
I feel better.

197
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Am I going to die?

198
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Say less.

199
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
No.

200
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
If I don't say it now,

201
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
there will be no chance in the future.

202
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,640
Yan Yan.

203
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Although I'm not good at sleeping with you,

204
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
I'll wake up in the child's room.

205
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
I'm not allowed

206
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
to keep dreaming in the child's room.

207
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
But that period of time

208
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
was the most unforgettable time for me.

209
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Things have developed to this day.

210
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
It's not my intention.

211
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
I just want to protect my parents.

212
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
If I die like this,

213
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
it's a death and a gain.

214
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,640
That's the end of it.

215
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
No.

216
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
My heart is beating so fast.

217
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Why...

218
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
Why are you still so reckless?

219
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
You're not hurt at all.

220
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Your heart is here.

221
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Just leave some blood and it will hurt a little.

222
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,640
You won't die.

223
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,640
You're too precious.

224
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,640
You haven't been hurt much.

225
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
So you don't think you'll be in danger of life.

226
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,640
I won't die.

227
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Then what I just said,

228
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
you just...

229
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Don't worry.

230
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
I didn't hear anything.

231
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
As for your family,

232
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
I will protect them.

233
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
If they did something wrong,

234
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
they should pay the price.

235
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
But it has nothing to do with them.

236
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
I won't let them die

237
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,640
like Qian Jiu.

238
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Take them.

239
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Yes.

240
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
Go.

241
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
You're late.

242
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Yan Yun Zhi,

243
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
you're so stubborn.

244
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,640
It seems that Yan San Lang is awake.

245
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
You think you're being arrested

246
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,640
and asking for death

247
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
just to make me feel at ease?

248
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,640
You just figured it out now.

249
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
It's too late.

250
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
I haven't said it yet.

251
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Then you're so anxious

252
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
to leave the city at night.

253
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
What's the matter?

254
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
What's the matter?

255
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I'm hunting.

256
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
What a coincidence.

257
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I'm hunting too.

258
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
But my prey

259
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
is already in front of me.

260
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Yan Yun Zhi,

261
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
do you really think

262
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
you can stop me?

263
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
Then you underestimated me.

264
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Yan Yun Zhi,

265
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
you're not afraid of me?

266
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Then let's go.

267
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
Go.

268
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
It's easy to see

269
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
who's got more horses.

270
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,640
What?

271
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
You still want to take these people

272
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
back to Bianjing?

273
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
You're still

274
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
a loyal official.

275
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Yan Yun Zhi,

276
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
you've been

277
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
busy with other things

278
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
since the beginning.

279
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
If you hadn't

280
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
let Sang Yu die,

281
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
you wouldn't have known so much.

282
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Our road is still running.

283
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Our wealth is still accumulating.

284
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
I can be your best student.

285
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I can get a civil name

286
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
and get a good reputation.

287
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Maybe I can come to see

288
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
your private master

289
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
during the festival.

290
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Isn't that good?

291
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Why do you have to investigate?

292
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
Why do I have to investigate?

293
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Why do I have to understand

294
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
why you pushed me to this point?

295
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
You sold your silk and silver

296
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
to Jin Yan.

297
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
You took over the silver silk

298
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
and the silk bag of the Central Treasures.

299
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
You're so honest.

300
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
I've learned something.

301
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
You're not annoying now.

302
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Yan Yun Zhi,

303
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
you should take this secret

304
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
and go to the government.

305
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Go.

306
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I didn't expect you to

307
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
have a wife.

308
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Don't touch my father.

309
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I'm enough.

310
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Sang Qi,

311
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
you're still alive.

312
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
We knew

313
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
the treasure was poisonous.

314
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
It's just a trick.

315
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
A few drops of the medicine

316
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
will be enough.

317
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
You're so smart.

318
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
You're so smart.

319
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
You're so smart.

320
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
You're so smart.

321
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
You're so smart.

322
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
You're so smart.

323
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,640
You're so smart.

324
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
You're so smart.

325
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
You're so smart.

326
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
You're so smart.

327
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
The medicine will be fine.

328
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
Thank you, doctor.

329
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Is it good?

330
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
Miss,

331
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
your lip is pale

332
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
and your nose is full of sweat.

333
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
It's a condition of

334
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,640
blood and air.

335
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Is there anything wrong?

336
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Nothing wrong.

337
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
I'm just tired

338
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
of the warm-up.

339
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
Come on.

340
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
I'll give you a pulse.

341
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
What's wrong, doctor?

342
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
It's a strong poison.

343
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
Strong poison?

344
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Miss,

345
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
think about it carefully.

346
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Is there anything wrong

347
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,640
with the diet and living conditions recently?

348
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
No.

349
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
What about the things you touch

350
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
every day and night?

351
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Unless...

352
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Why did you give me this?

353
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Miss,

354
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,600
this is the poison of the West

355
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
and it seems

356
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,640
to be very strong.

357
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,640
If you

358
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
wear it every day,

359
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
you'll be dizzy and dizzy,

360
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
and you'll lose your appetite.

361
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
You'll fall asleep

362
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
and die.

363
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
I understand, doctor.

364
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
I'll pay attention.

365
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
But

366
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
I don't want to lose you.

367
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,640
I'm sorry.

372
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Please keep it a secret for me.

373
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I will.

374
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Lin Pian,

375
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
see the doctor out.

376
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Yes.

377
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Goodbye.

378
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
There's only one possibility now.

379
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Zhuo Wen Yuan

380
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
has been killed.

381
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,640
But Qian Jiu is dead.

382
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Why does he still

383
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
have to go through so much trouble?

384
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
But it's right.

385
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,640
It seems

386
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
he has something to do with Qian Jiu.

387
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
But you got the pouch

388
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,640
from outside the house.

389
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
He can still be killed.

390
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Then we'll just

391
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,640
follow his lead.

392
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Maybe when he thinks

393
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
he's right to be in the hands of the evil,

394
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
he'll make a mistake.

395
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
By this time,

396
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
it's time for me to counterattack.

397
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
What?

398
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Let me in.

399
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Let me see him for the last time.

400
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
I'll follow you later.

401
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Thanks to Su's ghostly bowl,

402
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
I was able to kill

403
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Master Mangle.

404
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
My lady.

405
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Lin Pian.

406
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
My lady.

407
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Do you feel itchy?

408
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Is it the side effect of the ghostly medicine?

409
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
Let me see.

410
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
It's okay, my lady.

411
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Hurry up.

412
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
When I was dead,

413
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Deputy Chief's back is fine.

414
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I deliberately angered you in the prison.

415
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
I know

416
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
you're not a good person.

417
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
But I know

418
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
you're not a good person.

419
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
I know

420
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
you're not a good person.

421
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
But I know

422
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
you're not a good person.

423
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
I know

424
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,640
you won't let me die so easily.

425
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
You will definitely let me live

426
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
until the day your great achievement is accomplished.

427
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
Next,

428
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
we'll follow your new route

429
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,640
and track down the remaining party members

430
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
to find the place where you hid your wealth.

431
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Sang Qi.

432
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
You lied to me again.

433
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Why are you so cold to me?

434
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Isn't it because I want to kill you

435
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
and make you feel bitter?

436
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Zhong Wen Yuan.

437
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
You always mention childhood with me.

438
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
But now,

439
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,640
you grew up with me in the competition,

440
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,640
but you're not alone.

441
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,640
Now,

442
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
you have nothing to do with me.

443
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
In that case,

444
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
let's respect our own fate.

445
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
And

446
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
there should have been

447
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
an end between us.

448
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Let's just leave a result

449
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
for the past years.

450
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Qi, don't listen to her.

451
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Okay.

452
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Don't worry.

453
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
It's all over.

454
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Go back with me.

455
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Qi,

456
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
I can't go back.

457
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
I owe you a life.

458
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,640
I'll pay you back today.

459
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,640
I'll be with you.

460
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,640
I'll be with you.

461
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
I'll be with you.

462
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
I'll be with you.

463
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
I'll be with you.

464
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
I'll be with you.

465
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I'll be with you.

466
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Young Master.

467
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Qi,

468
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
I can't go back.

469
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,640
I owe you a life.

470
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
I'll pay you back today.

471
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Qi,

472
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
I can't go back.

473
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
I'll pay you back today.

474
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
I'll be with you.

475
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
I'll be with you.

476
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
I'll be with you.

477
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
I'll be with you.

478
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
I'll be with you.

479
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
I'll be with you.

480
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
I'll be with you.

481
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
I'll be with you.

482
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,640
I'll be with you.

483
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,640
I'll be with you.

484
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
I'll be with you.

485
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
I'll be with you.

486
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
I'll be with you.

487
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
I'll be with you.

488
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,640
Why did I be with you?

489
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
Qi,

490
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm afraid you won't understand me much.

491
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Qi,

492
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
we've never been downhill before.

493
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,640
You seem to be Honeymanriz's superior.

494
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
I can understand that.

495
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,640
I am willing to wait for you for the rest of my life

496
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,640
The happiness that has been lost in the world's old dreams

497
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:14,640
I want to spend the rest of my life with you

498
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,640
Are you willing to?

499
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Are you willing to?

500
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,640
I am willing to

501
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,640
The case is clear, the facts are clear

502
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Now the criminal, Zhuo Wen Yuan, is dead

503
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,640
His party has been killed

504
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,640
As for Concubine Zhuo

505
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,640
For the sake of her husband's kindness, death can be spared

506
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,640
But the harem is trying to command the previous court and the important officials

507
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
And even frame the loyal and the good

508
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,640
You can't escape from the crime of life

509
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
You must die in the cold palace

510
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Grand Tutor Song

511
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Take away the official position and let go of the border

512
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Song Luo Tian, also become a scholar

513
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Thank you for your kindness

514
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,640
I am willing to accompany my father to leave

515
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,640
I will seriously atone for my sins and change my mind

516
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
It's better for you to have such a heart

517
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,640
It means that your Song family is still alive

518
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,640
Guards

519
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
Yes

520
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Take him away

521
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Yes

522
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,640
You have suffered recently

523
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
As the biggest official

524
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
What kind of reward do you want?

525
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
Tell me

526
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
Tell me

527
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Officer

528
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,640
How can I be embarrassed to hear you say that?

529
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,640
It's fine if you don't want it

530
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
No, no, no

531
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
I mean

532
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
I'm embarrassed to refuse you

533
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I do have a favor to ask you

534
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Say it

535
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,640
I want to go back to the Imperial College

536
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
It's so unexpected

537
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
You can only play with us

538
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,640
The thinking is about my harshness

539
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:57,680
You

540
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,180
I can't agree more

541
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
See

542
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
That's why you are great

543
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,480
I need to think about it.

544
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,600
Officer,

545
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,600
I wanted to go to the Imperial College to study.

546
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You criticized me.

547
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,680
I guess you're a person

548
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
who loves and cares about talent.

549
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,000
I want everyone in the world

550
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,360
to share your generous love.

551
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,160
Okay.

552
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,520
I know your request.

553
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,200
Yan Qing,

554
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,480
what kind of reward do you want?

555
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,320
Tell me.

556
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,360
Officer,

557
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,200
I only have one request.

558
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,760
Please take back the order

559
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,240
to cancel the engagement between Su Jie Yu and me.

560
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,440
When you were guilty,

561
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,040
your engagement was canceled.

562
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,400
Today,

563
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,440
I'll grant you two a marriage.

564
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,320
You two have been through a lot of torture.

565
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,160
It's not easy for you to get here.

566
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
I hope you two can get married soon

567
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,440
and be a model for the love of

568
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
the Bianjing couple.

569
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

570
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,120
Brother,

571
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,760
you're watching us from the sky, right?

572
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,000
Your good brother, Xiao Bai,

573
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,560
followed your teachings

574
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,600
and took good care of my sister.

575
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,840
He even took care of her family.

576
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,280
I heard you're still feeling wronged.

577
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,960
Brother Yu,

578
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,120
I'm the one who was tied to the Sang family

579
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,560
to death at the beginning.

580
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Yes, yes, yes.

581
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,600
We're all counting on you.

582
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,840
Then you should be a man

583
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,160
of the Sang family.

584
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,200
Yes, yes, yes.

585
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,040
You should be a man of the Sang family.

586
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,880
Brother,

587
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,480
I've finally

588
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,560
understood your hard work and effort.

589
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,840
Don't worry.

590
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,600
I'll see you and Si Ye

591
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,640
in a good way

592
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,600
and fulfill your dream.

593
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,440
So be it.

594
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
and a man of great power.

595
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
He's a man of great power.

596
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,280
He's a man of great power.

597
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,960
But

598
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,000
you're also a good friend.

599
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,240
Song Luo Tian.

600
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,720
Although you're a mischievous person

601
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,920
and a ridiculous man,

602
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,360
you're not a man of great power.

603
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,640
You're just doing what you want.

604
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,200
But I have to say

605
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,520
that in the days of the Imperial College,

606
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,920
and even in the days of the Jinzhao Mansion,

607
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,040
you're always happy.

608
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,400
Are you two really saying goodbye to each other?

609
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,240
Although with your help,

610
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,760
the officials didn't punish me

611
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,360
and made me a commoner.

612
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,120
But I still want to atone for my sins with them

613
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,440
and come back to the country.

614
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,520
If there's another chance,

615
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,520
I'll definitely come back to the Imperial College.

616
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,280
If there's another chance,

617
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,360
I'll definitely come back to the Imperial College.

618
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,120
At that time,

619
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,920
I, Song Luo Tian,

620
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
will definitely make a contribution by learning and getting a good grade.

621
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,480
I'll wait for that day.

622
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,240
Wan Yuan.

623
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,720
Let's go home.

624
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,000
Let's go.

625
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,480
Mr. Zhuo.

626
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,000
Zhuo Wen Yuan was the last one to go back

627
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,240
to the border before he died.

628
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,880
But now he's dead.

629
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
Only Miss Song is willing to clean up for him

630
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,920
and take his ashes back.

631
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
I'm sorry, Miss Song.

632
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,360
I'm sorry, Miss Song.

633
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,320
I'm sorry.

634
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,320
I'm sorry.

635
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,400
I'm sorry.

636
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
I'm sorry.

637
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,040
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,760
I'm sorry.

639
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,520
I'm sorry.

640
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,200
I'm sorry.

641
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:56,920
I'm sorry.

642
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,720
I'm sorry.

643
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,480
Life is like a dream.

644
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,160
But with you,

645
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,440
I'd rather sleep.

646
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
Where did you learn this trick?

647
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Qingfeng Pavilion.

648
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,160
I knew it.

649
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,800
I really need to discuss with Sang Ye

650
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,160
about what kind of dirty tricks he taught me.

651
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,840
It's so painful.

652
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,120
Lian Pian.

653
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,920
The wind blows, the sand is flat.

654
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,280
The night is silent.

655
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,720
The moon is bright.

656
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,320
The night is silent.

657
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,560
The night is silent.

658
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,960
The morning is silent.

659
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,160
The night is silent.

660
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,920
The dream is a dream.

661
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,800
The dream is a dream.

662
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,160
The dream is a dream.

663
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,520
The dream is a dream.

664
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,520
The dream is a dream.

665
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,440
The dream is a dream.

666
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,200
són ponieważ

667
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:07,200
suí

668
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,640
silver

669
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,680
Welcome you

670
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,680
Spring breeze blows through the world

671
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,720
Blows open the flow of peach blossoms

672
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,280
The story in the book is long

673
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,640
There is always a heart-to-heart experience

674
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,920
Who is the most beautiful and who is the most beautiful

675
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,240
I look at someone smiling

676
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,720
Please give me another blank

677
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,120
You are in the city

678
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,520
Whether it's a laugh or an ordinary

679
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,920
I will never regret it

680
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,320
I want to meet you for a hundred years

681
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,120
I want to meet you for a hundred years

682
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,520
I want to meet you for a hundred years

683
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,320
It turns out that the love story is not only a dream

684
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,560
He is determined to be the most beautiful

685
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,000
He left the story

686
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
The love story is like a dream

687
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's a story of the end

688
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,800
The love story is like a dream

689
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,200
The love story is like a dream

690
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,200
The wind blows through the window

691
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,400
The love story is like a dream

692
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,280
Second worship

693
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
Husband and wife worship

694
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
The love story is like a dream

695
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,880
The love story is like a dream

696
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
The love story is like a dream

697
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
The ceremony is done

698
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Now please exchange the token

699
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Ring

700
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
This is He Yi'er

701
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,880
You don't want to

702
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Put the ring on the fourth prince's arm, do you?

703
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
Dare not

704
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,360
The ring is for teachers to teach students

705
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
I'll give it to you today

706
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,360
I hope you can teach me strictly in the future

707
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Don't be so polite

708
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
Then I will take it

709
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,360
You will definitely like my gift

710
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,360
The two of us started with the box

711
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,360
And settled the love with the box

712
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Now we can settle the love with the box

713
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
It's more suitable

714
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
I only want to be like this little box

715
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Every year

716
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
To be with you

717
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Thank you

718
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Sorry

719
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
I got your handkerchief dirty

720
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
I'll return it to you after I wash it

721
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
It's serious

722
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
This handkerchief is not worth it

723
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
I'll give it to you

724
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
You can't be so arrogant

725
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
I won't even marry you

726
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,840
The imperial edict is here

727
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
The imperial edict is here

728
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
The imperial edict is here

729
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
The imperial edict is here

730
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
This is the gift from the official to Sang Qi

731
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Please accept the edict

732
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Please accept the edict

733
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Yes

734
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
After the formation

735
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,320
The emperor's words are in the sixth level

736
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
The star rises in the private text

737
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Give it to the doctor

738
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Thank you

739
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Thank you, officer

740
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,320
The official is giving me an edict

741
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,320
I became the first female doctor in the Imperial College

742
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
Exactly

743
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
The official also has a oral edict

744
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,800
He agreed with the ideas of Yan Siye and Dr. Sang

745
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
In the Imperial College

746
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Specialized in recruiting female students in the Hualin class

747
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
From then on

748
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
The Imperial College recruits students

749
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,800
No matter age, gender, or family

750
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Siye

751
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
Your insistence has no way

752
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
We did it

753
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Madam

754
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,280
It's because of a female student like you

755
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
The official will have confidence

756
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Let more people enter the Imperial College

757
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
The official is here

758
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
Let's go

759
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
Under the sky

760
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,280
The sound of the lullaby is sad

761
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
Who is it

762
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
I saw it

763
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,280
The main character is not more important than the main character

764
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,280
There is a meaning

765
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,280
The prince is strong

766
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Wait for me

767
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
Is it here

768
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
The blood is flowing

769
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
The blood is flowing

770
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
The mountain is invisible

771
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
The road is narrow

772
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
The road is narrow

773
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,760
The road is narrow

774
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
The road is narrow

775
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
The road is narrow

776
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
There will be a stroke

777
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
This time the heart is in the corner

778
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,760
This time the heart is in the corner

779
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
I am heart

780
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Every moment is meaningful

781
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,760
One line is a single line

782
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,240
This time I am a light

783
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,240
You are my heart

784
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
I am a young man

785
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,240
You should restrain your words

786
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Don't always climb to the roof

787
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
This is not the end

788
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
I am me

789
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
I can do whatever I want

790
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Moreover

791
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Now I am not Dr. Sang

792
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
You are not Yan Siye

793
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
I am not Siye

794
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
Then what am I

795
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
You are

796
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,720
You are my Sangji's husband

797
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
You are my Sangji's husband

798
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
You are my Sangji's husband

799
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,720
You are my Sangji's husband

800
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
You are my Sangji's husband

801
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
You are my Sangji's husband

802
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
You are my Sangji's husband

803
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
You are my Sangji's husband

804
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,720
You are my Sangji's husband

805
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,720
You are my Sangji's husband

806
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
You are my Sangji's husband

807
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
You are my Sangji's husband

808
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,720
You are my Sangji's husband

809
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,720
You are my Sangji's husband

810
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,720
You are my Sangji's husband

811
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,720
You are my Sangji's husband

812
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,720
You are my Sangji's husband

813
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
You are my Sangji's husband

814
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,720
You are my Sangji's husband

815
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
You are my Sangji's husband

816
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
You are my Sangji's husband

817
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,120
The lonely rhythm is your thoughts

818
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,520
Your lips are这个样某 lip,我这个样子

819
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,520
I don't understand the meaning of words

820
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,120
But I can't be unknown

821
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,520
I'm going through a perfect story

822
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,520
I'm going through a perfect story

823
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,920
I'm going through a perfect story

824
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,920
I'm going through a perfect story

825
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,520
I'm going through a perfect story

826
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,120
I'm going through a perfect story

827
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,720
I'm going through a perfect story

828
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,920
The future is always bright

829
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,720
It's like a deep kiss

830
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,120
From the day I was born

831
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,320
That story

832
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,120
I'm going to use this life to exchange for a lifetime

833
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,320
The past is the place I left behind

834
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,520
If the strong bond of love

835
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,320
Deepened our love for each other

836
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,720
I'm going to have this life

837
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
If the past is the past

838
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,320
Became my value

839
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,520
I can't be unknown

840
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:49,720
I'm going through a perfect story

841
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm going through a perfect story

842
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,920
The heart is in a small town

843
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Changed the beginning

844
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,520
Lost the person who is not true love

845
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,120
I wrote the lyrics of the new moon

846
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:10,720
I also finished this life in the past

847
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,920
The future is always bright

848
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,720
It's like a deep kiss

849
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:33,920
When the life begins

850
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,120
I'm going to use this life to exchange for a lifetime

851
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:46,320
The past is the place I left behind

852
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
In this lonely city,

853
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:20,320
I changed the beginning

854
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,920
and lost the face of love.

855
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,520
I wrote the lyrics of the new moon.

856
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,920
I also finished this life and death.

857
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,320
In the future, we will be in love

858
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:39,920
and melt into a deep kiss.

859
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,320
In the future, we will be in love

860
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:48,320
and melt into a deep kiss.
