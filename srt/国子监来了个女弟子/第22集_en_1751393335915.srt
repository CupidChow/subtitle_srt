1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Someone is here

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Someone is here

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Someone is here

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Someone is here

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Someone is here

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Someone is here

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Someone is here

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Someone is here

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Someone is here

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Welcome our currency

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is this a clip?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Gjam

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is a review

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
where to read books.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,360
You're not suitable for this.

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,600
Why not?

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,320
You just can't stand

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,600
someone being attracted to you.

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,000
Miss Song,

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
you'd better go back.

35
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,560
Don't make it hard for Sang Qi.

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,400
You're all like Zhang A Qi.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,680
I've been used to it.

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
I'm not leaving today.

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,160
If you're capable,

40
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,000
just hit me.

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
This is the first time

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,160
I've heard such a request.

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,680
Then I'll be polite.

44
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,160
I...

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
How dare you touch me?

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
You know our Song family is capable.

47
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,520
I'm telling you,

48
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
if you're capable, just drag me out.

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,480
Then I'll be sorry.

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,880
Chu...

51
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
Chu Wen Yuan.

52
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,160
Put me down.

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,280
Put me down.

54
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,640
Chu Wen Yuan.

55
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,440
Put me down.

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,880
Chu Wen Yuan.

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,320
Read more books.

58
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,640
Let go of me.

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,880
Let go of me.

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,600
Do you hear me?

61
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,760
Chu Wen Yuan.

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,320
Miss Song,

63
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,440
you can let go now.

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,880
An Yan, are you okay?

65
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,600
Mr. Zhuo,

66
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,640
I didn't expect

67
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,600
you to be so polite to a woman.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
You're so rude.

69
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm nice to women.

70
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,880
But I'm not good enough to fight against Zang Qi.

71
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,600
You're here to test me.

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,800
You don't know the etiquette.

73
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,720
You don't respect me.

74
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,280
I can't be nice to you.

75
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,680
Fine.

76
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm dumb.

77
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,480
I can't beat you.

78
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,360
But A Yin is different.

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,640
In Bianjing,

80
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,240
there's no one A Yin is afraid of.

81
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,160
A Yan.

82
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,280
You're all like a chicken.

83
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,320
You're all bullying me.

84
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,360
I won the bet.

85
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,400
But in the end,

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Yan Xi also helped him out.

87
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,440
I'm a lady.

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm a lady too.

89
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
What's the difference?

90
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,360
I know

91
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,800
you all say I'm arrogant

92
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,520
and I'm a little bit of a bully.

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,000
But I'm just

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,960
in love with someone.

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,320
What's the difference?

96
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
What's the difference?

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
What's the difference?

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,880
Enough.

99
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,280
I'm not a lady.

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,040
Enough.

101
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
I...

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,880
Calm down.

103
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
If you keep doing this,

104
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,800
it'll be more embarrassing.

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,640
What are you doing?

106
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
Nothing.

107
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,040
It's just that I rarely see you so arrogant.

108
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,160
Don't say that.

109
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm not saying you're bad.

110
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
I think

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
you're much cuter than Fei Yang and Bahu.

112
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,640
Why don't you try another style?

113
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,960
Cute?

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,280
Enough.

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't be so mad at Sang Qi.

116
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
I lost to Yan Yun Zhi in the competition.

117
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
In terms of shame,

118
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
I'm much more serious than you.

119
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
What now?

120
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,840
You're going back home later.

121
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,560
Wait for me.

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,360
I'll see you off.

123
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,960
Yan.

124
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,680
Yan.

125
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,120
You...

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,720
What are you staring at?

127
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,600
Nothing.

128
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,680
Ms. Sang, let's go.

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Let's go.

130
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,800
Father.

131
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,600
Isn't this the most popular person recently?

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,200
Mr. Zhuo.

133
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,520
What's the news that you're here?

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,240
Father,

135
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,000
Mr. Zhuo sent me back.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,920
So, Mr. Zhuo,

137
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,160
you're here to see me?

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,480
Mr. Zhuo,

139
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
I'm home now.

140
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
You can go back first.

141
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
We'll meet another day.

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,960
Jiayin,

143
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,560
you can go back to your room and rest.

144
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,200
Dr. Song,

145
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
I have something to discuss with you.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,200
Go to my study.

147
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,320
Please.

148
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
What's the matter?

149
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Tell me.

150
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,440
Dr. Song, do you remember

151
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,120
the wolf's den that was searched last time?

152
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,640
I remember a little.

153
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
Didn't you clean it up?

154
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
Dr. Song has a lot of secrets.

155
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm bold to ask you.

156
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Did you use it?

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
Did you buy any spices

158
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,160
from that wolf's den?

159
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,840
That's true.

160
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,320
Then you have to be careful.

161
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,360
I'm afraid

162
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,440
you'll be watched here.

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,840
What's the matter?

164
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,600
Is it true?

165
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,440
It's been a long time.

166
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,920
Dr. Song should have made the plan earlier.

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,440
I'm not saying you're bad.

168
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,560
I think

169
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
you're much cuter

170
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,440
than Fei Yang, the tiger, and Ke'ai.

171
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,960
Why don't you try to change your style?

172
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm not a tiger.

173
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm a wolf.

174
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
I'm a wolf.

175
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
I'm a wolf.

176
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm a wolf.

177
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm a wolf.

178
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I'm a wolf.

179
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
I'm a wolf.

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
I'm a wolf.

181
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm a wolf.

182
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm a wolf.

183
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,320
I'm a wolf.

184
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm a wolf.

185
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm a wolf.

186
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Wan Ke Feng.

187
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Get away from me!

188
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Let's go!

189
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,960
No one dares to push a woman in front of me.

190
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,880
Song Jiayin.

192
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,160
What's wrong with you?

193
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
You have to remember

194
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
you'll be the wife of Deputy Chief Yan.

195
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
How can you think of another man?

196
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,080
But...

197
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,960
Mr. Zhuo is also one of the four princes of Bianjing.

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,920
He's also a star.

199
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,040
Even my father said

200
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,600
he's a popular man in the court.

201
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,000
He's not worse than Yan Si.

202
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,600
The key is

203
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,240
he's different from me.

204
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
I mean

205
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
he's going to marry the best man in Bianjing.

206
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,080
But there are two men

207
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
who have their own needs.

208
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,720
It's really hard for me

209
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,400
to give up one man.

210
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,360
How can I

211
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,920
tell the fish and the bear?

212
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,680
This is so nice.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,720
I didn't know

214
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,600
the Imperial College was so popular.

215
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
I wish I could come in and study.

216
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,720
What are you thinking?

217
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,720
The Imperial College

218
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
was only for famous students.

219
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,840
Now it's rare to open for students.

220
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,200
If you can come in,

221
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,760
it'll be a great success.

222
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Let me help you.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,280
Everything is fine here.

224
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
But there's a girl in the teacher's room

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,240
who's not fit for the occasion.

226
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,680
And I heard

227
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
that the imperial exam can be entered in the Imperial College

228
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,400
because she's the daughter of the Grand Commandant.

229
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Maybe the so-called broad-minded family

230
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,200
is just trying to open the way

231
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,600
for the grand family.

232
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,720
Exactly.

233
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,600
You're right.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,920
I was blessed by my family

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
to study at the Imperial College.

236
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,880
But I got the title

237
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,040
and got the title.

238
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,960
I have to work hard.

239
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
You're not saying that.

240
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,720
Yes.

241
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,960
I can prove it to you.

242
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,880
Okay.

243
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,600
But it's not about the chess club.

244
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,680
It's about your family's education.

245
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,320
It's not about the Imperial College.

246
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,400
Of course.

247
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,960
If I write a play here,

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,840
it'll be a waste of time.

249
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,320
I'll give you some time.

250
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,320
Click on the place where I work.

251
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,800
Why don't you take another exam here?

252
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,080
What do you think?

253
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,920
How can I take the exam?

254
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,400
There are hundreds of books here.

255
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,880
There are thousands of books.

256
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
Although there are many books,

257
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm still familiar with them.

258
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,040
Just say a book.

259
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,920
I can find it for you

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,360
as long as there's one here.

261
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,400
Okay.

262
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
The son of the teacher.

263
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,480
I'm not making things difficult for you.

264
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,440
The son of the teacher...

265
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,280
Is he reading it?

266
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,720
The son of the teacher.

267
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,240
The teacher of the Taoist School in West Han.

268
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,920
The teacher of the Taoist School.

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,320
I'll read it

270
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,320
in a way that's appropriate for the son.

271
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
But I personally recommend

272
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
the play of the Monk and the Monk.

273
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,520
If you read both books together,

274
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,360
you'll get a lot of benefits.

275
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,720
What do you think?

276
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,240
You're looking for this book, right?

277
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,520
I did enter the Guozi Sword

278
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,760
as a son of the Taoist School.

279
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,480
But the criticism and criticism I received

280
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,920
far surpassed the other people.

281
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,080
The so-called broad-minded family

282
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,240
is not just a trick.

283
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,440
I want everyone to be fair

284
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,000
to another student.

285
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,800
No need for too many questions

286
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,440
and no need for other people's criticism.

287
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
You just need to

288
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,280
study in the Guozi Sword.

289
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,080
Yes.

290
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,920
Yes.

291
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,920
Yes.

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,760
We just need to study.

293
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,400
Qi.

294
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,360
You were pretty just now.

295
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,200
It's interesting.

296
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,160
You're pushing yourself to the next level.

297
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,240
That's because the Fourth Master taught me well.

298
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,680
I did well in the role of a model.

299
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,400
It's rare to praise you.

300
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,000
Why did Feng Cheng come to me?

301
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,360
Actually, I'm praising myself.

302
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,520
You're the one I'm praising.

303
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,880
You're the one I'm praising.

304
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,400
So I'm praising you

305
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,880
for raising your price a little bit.

306
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
This way, I'll have a better taste.

307
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,520
Besides,

308
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,440
from now on,

309
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,960
you have to do well

310
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,200
and earn some money for me.

311
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,960
Three days.

312
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
I'll get back to work.

313
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,160
I'll go and earn some money for you.

314
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,840
Here.

315
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,040
Here.

316
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,000
Qi Lang.

317
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,920
You're here.

318
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,240
Why did you ask me out today?

319
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,480
It's your birthday soon.

320
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,240
I came to ask you how to arrange it.

321
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,720
I forgot about it.

322
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,200
I've been busy

323
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,680
with the thing about Qi's entry into the editing room.

324
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,640
I know you don't like to be in the dark every year.

325
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,560
We just came to remind you

326
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,680
when the time is right.

327
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,480
Well,

328
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,240
let's have a meal together like we used to.

329
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,160
Forget it this year.

330
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
I have another plan.

331
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,600
See?

332
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,880
I told you that Qi Lang

333
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,160
wouldn't care about us this year.

334
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,760
You lost.

335
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,640
Qi Lang,

336
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,080
I was wrong about you.

337
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,760
How's the investigation going on about the Wolf's Cove?

338
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,640
It's not over yet.

339
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,680
We found a group of suspicious salt merchants today.

340
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,720
They're going to be caught.

341
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,200
Just wait and see.

342
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,260
I hope we can find the black-handed

343
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
and the black-handed this time.

344
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,000
Come on, let's drink.

345
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,200
We'll talk later.

346
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,560
Young Master,

347
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,280
is there anything wrong with your birthday this year?

348
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,640
Why don't I know?

349
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,560
It's Qi's birthday this year.

350
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,240
He'll arrange it for me.

351
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Does Third Sister know about your birthday?

352
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I'll go.

353
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:21,720
Sister.

354
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,760
Sister.

355
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,680
Sister.

356
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
What are you doing here?

357
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,560
Sister, I'm still on duty.

358
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,160
Let's talk when we're back at night.

359
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,120
No way.

360
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,280
It's an emergency.

361
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,560
I can't wait till night.

362
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,680
What's wrong?

363
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,440
You're an official now.

364
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,960
Your sister is not here.

365
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
No, sister.

366
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,560
What's going on?

367
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,280
Your sister has been in a big trouble recently.

368
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,000
She wants to know your opinion.

369
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,640
Which one of Yan Siye and Zhuo Wenyuan

370
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,000
is better as your brother-in-law?

371
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,160
I know your worry.

372
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,200
I've been thinking about it.

373
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
Should I be the Prime Minister

374
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,080
or the Grand Commandant?

375
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,920
You've been with Yan Yan for a long time.

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,360
You've learned to fight with your sister.

377
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Sister, it hurts.

378
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,080
Let go of me.

379
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,080
I'm wrong.

380
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,680
If my men see it,

381
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,960
how can I get back together?

382
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,320
It's a big deal.

383
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,600
Mind your own business.

384
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,960
Aren't you going to marry into Yan's family?

385
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,440
Why is Zhuo Wenyuan here?

386
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,160
I was thinking about Yan Siye.

387
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,400
Because he's the only one who can match me in Bianjing.

388
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,280
But Zhuo Wenyuan is more popular recently.

389
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,280
The most important thing is that

390
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm well-off to your sister.

391
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
And this.

392
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,480
You didn't tell your brother.

393
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,880
Stop it.

394
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,480
The most important thing is

395
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,920
which one of them I should choose.

396
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,680
So ugly.

397
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,320
I have an idea.

398
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,800
Your sister's life is important.

399
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,440
You can only rely on a copper coin.

400
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,760
The front is Yan Siye.

401
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,040
The back is Zhuo Wenyuan.

402
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,360
You can trust your brother.

403
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,240
Throw it.

404
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,040
The front?

405
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,120
It's a big deal.

406
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,720
We have to win three times.

407
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,840
I'll do it again.

408
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,640
I...

409
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
If you want to do it again,

410
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
it means you don't think about Yan Siye.

411
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,440
It's Zhuo Wenyuan.

412
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,400
It makes sense.

413
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,600
Good for you, brother.

414
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,840
You're a good boy.

415
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,960
You're smart.

416
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,120
I'm glad to hear that.

417
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,000
Since I've made my decision,

418
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,800
I'll go to see a doctor.

419
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,640
Go ahead.

420
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,440
I'm going.

421
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Let's go.

422
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,160
Qi.

423
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,760
Miss Song, you're here again.

424
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,160
But you're dressed up like a plain girl.

425
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,920
Just tell me what you want.

426
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,760
Don't bother other students.

427
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,640
Qi.

428
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,000
You and Siye are a couple.

429
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,400
Although we're married into the Yan family,

430
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,680
I'm the eldest.

431
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,520
You're the youngest.

432
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,640
But it's better to be alone.

433
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,560
I'll tell you today.

434
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,680
I won't argue with you.

435
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,640
I'll let you have Yan Siye.

436
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,000
What's your idea again?

437
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,040
I'm into Mr. Zhuo.

438
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
Zhuo...

439
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,160
Zhuo Wenyuan?

440
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,120
All right.

441
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,520
I've made it clear to you.

442
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,520
Don't ask me again.

443
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,120
That's it.

444
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,800
Let's go.

445
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,280
Qi.

446
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Siye, why are you here?

447
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,880
You're back.

448
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,080
Today is the first day of the eighth month.

449
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,840
According to the custom,

450
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm going to sort out the list of the Imperial College.

451
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm here to help you.

452
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,840
You're so nice.

453
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,160
Let's go.

454
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,400
Why are you hungry again?

455
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,640
Qi.

456
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,760
I've found my list of the year.

457
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,840
Can you find it for me?

458
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,640
Yes.

459
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,640
Qi.

460
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,760
Yes.

461
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,480
This is your brother.

462
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,120
I should be right behind your brother.

463
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Can you find it for me?

464
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,640
Shu...

465
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,840
Who is Shu Zheyu?

466
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,480
Yan Yan.

467
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,960
Siye.

468
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,720
Why are you here?

469
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm here to see you.

470
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,160
Me?

471
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,600
Did I do something wrong

472
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,600
in the Imperial College again?

473
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
I'm not in the Imperial College anymore.

474
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Do you care about the Imperial Seal?

475
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
Don't talk nonsense.

476
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
Do you know

477
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,640
what day is the eighth day of the eighth month?

478
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,880
The eighth day of the eighth month?

479
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,880
Let me think about it.

480
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,920
I know.

481
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,080
It's the day I've been in the Imperial College for a month.

482
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,160
It's related to me.

483
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
It's related to Siye?

484
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,760
I don't know.

485
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,040
Forget it.

486
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,000
It's a waste of time

487
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,440
to tell you about the eighth day of the eighth month.

488
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,640
Let me tell you.

489
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,000
The eighth day of the eighth month

490
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,600
is my birthday.

491
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,880
It's Siye's birthday?

492
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,520
I see.

493
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:49,920
What?

494
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,480
Siye wants to treat you to a meal?

495
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,040
You...

496
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,320
Forget it.

497
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,240
I want you to tell Sang Qi

498
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,160
the truth

499
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,480
without any hesitation.

500
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,280
Without any hesitation.

501
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,720
The eighth day of the eighth month.

502
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Tell Sang Qi my birthday.

503
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,680
Why didn't Siye...

504
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,480
Don't ask.

505
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,080
Go now.

506
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,600
Now.

507
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,560
I...

508
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,840
I'll go now.

509
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,280
Where are you going? You're wrong.

510
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,480
Okay.

511
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,960
What day is the eighth day of the eighth month?

512
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,360
It's...

513
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,920
You...

514
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,240
Siye's birthday.

515
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,800
It's reliable.

516
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,240
The eighth day of the eighth month.

517
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,480
The eighth day of the eighth month is my birthday.

518
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,280
It's my birthday.

519
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,240
Master Sang.

520
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,360
I just met Siye in Jingzhou.

521
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,160
He told me...

522
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,360
Yan Xiaolang.

523
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,520
Why are you back so late?

524
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,160
I was stopped by Siye.

525
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,080
He just...

526
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,720
I shouldn't have waited for you.

527
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,000
Why?

528
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,200
Yan Yan.

529
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,320
You've been living in our mansion

530
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,600
for a month, right?

531
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,880
Why don't you clean the room?

532
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,920
You're a girl.

533
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,400
You can't go in.

534
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,440
Right.

535
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,120
I've been waiting for you to clean it.

536
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,000
I've been holding it for you for a long time.

537
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,840
Why are you holding it?

538
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,280
Why don't you shoot?

539
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,280
Go.

540
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,280
Swing it.

541
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,400
Swing it.

542
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,440
Swing it.

543
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,320
I remind Qi that today is my birthday.

544
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm not here to celebrate it.

545
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,400
I'm afraid that she'll feel sorry

546
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,240
if she misses it.

547
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,440
Deputy Chief.

548
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,440
Deputy Chief.

549
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,640
Qi.

550
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,000
Deputy Chief.

551
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
Today is actually...

552
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,120
Deputy Chief.

553
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,680
What time is it now?

554
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,400
It's past five o'clock.

555
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,120
It's past five o'clock?

556
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,840
My father asked me to go back early today.

557
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
I have something urgent to do.

558
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,320
Please take care of it for me.

559
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,600
I'm afraid it's too late.

560
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,560
Qi, actually today...

561
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,160
Right.

562
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,880
Today is a happy event.

563
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,280
You can come at any time.

564
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,240
What happy event?

565
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,760
Qi.

566
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,440
Qi.

567
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,040
You asked me to come here

568
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,200
because of some happy event.

569
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
Just go in.

570
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,280
Why are they all

571
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,960
coming to my house to eat?

572
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,200
Mr. Sang.

573
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,240
Sorry to bother you.

574
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,680
Sit down since you're here.

575
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
Qi has been in the house for days.

576
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
I thought

577
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,680
you prepared this for me.

578
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,600
Qi.

579
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,600
You prepared all these for me?

580
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,280
Deputy Chief, what do you mean?

581
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,640
Lian Pian prepared this?

582
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,400
To celebrate the fact that

583
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Yuan Xiaolang has been in our house for a month,

584
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,240
he prepared so many delicious dishes.

585
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:02,920
Right?

586
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,480
Deputy Chief, it means

587
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,880
you have something good to say.

588
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,720
Nothing.

589
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,360
Nothing else.

590
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,080
Have some.

591
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,720
Thank you, Miss.

592
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,320
Come on, Deputy Chief.

593
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,800
Come on, Lian Pian.

594
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,480
You have to eat more.

595
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,200
Thank you.

596
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,360
Here.

597
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,840
Have some more.

598
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:31,760
Here.

599
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,440
Have some.

600
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,240
Here, Deputy Chief.

601
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:34,920
Lian Pian.

602
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,120
Thank you, Miss.

603
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Thank you.

604
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Let me pour you another cup.

605
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,280
Okay.

606
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:40,840
Here.

607
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,840
Okay, Deputy Chief.

608
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,560
Pour me some more.

609
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,120
Eat.

610
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,000
Why are you eating?

611
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,080
Let's do it together.

612
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,120
Here.

613
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,400
Pour me another cup.

614
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,040
These are all yours.

615
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,920
Let me toast you.

616
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,440
Here.

617
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,200
Here.

618
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,520
Lian Pian.

619
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,600
Have some more.

620
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,280
I'm so full.

621
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,520
Here.

622
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,720
Let me toast you.

623
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,400
Have some more.

624
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,160
Here.

625
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,560
Here.

626
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,240
Here.

627
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,880
Here.

628
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,040
Why do you look unhappy?

629
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,680
Nothing.

630
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,240
You have to tell me if you're unhappy.

631
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,600
It'll be much better if you tell me.

632
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,120
What are you talking about?

633
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,360
Three friends and a few glasses of wine.

634
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,040
I'm looking at the stars and looking down at my lover.

635
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,080
How can I be unhappy?

636
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,520
Since it's not unhappy,

637
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,120
it's just a pity.

638
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,120
I've told you.

639
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,200
I didn't celebrate your birthday with you.

640
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,080
You...

641
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,040
You know?

642
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,920
Of course I know.

643
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:00,920
Then...

644
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:09,920
Do you like it?

645
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,680
I made it especially for you.

646
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,320
It took me several bowls of wine.

647
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,640
Of course I like it.

648
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,600
Thank you.

649
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,160
You're getting old fast.

650
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,080
I don't know who

651
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
didn't want you to live to the end.

652
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,240
It's different from the past.

653
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,040
Look.

654
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,080
The one you're sewing now

655
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,400
is much better than the one you used to have.

656
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,360
How beautiful it is!

657
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,040
I've learned a lot from Lian Pian

658
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,360
and learned it from him at night.

659
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
It's much more troublesome than learning martial arts.

660
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,280
You're lucky.

661
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,760
But you knew my birthday.

662
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,480
Why did you pretend not to know

663
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,600
when I was hinting you?

664
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,480
You know that's a hint?

665
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,800
First, you gave me the name list in the editing room.

666
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,960
Then,

667
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,960
you made Bai Shi

668
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,160
pick the side-by-side

669
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,680
of Lian Pian.

670
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,720
Then,

671
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,400
you found Yan Xiao Lang, right?

672
00:28:59,440 --> 00:28:59,960
Yes.

673
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,040
You could have just said it.

674
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,640
You had to set me up.

675
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,440
I knew you liked this trick.

676
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,600
So I had to stop you.

677
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
I knew you were a genius.

678
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,200
But

679
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,440
I think you like to trick people.

680
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,520
I had to torture you.

681
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,800
It's called

682
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,480
using the way of others to control the voice of others.

683
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,480
Do you like it?

684
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:21,840
Yes.

685
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm the best.

686
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,480
But

687
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,960
I hope you can be more direct in the future.

688
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,280
Of course.

689
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,120
I've lost my memory.

690
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,600
I've lost the biggest part of my life.

691
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,240
I've lost myself.

692
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,360
So you're not satisfied?

693
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:46,960
Not satisfied.

694
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,560
Not satisfied.

695
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,240
Not satisfied.

696
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,320
Not satisfied at all.

697
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,040
Not satisfied?

698
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,760
I dare not.

699
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,200
How can I be not satisfied?

700
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,600
That's more like it.

701
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,080
Shake it up.

702
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,360
Higher.

703
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,040
Higher.

704
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,880
Higher.

705
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,440
My Lady.

706
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,040
Higher.

707
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,400
My Lady, something's wrong.

708
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,640
My Lady, something's wrong.

709
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,800
Something happened to the Yan family.

710
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,880
The Jingzhao Mansion was searched by Yan Mansion.

711
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,560
The imperial tutor and others were arrested.

712
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,240
Mr. Yan and Lian Pian have rushed there.

713
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,480
Master said

714
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,480
he would go to find someone to ask about it.

715
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:28,600
Let's go.

716
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Let's go.

717
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,440
Let's go.

718
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,880
Stop.

719
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,520
You can't enter here.

720
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,680
Yan Yan.

721
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,480
Lian Pian.

722
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,960
My Lady.

723
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,960
What happened?

724
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,800
Why was Yan Taisi arrested?

725
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,560
I don't know.

726
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,040
They stopped me here.

727
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,760
I asked them for help.

728
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,480
They told me to wait here.

729
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,680
Something happened in the house.

730
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,480
Why did they wait?

731
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,320
Yan Xiaolang.

732
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,440
My Lady.

733
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,560
Since it's related to Yan Taisi,

734
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,640
it must be a big deal.

735
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,200
They must be confused about it.

736
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,080
I'll go and ask Yan Xiaolang.

737
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,160
Song Luo Tian.

738
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,640
Song Luo Tian.

739
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,920
Explain it.

740
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,960
What happened?

741
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,640
Come on.

742
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,440
Take it.

743
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,360
What are you doing?

744
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:06,880
What are you doing?

745
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,680
What are you doing?

746
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,600
Mr. Song.

747
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
Something happened in the Taisi Mansion.

748
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,680
We need to figure it out.

749
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,640
It's not the time for you two to have a fight.

750
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
You don't have the right to say that.

751
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,360
Don't think you can just stand there

752
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
as a goddaughter.

753
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,600
You're just a maid.

754
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,200
Go and see.

755
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,120
Song Luo Tian, you...

756
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:21,880
Sang Qi.

757
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,560
Wait.

758
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,880
What happened?

759
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,560
Mr. Yan.

760
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,080
The King of Jingzhao Mansion asked us to arrest him.

761
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,040
Please don't stop us.

762
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,480
We won't delay

763
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
the arrest of the King of Jingzhao Mansion.

764
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,760
But you need to

765
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
have a reason to arrest him.

766
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,560
Mr. Song.

767
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,240
Sang Qi.

768
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:39,920
Don't worry.

769
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,760
Let him take her away.

770
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,800
I'll explain it to you later.

771
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:43,640
Go.

772
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,760
Go.

773
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,040
Lian Yan.

774
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,760
Lian Xiaolang.

775
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,360
Lian Ping.

776
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,440
Sang Qi.

777
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,000
Let's go back to the Taisi Mansion and wait for your news.

778
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,640
Okay.

779
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,640
Go.

780
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,960
Mr. Yan.

781
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:13,960
What happened?

782
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,360
Water.

783
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,840
Mr. Yan, tell us.

784
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,440
Lian Ping.

785
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,000
Let him take her away first.

786
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
It's not useful

787
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,600
to be anxious for a while.

788
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,320
Sang Qi is kind.

789
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,280
But

790
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,560
the case of Yan family happened suddenly.

791
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,120
It's not your fault.

792
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,200
How could you find out about Yan family?

793
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
It's weird.

794
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Didn't you ask me

795
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
to follow Yan Lu

796
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,920
according to the clue of the Wolf House?

797
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,520
According to our inferences,

798
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,880
the goods of the Seven Tricks

799
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,880
and the salt in the Wolf House

800
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,160
and the fragrance of Song Jiayin

801
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,920
are all linked.

802
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,400
If nothing goes wrong,

803
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,360
we can catch the evidence

804
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,520
of Song's family

805
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,400
in the Wolf House.

806
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
That's right.

807
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,360
According to our inferences,

808
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,440
there's something wrong.

809
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,360
We found a man named Ding Hao.

810
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,280
He was caught by us.

811
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,800
He's a coward.

812
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,240
He didn't wait for us to go on a trip.

813
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,760
He confessed to the Song family.

814
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,640
Then

815
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,200
we can find out about the Song family.

816
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,720
Why did he catch Yan family?

817
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,840
Listen to me.

818
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,720
I thought it was the Song family before.

819
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,360
But Ding Hao insisted

820
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,960
that Yan family forced himself

821
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
to work for Taisi Mansion.

822
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,120
He sold salt and sold the official jade.

823
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,920
And he didn't just do it.

824
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,520
He took out a whole account book.

825
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,040
Each one was written on it.

826
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,640
Wait.

827
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,040
He took out a whole account book

828
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,280
and remembered it clearly.

829
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,160
Of course.

830
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,640
The date, amount,

831
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,640
the transaction with the Shen Family,

832
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,480
and who he was with.

833
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,520
They were all written on it.

834
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,000
The one who sold salt and sold the official jade

835
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,520
didn't do it.

836
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,120
It's obvious.

837
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,320
I know that.

838
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,800
But I dare not hide it from you.

839
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,960
I have to report to the official.

840
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,640
But the official ordered

841
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,640
to arrest and seal the Taisi Mansion.

842
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,680
The entire Yan family will be investigated.

843
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
Even the Wolf House is no exception.

844
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,680
Then...

845
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,920
Yan Yan won't be beaten by Yan Xingkou, right?

846
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,920
Don't worry.

847
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,160
He's in my mansion.

848
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,880
I'll keep an eye on him.

849
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,800
He'll be fine.

850
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,040
The Song family has found out.

851
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,080
But it shouldn't be too early.

852
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,360
It seems that it's just a hasty crime.

853
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,840
It seems that the evidence is lacking.

854
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,960
It's actually a mistake.

855
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
We have to prove Yan family's innocence

856
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,960
before they make the next move.

857
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,120
What should we do now?

858
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:06,960
Mr. San.

859
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,120
Can I see Ding Hao?

860
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,600
Sure.

861
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,560
Anyway, you usually

862
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,840
help the Jingzhou Office.

863
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,400
No one will say anything if you go.

864
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,560
But...

865
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,320
We can only interrogate him now.

866
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,000
He's a prisoner who has been confessed.

867
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:19,920
He can't be executed.

868
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,200
Then he'll keep asking for Yan family's release.

869
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,560
There's no other way.

870
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,800
Mr. Qi.

871
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,280
We can only depend on your means.

872
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,160
You said that Ding Hao is timid.

873
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,520
Yes.

874
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,360
Deputy Chief.

875
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,520
Just lock me in.

876
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm dead.

877
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,120
I'll never see him again.

878
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,600
Ah!

879
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,520
Ah!

880
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,960
Ah!

881
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,520
Ah!

882
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,240
Ah!

883
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,880
Ah!

884
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,400
Ah!

885
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,000
Ah!

886
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,640
Ah!

887
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,760
After this prisoner is interrogated,

888
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,240
it's your turn.

889
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,200
Sir.

890
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,040
Please listen to me.

891
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,840
If you have anything to say,

892
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,120
just leave it for later.

893
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,440
Take him away.

894
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,040
Yes.

895
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,280
Get up.

896
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,200
Sir.

897
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,080
Please listen to me.

898
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,360
Go.

899
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:20,960
Sir.

900
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:21,840
Sir.

901
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,600
Nonsense.

902
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,440
This...

903
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,800
This...

904
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,840
Get in.

905
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,640
Wait here.

906
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,120
Sir will come to remind you.

907
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:46,920
Go.

908
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,160
You were the one interrogated.

909
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,960
Don't talk.

910
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,280
What's going on?

911
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,560
I don't want to remember it.

912
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,200
I don't want to remember it.

913
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,520
I don't dare to remember it.

914
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,520
A cruel and cruel person.

915
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't dare to think about it.

916
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,320
You don't look

917
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,040
as you were in the past.

918
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,160
Because you're passar the time,

919
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,240
why do you still remember it?

920
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,680
I've heard about it.

921
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,700
When do you

922
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
become so arrogant?

923
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,720
Do you mind

924
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
I'll put a layer of it on your face

925
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,720
and spray water on it.

926
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,720
If you don't say anything,

927
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
I'll spray water on it again

928
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
until you can't breathe.

929
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Stop! Stop!

930
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Listen to me.

931
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
It's not good for your health.

932
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
The most important thing is

933
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,720
that it has no marks at all.

934
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,720
You can't go out and say hello.

935
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,720
It's useless.

936
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,720
The third trick.

937
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
The third trick.

938
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,720
I can't stand the third trick.

939
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Is there...

940
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
Is there any law?

941
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
You're so funny.

942
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
If there's no law,

943
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
how could we be caught?

944
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Then...

945
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
Then why did you get caught?

946
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,720
You know what

947
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
Master Yan was fooled by a guy a while ago, right?

948
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,720
I was walking too close

949
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,720
to his house's master.

950
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
So I was caught.

951
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
I can't breathe at all.

952
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
I can't breathe at all.

953
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,720
I don't know.

954
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I don't know.

955
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
I don't know.

956
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
I don't know.

957
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
I don't know.

958
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,720
Hide.

959
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,720
I'm wrong.

960
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Don't protect me.

961
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
I won't do it again.

962
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
I'm not looking for you this time.

963
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
It's you.

964
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
Come on.

965
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,720
Take him out.

966
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,720
I...

967
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Let's go.

968
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm so lucky.

969
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
I must protect Xian Mei.

970
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Protect Xian Mei.

971
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,720
Sit.

972
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Sit.

973
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
Ding Hao, right?

974
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Yes.

975
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,720
I think you should know

976
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
why we met here.

977
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
I understand.

978
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,720
I...

979
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
You don't understand.

980
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Isn't it because of Si Yan?

981
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
It's not worth mentioning.

982
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
What I want

983
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
is Yan family.

984
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Yan family?

985
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
I've said everything I should.

986
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Yes, you did.

987
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
What you said

988
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
is not enough to make me punish them.

989
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
I'll give you another chance.

990
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
If you don't explain it to me,

991
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
until I can punish them,

992
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
I won't let you off today.

993
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Sir, I've done what I should do.

994
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Aren't you making it difficult for me?

995
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
Guards.

996
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Sir.

997
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
Sir.

998
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
Sir.

999
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
I want to see

1000
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
how long you can hide it from Yan family.

1001
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Sir.

1002
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
Sir.

1003
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
I'll confess.

1004
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Sir, I'll confess.

1005
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
I'll confess everything I know.

1006
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Can't I confess?

1007
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,720
Sir.

1008
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Sir, I know I'll confess.

1009
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
Then, let's start

1010
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
from Yan family's account book.

1011
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Okay.

1012
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,720
Yan family's account book.

1013
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,720
I'm the one who insisted on love.

1014
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,720
We fell in love with each other.

1015
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
I'm the one who has this vision.

1016
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
If I'm the one who's been thinking about it for ten years,

1017
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,720
it becomes my quality.

1018
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
My quality.

1019
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I can't be the one to hold it back.

1020
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
I'm the one who's been thinking about it for ten years,

1021
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
it becomes my quality.

1022
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,720
I'm the one who's been thinking about it for ten years,

1023
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
it becomes my quality.

1024
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
It's like I'm being rejected.

1025
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
It's like I'm being rejected.

1026
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
My heart is in a small town.

1027
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
It's like I'm being rejected.

1028
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,720
So now I've changed it.

1029
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
A weirdest look had happened.

1030
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
I wrote down the AC,

1031
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
to put B,

1032
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
ensuite I picked up,

1033
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
life was too short or too faster.

1034
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
Life of love is like this.

1035
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,720
I've written down informations of love.

1036
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
I've broken the alias,

1037
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,720
framing life into history.

1038
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Using ice as shining.
