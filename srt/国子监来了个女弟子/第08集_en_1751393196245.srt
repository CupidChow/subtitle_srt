00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Episode 16

2
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,120
Are you tired after working so long?

3
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
I didn't expect that Miss Sang Qi

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,640
would give me such a good evaluation.

5
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,880
It seems that

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,120
I have earned

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,400
the official recognition.

8
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,600
But what if

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Miss Sang Qi

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
knew the big secret

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,160
that Mr. Zhuo kept from us

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
and she was always

13
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
with us?

14
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,680
She wouldn't be like today

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
and tell Mr. Zhuo the truth, right?

16
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,120
You don't have to scare me.

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
I've done everything

18
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
you arranged.

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I never failed.

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,400
If you are still not satisfied,

21
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,880
you can find another leader

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,360
and don't waste our time.

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,000
Why is Mr. Zhuo so arrogant these days?

24
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,440
You are not like this to me in the past.

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,280
You were the most

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,840
patient in the past.

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,320
You used to be the most

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,120
straightforward and honest.

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,840
But now,

30
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,720
you are also

31
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,560
strange and strange.

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,120
Actually, I know

33
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,640
that you were in the villa

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,880
and ambushed the person who tried to assassinate Sang Qi.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,960
If the plan fails,

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,240
you will hide your identity

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,920
and Sang Qi will trust you more.

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,320
I gave you freedom.

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,480
But the only thing you can't do

40
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,240
is to hurt Sang Qi.

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,600
I had to do so many things for her.

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,000
That Yan Yun Zhi

43
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,400
is still suspecting me.

44
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,080
She knows so much.

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
We have to be careful.

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,520
We should be careful.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,800
I see.

48
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,920
There is a problem with the route to the south.

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,640
We can't get in.

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,000
We are being watched by the people in the house.

51
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,120
Did the Noble Consort Zhuo

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,600
not take it seriously?

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,680
We have more and more books to guess.

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
We are getting more and more

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,840
information about the route to the south.

56
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,560
It's time to take a break.

57
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,920
I am also contacting Lu Lu

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,920
to see if we can connect some local merchants

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
and get more information.

60
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,520
Local merchants?

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,280
Is it reliable?

62
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,400
The world is full of new and new.

63
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
As long as you are willing to share with others,

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,680
someone will come.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Okay.

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,040
The route to the south is the foundation of Zhuo's family's growth.

67
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,680
You know more than I do.

68
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
Since you said it's okay,

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,600
it must be okay.

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,520
Please arrange the trip as soon as possible

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
to settle this matter.

72
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,760
I...

73
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,160
I will send my family letter to handle it.

74
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
Because these days,

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,480
I can't leave the border.

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,120
What else can you do?

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,480
It's the girl from the Grand Commandant's Mansion.

78
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,280
My men saw Yan Yun Zhi

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,280
sending people to protect her secretly.

80
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
She is just a gold.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,720
She can't understand the love between men and women.

82
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
If I don't watch her,

83
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm afraid things will change.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,600
Seeing such a good and bad man,

85
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
I'm not used to it.

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,680
I'm also concerned about the overall situation.

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,360
The Third Prince's family will cooperate with us in the future.

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,640
If they want to cooperate with us,

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
it's part of the plan.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
Mr. Zhuo,

91
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
you don't have to say

92
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,880
these ridiculous things to me.

93
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
Don't forget

94
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,760
your promise to Xi Zhao.

95
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,360
This way.

96
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Your guest is here.

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,520
Greetings, Deputy Chief Yan.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,560
Mr. Zhuo has an appointment today.

99
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
Mr. Zhuo?

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,640
Why is Deputy Chief Yan here?

101
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,120
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

102
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,320
Since you're all here,

103
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,200
let's have a drink together.

104
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,840
Okay.

105
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,640
Let's go.

106
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,960
Please

107
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,240
play your zither

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,200
for us.

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,600
I'll go get the pipa right away.

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll make sure you two have a good time today.

111
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,360
Three years later

112
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,960
Your Highness,

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,480
there's a wedding!

114
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,920
There's a wedding!

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,040
There's a wedding!

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,520
Your Highness,

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,040
there's a wedding!

118
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,680
Yan Yan,

119
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,560
can you not always

120
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
get yourself in trouble?

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What if my father

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
hears that you're marrying a woman?

123
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,840
What kind of music and status is that?

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How could he?

125
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,440
Tell me. What do you want?

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,920
I've found the old man in white.

127
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,240
I heard he's a good man.

128
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,360
He's low-key,

129
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,440
but he's well-groomed.

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,360
He's a newlywed.

131
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,520
He's a newlywed.

132
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm...

133
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,600
Yuan Yan.

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
I thought you were a smart guy

135
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,760
who's been married for a long time.

136
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,800
That's why he's in touch with you and Qi.

137
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,520
You bastard.

138
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,360
You arranged the six-brother-old man for him.

139
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,000
Are you arranging a brother for me

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
or a son-in-law?

141
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,360
Dad, you're mistaken.

142
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,480
He's looking for my savior.

143
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
Not that stupid.

144
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,800
Right.

145
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,360
Not that stupid.

146
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,720
You're a good boy.

147
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,920
You can even find a benefactor.

148
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,800
You're a fatherless son.

149
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,800
Go and tell the bank

150
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,520
to prepare more gifts.

151
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,880
You must satisfy the benefactor.

152
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,960
Do you have a budget?

153
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,160
No. It's up to you.

154
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
I knew it.

155
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,240
Dad adores me the most.

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,240
We should be here soon.

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,180
Take care of yourself,

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,520
don't terrain.

159
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,460
Be patient.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,640
cloud

161
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,380
clouds

162
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,840
sun

163
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
day

164
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
and night

165
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,160
clear

166
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,960
conducted

167
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,500
Clear

168
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
These and here's gone.

169
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,720
Here's蜂不会

170
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,560
All for me.

171
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,360
You're amazing.

172
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,120
Right here.

173
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,680
No, Yanyan.

174
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,400
Don't you think it's a bit strange?

175
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,080
Look.

176
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,840
From Bianjing to Linwu Peak,

177
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
the most convenient and the fastest way

178
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,480
is clearly drawn.

179
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,760
Even this little house is marked clearly.

180
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm afraid we can't find it.

181
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,320
Do you think a master of film history

182
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,720
will be so bright and bright in film history?

183
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,600
I didn't think about that.

184
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,760
I haven't had time to ask you.

185
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,680
Where did you get the map?

186
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,600
I went to the Qingfeng Restaurant.

187
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,720
Qingfeng Restaurant?

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,480
Qianjiu gave it to me.

189
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,320
No.

190
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,480
There was a young man who was on the same boat with me.

191
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,720
He said he knew it too.

192
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,160
So he gave me this map.

193
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I'm afraid that

194
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,520
the person waiting for us inside

195
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,640
is not the old man in white.

196
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,000
There's someone else in the forest.

197
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,480
Wait here.

198
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,560
Wait here.

199
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,800
Let's go find out the way.

200
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,040
Let's go.

201
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,840
I'm Sang Qi.

202
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,200
Please come to disturb me.

203
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm looking for the old man in white.

204
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,240
All the visitors are guests.

205
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,800
Come in.

206
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,280
Let's go.

207
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,080
Look.

208
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,520
This is the old man in white I mentioned.

209
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,240
You have to say it's my imagination.

210
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,200
I don't have any imagination, right?

211
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,000
This is not a person who is as thin as a body.

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
I want a living person to sit here.

213
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,600
If you don't know how to use idioms, don't use them.

214
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,120
What do you mean by thin as a body?

215
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,920
Be careful that they don't take you in.

216
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,400
Deputy Chief.

217
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,600
Deputy Chief.

218
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,880
Deputy Chief.

219
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,920
Isn't it already the holiday?

220
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Can't you leave a way for the students to survive?

221
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,200
Why are you here again?

222
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,160
Me?

223
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm here to show my filial piety.

224
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
I'm here to see the elders.

225
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,280
By the way,

226
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,600
I haven't introduced you yet.

227
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,520
This is my second uncle,

228
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,720
Yan He Xing.

229
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,400
Second uncle?

230
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,760
Second uncle?

231
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,920
You are relatives?

232
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,760
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

233
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,400
If you had told us earlier, wouldn't it have been more convenient?

234
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,160
That's right.

235
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,640
It's weird that you asked that.

236
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,800
You didn't ask at that time.

237
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,960
You didn't ask at that time either.

238
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,640
I didn't ask.

239
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,560
Think about it.

240
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,800
When you were at Qingfeng Restaurant,

241
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,480
you asked for the news and you got it here.

242
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
Didn't you think about

243
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,600
asking the person who really has a way?

244
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,040
The person who really has a way?

245
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,000
Who is so great?

246
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,280
It's the one who is close to the sky.

247
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes.

248
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,360
The one who is the greatest in the Imperial College.

249
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Dr. Feng.

250
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,960
At that time, I had already decided to help you.

251
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
You didn't owe me anything.

252
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,840
I didn't do it because...

253
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,480
Buying food is more important.

254
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,680
Yes.

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
I'll settle it for you later.

256
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,400
Second uncle.

257
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,840
Since you are relatives with Deputy Chief,

258
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,680
it's more convenient to give your family a treat.

259
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,520
Please take care of your disciple...

260
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,200
No.

261
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,360
Please take care of your grandson.

262
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
Grandson...

263
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,360
I don't understand.

264
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,200
Anyway, it's not important to be a criminal.

265
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
What's important is that you can take us two.

266
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,680
Anyway, we came here

267
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,720
to learn martial arts from you.

268
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,440
Not bad.

269
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,880
You have some skills.

270
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,400
You are not a person who can wait for death.

271
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,080
But I don't like to take back my disciple.

272
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,840
I take medicine and teach him.

273
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
When things get complicated,

274
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,280
he becomes a troublemaker.

275
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,320
What's wrong with having the time to do something?

276
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,360
You are talking nonsense again.

277
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,560
I am your disciple.

278
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,600
Why don't you take back your disciple?

279
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:00,840
Look.

280
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,720
If you keep nagging,

281
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,760
I'll beat you out.

282
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
It's not like you can say anything

283
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,040
you want.

284
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,320
Second uncle.

285
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,040
Actually, you don't have to be so anxious to make a conclusion.

286
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,440
I...

287
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
I am different from Yan Yan.

288
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,560
I am a low-key person.

289
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,640
I am hardworking.

290
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,280
I don't have any talent.

291
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,160
I am poor.

292
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,640
I can't be of any help.

293
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,160
In the future, there will be no achievements in the martial arts world.

294
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,080
You don't have to worry about your success.

295
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,640
Besides, it suits your position

296
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,200
as a high-ranking person.

297
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:31,800
Right?

298
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,760
Really?

299
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,560
You two...

300
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,880
One is the daughter of the Grand Commandant's Manor.

301
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,720
She grew up in the border.

302
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,560
She is the first female disciple of the Grand Commandant's Manor.

303
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,560
The other is the legitimate son of the Grand Master.

304
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,360
She is also the famous playboy of Bianjing.

305
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,640
You two are fooling around here.

306
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,600
Xian Zhi.

307
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,080
You can take care of your own students.

308
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,960
You can stay here for a few days.

309
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,080
Take back your disciple.

310
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,120
No need to talk.

311
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,320
How did he know?

312
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,520
I don't know.

313
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,240
He is a master.

314
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,280
Isn't it for the girl from the Sang family?

315
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,680
You know her?

316
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,880
Of course I know.

317
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,080
She is the daughter of the Grand Commandant's Manor's daughter.

318
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,840
She is the first female disciple of the Grand Commandant's Manor.

319
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,680
Speaking of which,

320
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,000
I have a good relationship with her.

321
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
Last time, I even saved her once.

322
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,840
Right.

323
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,720
It's because you saved her last time.

324
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,120
She is determined to learn martial arts from you.

325
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,000
No.

326
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
Forget about the master.

327
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,880
I just want to have a quiet life.

328
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,520
Now the daughter of the Grand Commandant's Manor is here.

329
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,400
She will make a scene and kill me.

330
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,960
Luckily, I am quiet here.

331
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
And it's a little bit hidden.

332
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,440
You can help me to block her.

333
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,040
She won't find you even if she is quiet.

334
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,520
I have already spread your position.

335
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,280
What do you mean spread?

336
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,480
What do you mean?

337
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,400
It must be you.

338
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,520
You just told her.

339
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,360
No.

340
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,880
Then it means I am helping her.

341
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
Aren't you helping her now?

342
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,240
I just revealed your position.

343
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
It doesn't count as helping her.

344
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,080
Besides, even if she is really on the mountain,

345
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,360
whether she will accept it or not

346
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
is up to you.

347
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
Of course I won't accept it.

348
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
That's good.

349
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Sang Qi, my private career is enough.

350
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,720
I don't want her to have another teacher.

351
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,800
You sound weird.

352
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,560
But you can refuse to accept the disciple.

353
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
But you still have to teach her martial arts.

354
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,040
According to your words,

355
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,280
after learning my martial arts,

356
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
you still can't accept me as your master.

357
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,960
You have to suffer a lot to plant a tree.

358
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,360
The fruit is mine.

359
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Why?

360
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,400
Then you can take it.

361
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Stop it.

362
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
Why do you insist on teaching her?

363
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,080
It's a long story.

364
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,920
I know.

365
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
She must have a bad temper.

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,920
I know.

367
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,920
But I think

368
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,560
you have a Sang Yu before.

369
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,320
Now you have a Sang Qi.

370
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,200
You are so shy.

371
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
You really want to plant a tree

372
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,560
and run to the death.

373
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,800
You don't have to worry about

374
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,440
which tree I plant.

375
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,960
As long as Sang Qi

376
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,120
learns martial arts from you,

377
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,200
I can protect myself.

378
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,520
You are very caring to her.

379
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,680
You are too kind.

380
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
I am?

381
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,640
Okay.

382
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,080
I am kind.

383
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,200
Okay.

384
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,680
Then I will do as you said.

385
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,240
But we have to talk about it in advance.

386
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,320
I can accept this disciple.

387
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,920
But I have to listen to me.

388
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
Of course.

389
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,920
Pour tea.

390
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
I just poured it.

391
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,720
I just sprayed it.

392
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Didn't you see it?

393
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Hurry up. Pour tea.

394
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Deputy Chief.

395
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,360
Deputy Chief.

396
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
How is it?

397
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
How is it?

398
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,080
Look.

399
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
I said

400
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,840
he doesn't want to accept you as his disciple.

401
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,320
But I tried to persuade him.

402
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,720
He finally said yes.

403
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
He said yes.

404
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,520
He said yes.

405
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,800
What do we need to do?

406
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
As long as he accepts you as his disciple,

407
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
first,

408
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,920
it depends on whether you are sincere or not.

409
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,640
Yes.

410
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,840
We will definitely succeed.

411
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,440
Yes.

412
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,360
We will definitely succeed.

413
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,640
We came up from the mountain

414
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,840
just to get wet.

415
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
You don't count.

416
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,080
He said he suddenly wanted to drink

417
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,360
the wine of his own family in the mountains.

418
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,720
If you can get him some

419
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
wine,

420
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,320
then this test is over.

421
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Wine?

422
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Let's go.

423
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,720
Actually, I think it's not that hard

424
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,720
except for being a bit tired.

425
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Yan Yan.

426
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
Deputy Chief.

427
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,320
Yan Yan, are you alright?

428
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Are you alright?

429
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
I'm fine.

430
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Deputy Chief.

431
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,120
How come you came here all of a sudden?

432
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,520
How come I'm here?

433
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
If I'm not here,

434
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
if you come across this situation,

435
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,920
can you handle it yourself?

436
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,520
I just carelessly

437
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,320
felt that I shouldn't have come here.

438
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
I felt that I shouldn't have come here.

439
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,720
I actually also had a lot of things to do.

440
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
I was thinking about what I should do.

441
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
What should I do?

442
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

443
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I didn't even know

444
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
what to do.

445
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,320
I was thinking about what I should do.

446
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,720
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

447
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,320
I didn't get a chance to talk to you.

448
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,600
I'm so sorry. Look.

449
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,360
If so,

450
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,640
I don't think we can go today.

451
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,560
Let's send him home.

452
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,600
How can we do that?

453
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,600
You've been praying for him for so long.

454
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,600
You can't listen to him.

455
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,120
This is a desert. There's no one here.

456
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,160
I'll wait for you here.

457
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,240
Go find some wine.

458
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:50,960
No.

459
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,320
How can we leave you here alone?

460
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,120
Besides,

461
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,160
there might be a beast

462
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,320
because this is a desert.

463
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,240
With your leg,

464
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,560
you can't run away.

465
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,680
Miss,

466
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,320
I'll stay here with Mr. Yan.

467
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:01,880
Anyway,

468
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,800
I'll let you know

469
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,840
if anything happens.

470
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,800
It's not far from here.

471
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,280
You and Mr. Yan can go there first.

472
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,080
Yes.

473
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,320
Lian Pian will take care of us.

474
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,000
It's okay.

475
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,920
You can go.

476
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,520
Okay.

477
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,920
We'll be back soon.

478
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,960
Take care of Yan Yan.

479
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,400
Okay.

480
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Take care of Lian Pian.

481
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,480
Let's go.

482
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,720
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

483
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,240
Be careful.

484
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,240
Are you hungry?

485
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,040
A little.

486
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,320
You're still eating

487
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
when you're on the mountain.

488
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,200
I'm not ready to fight.

489
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm prepared.

490
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,320
Who knows what I'll meet when I'm out?

491
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,960
Besides,

492
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,160
if I don't plan it early

493
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,400
and make my lady suffer,

494
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,080
I'll make a big mistake.

495
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,520
If I didn't see you get hurt,

496
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,920
I wouldn't have stopped you.

497
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,560
Here, have a bite.

498
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,560
Okay.

499
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,520
I thought you were a

500
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,760
sharp-tongued girl.

501
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,240
I didn't expect to make you think so simple.

502
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,920
Of course.

503
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,800
When my lady and I were in the border,

504
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,080
we went through a lot.

505
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,080
I

506
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,120
couldn't control my mouth.

507
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
I couldn't control it.

508
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,240
I couldn't do anything else.

509
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,360
You're funny.

510
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,760
Stop.

511
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,800
Follow me.

512
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,840
Hurry up.

513
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,240
What's there to be afraid of?

514
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm not afraid.

515
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,000
What's there to be afraid of?

516
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,000
Wine.

517
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm not afraid.

518
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm not afraid.

519
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
I'm not afraid.

520
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,240
Second Uncle.

521
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,800
You're teasing me again.

522
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,440
Sister, don't be afraid.

523
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,360
Listen to my command.

524
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,920
Take two steps forward.

525
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,920
Can I go back now?

526
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
No.

527
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,120
Go.

528
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,320
Go.

529
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,320
Go.

530
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,320
Go.

531
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,960
Go. Go. Go.

532
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,480
Hands up.

533
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,080
Hands up.

534
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,760
Hands up.

535
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,840
Go. Go. Go. Go.

536
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,120
Mission accomplished.

537
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,720
Go.

538
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,280
Go.

539
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,520
Go.

540
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,920
Second Uncle.

541
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,120
I have something to ask you.

542
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,000
You're back so fast.

543
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
All the way...

544
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,520
Xianzhi.

545
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,720
I suddenly remember that I have something to tell you.

546
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,320
Go. Go. Go.

547
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,280
Go inside. Go inside.

548
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,320
Go. Go. Go.

549
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,680
Go.

550
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,480
Go.

551
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,920
Go. Go. Go.

552
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,440
Hurry up.

553
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,160
Go inside.

554
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,280
Go. Go. Go.

555
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,360
Second Uncle.

556
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,440
I have something to ask you.

557
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,080
Are you targeting me

558
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,040
with the goose feathers in your room?

559
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Well...

560
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,240
You know that

561
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,400
I'm a little young

562
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,160
after I'm old.

563
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Your students

564
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,760
are disturbing my peace

565
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,960
and forcing me to collect the pictures.

566
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,720
I should make you happy.

567
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,560
I can't sleep well at night.

568
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,880
I always think about it.

569
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,720
Who forced you to collect the pictures?

570
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,800
What?

571
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,440
It's a soft knife, not a knife.

572
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,720
All right. All right.

573
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,640
You were just scared by the goose feathers.

574
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
You were scared.

575
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,480
I lost the peace on the mountain.

576
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,120
There are also

577
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,920
the pictures of my 30-year-old daughter.

578
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,080
I'll drink more for you.

579
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,280
It's my compensation.

580
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,240
I got it.

581
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,000
Now we can talk about

582
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,480
the matter of collecting the pictures.

583
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,680
All right.

584
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,520
After all, he is my nephew's student.

585
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,760
I'll break the rule once.

586
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Don't worry. Don't worry.

587
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,560
I can collect the pictures,

588
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,840
but...

589
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,000
Xian Chen.

590
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,960
Go out for a while.

591
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,800
Hurry up. Go out.

592
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,960
I'm not going out.

593
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,320
I'm old.

594
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,520
I have limited energy.

595
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,240
I can only take one of you as my student.

596
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,080
One?

597
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
It's not appropriate.

598
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,600
We went up the mountain together.

599
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,080
Now you say you only take one person.

600
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,400
It's not appropriate.

601
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,400
Yes.

602
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,040
We are like brothers in the Imperial College.

603
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,640
That's a life-and-death relationship.

604
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,600
That's right.

605
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,080
You said you only take one person.

606
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,280
Is it too cruel?

607
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,720
I said I only take one person as my student.

608
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
I didn't say let the other person go.

609
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
If you want to stay,

610
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,960
you can stay here as a stranger.

611
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,120
It's not not okay.

612
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,080
A stranger?

613
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,280
A stranger is just an excuse.

614
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,640
I can't let you be a servant.

615
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,800
But someone has to do the work.

616
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,640
Of course.

617
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,440
I won't do it for nothing.

618
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,160
Although I only take one person as my student,

619
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,680
if the other person is done with his work,

620
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,920
he can come to practice with me.

621
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,280
I can't just give him a few points.

622
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,280
Okay.

623
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,480
It's a deal?

624
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,400
It's a deal.

625
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,520
Okay.

626
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,000
I'll give you a question.

627
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
It's a test.

628
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,600
Whoever finishes it first,

629
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,400
I'll take the picture first.

630
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,920
Say it.

631
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,320
It's not a problem.

632
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,840
I want Yan Yun Zhi's Chinese medicine.

633
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,360
You two go get it for me.

634
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,360
Chinese medicine?

635
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,480
It's not a problem.

636
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,600
I'm a girl.

637
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,080
How can I get his Chinese medicine?

638
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,880
If you don't want to, just admit defeat.

639
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,720
It's not fair.

640
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,480
I can.

641
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,760
I can, too.

642
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,960
I know you have to teach me Chinese medicine.

643
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:59,560
Green herb is fighting qi of why

644
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,440
Hello.

645
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,080
Come again?

646
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,080
Yes.

647
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,000
And?

648
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,200
And I have to get it first.

649
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,120
Hello?

650
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,760
Can you spare some money?

651
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,960
will you help me?

652
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,080
Of course.

653
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,840
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

654
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,320
Deputy Chief, I'll fill your glass.

655
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,720
Sang Qi, what are you thinking?

656
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,480
You're careless.

657
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,960
Drink it.

658
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,600
I'm sorry.

659
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,120
Deputy Chief.

660
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,120
Sang Qi, you...

661
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,880
Deputy Chief, I'm sorry. I was careless.

662
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,880
Deputy Chief, why don't you take a shower?

663
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,800
I'll heat up the water for you.

664
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,000
Go.

665
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,520
Okay.

666
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,520
I'll go.

667
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,360
What a good trick.

668
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,200
She's so weak.

669
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,400
How can I beat her?

670
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,400
Deputy Chief.

671
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,760
Deputy Chief.

672
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,160
I've prepared the toilet.

673
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,360
You can wash it.

674
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,080
By the way,

675
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,040
you can throw the dirty clothes outside.

676
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,480
I'll wash it for you later.

677
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,000
No need.

678
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
I made it dirty for you.

679
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,040
Of course I should be responsible for it.

680
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,120
Okay.

681
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,400
Okay.

682
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,000
You're a girl.

683
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,000
It's not suitable for you to be here.

684
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,760
It's not suitable.

685
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,840
I'll go out.

686
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,720
Take your time.

687
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,400
Go.

688
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,960
Get out.

689
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:07,920
No.

690
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,800
I can explain it to you the next time.

691
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,120
I told you to get out.

692
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,280
Why don't you

693
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,680
give me the mid-air coat?

694
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,480
Get out.

695
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,200
Get out.

696
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,200
Why is there a ladder?

697
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,560
Give me the dress.

698
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,480
So Yan He Xing asked you to take my mid-air coat.

699
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,600
You deliberately put the food on me

700
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,680
and forced me to take a bath.

701
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,800
You think you're smart, right?

702
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,480
Yes.

703
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,400
Don't you think

704
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,120
there's something wrong?

705
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,200
I shouldn't have

706
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,120
broke into Deputy Chief's bath.

707
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,880
Deputy Chief's teaching is right.

708
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,720
Yes.

709
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,560
But I'm not talking about this.

710
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,640
You've been entangled here with me for so long.

711
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,520
Why didn't Yan Xiao Lang see the shadow?

712
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
He thought he was Ji Wu Shuang.

713
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,360
In fact, he had been captured by someone.

714
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,200
Go look.

715
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,120
A-qi.

716
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,040
Sang Qi, you're back.

717
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:41,520
original Yan

718
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:56,280
So this special

719
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:05,840
Follow the team

720
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,720
male

721
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,560
Hey!

722
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,800
Yan Yan.

723
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,000
After I go down the mountain,

724
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,120
I'll definitely teach you a good lesson.

725
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,480
My master gave me this.

726
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,080
Master?

727
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,840
You're calling me master again?

728
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,120
Master,

729
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,920
you must protect your disciple.

730
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,800
This three-part chess is very bad.

731
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,800
How dare you scold me?

732
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,520
I...

733
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,400
What are you doing?

734
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,480
Come here.

735
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,680
Come here.

736
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,920
Master, save me.

737
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Yan Yan is my disciple.

738
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,960
You can't bully him on the mountain.

739
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,000
You can either be a scoundrel or leave.

740
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:21,960
It's up to you.

741
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,720
If the past is the past,

742
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,720
it will become my past.

743
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,440
My past.

744
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,280
I can't let it go.

745
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,720
It's a perfect story.

746
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,560
It's the way I am in the wind.

747
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,160
My heart is in the city of unknown.

748
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Changed the beginning.

749
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,760
I lost the person I love.

750
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,400
I wrote the words of happiness.

751
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,600
I also wrote the poem of my life.

752
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,280
The future is always bright.

753
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:51,200
It's melted into a deep kiss.

754
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,280
The future is always bright.

755
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,880
It's melted into a deep kiss.
