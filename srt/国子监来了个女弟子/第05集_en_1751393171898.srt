1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
and have a lookdt the jumpsael

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,660
It is not knew that scenes are happening like

3
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:03,900
they have been mistaken

4
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,500
life before

5
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,900
Day after tomorrow

6
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:12,380
Light turns into a spring breeze

7
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,860
How Qinะ Heerek he is

8
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,580
a long-lived person

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:56,520
أو

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,480
Don't worry too much today.

11
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
As long as I finish it,

12
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,680
I'll be loyal to you.

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,000
With your words,

14
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,840
I'll do my best.

15
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Good!

16
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,440
Good!

17
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
Good!

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,000
Good!

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Good!

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Good!

21
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,400
Good!

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,240
Good!

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,000
Good!

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Good!

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,600
Good!

26
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,920
Why isn't the Qilang following us?

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,160
Madam,

28
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
the young master went to pick up Miss Su.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,680
Dr. Sang,

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,400
Dr. Song,

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,520
Madam Yan.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,560
Come,

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
have a seat.

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,920
Where is Miss Sang?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,360
Is Miss Sang afraid?

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
Sang Qi and I have known each other since childhood.

37
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,360
We never get scared when we go to the mountains or the sea.

38
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,880
Good!

39
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,000
Good!

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,880
Good!

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,840
Good!

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680
Believe me,

43
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
there will be a good show tonight.

44
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
Miss Sang is changing clothes on the backstage.

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
You can go.

46
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,440
Good!

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,360
Good!

48
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Good!

49
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,160
Good!

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,200
Good!

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,080
Good!

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,760
Good!

53
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,200
Good!

54
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,440
Good!

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,360
Good!

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,280
So pretty!

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,040
So pretty!

58
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,600
So pretty!

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,240
Jin Mo,

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
take them to the backstage.

61
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Good!

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,240
Good!

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,920
Good!

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,960
Good!

65
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Good!

66
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,200
Good!

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
Good!

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Good!

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,160
Good!

70
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,760
Miss,

71
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,200
did you see Deputy Chief today?

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,760
No.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
I think Yan Yun Zhi

74
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,760
is trying to make fun of me.

75
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
I know what he is doing.

76
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,240
You almost didn't recognize me, Sang Qi.

77
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,040
You are quite suitable for this style.

78
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,600
Tonight,

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
you will be able to change your clothes.

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,600
I think you shouldn't go to

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
Guozi School to study.

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
I think Gou Lan is more suitable for you.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
So pretty!

84
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
So pretty!

85
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Isn't this Miss Song?

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,720
It seems that she wants to be on the same stage with me.

87
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
But she is too shy

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,400
to say it out loud, right?

89
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
What are you talking about?

90
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,520
Who wants to be on the same stage with you?

91
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,960
Since she wants to be on the same stage with me,

92
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,880
I have to dress her up, right?

93
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Let me dress you up.

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
What are you doing?

95
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,800
I...

96
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
Let go of me!

97
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Where did you go?

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,400
Zhuo Wen Yuan, what are you doing?

99
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Isn't this Miss Song?

100
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
What a rude person!

101
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,600
You got the wrong person.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
I thought it was the songwriter I was looking for.

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
But what Miss Song

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,600
is trying to do today is...

105
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Zhuo Wen Yuan, what are you pretending?

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
You just want to help Sang Qi, right?

107
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,000
What songwriter are you talking about?

108
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Miss Song, don't believe it.

109
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Miss Song, don't believe it.

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,400
If Miss Song doesn't believe it,

111
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
I'll show you.

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Mr. Zhuo, it's about to start.

113
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Please sit down.

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Miss Song,

115
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
you believe it now, right?

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,400
How embarrassing!

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,200
Get off me!

118
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Song Jiayi,

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll wait for you to be on the same stage.

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,000
Zhuo Wen Yuan, you're so good.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,200
Look at you, you're so angry.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,200
Deputy Chief is willing to let you out.

123
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I can't bear to leave you.

124
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,200
I also specially invited an escort for you.

125
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Who is this?

126
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
This is Miss Qian Jiu.

127
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
She's the senior manager of the Bianjing Department of Health and Welfare.

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,000
I specially arranged her to cooperate with your performance.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Later,

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
you just need to do some performance on the stage.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No one else can see it.

132
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Wait, no, no.

133
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
I appreciate your kindness.

134
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
But I, Sang Jia, can't afford to lose her.

135
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Miss Qian Jiu is a top pianist.

136
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,600
How can she be used in such a routine play?

137
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
No, no.

138
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,600
Listen to me.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll count it.

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Yesterday, I practiced the piano for a whole night at home.

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,200
I didn't close my eyes for a whole night.

142
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,200
Right.

143
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I can handle this kind of situation.

144
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
But you have to keep your ears closed.

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
Lian Pian, let's go.

146
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Good.

147
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Good.

148
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Good.

149
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Good.

150
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Good.

151
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Good.

152
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm Sang Qi, the daughter of the Grand Commandant.

153
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
I'm from Bianjing.

154
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I heard that every year,

155
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
the Spring Festival is started with a song called Puo Zhen Zi.

156
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Today, I'll play the piano and help the people.

157
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
I wish the court a smooth and smooth life.

158
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
The country is prosperous and the people are at peace.

159
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Good.

160
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Good.

161
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
Good.

162
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Good.

163
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
Good.

164
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
Good.

165
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Good.

166
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Hey, hey.

167
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Can you do it?

168
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
If not, we'll win.

169
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
Yes.

170
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
I'm better than him.

171
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
What are you talking about?

172
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Young Master.

173
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
It should be like this.

174
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
It's like this.

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I think he's playing the piano.

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Young Master,

177
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
you really don't plan to help him?

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
He has to go through this.

179
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
What can I do?

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
It's really hard.

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Stop playing.

182
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Stop playing.

183
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Stop playing.

184
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Stop playing.

185
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Stop playing.

186
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
I can't believe it.

187
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
It's really expensive.

188
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
It's a new instrument.

189
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
What's the matter?

190
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
What's the matter?

191
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Where are you going?

192
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Really?

193
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
It's really hard.

194
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Really?

195
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Can Sang Qi do it?

196
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
If he can do it,

197
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
I have no fun.

198
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
You're a good person.

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
If you lose, you lose.

200
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
What?

201
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Yan Xiaolang's friend

202
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
can't afford to lose.

203
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
So what if I lose?

204
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Everyone knows that

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Sang Qi can't win this bet.

206
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I heard Yan'er say that

207
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
your girl is good at martial arts.

208
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I didn't expect that she can play music.

209
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
Grand Commandant Sang has a daughter

210
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
who is good at both martial arts and martial arts.

211
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Can you do it?

213
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
If you can't, go down first.

214
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Go down.

215
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Go down.

216
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
Go down.

217
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
What's wrong with you?

218
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Go down.

219
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Go down.

220
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
What's wrong with you?

221
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Go down.

222
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Go down.

223
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Go down.

224
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Go down.

225
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Go down.

226
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Go down.

227
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
What are you doing?

228
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
I'm very sad.

229
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
What are you doing?

230
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I'm so sad.

231
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I don't want to stop Frame Dschelze.

232
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
This is a good dance.

233
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,320
I know he's back.

234
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,480
I want to meet him.

235
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,520
Siyu!

236
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,440
That's a porpoise!

237
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,680
Now you know how to listen to it.

238
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,300
Miss Sang

239
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,920
grew up in the bianlinear around,

240
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,240
centre of musicalude can't fit into everyone's ears.

241
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,800
So she would like to play for you,

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,320
just let her sing for us.

243
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,120
Just sing the bian narratives

244
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Great!

245
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Great!

246
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Great!

247
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Great!

248
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Let's sing one.

249
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Come on.

250
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Great!

251
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
Great!

252
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Great!

253
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Great!

254
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Great!

255
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Great!

256
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
Great!

257
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Great!

258
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Great!

259
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
Great!

260
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,280
Stretching out my tears

261
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,080
I drink my journey with you

262
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,300
This land is free

263
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:37,320
It helps me to end the love's doctors and sailors

264
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Look!

265
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,280
Go.

266
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,320
Okay, okay.

267
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,960
Her singing and dance was better.

268
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,640
Among men, herabel was left unf Apparently,

269
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,720
and the death of a woman will be the end of the world.

270
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,400
Mr. Sang,

271
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,480
Yan'er and your daughter

272
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,520
are close.

273
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,840
Why don't you consider our family?

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
It's not about considering.

275
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,840
You know

276
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,960
that my mother passed away early.

277
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,520
Now,

278
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,240
it's her decision.

279
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,840
I can't control her.

280
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,200
I didn't expect

281
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,840
that you're a daughter-in-law.

282
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,520
Your daughter

283
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
is also favored by you.

284
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,080
She can't bear any grievance.

285
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,760
Look.

286
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,320
Speaking of which,

287
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,960
my daughter A'qi is on stage

288
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,160
to arrange the show.

289
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,080
It's not bad to be a daughter-in-law.

290
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,120
Don't you think so?

291
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes.

292
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,120
Bravo!

293
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Bravo!

294
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,040
Bravo!

295
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,720
Bravo!

296
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,360
Mr. Sang.

297
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,800
Bravo!

298
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,120
Mr. Sang?

299
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,440
Bravo!

300
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,120
Good!

301
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,840
Good!

302
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,120
Did you see that?

303
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,840
Deputy Chief came to save me.

304
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,440
Anxin,

305
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
don't go to ruin her good deeds.

306
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,040
What do you mean?

307
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,600
Deputy Chief is in a good mood today.

308
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,320
He came to show his gratitude

309
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,360
to his future wife.

310
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
What are you talking about?

311
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,600
What is it?

312
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,040
What is your future wife?

313
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,600
Su Jieyu,

314
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,120
the most talented woman in Bianjing.

315
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Is Miss Su special?

316
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,560
Yun Zhi,

317
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,040
who is she?

318
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,080
Yu's sister,

319
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,120
my student.

320
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,320
Such a beautiful woman.

321
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,880
She is Deputy Chief's fiancee.

322
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,680
So amazing!

323
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,720
Good!

324
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,400
Wait.

325
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,320
How dare you

326
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,360
eat for the masters?

327
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,160
Stop!

328
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:24,920
Don't move.

329
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,680
And him.

330
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,560
Move.

331
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,880
Move.

332
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,760
Move.

333
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,120
Stop.

334
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,360
Move.

335
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Move.

336
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,480
What happened?

337
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,880
Anxin.

338
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,840
No.

339
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,040
Move.

340
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,240
I'll go and have a look.

341
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,960
Be careful.

342
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,080
Move.

343
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,720
Don't run.

344
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:18,880
Hurry.

345
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,240
Deputy Chief,

346
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,880
you saved me on the stage.

347
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,280
I haven't had time to thank you.

348
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,920
You saved me this time.

349
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,520
Look at our fate.

350
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,560
Yun Zhi.

351
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,520
Yun Zhi,

352
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,120
are you hurt?

353
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm fine.

354
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,320
I'm Su Jieyu.

355
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm Su Jieyu.

356
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm Su Jieyu.

357
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,680
I'm Sang Qi.

358
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,080
It's been a while since I came to the editor's office.

359
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,040
But I've never seen a girl like Su Jieyu.

360
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,880
She looks like a fairy.

361
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,280
Miss Sang, you're overpraising.

362
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,960
Lan Ji is ordinary and unparalleled.

363
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,120
You don't deserve to praise her.

364
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,320
But on the stage,

365
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
you sang a good song.

366
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,240
Me?

367
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,480
No.

368
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,040
Well...

369
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,160
Speaking of which,

370
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,960
I've known you for a long time.

371
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
I've heard that

372
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,320
you've got a female disciple

373
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
and a daughter of the Sang family.

374
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,960
Our fate with the Sang family

375
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,920
is really not that simple.

376
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,480
We've been in a relationship

377
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,640
since we met your brother.

378
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,640
We're close.

379
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,560
You know my brother?

380
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,040
Qi.

381
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,240
Qi, are you okay?

382
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,800
My brother...

383
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,680
It's not a good place to stay.

384
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,960
Don't stay here.

385
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,600
Go back first.

386
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,960
Then, Deputy Chief, send Miss Su back first.

387
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,440
I'll take care of Anqi.

388
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,280
Don't worry.

389
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,240
Miss Sang,

390
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,920
we're in the same boat.

391
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,600
We'll meet again some other day.

392
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,720
Let's go.

393
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,280
Come on.

394
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,920
Anqi, hurry up.

395
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
The Lantern Festival is finally over.

396
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,880
Change your clothes.

397
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,800
I'll send you back.

398
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,680
Okay.

399
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,880
By the way,

400
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,040
Anqi.

401
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,680
I have a new certificate.

402
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,560
And a poison that I was sure

403
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,840
would make me sick.

404
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,600
Could you check

405
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,240
if they have the same ingredients?

406
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,320
I'll do my best

407
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,440
to do what you asked me to do.

408
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,960
Thank you.

409
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,040
You don't have to perform on stage.

410
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Why are you still looking?

411
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,120
You said that Miss Su was unusual

412
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,520
at the concert.

413
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,480
But you're so different.

414
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,640
You've been thinking about Miss Su for a long time.

415
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,440
She's the daughter of the Chancellor, Su Jieyu.

416
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,800
The Yan family and the Su family are friends.

417
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,920
When Yan Yunzhi first entered the field,

418
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,560
she was already a famous talent in Bianjing.

419
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,680
She's good at playing chess and painting.

420
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,720
Everyone in Bianjing knows

421
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,280
that Su Jieyu and Yan Yunzhi

422
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
are close friends.

423
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
I'm afraid they're going to

424
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,960
have a marriage proposal after they come back.

425
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,840
How is it?

426
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,440
No one told you about this news, right?

427
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,480
You're drunk.

428
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Su Jieyu is the best.

429
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,600
But in my heart,

430
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,560
you're the best.

431
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,280
Don't forget your uncle

432
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,360
when you're drunk.

433
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,560
What are you talking about?

434
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,040
Yan Yunzhi is drunk.

435
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,320
What a pity.

436
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,760
How can a good girl be stupid?

437
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,080
You're the stupid one.

438
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,880
In Bianjing,

439
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,280
I thought all the girls were like Song Jiayin.

440
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,920
I didn't expect

441
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,040
there was a family member like Miss Su.

442
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,880
She's a fairy.

443
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,480
It would be better if we could meet in the future.

444
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,840
Miss Su.

445
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,240
I remember we had a good time together...

446
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,320
Yu likes

447
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
this special flower.

448
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,160
That's good.

449
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:52,920
Anbaby.

450
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you still want to keep the flower?

451
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:24,900
dernier Confederate

452
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,080
Why didn't you report about the lantern?

453
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,320
Sir,

454
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,480
about the lantern,

455
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,160
I took someone to check the order of the lantern.

456
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,840
There was a thief who wanted to poison it.

457
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,280
About the Imperial College,

458
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,880
the daughter of Grand Commandant Sang, Sang Qi,

459
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
was poisoned.

460
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,320
But she didn't detect the poison when she ate it.

461
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,400
After I investigated with Yan Siyue,

462
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,800
I found the poison.

463
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,360
Today, I'm here to report to Yan Siyue.

464
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,160
Sir,

465
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,200
I've arranged the food

466
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,760
that was left in the lantern.

467
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,160
I found that the food

468
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,560
was poisoned in a cold environment.

469
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,200
After my experiment,

470
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,520
the reaction after the incense was absorbed into the food

471
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,640
was the same as the reaction of the second lady of Sang's family.

472
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,720
Recently, there have been two poisoning incidents.

473
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,960
We can't let it be exposed.

474
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,120
Yan Siyue,

475
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,080
you need to find out the truth behind it.

476
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,080
But remember,

477
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,120
be careful.

478
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,720
Don't cause panic among the people.

479
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Yes, sir.

480
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,700
The

481
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
good people finally stop playing the new game.

482
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,160
I don't have to worry about

483
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,880
giving the pouch to Yan Yunzhi anymore.

484
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm so lucky.

485
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,840
I embroidered the pouch so seriously.

486
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,320
Yan Yunzhi didn't even notice it.

487
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,600
But I won't waste

488
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,800
such a hard-working pouch.

489
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
I'll just take it as a personal item.

490
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,320
I'm going to the main street.

491
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,440
Sir.

492
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,640
It's strange.

493
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,160
Why is no one watching the store?

494
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,520
I guess they are busy.

495
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,040
But we can take a look.

496
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,360
Miss, look.

497
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,520
So many pens.

498
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,280
Are they all for writing?

499
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,240
That's not necessarily.

500
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,320
They are for painting.

501
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,240
Look at this pen.

502
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,680
It's so valuable.

503
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,480
Look.

504
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,440
Look at this.

505
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,680
Look.

506
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,920
Sir.

507
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,160
Please wait.

508
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,680
This is the best pen in our store.

509
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,600
It's light and heavy.

510
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,920
It's good for the body.

511
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,240
It's very good for the body.

512
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,280
Great.

513
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,080
Thank you for selling it to me.

514
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,080
You're welcome.

515
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,280
Miss Su's painting is very good.

516
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,000
It's my honor to use the pen in our store.

517
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,720
Wrap it up.

518
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,600
Okay.

519
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,320
Miss Sang.

520
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,200
We meet again.

521
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,120
Miss Su.

522
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,680
Miss Sang.

523
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,120
You can call me Lan Ji.

524
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,840
Yun Zhi and others call me that.

525
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,120
They?

526
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,760
Just call me Qi.

527
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,680
Qi is here to choose pens.

528
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,200
I have a few.

529
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,440
I can help you choose.

530
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Lan Ji, you're too modest.

531
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,360
No one dares to say the first

532
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,800
if you want to say the second.

533
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,800
But I'm here to buy paper today.

534
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,440
Is there any good recommendation?

535
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
Then you've found the right person.

536
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,440
Please help me get some paper I often use

537
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,040
and put them on my account.

538
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,240
No, no, no.

539
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,600
I can do it myself.

540
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,760
Just some paper.

541
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,320
And the paper I often use is not easy to ink.

542
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,960
I recommend it to you as a trial.

543
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,320
If you think it's useful,

544
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
you can write my name

545
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,920
next time you come.

546
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,920
The store owner

547
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,760
can give you some discounts.

548
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,680
Thank you, Lan Ji.

549
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,000
I was in a hurry yesterday.

550
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,480
I didn't have time to thank you.

551
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,960
I don't know if Qi has time today.

552
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,880
My brother, Qing Xuan, is having a banquet today.

553
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,560
Would you like to invite Qi to come with you?

554
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,120
Qing Xuan?

555
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,480
Qing Xuan is your brother?

556
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,360
I've heard of him.

557
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,160
He's one of the four princes of Bianjing, Qing Xuan.

558
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,240
Is it true that you want to marry him?

559
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,640
It's true.

560
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,040
I'm embarrassed.

561
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,680
What?

562
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,840
You're afaced with him right now?

563
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,960
I need to make an announcement.

564
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Look here.

565
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,320
There are many things I want to discuss with you.

566
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,520
Moreover,

567
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,960
I want to know more about my elder brother.

568
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,440
Good.

569
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,000
My brother and Yun Zhi

570
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,120
often meet together.

571
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Be careful.

572
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,120
I've never seen such a kind guest before.

573
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Jiaxiong doesn't like to make trouble.

574
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
He tried so hard to find this place

575
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
and named it Mount Jianshan Pavilion.

576
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,120
Mount Jianshan Pavilion?

577
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
There's no mountain in this courtyard.

578
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Not even a fake mountain.

579
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Oh.

580
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Lin Tian is just a cat.

581
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Don't mind him.

582
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
It's okay.

583
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,120
There's no mountain in this courtyard.

584
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,120
It's a different purpose to name it Mount Jianshan Pavilion.

585
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Please explain it to me.

586
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Miss.

587
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
It's He.

588
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
He?

589
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,120
Although there's a mountain,

590
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
it's not a mountain.

591
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
Mountains don't need to be real.

592
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
As long as it's in people's hearts,

593
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
it's a kind of

594
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
commonplace and commonplace.

595
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
This Miss Su is really a fairy.

596
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
She doesn't talk to people.

597
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
I can understand her.

598
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,120
I can't understand her even when she's with me.

599
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
Lanji.

600
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
You're worthy of being called

601
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
the most talented woman in the capital.

602
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
I learned to be a good brother.

603
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,120
This is what a monk told me

604
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
when he was traveling abroad.

605
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,120
I just recorded what he told me.

606
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Speaking of which,

607
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
I also learned from Qi's brother.

608
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
My brother?

609
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
My brother?

610
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
When Brother Yu was alive,

611
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
I learned medicine from him for a while.

612
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I didn't make much money.

613
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
It's a pity that...

614
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Qi.

615
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Let's go in quickly.

616
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Okay.

617
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Bai Shi.

618
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
Miss Sang. Miss Su.

619
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Deputy Chief is here.

620
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Lanji.

621
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
You're here.

622
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
This is...

623
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Let me guess.

624
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Yes.

625
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
Sang Qi.

626
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Why are you here?

627
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
I haven't had time to say it.

628
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Why didn't you answer?

629
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,120
I knew it at a glance.

630
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
This is the sister that Brother Yu mentioned.

631
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Look at her eyes.

632
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I'm Sang Qi from the Three Families.

633
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Greetings, Lord Xingquan.

634
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Deputy Chief.

635
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
I came with Miss Su.

636
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
Why?

637
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Only you can't let anyone else come.

638
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
I dare not talk to you like this

639
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,120
when I'm not in the Imperial College.

640
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
I saved you last night on stage.

641
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
You're still talking.

642
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
You said that

643
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,120
if you had received the pouch earlier,

644
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
you wouldn't have had to come on stage.

645
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
You shouldn't have made that bet in the beginning.

646
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
You shouldn't have drunk that wine.

647
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
What wine?

648
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
What pouch?

649
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Sang Qi.

650
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
This is...

651
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
I know.

652
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
I've seen it.

653
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
The third man of the Jingzhao family.

654
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,120
It's his fault.

655
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
The day you came to Bianjing,

656
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
you had a fight with Miss Song.

657
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
He drank it.

658
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
It was all because of him.

659
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
This is not Jingzhao.

660
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
This is not Jingzhao's mansion.

661
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
You don't need to find out the truth

662
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
like this.

663
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,120
So it's because of you, Deputy Chief.

664
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Sang Qi.

665
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
It's basically like this.

666
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
I'm going to give the pouch to Deputy Chief.

667
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,120
But Deputy Chief is not going to accept it.

668
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,120
So I was forced to come on stage to show my favor.

669
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Right?

670
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Right?

671
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
I really envy you.

672
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,120
It's great that you can fight like this.

673
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
It's a fight between two wolves.

674
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Stop talking.

675
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
Let's get in the seat

676
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
and start the banquet.

677
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Sang Qi.

678
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
This is just a friendly gathering.

679
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
There are not many gifts.

680
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
Just do as you like.

681
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
Deputy Chief.

682
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Is there something on my face?

683
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Why does he keep looking at me?

684
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
It would be great if Sang Yu was still here.

685
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,120
Nobody asked him to make Brother go to see you.

686
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
At the Jialuo Hall,

687
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
there is also a place

688
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,640
to try some science and technology

689
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
which can help you to keep an Understood mind.

690
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Sang Qi.

691
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
When you were in the Imperial College,

692
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Brother Yu was always here.

693
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,320
He will sit on your seat.

694
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,760
Well?

695
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,320
Well?

696
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,360
Sorry.

697
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,440
You always...

698
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,000
don't realize

699
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,360
how happy I am to meet you.

700
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:22,320
It's a pity.

701
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,720
I have a question for you.

702
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Go ahead.

703
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,080
I heard that my brother has a close friend

704
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
in the Imperial College.

705
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,160
His name is Xiao Bai.

706
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,120
He often writes this

707
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,600
in my letter.

708
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,160
He said that he is his best friend.

709
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,600
He is

710
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
gentle, cute,

711
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,200
sticky, obedient and sensible.

712
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,920
You are the closest friend to Yuxiong.

713
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You are also his best friend.

714
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,840
Qilang,

715
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
have you heard of Xiao Bai?

716
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,760
Never.

717
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,400
Maybe

718
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,080
your brother is just kidding with you.

719
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,560
Since you are the closest friend to my brother,

720
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,120
how can you not know about Xiao Bai?

721
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
You are so blind.

722
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
Anyway, my brother said that

723
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,760
Xiao Bai

724
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,400
is very kind to him.

725
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,880
My brother needed a sketchbook.

726
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,920
So Xiao Bai walked

727
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,520
through the streets and alleys of Bianjing

728
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,920
to find this sketchbook.

729
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,440
My brother is not well.

730
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,560
So Xiao Bai always stays

731
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,800
by his medicine fire

732
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,760
and watches the fire.

733
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,160
When they went to the mountains to learn farming,

734
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,040
Xiao Bai

735
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,800
carried my brother's medicine

736
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,960
down to the mountain.

737
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,960
When my brother was not well,

738
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,400
Xiao Bai was very anxious.

739
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,120
He needed my brother to comfort him

740
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,560
so that he could be relieved.

741
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
So there are such cute people

742
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,760
in the Imperial College.

743
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,240
It's really unprecedented.

744
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,880
I thought most of them

745
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
were nerds.

746
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,640
Yuxiong is really a broad-minded person.

747
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,200
But Xiao Bai is different from Qilang.

748
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,280
He is compatible with all of them.

749
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,320
Next time,

750
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,120
you must bring him out

751
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,840
and let us meet him.

752
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,560
Yes.

753
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,520
Deputy Chief.

754
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,560
Do you want to know this Xiao Bai?

755
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,200
From what you just described,

756
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,080
this Xiao Bai is not like a person.

757
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,600
He is like a dog.

758
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,880
You are still pretending.

759
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,720
Let's see how long you can pretend.

760
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,920
But in fact,

761
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,680
Deputy Chief is not only

762
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,160
a broad-minded person in the Imperial College.

763
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,760
It's not a big deal

764
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,760
to find a former swordsman

765
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,040
for you, right?

766
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,280
Why do you always think about

767
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,480
how to instruct your teacher

768
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,440
to do things for you?

769
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,120
I am my brother's sister.

770
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,240
The person here

771
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,480
is the closest to my brother.

772
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,240
It's you.

773
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,640
I won't look for you.

774
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,320
There is a crane behind.

775
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,200
That is...

776
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,240
That is Qingxuan Jun's wife.

777
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,040
Wife?

778
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,440
Sister-in-law.

779
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,040
Back then,

780
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,320
Qingxuan Jun's family

781
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,880
thought that Qingxuan Jun was old enough

782
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
to get married.

783
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,520
Who would have thought

784
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,200
that he would raise a crane

785
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
without saying a word?

786
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,200
It's the one behind.

787
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,920
He put on a headdress,

788
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,080
put on a wedding dress,

789
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,440
and became a gold-digger.

790
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,640
The one who was angry at the Central Secretary,

791
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,560
Lord Su Ting,

792
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,080
was Qingxuan Jun's father.

793
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,920
He was in a car accident.

794
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Two doctors

795
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,240
saved him for a long time.

796
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,240
And then?

797
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,880
The official heard about it

798
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,200
and found it very interesting.

799
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,920
So they prepared to

800
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,080
approve this marriage.

801
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,760
It's a mess.

802
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,880
Third Brother,

803
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,240
this is your fault.

804
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,600
They approved my marriage.

805
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Why is it a mess?

806
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,360
Do you have any objection

807
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,120
to my wife?

808
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,520
Don't try to

809
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,720
provoke me and Mrs. Cao.

810
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,040
Bu Gaqi,

811
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,920
why did you react so strongly just now?

812
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,880
Are you afraid that

813
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,840
the gold-digger of the Grand Commandant's Mansion

814
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,200
will be a bad thing?

815
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,760
I was afraid

816
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,160
because

817
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,840
there were no birds in the border.

818
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,440
That's why I was afraid.

819
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
Thank you, that won't happen.

820
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:03,660
Listening to the gong led by the

821
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,400
five types of books,

822
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,280
I was very worried.

823
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,520
So, I asked Xiascreaming

824
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,460
if they had got the notes.

825
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,680
That's why I brought them.

826
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:15,420
Write.

827
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,400
Where are they?

828
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,000
I hid them here.

829
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Where's mine?

830
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,440
The white cake that you like the most.

831
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,840
I've kept it in my house for a long time.

832
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,440
You can go and get it yourself.

833
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,000
Sang Qi.

834
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,760
Why don't you be my sister?

835
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,400
They say that

836
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,600
other people's family is better.

837
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,080
Sang Xia is a good girl.

838
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,120
She drinks well.

839
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,880
But

840
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,520
I can't hide my feelings.

841
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,920
I have something to tell you.

842
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,760
What is it?

843
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,640
Excuse me.

844
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,000
You entered the Imperial College of Education.

845
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,440
Is it because of Sang Yu?

846
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,880
It does have an impact on me.

847
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,000
But

848
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,480
I also have my own thoughts.

849
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,600
It's been a while since I entered the Imperial College of Education.

850
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,600
I'm starting to feel

851
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,120
that the Imperial College of Education should open up

852
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,680
the right to women's education.

853
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,240
I think you're still young.

854
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,240
Do you know

855
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,680
how much criticism this will cause?

856
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,720
Of course I know.

857
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,760
But women's education

858
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,840
is lower than men's.

859
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,240
Women can also be good at writing and writing.

860
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
It's just that there's a lack of an equal opportunity.

861
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,280
If the whole city has

862
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,200
an equal opportunity to learn,

863
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,800
then it's better

864
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,920
for the future design.

865
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,560
Take Lan Ji as an example.

866
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,600
Lan Ji is the top talent in Bianjing.

867
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,720
If Lan Ji can enter the Imperial College of Education,

868
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,200
the students in the Class of Heaven

869
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,440
are no match for her.

870
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,280
Right, Master?

871
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,680
You're in the Imperial College of Education.

872
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,160
Why do you need her as an example?

873
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,800
Deputy Chief Yan,

874
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,080
give me your opinion.

875
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,280
How did you learn

876
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,400
as a female student?

877
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,680
You have the same vision.

878
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,800
Perhaps

879
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,760
she will become your right arm in the future.

880
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,880
Judging from her look,

881
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,520
she's more likely to be better than you in the future.

882
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,640
A little Broad Encyclopedia

883
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:39,420
A cloud

884
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,760
Yun Zhi, don't you like to watch the blue chicken play the zither?

885
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,760
The zither is used to listen to music.

886
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,760
The Blue Chicken Play the zither

887
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,760
I'll take my leave.

888
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Qi, I have something to tell you.

889
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
When we came in today, we saw the crane.

890
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
But I didn't feel you scared.

891
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Maybe...

892
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
Maybe I didn't see it clearly when I came in.

893
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Qi, this time, Yun Zhi specially called me back.

894
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Maybe I'll stay for a long time.

895
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,760
We have to keep in touch.

896
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
Of course.

897
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Let's go.

898
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,760
Miss, I think Mr. Yan is very considerate of Miss Sang.

899
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
But I can't take it.

900
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
Be careful.

901
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
It seems that I'm really drunk.

902
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
You...

903
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Am I drunk?

904
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Come up.

905
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I have something to tell you.

906
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,920
Wikipedia

907
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,880
Has he

908
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,500
never raced with women before?

909
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,760
He thought no such thing.

910
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,760
You've had more.

911
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Drink this,tuber the wine.

912
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,520
This has no kinds of origin.

913
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,760
What if to me

914
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,760
you're an sinner?

915
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,760
Why would I have to another get Holmes

916
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:31,760
since I won't harm you.

917
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,740
I'll try to enhance your power technically

918
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,360
and guide you through the process.

919
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,580
Go ahead.

920
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:09,740
Today I blocked your

921
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,580
I'm drunk.

922
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,340
I'm drunk.

923
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,540
I don't remember anything.

924
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,340
But if you don't tell me the truth, I'll...

925
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,980
What will you do?

926
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,340
I'll...

927
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,180
All right.

928
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,540
Since we've made it clear,

929
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,340
I'll tell you.

930
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
I'll tell you everything.

931
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
I'll tell you everything.

932
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
I'll tell you everything.

933
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
I'll tell you everything.

934
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
I'll tell you everything.

935
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
I'll tell you everything.

936
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,540
I admit

937
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,340
I'm Xiao Bai.

938
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,340
I'll...

939
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,340
I'll call you Xiao Bai.

940
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,340
I'm right, right?

941
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:47,940
My brother said...

942
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,540
My brother said Xiao Bai is a gentle and kind person.

943
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,140
Look at you.

944
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,940
You're so dark.

945
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,940
What's your name, Xiao Bai?

946
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,340
You're called Little Black.

947
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,140
I'm not.

948
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,140
Didn't you say you wouldn't do it?

949
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:56,940
Let go of me.

950
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,740
I've been thinking about it for so long.

951
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,540
I've been thinking about it for so long.

952
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,740
Why didn't you tell me?

953
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,540
It's none of your business.

954
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,140
It's between you and your brother.

955
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:02,940
He can call me Xiao Bai.

956
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:03,540
You can't.

957
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,740
Why should I tell you?

958
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,140
I told Xiao Bai to tell me.

959
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,340
I told him not to kick me.

960
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Your brother even asked me to fabricate your story.

961
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:08,940
Let go.

962
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,540
Don't do it.

963
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,740
You're going to kick me.

964
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,340
If my brother knew

965
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,740
that you're the one who did it,

966
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,540
he would kill you.

967
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
I did it on purpose.

968
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,540
Otherwise, you...

969
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,740
I'm sorry.

970
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,940
