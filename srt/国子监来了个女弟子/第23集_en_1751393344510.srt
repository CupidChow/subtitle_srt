sound of the light, the sound of the light, the sound of the light, the sound of the light, the sound of the light,

3
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Episode 5

4
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,820
How is it

5
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,760
everything went well

6
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,720
Ding Hao's company

8
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,000
is indeed hasty.

9
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,480
Before asking a few questions,

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,880
he started to have a conflict with Zi Xiang.

11
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,680
Not only that,

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,120
apart from Yan Taishi and Yan Yan,

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
the rest of the people in Yan Mansion

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,960
don't know him.

15
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,320
They just hit him a few times.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,200
They all didn't do well.

17
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,360
Ziyan, you have to praise me.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,880
When I tried to interrogate him,

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,640
he was so scared that his face was pale.

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,080
If it weren't for me,

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,280
you wouldn't have interrogated him so smoothly,

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,840
right?

23
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,600
Yes, yes, yes.

24
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
It's all your credit.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Zeyi,

26
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
have you remembered everything?

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,560
I heard everything clearly

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
in the next room.

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,680
I remembered it clearly.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
There is a conflict before and after the trial.

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,440
I have a reason to propose to the authorities

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
to re-examine the case of the Yan family.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,200
So,

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,920
it should be fine now, right?

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
It depends on the final decision of the authorities.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,640
The result will be out in a few days.

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,760
Just wait and see.

38
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Yan Xiaolang.

39
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,480
Lian Pian.

40
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Xiaolang.

41
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,720
Lian Pian.

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
It's getting late.

43
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,840
Just tell me what you want.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,800
I'm afraid

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,360
I won't have a chance in the future.

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,160
You've suffered a lot.

47
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,320
You've gone through so much.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,400
I don't want to see you again.

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
I'm afraid you can't be with me anymore.

50
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

53
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

55
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,360
You must have suffered a lot these days.

56
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,000
What's this?

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
You can't beat me.

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,680
And I'm free.

59
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,760
I practice the same-sheet steel drum

60
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,880
my master taught me every day.

61
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,760
Look.

62
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,080
It's more self-sufficient.

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,200
All right.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Silly girl.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,320
You don't have to worry about me.

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,520
I'm upright.

67
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm not afraid of being fired.

68
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
In a few days,

69
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,840
I can go out without any worries.

70
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,920
And I've thought it through.

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,440
After I go out,

72
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,280
we won't be involved in any more trouble.

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,640
Even if my mother beats me to death,

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,080
I'll tell her clearly.

75
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,520
I'll definitely get you out of here.

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,800
Don't say that.

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,120
As long as you're safe and sound,

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,120
even if I'm not famous,

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,160
I'll be by your side.

80
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,080
Lian Pian.

81
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,720
Brother.

82
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,520
Look at them.

83
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,040
You know me and Qin Shengyi.

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,760
I'm as good as Qin Shengyi.

85
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,120
Give them more time.

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,040
Move.

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Move.

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,280
Let go.

89
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,760
Give me more time.

90
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,280
Lian Pian.

91
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,800
Brother.

92
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,800
Brother.

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,600
Brother.

94
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,560
Brother.

95
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,280
Let go.

96
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,920
Let go.

97
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
I thought you came to pick her up.

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,080
Yes.

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,640
If you have anything to say, say it at home.

100
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,600
Don't wait for me to get off work.

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,240
I'll say it when I get home.

102
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,400
You're such a good actress.

103
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,840
You can go home and watch a play.

104
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's go.

105
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,840
Hurry up.

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,440
Go.

107
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,040
Come.

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,960
Thank you for your help.

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,640
Thank you.

110
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,160
It's okay.

111
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,520
If my mother saw this,

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,960
she would cry.

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,200
I subject立法官

114
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:54,800
Sis BIGO wants to

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
make a man

116
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,800
like Chen Ye in heaven.

117
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
facing the disadvantage

118
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,760
of sad history.

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,480
You,

120
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,400
you...

121
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,960
Dismiss!

122
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
I'm making a man

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,880
annoying and careless

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,720
to

125
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,840
live with.

126
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
I've been trying to

127
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,560
persuade me to take the devotion

128
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I've always wanted

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,480
Even if I go back,

130
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,320
I can't interfere in this case anymore.

131
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,960
Of course,

132
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,680
I can still use my relationship

133
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,640
to investigate further.

134
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
I've been a good actor for so many years.

135
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,760
Seeing you still have this shot,

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,760
I feel much more assured.

137
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,480
Anyway, our family

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,880
won't participate in such dirty things.

139
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,520
If we want to investigate,

140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
we must investigate it clearly.

141
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,960
Right.

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,280
And we must hurry up.

143
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,880
In case the Song family does something cruel again,

144
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,440
we must be careful.

145
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,280
Come back to our mansion with us first.

146
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,640
Forget it.

147
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
I won't go back.

148
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm going back to your house

149
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,840
to cause trouble for your family.

150
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,920
It makes me feel like I'm a debtor.

151
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Well...

152
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,680
I know you don't dislike me.

153
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,480
But I can't stand it either.

154
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,760
Besides,

155
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,160
this is Yan Mansion.

156
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
Someone has to be there to support us.

157
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,920
My Lady.

158
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,560
Can I stay and stay with Yan Xiaolang?

159
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,520
Look at this mess.

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,320
He can't take care of himself.

161
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
If you're willing,

162
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,280
it's better not to live.

163
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,240
Let's clean up.

164
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,320
No, we can't live here.

165
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,320
I can't leave here by myself.

166
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,800
NI machen 2020

167
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,180
A Qi.

168
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,620
Fell asleep?

169
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,020
Si Yan.

170
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,520
You haven't had a good rest recently?

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,000
I can't sleep well at night

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
because of Yan Yan's case.

173
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,000
But it doesn't matter.

174
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm fine.

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,480
Go out with me to relax.

176
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,480
Help me wash my cloth.

177
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,560
Help me.

178
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,320
Yes.

179
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,000
A'xi.

180
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,080
Your Highness.

181
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,560
Any news on Yan's family?

182
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,480
We didn't make any table of quail's eggs.

183
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,960
I'll go by my own derivative.

184
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,040
I heard that

185
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,200
Song Jiayin is your wife

186
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,680
because she's out there.

187
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,200
What?

188
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,320
You have an arrangement behind my back?

189
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,080
It's not what Zhier means.

190
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,120
He just said what he wanted to say.

191
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,400
I don't object to it.

192
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,480
The Song family

193
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,080
is not inferior to the Sang family

194
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,360
in the court.

195
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
And they've been working closely with us.

196
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,800
In fact, the Song family has always been a strong-headed person.

197
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,560
I've been worried about it.

198
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,920
But if you really marry Song Jiayin

199
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
and have this marriage,

200
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,840
it will save us a lot of trouble.

201
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
I don't think so.

202
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,520
Even if the strong-headed man

203
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
is after us today,

204
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,560
he will be after someone else one day.

205
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,680
You have to be careful

206
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,640
when you work with the Song family.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You have to work hard

208
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
to get things done.

209
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,000
In my opinion,

210
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,080
the first priority

211
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,720
is the Sang family.

212
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,080
You have the nerve to mention the Sang family?

213
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
You've been back to the capital since the Sang family was founded.

214
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,680
You've been busy with many things

215
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
for that girl.

216
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
That girl has ruined our plans.

217
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,920
Cooperation?

218
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
Except for them.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,120
You should let go of your love for her.

220
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,120
Aunt.

221
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,160
Give Sang Qi and me another chance.

222
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,440
What?

223
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,360
Do I have to say it

224
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,840
for the second time?

225
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,280
No, it's not necessary.

226
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,960
Even if I say yes,

227
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,840
Sang Qi has also made it clear.

228
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,760
She wants to keep年gehen married.

229
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
They need to both Qifeng and Journey.

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,280
Aunt.

231
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,680
I know how to do this.

232
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
I'm still thinking about that life

233
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,320
I'm willing to exchange this life for a formal meeting

234
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,840
Leave me with thousands of thoughts

235
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,160
If it's the persistence of love

236
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
We are born to love each other

237
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,560
Are you tired?

238
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,640
You play so hard

239
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm still having this life

240
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,920
If it's the persistence of love

241
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
You bring me to relax

242
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,120
I'm still having this life

243
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,720
Of course I want to play hard

244
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,720
I'm happy to be with you

245
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm happy to be with you

246
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
I'm happy to be with you

247
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,960
Actually, I've been thinking

248
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,640
I want to have more time alone with you

249
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,000
Then why don't you take me up the mountain

250
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,920
Come to my house and find me

251
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,800
That's different

252
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,520
There are too many separations

253
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,240
I hope to be with the one I love

254
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,720
More private time alone

255
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,840
Just like now

256
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
Why do you say that all of a sudden?

257
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,280
You used to think I was a talkative person

258
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,000
Now I'm just going to go

259
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
You're not used to it

260
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,920
It's really hard to serve

261
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,560
You're too fast and too sudden

262
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm not used to it

263
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,440
Besides, what is hard to serve

264
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,640
Don't serve you

265
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,520
I won't let you leave

266
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
You're going to go if you don't let you go

267
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,040
Don't say it's for you

268
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,240
You said you were so hard to do

269
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,240
Why don't you want to

270
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,480
No, I'm willing

271
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,600
I'm very willing

272
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,080
No, I'm going on a trip

273
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,680
A trip?

274
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,760
Sendingу

275
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,040
Rayu

276
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Is it true

277
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,840
Yes

278
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,520
Jin

279
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,520
Never paraffin

280
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,640
the one who took you to the mountain.

281
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,240
You mean

282
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,040
my horseman?

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,600
Young Master!

284
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,360
Young Master!

285
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,280
Bring the food back.

286
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,720
Don't rush.

287
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,000
Miss Sang.

288
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,720
The Grand Commandant...

289
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,080
The Grand Commandant was taken away by the officials.

290
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,160
What happened?

291
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,720
Let's go back first.

292
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,240
Let's go.

293
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
What happened?

294
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm not sure.

295
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,360
I was discussing the countermeasures with the Grand Commandant.

296
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,560
Suddenly, a group of officers came

297
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,880
and took the Grand Commandant away.

298
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,520
That's not right.

299
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,440
Although my father pleaded for the Yan family,

300
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,520
he never did anything overbearing.

301
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,920
He wouldn't have angered the officials.

302
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,400
It should have nothing to do with the Yan family.

303
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,080
They must have come for Miss Sang.

304
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,840
Yes.

305
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:16,960
Qin Lang.

306
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,560
Qi.

307
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,360
How is it? Did you find out?

308
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,280
Not yet.

309
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,560
Not yet.

310
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,080
Mr. Sang.

311
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Can you find a way

312
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,280
to let us meet Grand Commandant Sang or Grand Commandant Yan?

313
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,400
This should be related to the case of the Yan family.

314
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
It's a bit troublesome to ask for this now.

315
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,000
Grand Commandant Sang was sent by the officials

316
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,160
to be sent to the prison directly.

317
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,240
I can't interfere.

318
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Although Grand Commandant Yan is still in the prison of the Jingzhao Prefecture,

319
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,920
the officials ordered Yan family to watch him closely.

320
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,920
I have to go and ask them.

321
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,720
How about this?

322
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,720
Mr. Sang.

323
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,080
You and Yan Yan

324
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,600
find a way to meet Grand Commandant Yan.

325
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,320
Qi and I will go to the palace to meet the officials.

326
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
We must ask them clearly.

327
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,160
Okay.

328
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,280
Let's go.

329
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,160
You two.

330
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,240
The officials are busy.

331
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,160
Please go back.

332
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,400
The officials shouldn't be willing to see us now.

333
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,600
I understand.

334
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,680
We have been guarding here for a day.

335
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
It's time to eat something.

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,880
We are exhausted.

337
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,240
We have more things to do.

338
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,600
Let's go to the capital to eat something.

339
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
We can also ask for information.

340
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,040
Let's go.

341
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,120
Right.

342
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,040
Right.

343
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,280
This way.

344
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,760
Mr. Sang, Miss Yan, please wait.

345
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,600
What's wrong?

346
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
You two are both well-informed.

347
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,800
In this situation,

348
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,440
it's really inconvenient to entertain you two.

349
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,120
Please don't make it difficult for me.

350
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,040
It's okay.

351
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,080
Deputy Chief, let's go to another house to eat.

352
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,360
It's okay to go to another house.

353
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,720
But I have to ask why.

354
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,720
This...

355
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,080
Xiaodan...

356
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,880
Yan Siyan.

357
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,960
You are really pretending to be confused in your clothes.

358
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,320
What's there to ask?

359
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,480
Deputy Chief was caught by the officials.

360
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,880
With his identity,

361
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,600
it won't be a small mistake.

362
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,560
Maybe it will be a big crime.

363
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,160
Qi.

364
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,080
You said you were eating at the Qingfeng Restaurant.

365
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
But if the Imperial Guards

366
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
really harassed the officials,

367
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,920
what if one of us

368
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,280
made a mistake?

369
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,680
How can you explain that?

370
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,920
I don't understand.

371
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,920
To put it bluntly,

372
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,760
Qi is just a bad person.

373
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,280
He doesn't welcome you wherever you go.

374
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,360
I think

375
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,600
you should go back to the Imperial Guards with Yan Siyan.

376
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
You should hide yourself.

377
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,520
Miss, this way, please.

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,840
Mr. Zhuo.

379
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,880
Song Jiayin.

380
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,360
You asked me out, but you are still late.

381
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,440
Why are you still in a good mood?

382
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,160
Mr. Zhuo, please forgive me.

383
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,920
I was too late because I met something good.

384
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,160
You don't have to say anything good.

385
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,600
Just say it.

386
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,560
Don't get in my way.

387
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,280
Mr. Zhuo, don't worry.

388
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,360
Listen to me.

389
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,960
This good thing is not only mine,

390
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
but also yours.

391
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,040
It's my business.

392
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,800
Guess who I met downstairs?

393
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,440
Sang Qi and Ye Yunchi.

394
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
Mr. Zhuo, don't be so mean.

395
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,680
Listen to me.

396
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,480
Sang Qi is not the same as before.

397
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,760
His backer father was caught.

398
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,680
Ye Yunchi couldn't protect him.

399
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,680
I just took the opportunity

400
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,040
to teach him a good lesson.

401
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,520
I took the whole Qingfeng House

402
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,560
and kicked him out.

403
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,520
I was able to help you out.

404
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,880
You are the eldest daughter of the Song family.

405
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,080
When can you stop being so reckless?

406
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,360
The officials have been

407
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,560
cold to the Sang family.

408
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,120
No one knows what will happen in the middle.

409
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,440
Besides, if Sang Qi hates you,

410
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,800
he will make you go to the Song family.

411
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
What are you going to do?

412
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,800
I...

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,440
Whether it's a good thing or not,

414
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,760
please think about it more.

415
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
I have something to do.

416
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,200
See you.

417
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,120
Qi.

418
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,040
Don't take it to heart.

419
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,160
I know.

420
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,280
I'm always pushing you.

421
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,640
I'm a commoner.

422
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,960
It's no surprise.

423
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,760
No matter what happens,

424
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
I'll face it with you.

425
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm just worried about my father.

426
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,320
He's old.

427
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,640
What if he suffers in prison?

428
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Don't worry too much.

429
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,360
The Grand Commandant is the Grand Commandant.

430
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,880
Besides, he hasn't been convicted.

431
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,520
No one will do anything to him.

432
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,280
I'll think of a way

433
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
to see if anyone can arrange

434
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,200
for us to see him.

435
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
What is the reason why the Noble Consort

436
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
has summoned Lan Ji to the palace?

437
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,120
I heard from my nephew

438
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
that Lan Ji is very good at drawing.

439
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,320
But she's been depressed lately.

440
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,560
She asked me to arrange

441
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,320
something good for you.

442
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,200
Something good for Young Master Zhuo?

443
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,240
Don't worry.

444
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,320
The official is here.

445
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,840
Greetings, Your Grace.

446
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,280
Don't stand on ceremony.

447
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This is

448
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,320
Miss Su.

449
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,160
I'm Su Jieyu.

450
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,240
Greetings, Your Grace.

451
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,520
Arise.

452
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,720
No wonder you look familiar.

453
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,320
You sound familiar too.

454
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
You're wise, Your Grace.

455
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,440
This is the first talented woman

456
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,320
I mentioned to you a few days ago.

457
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,040
Then why did you

458
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,840
get together with Miss Su today?

459
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
Your Grace,

460
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,600
people outside think

461
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,880
I'm not worthy of

462
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,600
the good smell of Su's perfume.

463
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,200
I have two drops of ink in my body.

464
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,880
I see.

465
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,360
I'm not joking.

466
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,280
Miss Su

467
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,960
has been very worried lately.

468
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,440
She asked me to come and talk to her.

469
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,040
She's old enough to get married

470
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,720
and is looking for a good husband.

471
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,760
But she's been looking for a husband

472
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,160
without any ulterior motives.

473
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,960
I've been talking to her for a long time

474
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,720
and she's been a little more relaxed.

475
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,960
The official is here today.

476
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,240
I wonder if Lan Ji

477
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,360
has the luck

478
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,560
to get the blessing of the official?

479
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,920
Your Grace,

480
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,480
you're very interesting.

481
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,120
You've never proposed to your beloved nephew.

482
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,280
You've helped Lan Ji first.

483
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,000
But

484
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
I have to agree

485
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
with your proposal.

486
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,800
Miss Su,

487
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,000
if you like any man,

488
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,280
I'll make the decision for you.

489
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,520
Thank you, Your Grace.

490
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,200
Hurry up.

491
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,440
Call me when you're done.

492
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,280
Yes.

493
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,680
Father.

494
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Why are you here?

495
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,720
Father,

496
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,120
we've been talking for a long time.

497
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Did you find anything suspicious

498
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,200
before you were caught?

499
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,440
No.

500
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,080
It happened so suddenly.

501
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,440
The official and I discussed the matter of the Yan family.

502
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,040
The official was just released.

503
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,040
He was caught as soon as he got back.

504
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
That's to say,

505
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,760
I didn't know it was the Yan family

506
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,040
who dragged you into the water.

507
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,000
Yan?

508
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,120
What's wrong with him?

509
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,400
I don't know.

510
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,680
I just heard it.

511
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,520
Lan Ji,

512
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,120
have you ever doubted

513
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,560
that I really

514
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,720
participated in those things?

515
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,840
When did you do that?

516
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,360
You're still telling me this?

517
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,160
Okay.

518
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,080
The secret plan, the secret action,

519
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,360
the secret plan,

520
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,280
can you figure it out?

521
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,960
You?

522
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
Don't bother me.

523
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,920
But the other party

524
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,680
has made such a thorough plan.

525
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,800
I'm afraid that if this matter is resolved,

526
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,120
it won't be that easy.

527
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,960
I know.

528
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,360
But first, we need to figure out

529
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,160
why Yan Tai Shi was in the water.

530
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,240
Sit.

531
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,320
Yan.

532
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,200
Father,

533
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
what happened this time?

534
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,480
Why was Grand Commandant Sang arrested?

535
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,800
Grand Commandant's Mansion

536
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,080
was arrested because

537
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
someone was in charge of the three guards.

538
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,720
Someone?

539
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,760
Didn't the account of Ding Hao

540
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,800
be overturned?

541
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,040
It's not Ding Hao.

542
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,600
It's a familiar person.

543
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Familiar person?

544
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,480
Dad,

545
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,560
please go to find him.

546
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,280
How did justly

547
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
게o Kapi goodbye Warder Wei

548
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
and the Samuel.

549
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,560
and ran away with Lord Wei.

550
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,320
When I found Lord Wei,

551
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,520
he was dead.

552
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,080
But Zhuo Wen Yuan said

553
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,600
he saw Wei Zhanhong jumping off the cliff.

554
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,520
After Wei Zhanhong jumped off the cliff,

555
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,200
the government sent people to search for the body.

556
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,840
But the wound was very high.

557
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,400
We couldn't find his body.

558
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,240
In the end,

559
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
Wei Zhanhong died and took the case.

560
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,440
It's been so long.

561
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,520
Wei Zhanhong suddenly came back to testify.

562
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,720
There must be something fishy.

563
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,920
The priority is to find Wei Zhanhong

564
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,240
and confront him face to face.

565
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,400
Only in this way

566
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,600
can we get a clear picture of Sang Taiwei.

567
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,720
But where is Wei Zhanhong now?

568
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,800
Mr. Yan, do you have any news?

569
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,920
Wei Zhanhong's return to the capital is a top secret.

570
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,520
The Jingzhao Prefecture didn't receive any reward.

571
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,480
Now,

572
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Wei Zhanhong must be secretly hidden.

573
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,480
Besides,

574
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,160
this case is no longer under investigation by the Jingzhao Prefecture.

575
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,240
It's not a matter of time

576
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,440
for Wei Zhanhong to be found.

577
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,560
Now,

578
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,440
it's a tight time.

579
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
We'll split up to find out the news.

580
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,320
We must find Wei Zhanhong

581
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,640
at all costs.

582
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,200
That's probably it.

583
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,760
Let's go now.

584
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,640
Go.

585
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,160
This is too strange.

586
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,800
There must be someone behind it.

587
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,480
This person knows that Wei Zhanhong is still alive.

588
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,440
I saved him after Wei Zhanhong jumped off the cliff.

589
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,280
I tried my best to hide him.

590
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,680
I was so excited that I sent Wei Zhanhong back to Bianjing

591
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,680
at this moment

592
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,440
to be the black card of Wei Zheng.

593
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,480
It's too cruel.

594
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,520
I don't understand.

595
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,480
Wei Zhanhong's father has been killed by Xi Zhao.

596
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,160
Why did he still help Shi Zhao sell his life

597
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,640
and frame my family?

598
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
This person

599
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,360
is good at planning and planning.

600
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,880
Maybe Wei Zhanhong was bewitched by him.

601
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,480
But it's a pity

602
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,560
that he gave up his life

603
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,880
and threw Wei Zhanhong out.

604
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,000
He also exposed himself.

605
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,400
As long as we find Wei Zhanhong,

606
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,160
we can find Mo Heng Heisheng

607
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,480
by touching his head.

608
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,560
Sir,

609
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,640
we didn't find him.

610
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,200
We didn't find him.

611
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,280
Come on.

612
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,240
Come on.

613
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:13,920
Come on.

614
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,480
Sang Qi,

615
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,080
why did you invite us to meet today?

616
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
We haven't seen each other for a long time after graduation.

617
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,400
We'll meet you

618
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,160
when we have time.

619
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,720
Why didn't Zhuo Wenyuan and Yan Yan come?

620
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,640
I heard that Zhuo Wenyuan

621
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,240
is now a famous person in the Ministry of Personnel.

622
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
Maybe he is busy with official affairs.

623
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,960
Yan Yan's family...

624
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,880
You shouldn't mention that.

625
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,760
Why do you say that?

626
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,520
Eat.

627
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,120
Come on.

628
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,560
Eat.

629
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:42,960
Eat.

630
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,600
Eat.

631
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,000
Although my father was wronged,

632
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,960
he was very honest.

633
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,440
I believe the officials will investigate it

634
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,920
and prove my father's innocence.

635
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,520
That's right.

636
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,360
Dr. Sang has a criminal record.

637
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,960
He is loyal to the court.

638
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,720
We

639
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,160
trust Dr. Sang.

640
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,120
Besides,

641
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,320
the imperial guards are blessed.

642
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,560
They will be able to help us.

643
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,120
Thank you.

644
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,040
To be honest,

645
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,840
our students

646
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,440
are really lucky.

647
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,240
Wei's family was in trouble.

648
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,440
Wei Zhanhong died.

649
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,440
Then Yan's family and Sang's family

650
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,920
were involved in the case.

651
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,800
But I heard that

652
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,760
the government didn't find Wei Zhanhong's body.

653
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
Maybe he is still alive.

654
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,240
The government has sentenced him to death.

655
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,800
There is no news of him since he was killed.

656
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,960
I think he is in a lot of trouble.

657
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,040
Yes.

658
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,000
Father, are you going out?

659
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,400
I'm going to talk to some ministers.

660
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,400
You are in such a hurry.

661
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,480
Did something happen

662
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,640
in the court?

663
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,560
Tell me. What do you want to ask?

664
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,840
I heard that Dr. Sang's case

665
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,760
has a key witness who has made an iron certificate.

666
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,600
Isn't it bad for the imperial guards?

667
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,160
Father, do you know about this?

668
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,480
This is a secret case.

669
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,080
The official asked about it.

670
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,080
I still don't know

671
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,800
who the witness is.

672
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,680
Dr. Sang's case is extraordinary.

673
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,680
Don't get involved.

674
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,880
Everyone in the court is in danger.

675
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,600
You can't make any trouble.

676
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,560
But now the Sang family is in trouble.

677
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,520
How can I just ignore it?

678
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,760
What can you do?

679
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,080
The situation in the court is very strange.

680
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
A lot of things are already there.

681
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,080
Even father is helpless.

682
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,440
What can you do?

683
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,240
Yun Zhi, a gentleman

684
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,160
is not good for the weak.

685
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,240
Take care of yourself.

686
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,640
I've been investigating everywhere in the city.

687
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,680
I have no news.

688
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,360
Song Langtian doesn't seem to know about it.

689
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,040
I secretly watched the house and sent the letter.

690
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,800
I didn't find anything strange.

691
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,680
I've also looked into it.

692
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
The court officials

693
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,400
also know nothing.

694
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,480
Does no one in the whole Bianjing

695
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,000
know where Wei Zhanhong is?

696
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,120
Maybe

697
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,240
someone knows.

698
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
If Zhou Wenyuan knows where Wei Zhanhong is,

699
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
it means he is the one behind it.

700
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,000
I hope I guessed wrong.

701
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,080
Miss Sang,

702
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,800
the young master invites you to his house.

703
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,320
Deputy Chief Ye, I'm sorry.

704
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,800
The young master only invites Miss Sang to his house.

705
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Don't worry.

706
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,280
Zhou Wenyuan and I have been friends for many years.

707
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,840
He won't do anything to me.

708
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,040
I'll be right back.

709
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Take care.

710
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,080
Anjie, you're finally here.

711
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,960
I was the one who visited you in the mansion.

712
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
I almost broke the door of the Grand Commandant's Mansion.

713
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Today is the first time you visit my mansion.

714
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,320
I have something to ask you.

715
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,680
Don't worry.

716
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,080
We'll talk later.

717
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
I'll take you to the mansion first.

718
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,960
Let's go.

719
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,920
Zhou Wenyuan.

720
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,200
Let's go.

721
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,360
Anjie,

722
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,120
let's have dinner in my mansion today.

723
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,640
I'll ask the kitchen to make some dishes

724
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,760
that you like the most.

725
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,000
For example, Dongpo...

726
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,840
Zhou Wenyuan.

727
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,880
Can we talk about this?

728
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,080
I wanted to talk to you about our friendship

729
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,320
and trust.

730
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,200
Forget it.

731
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,080
I know you came for the Grand Commandant's Mansion.

732
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,120
I can help the Grand Commandant escape punishment.

733
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,120
Although I can't help him get back his position,

734
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,680
I can definitely save his life.

735
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,600
Wei Zhanhong is really with you.

736
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,080
Wei Zhanhong?

737
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,920
Isn't he dead?

738
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,760
If he's not with you,

739
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,240
how can you help my father get back his position?

740
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,240
I have my own way.

741
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,120
But this is not a small matter.

742
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,360
The Grand Commandant's position is related to Xi State.

743
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,520
The entire court is busy with civil affairs.

744
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,120
I'm an outsider.

745
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,520
I'm not related to the Grand Commandant.

746
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,760
How can I be involved in other things?

747
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,800
Unless...

748
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,440
Unless the Grand Commandant is my family,

749
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,640
I, Zhou Wenyuan, will risk my life

750
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,800
to help the Grand Commandant escape punishment.

751
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,520
Family?

752
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,240
You want to force me to marry you?

753
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,480
No.

754
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,360
Anjie.

755
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,920
I didn't force you.

756
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,480
But now, the only way to save the Grand Commandant is

757
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,320
to force you to marry me.

758
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,160
I'm not going to marry you.

759
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm going to marry you.

760
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,400
Zhou Wenyuan.

761
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,320
You threatened me with my father's life.

762
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,680
Do you remember how he treated you

763
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,920
and how he took care of you in the border?

764
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,040
How did you become like this?

765
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
Did I change or did you change?

766
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,240
We used to be close.

767
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,320
But ever since you met Yan Yunzhi,

768
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,680
I've done so much for you.

769
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,320
But in your heart,

770
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,560
you never remember that Yan Yunzhi you just met.

771
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,240
Now you still want to marry her.

772
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,680
But Anjie, let me tell you.

773
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,320
Yan Yunzhi will only bring you into trouble

774
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,320
and push you into danger again and again.

775
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,840
Only I can really protect you

776
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,040
and help you get out of the Sang family.

777
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,160
One day, you'll understand

778
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,040
that I, Zhou Wenyuan, am the most suitable for you.

779
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,520
I've told you.

780
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,040
You and I can only be friends.

781
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,600
But I don't want to be your friend.

782
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
What's the point of living and dying for the Grand Commandant?

783
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,280
You choose.

784
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,000
I didn't expect Zhou Wenyuan to be so stubborn.

785
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,560
He even used my father's life as a bait.

786
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,720
Although Zhou Wenyuan

787
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,800
doesn't admit that Wei Zhanhong is in his hands,

788
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,840
if he wants to reverse the case,

789
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,760
only Wei Zhanhong will come out to make a comeback.

790
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
There's no other way.

791
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,920
Zhou Wenyuan

792
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
must have something to do with this.

793
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,760
I'm sure he's not the one who did this.

794
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,160
I'm sure he's not the one who did this.

795
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,480
I just didn't want to ask Zhou Wenyuan for help.

796
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,360
I was afraid that this would have something to do with him.

797
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,240
But I never thought

798
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,440
he would become like this.

799
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,800
Qi.

800
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,800
People are so fickle.

801
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,640
It's hard for a man to see through.

802
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,000
Don't worry.

803
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,760
We'll find a way to do it.

804
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,280
And Uncle's case hasn't been investigated yet.

805
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,880
There's still room for him to come back.

806
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,080
I'll find Wei Zhanhong

807
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,680
and help Uncle to catch Yuanqu.

808
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,520
I hope so.

809
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm sorry.

810
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,760
I'm sorry.

811
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,680
I'm sorry.

812
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
I'm sorry.

813
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm sorry.

814
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
I'm sorry.

815
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
I'm sorry.

816
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
I'm sorry.

817
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm sorry.

818
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
I'm sorry.

819
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
I'm sorry.

820
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
I'm sorry.

821
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm sorry.

822
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
I'm sorry.

823
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
I'm sorry.

824
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
I'm sorry.

825
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
I'm sorry.

826
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I'm sorry.

827
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
I'm sorry.

828
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
I'm sorry.

829
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
I'm sorry.

830
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
I'm sorry.

831
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
I'm sorry.

832
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
I'm sorry.

833
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I'm sorry.

834
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
I'm sorry.

835
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
I'm sorry.

836
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
I'm sorry.

837
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
I'm sorry.

838
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
I'm sorry.

839
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
I'm sorry.

840
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
I'm sorry.

841
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,680
I'm sorry.

842
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
I'm sorry.

843
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
I'm sorry.

844
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
I'm sorry.

845
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
I'm sorry.

846
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
I'm sorry.

847
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
I'm sorry.

848
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm sorry.

849
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
I'm sorry.

850
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
I'm sorry.

851
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
I'm sorry.

852
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
I'm sorry.

853
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
I'm sorry.

854
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
I'm sorry.

855
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
I'm sorry.

856
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
I'm sorry.

857
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
I'm sorry.

858
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
I'm sorry.

859
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
I'm sorry.

860
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
I'm sorry.

861
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,680
I'm sorry.

862
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
I'm sorry.

863
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
I'm sorry.

864
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
I'm sorry.

865
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
I'm sorry.

866
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,680
I'm sorry.

867
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm sorry.

868
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
I'm sorry.

869
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,680
I'm sorry.

870
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
I'm sorry.

871
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
I'm sorry.

872
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
I'm sorry.

873
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
I'm sorry.

874
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
I'm sorry.

875
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
I'm sorry.

876
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
I'm sorry.

877
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
I'm sorry.

878
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,680
I'm sorry.

879
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
I'm sorry.

880
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
I'm sorry.

881
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,680
I'm sorry.

882
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,680
I'm sorry.

883
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,680
I'm sorry.

884
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,680
I'm sorry.

885
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
I'm sorry.

886
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
I'm sorry.

887
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
I'm sorry.

888
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
I'm sorry.

889
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
I'm sorry.

890
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
I'm sorry.

891
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
I'm sorry.

892
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
I'm sorry.

893
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
I'm sorry.

894
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
I'm sorry.

895
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
I'm sorry.

896
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
I'm sorry.
