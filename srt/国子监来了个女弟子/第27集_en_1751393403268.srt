00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The King's Woman

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Qi, you are...

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm making snacks for my father.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So he can have fresh snacks when he comes back.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Since that, I should do the same.

7
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let me help you.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You know how to make snacks?

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't. But I can learn.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Miss, I'll go to the kitchen to check on the Empress.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wash your hands first.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll make the dough.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Dough is the hardest part.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I remember I saw people living before.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's like that.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not that hard.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let me teach you.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Look.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Push the part with the gap.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And keep kneading.

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
When it reaches the bottom,

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
turn it over like this.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And then...

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Like this?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Right?

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Deputy Chief.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Are we a little bit different?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I hope our days will be like this.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We can live our lives together.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's great.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But...

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Qi.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll think of something.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's welcome your father back happily.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't think about unhappy things.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think I've learned it.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're like this.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Deputy Chief.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Deputy Chief.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Deputy Chief is here.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yan Yan, why are you here?

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Grand Tutor and Madam are fine.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The case is settled.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They're all back.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why didn't you stay with them?

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My father said

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Grand Tutor was framed

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
for helping us to keep our words.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He wanted to visit us in person.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But he felt unwell.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So he asked me to come.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Where's Grand Tutor?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He'll be back in a while.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He's not here.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Where's Grand Tutor?

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He'll be back in a while.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yan Yan will send him back.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll wait for him to come back.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My father told me

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
to thank him in person.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You two were here just now...

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Just now...

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I...

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was teaching Deputy Chief how to make snacks.

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Snacks are complicated.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You have to be skilled.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, that's right.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Deputy Chief wants to please Uncle too.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm just a free-spirited man.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I should do something.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where's Lin Pian?

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Where's the kitchen?

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll help.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll help.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You two continue.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Continue.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You can smell this.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's the best.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Xia Lang.

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Dr. Zeng.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Father.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Father.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Father.

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Father.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hello.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You...

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You've lost weight.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I haven't.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My hair is white.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My belly is flat.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Enough.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I heard from Master Yan

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
that you've been running for my case

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and for my daughter.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thank you.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Uncle, don't say that.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I should do this.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're really a good son.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What are you doing?

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why did you hit him?

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm not fighting with him.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm thanking him sincerely.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Then I'll thank you

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
for your kindness.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm tired of talking to you.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll go to my room to rest.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Drink with me later.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Master Yan, you stay too.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I want to thank you too.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have work to do.

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll come again some other day.

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll see Master Yan off.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go.

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Come.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let me see.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let me see.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Father.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
San Lang.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Qi was here just now.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I have something to say.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You want to talk about Zhuo Wen Yuan?

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
After the West Regions and the previous nine years,

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
he's been very thoughtful

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and crafty.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I think

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
he won't give up

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
until the West Regions and the previous nine years.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He'll be furious again.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll keep investigating.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have the same idea.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll pay close attention to his actions

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and investigate in secret.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Only you know about this.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't let Qi know about it.

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you have any clues,

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
let me know.

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll work with you.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll get ready now.

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Qi Lang, stay here.

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Today is a family dinner.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No outsiders are allowed.

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No need to be so formal.

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I've been away from home for a while.

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you for your hard work.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Uncle, you're back safely.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Congratulations.

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let me propose a toast to you.

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You...

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What kind of wine is this? It's bitter.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is the roasted wine

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that Master brought from the border.

158
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We don't usually drink it.

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're not used to the wine of the Sang family?

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm used to it.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm used to it.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Uncle,

164
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
let me propose another toast to you.

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Here.

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's eat.

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Here, eat.

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You like it?

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Eat more.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Look at you.

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sit down.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The West Regions was destroyed.

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's kind of ending

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
my worries.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Even if the Jingzhao family doesn't do anything,

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll kill them sooner or later.

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But I heard that

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Jingzhao family wants to

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
dig deep into the West Regions.

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Aunt, don't worry.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I've taken care of it.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They don't have the evidence.

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
They can't do anything.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're getting

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
more and more stable.

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
By the way,

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I heard that the Guan family

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
released Sang Wei

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and reinstated Yuan Zhi.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Have you thought about

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
how to deal with it?

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Aunt, don't worry.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This scene

195
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
can't be left out.

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
From now on,

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Siyue and Sang Dianji

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
will prepare

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
for the recruitment of students

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
with us.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The students of the last year

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
of the Imperial College of Education

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
have excellent grades and

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
extraordinary thoughts.

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Many young people

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
in Bianjing

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
want to enter the Imperial College of Education

208
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
to study.

209
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I've sent Siyue's

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
new recruitment rules

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to the Ministry of Personnel and Ministry of Personnel.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I believe

213
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
there will be a response soon.

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
From now on,

215
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'll be the one

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
who will be the first.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
From now on,

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll recruit many students.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No matter their birth,

220
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
their family,

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
or their gender,

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
as long as they want to study,

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
they can all

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
enter the school.

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

226
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll also set up a female class.

227
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The teaching class

228
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
will be the same as the other classes.

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There will also be a regular assessment.

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The results after the assessment

231
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
will be announced

232
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
with all the students.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's great.

234
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We can also use this

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
to encourage the students

236
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to study.

237
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Deputy Chief.

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Deputy Chief.

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Dr. Feng.

240
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The Minister of Personnel is here.

241
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So fast.

242
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Did he pass the new recruitment rules?

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Wen Yuan.

244
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're here

245
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
to inform us about the good news.

246
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't see you

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
visiting His Majesty often.

248
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Dr. Huo.

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have work to do.

250
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll talk to you about it another day.

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay.

252
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The Ministry of Personnel discussed

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
the new recruitment rules of the Imperial College.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's not appropriate.

255
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The students who are going to study

256
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
should be taught by Ning Que.

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The students who are going to study

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
should be taught by Ning Que.

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The students who are going to study

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
should be taught by Ning Que.

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's necessary to have a wide range of students.

262
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
As for the female students,

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
it's not appropriate.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In short,

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the new recruitment rules

266
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
are not appropriate.

267
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I hope you can

268
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
reconsider it.

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Chu Wen Yuan.

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're deliberately making things difficult for us.

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm just

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
telling the Ministry of Personnel

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that if there's any problem,

274
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can appeal to the Ministry of Personnel.

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm leaving.

276
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It seems

277
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that the Ministry of Personnel

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
is sad.

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What should we do?

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Zhuang Wen Yuan

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is so reckless

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
and he's making things difficult for us.

283
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Isn't he clearly making things difficult for us?

284
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's not the time to be angry with him.

285
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What we need to do is

286
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
to make a more convincing rule

287
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
as soon as possible.

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And we need to change the other people in the Ministry of Personnel.

289
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's right.

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Even if Zhuang Wen Yuan

291
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
is like a fish in the Ministry of Personnel,

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
he can't just stand by and watch.

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The so-called

294
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the essence of the essence is the beginning.

295
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't believe

296
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't move the old masters of the Ministry of Personnel.

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Qi.

298
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Go back to the editing room first.

299
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll think of the countermeasures.

300
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't work too hard, Deputy Chief.

301
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't worry.

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll go back to the editing room.

303
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Qi.

304
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Deputy Chief, have you found anything?

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I just received the news

306
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
that Zhuang Wen Yuan

307
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
will be an important person outside the city tonight.

308
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
In order not to leak the news,

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll only take a small number of people with me tonight.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I hope I can catch Zhuang Wen Yuan's flaw this time.

311
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Zhuang Wen Yuan has a lot of tricks.

312
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There's something wrong with the kitchen.

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll go with you tonight.

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay.

315
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll go with you.

316
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Deputy Chief.

317
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why don't you have lunch?

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Qi.

319
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I just had it.

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's from Baishi.

321
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When did you get used to eating poisonous food?

322
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've been thinking about you.

323
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay.

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'll treat you to lunch tomorrow.

325
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Take it as an apology.

326
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
By the way,

327
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:50,300
I have to hurry up about the new

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll go now.

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Go.

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Qi.

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What's wrong?

332
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Tonight is the family dinner.

333
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
My parents will be upset

334
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
about the engagement.

335
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
How about

336
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
you go to my house and hide?

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
My father has been sick for the past two days.

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'd better not upset him.

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Then you should tell them

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
not to fight.

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I know.

342
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll go to work.

343
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Go.

344
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Go.

345
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Zan,

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
is it true?

347
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It should be.

348
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You didn't guess

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
that there was another mastermind behind the wedding.

350
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
This man

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
clearly told me

352
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that he had important evidence about the black hand.

353
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Is he reliable?

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Although he is not a decent man,

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
he is just a little shrew.

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
But

357
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
he is well-informed.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He helped me a lot before.

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Stop.

360
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Zan,

361
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think it's a trap.

362
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I suspect Sang Yu's death.

363
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I've been investigating for years

364
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and got the support of Jingzhao's family.

365
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sure that

366
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
no one in the capital

367
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
knows me better than me.

368
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
But even so,

369
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I just guess

370
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
there is another man behind Xizhao.

371
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But you,

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
are too sure.

373
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm afraid...

374
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Who is it?

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's me.

376
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm here.

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm here.

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm here.

379
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm here.

380
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm here.

381
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm here.

382
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm here.

383
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm here.

384
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm here.

385
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm here.

386

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm here.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm here.

389
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm here.

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm here.

391
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm here.

392
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm here.

393
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm here.

394
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm here.

395
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm here.

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm here.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm here.

398
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm here.

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm here.

400
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm here.

401
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm here.

402
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm here.

403
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm here.

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm here.

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm here.

406
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm here.

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm here.

408
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm here.

409
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Peki.

410
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm here.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm here.

412
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm here.

413
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
chuoudan

414
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm here.

415
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
chuoudan

416
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Stop!

417
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm so tired today.

418
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,160
Miss, you just finished your case.

419
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
And you're busy with the case of Guo Zijian.

420
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,120
You don't have a rest for a few days.

421
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,320
You really think you're strong?

422
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Go back and have a rest after dinner.

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,960
I'm so tired.

424
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,480
What's good to eat today?

425
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,480
Yan Yan,

426
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
are you going to eat in your mansion?

427
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,680
Why are you here again?

428
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,480
By the way,

429
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,680
didn't you say you were going to

430
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
accompany Master Yan and his wife?

431
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,400
My mother said that I was so talkative that

432
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
Lian Ping was raised by her.

433
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,200
The food in the mansion is not to my taste.

434
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,200
She asked me to come to Taiwei to eat.

435
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,520
My mother also said that you made delicious snacks.

436
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,280
Really?

437
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,040
You gave snacks to Mrs. Yan?

438
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,080
A few days ago,

439
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,720
Master went back to the mansion and made too much.

440
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
So I asked Yan Yan to take it back.

441
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,960
Good, Lian Ping.

442
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,360
I learned a little too.

443
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,720
Why are you back so late today?

444
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,400
It's all about Song Luo Tian.

445
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,480
He always leaves early in the morning.

446
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,960
I can't eat hot food.

447
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,080
By the way,

448
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,080
I just saw Deputy Chief leave the city.

449
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Master Yan took someone out with him.

450
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,160
Did they do anything?

451
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,280
Deputy Chief left the city.

452
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,800
You're right.

453
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,840
Yes.

454
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
You don't know?

455
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,080
I said Deputy Chief left the city today.

456
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,720
Could it be...

457
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,760
Yan Yan, come with me.

458
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,440
I'll be back soon.

459
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,920
I just got the news.

460
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,920
Our people found Master Yan outside the village.

461
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,960
He still has a breath, but he is heavily poisoned.

462
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,600
Deputy Chief Yan is missing.

463
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,720
Keep up theboards,

464
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,640
and I'll dry the cloth for you.

465
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,000
Yun Ri,

466
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,120
do you remember if you ever speak Korean?

467
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,240
An old man

468
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,240
once said,

469
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,840
he was at home.

470
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,520
Looking back at the people whom Yan Yan took care of,

471
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,960
I learn that these pictures are proof husband and wife All be together while newlyweds together.

472
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,400
Could it be they met and would meet again boombl�?

473
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
Why are you�로

474
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,280
far away from each other in sec.

475
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Deputy Chief really fell from here?

476
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,560
The officers said so.

477
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,480
Where is Yan Siliang?

478
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,200
He's still in a coma.

479
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,200
Let's go. Let's go find him.

480
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,400
Let's go. Keep looking.

481
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,120
Yes.

482
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,520
Deputy Chief Yan.

483
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,320
Deputy Chief.

484
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,480
Deputy Chief.

485
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Deputy Chief.

486
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,200
Deputy Chief Yan.

487
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,040
Deputy Chief.

488
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,600
Yan Yanzhi.

489
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,040
Deputy Chief.

490
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,840
Deputy Chief.

491
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,120
Yan Yanzhi.

492
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,920
Deputy Chief.

493
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,640
Deputy Chief.

494
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,520
Deputy Chief Yan.

495
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,360
independently.

496
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,000
facilitate

497
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,840
Looking for the Deputy Chief.

498
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,520
Do not rush.

499
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,600
Do not make trouble yourself.

500
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
It's not too late to make a mistake.

501
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,000
It's been several days.

502
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,840
If we don't do anything,

503
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,480
there's nothing we can't do.

504
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,680
There's no news at this time.

505
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,560
It's good news.

506
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Deputy Chief is good at martial arts.

507
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,200
Maybe he's out of danger now.

508
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,560
He's recuperating somewhere.

509
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,800
I hope so.

510
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,840
But Yan San Lang is so...

511
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,560
Sir.

512
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,480
Sir.

513
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,080
We found this pouch

514
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,040
at the river bank.

515
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,560
Here you are.

516
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,360
Where did you find it?

517
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,080
At the river bank.

518
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,800
Deputy Chief Yan.

519
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,320
Stop.

520
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,840
Let's go.

521
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,920
Deputy Chief.

522
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,440
Hurry.

523
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:16,680
Hurry.

524
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,440
Is there anything else?

525
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,920
We've searched everywhere.

526
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,360
We didn't find Mr. Ye's trace.

527
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,480
Where are you going?

528
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,400
I'll go down there.

529
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,080
Qi.

530
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,400
I know you're worried.

531
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,080
But we've been looking for it

532
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,240
for days and nights.

533
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,600
Not to mention my men.

534
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,760
You can't eat it.

535
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,800
But Deputy Chief...

536
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,640
Listen to me.

537
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,920
Go back first.

538
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,040
If Deputy Chief is really...

539
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
We can't complete

540
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,640
the search at the river bank.

541
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,000
I'll go find some men.

542
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,040
Besides,

543
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,680
we're not the only team in the search.

544
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,080
Go back to the Palace of Jin Zhao.

545
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,240
Maybe there's good news.

546
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Don't worry.

547
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,920
Have you found veggies?

548
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,200
starving?

549
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,520
rationally.

550
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,440
Song Luo Tian.

551
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,280
What happened?

552
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,400
He died in the prison of the Jingzhao Mansion.

553
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
He died?

554
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,520
The Jingzhao Mansion is heavily guarded.

555
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,040
How could this happen?

556
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,320
I haven't had the chance to investigate it.

557
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,920
But the person who broke into the Jingzhao Mansion

558
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,200
is definitely not a lowly person.

559
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,640
What about Lord Yan?

560
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,480
How is he?

561
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,400
Lord Yan is not in danger for now.

562
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,680
He's just in a coma.

563
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,600
The officer has sent the imperial doctor

564
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,520
to wake him up.

565
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,080
Lord Yan is not here now.

566
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,040
The Jingzhao Mansion is heavily guarded.

567
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,480
I've thought about it.

568
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,840
So I sent Lord Xiao from Dali Temple

569
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,040
to take care of the Jingzhao Mansion for now.

570
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,840
But when he just came out,

571
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,840
the officers and soldiers who survived

572
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,880
with Lord Yan

573
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,000
seemed to wake up.

574
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,400
Lord Xiao is being interrogated now.

575
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,640
Baishi seems to have passed.

576
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,600
Baishi?

577
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,080
Why did he pass?

578
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
Look at him.

579
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,520
He's asking for nothing.

580
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,760
Let's go and check it out.

581
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,240
Let's go.

582
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
Nonsense!

583
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
You're lying!

584
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,000
My lord.

585
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,680
Yan Yan, the left-hand man of Jingzhao Mansion.

586
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,680
Greetings, my lord.

587
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,240
Sang Qi, the imperial doctor of the Imperial College.

588
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,240
Greetings, my lord.

589
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,760
You're here at the right time.

590
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
I've just checked

591
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,120
the case of Lord Yan's assassination.

592
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,720
The murderer has been confirmed.

593
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,760
Who is it?

594
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,360
Yan Yunzhi.

595
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
How is that possible?

596
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,360
Baishi.

597
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,200
Young Master, he was framed.

598
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,640
My lord.

599
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,760
Is there any evidence

600
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,520
that Yan Yunzhi hurt Lord Yan?

601
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,040
If he's to be convicted,

602
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,640
we need evidence.

603
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,880
Of course.

604
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,240
The official duty is the evidence.

605
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,960
I didn't have to explain it to you.

606
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,240
But since you're not close to Yan Yunzhi,

607
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,720
I'm not a biased person.

608
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,680
It's okay to talk to you.

609
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,440
Come on.

610
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,520
Tell us about that day again.

611
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,480
Yes, my lord.

612
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,280
I was ordered

613
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,760
to follow Lord Yan

614
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,840
to search for the remains of the West Regions.

615
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
The action was a secret.

616
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,240
But Yan Yunzhi suddenly followed up

617
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,520
when he left the city.

618
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I thought Lord Yan

619
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,440
was looking for Yan Yunzhi's help.

620
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,880
But I saw two people fighting.

621
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,080
When they left the city,

622
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,680
they were surrounded

623
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,720
by a group of men in black.

624
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,960
We were caught off guard.

625
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,040
We were in a mess, so we had to hold our feet.

626
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,600
But Yan Yunzhi suddenly turned against us

627
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,640
and hurt two officers and officers around him.

628
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,800
He even attacked Lord Yan.

629
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,160
Yan Yunzhi.

630
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,760
What are you doing?

631
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Lord Wuyin.

632
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,760
Can't you see it now?

633
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,960
You're from Xizhou?

634
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,760
I finally understand.

635
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
But no wonder.

636
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,240
You have inner power.

637
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Why do you always ask me to help you solve cases?

638
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,560
Why do you keep it from me?

639
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,720
When did I keep it from you?

640
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
You're stupid.

641
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,080
You never check it.

642
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
I told you

643
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,880
not to leave the city today.

644
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,840
But you insisted on leaving.

645
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,160
Don't blame me for killing you.

646
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,760
Yan Yunzhi.

647
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,040
You're so good at fighting.

648
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,360
Yan Yunzhi, I've figured it out.

649
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,120
Thank you for giving up.

650
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,600
Maybe I can spare your life.

651
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Yan Yunzhi.

652
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,000
You know too much.

653
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Dan Dan.

654
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,880
You said it was Yan Yunzhi.

655
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
But it doesn't sound like

656
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,680
what Deputy Chief would say.

657
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,160
My lord.

658
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
Yan Yunzhi is always low-key.

659
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,080
He can't say such things.

660
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,960
The whole country can be in the picture.

661
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,520
You can also check it.

662
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,280
I think

663
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,800
he's not telling the truth.

664
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,040
Could it be something else?

665
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,080
What's wrong with you?

666
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
My lord.

667
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,560
I suddenly have a headache.

668
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,760
I had a bad dream and suddenly had a heart attack.

669
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,040
I'm seriously injured.

670
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm still dizzy.

671
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,800
Maybe I'm too serious.

672
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,360
Anyway, that's the situation.

673
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,960
Yan Yunzhi and Xizhao Yu Ning are trying to frame you.

674
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,040
It's true.

675
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,880
I have no lie, my lord.

676
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,080
No lie?

677
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,680
No lie.

678
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,280
Let's not talk about our friends.

679
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,280
Everyone in the Jinzhao Mansion knows

680
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,680
Yan Yunzhi is investigating my brother's death.

681
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,280
That's why he's involved in the evil Xizhao.

682
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,280
Yan Yunzhi is a man of great merit.

683
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,080
Why would he collude with Xizhao to hurt Yan Yanzi?

684
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
That's right.

685
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
From what I know about Deputy Chief,

686
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
he and Lord Yan are friends.

687
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,680
How could he do that to him?

688
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,880
My lord.

689
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,680
Although it's just a one-sided thing,

690
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,880
Deputy Chief is now clueless and unable to deal with me.

691
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,280
He said that we can't trust him completely.

692
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,280
We have to wait until he's fully convinced.

693
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,880
Of course.

694
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,880
My lord.

695
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,480
This is the account book

696
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,880
found in Yan Yunzhi's study.

697
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Yan Yunzhi's study

698
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,080
The funeral is half right.

699
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,680
Yan Yunzhi has been cooperating with Deputy Chief Yan

700
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,080
in investigating Xizhao.

701
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,880
But Yan Yunzhi's purpose

702
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,680
is not to destroy Xizhao,

703
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,280
but to observe Deputy Chief Yan's progress.

704
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,280
The account book that Wei Zhanhong handed in,

705
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
Deputy Chief Yan has already noticed

706
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,080
that Yan Yunzhi and Lord Wei have a close relationship.

707
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,480
I've read that account book.

708
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,280
It has nothing to do with Deputy Chief.

709
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,080
You can't tell the connection

710
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
because there's another one.

711
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,280
Another one?

712
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,080
Yes.

713
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
It's the one in Lord Xiao's hand.

714
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,280
Two accounts, one name and one case.

715
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,680
The accounts found in Yan Yunzhi's study

716
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,680
and the accounts handed in by Wei Zhanhong

717
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,480
can be matched with the data on it.

718
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,880
How did you know?

719
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,280
Qianjiu.

720
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,480
My Lord.

721
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,080
Qianjiu is a spy of Xizhao.

722
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,280
But I didn't realize it before.

723
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,680
It's really my fault.

724
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,480
But because of that,

725
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,280
I've been close to him

726
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,880
and learned a lot from him.

727
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,280
When I knew his identity,

728
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,280
I reflected on the things I did with him every night.

729
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,280
I found out all his strange things.

730
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Not only that,

731
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,280
I mentioned Yan Yunzhi's study.

732
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,880
So I took someone to check it.

733
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,680
I found this account book.

734
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
How's the account book?

735
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,080
My Lord.

736
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,480
It's recorded.

737
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Yan Yunzhi sold it to Lord Wei.

738
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,680
And the handwriting and handwriting on the account book

739
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,080
are not new.

740
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,080
It's not fake.

741
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:35,880
My Lord.

742
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,680
It's just a guess.

743
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,680
There's no way to make it fake.

744
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
We both know

745
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,080
Xizhao is in a dark place.

746
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
Why did Yan Yunzhi cut himself off?

747
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,280
Anqi.

748
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,680
This is the place Yan Yunzhi

749
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
is so scared of.

750
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Think about it.

751
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,880
From the Song family's tea garden to Lord Wei,

752
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Wei Zhanhong

753
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,680
and the last one to kill Xizhao,

754
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,280
he was there every time.

755
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,680
But every time he did it,

756
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,480
it led to the end of the clue.

757
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,080
Think about it.

758
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Yan Yunzhi helped the investigation to be fake,

759
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,280
helped Xizhao to clear the traces

760
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,280
and mess up the court's vision.

761
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,680
Anqi.

762
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,080
The news you got

763
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,680
and the so-called truth

764
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,680
were all investigated by Yan Yunzhi.

765
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,480
He told you everything.

766
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
All the information you knew

767
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,080
was all given to you by him.

768
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,280
Don't you think it's suspicious?

769
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,280
My Lord.

770
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,680
It's just your guess.

771
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,280
As long as Lord Yan wakes up,

772
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,680
everything will be clear.

773
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,680
How is Lord Yan now?

774
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,080
My Lord.

775
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,080
The imperial doctor has diagnosed him.

776
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,080
But he's not optimistic.

777
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,880
Lord Yan is still unconscious.

778
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
He can only use silver needles and medicine to kill him.

779
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,480
We don't know if he can wake up.

780
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
In that case,

781
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,480
we can't just wait.

782
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,080
We have to find Yan Yunzhi no matter what.

783
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,280
As for his identity,

784
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,080
we can't just wait.

785
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
What if

786
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,080
the fugitive is the one who will be killed?

787
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,680
Zhuo Wenyuan.

788
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
Zhuo Wenyuan, what do you mean?

789
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
You want to arrest Yan Yunzhi?

790
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,080
It's just a temporary measure.

791
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,280
All right.

792
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,480
Stop arguing.

793
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,080
Do as Zhuo Yushi said.

794
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,080
Save Lord Yan with full force.

795
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,080
Take the White Division under custody

796
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,480
and arrest Yan Yunzhi.

797
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,280
Yes.

798
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,680
Yes.

799
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,080
My Lord.

800
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,480
Retreat.

801
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,080
My Lord.

802
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,280
Retreat.

803
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,480
Yan Yunzhi

804
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,680
My Lady.

805
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,080
My Lady.

806
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,880
How is Lord Yan?

807
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
Did you find Deputy Chief?

808
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,280
Don't ask me.

809
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,080
I'm so confused now.

810
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,280
I don't know anything.

811
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,680
Let's go back to the mansion first.

812
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,680
Wait for me here.

813
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:53,880
I'll call a carriage.

814
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,280
Anxin.

815
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,680
Are you all right?

816
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,080
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Zhuo.

817
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,480
Why are you so polite to me?

818
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Let me send you back.

819
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,680
No need.

820
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,480
Young Master.

821
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,280
Lord Yan is so wise.

822
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,880
He escaped from death.

823
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,080
If he wakes up,

824
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,480
it's very bad for us.

825
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,680
How about I go and arrest him?

826
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,280
No hurry.

827
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,880
When we dealt with Wei Zhanhong last time,

828
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
we took a lot of risks.

829
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,680
The people of Jinzhao Mansion

830
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,280
are not all plain.

831
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
I'm afraid they may have noticed.

832
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,480
Now, Yan Sanlang

833
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,080
should be protected by Yan Mi.

834
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,480
It's hard for us to do anything.

835
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:52,880
Forget it.

836
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Let's talk about it after the court is over.

837
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,880
Yes.

838
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,080
Qi.

839
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,880
Qi.

840
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,880
Why are you sleeping here?

841
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,480
You'll catch a cold.

842
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
Siyi.

843
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,080
Where have you been?

844
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,280
When will you come back?

845
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,480
Don't worry.

846
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,880
What you need to do now is to have a good rest.

847
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,680
When you have a good rest,

848
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,880
I'll be by your side.

849
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,280
You're not lying to me.

850
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,480
I'm so tired when you're not here.

851
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,080
I'm not lying to you.

852
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,480
Come on.

853
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,080
Don't leave me.

854
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,680
Siye.

855
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,080
You're awake, Miss.

856
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,280
Miss.

857
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,880
You've been sleeping

858
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,480
since you came back yesterday.

859
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,280
Are you too tired recently?

860
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,480
You have to take care of yourself.

861
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,480
I prepared some chicken soup for you.

862
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,080
Why don't you drink it while it's hot?

863
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,080
I don't want to drink it.

864
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
All right.

865
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,480
I'll go find my brother.

866
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,880
Miss.

867
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,480
Brother.

868
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,480
What should I do now?

869
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,480
Siye is still alive.

870
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,280
Even the Third Prince is in a coma.

871
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,280
Everything in the city

872
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,480
is a lie.

873
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,880
I really don't have any thoughts now.

874
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,480
With the current situation,

875
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,880
I really can't tell

876
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,480
what's true and what's not.

877
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,280
Brother.

878
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Can you give me some advice?

879
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Miss.

880
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
Miss.

881
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,480
Miss.

882
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,480
Miss, what's wrong?

883
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,080
Miss.

884
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,880
Help!

885
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,480
Miss fainted!

886
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,080
Miss.

887
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,880
How is she?

888
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,680
I still can't tell her.

889
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,280
Let me make some donation.

890
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,560
Give it to me.

891
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
Thank you, Miss.

892
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,880
formalordeerneas.

893
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
Try to move more.

894
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,320
This doctor is a famous doctor I hired.

895
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,960
There won't be any mistake in the diagnosis.

896
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,960
Besides, the disease is like a silkworm.

897
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,160
It's not easy to recover.

898
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,000
Take the prescription to the doctor first.

899
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,240
Yes.

900
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,080
Qi.

901
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,720
Qi.

902
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,240
You still have the pouch.

903
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,120
Why don't I keep it for you?

904
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,600
It belongs to Deputy Chief.

905
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,000
He's not here.

906
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,360
Why do you still keep the pouch?

907
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,520
Anyway, I'll be with you

908
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,560
for the rest of your life.

909
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,720
Give it to me.

910
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,680
Qi.

911
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,280
I know you've misunderstood me

912
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,480
all this time.

913
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,360
But in my heart,

914
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,760
you're still my best friend.

915
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,160
I'm also your most reliable person.

916
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,120
From now on,

917
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
if you need anything,

918
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:38,960
just tell me.

919
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,840
I'll try my best to satisfy you.

920
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,280
Take good care of yourself.

921
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,920
I'll come up to see you.

922
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:24,440
Посткдер

923
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:24,840
Doctor.

924
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,400
How good is Sang Jie's condition?

925
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,760
In addition to acutestalk,

926
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,440
drugged owners haveez in the symptoms suspicions.

927
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,760
Groom!

928
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,160
Did this study go smoothly?

929
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,880
Look, tell me.

930
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,380
Yan Sala has resolved the case.

931
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,680
But she has lost a tooth

932
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,200
and still hasn't found his ghost yet.

933
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,780
Yes.

934
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:00,460
I found instant覺,

935
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,880
the handbag which he kept with his bag all the time.

936
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,120
Jinmu,

937
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,520
give me the white bottle

938
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,720
left by Qianjiu.

939
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,520
The Four Kingdoms

940
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,020
When it's just beginning,

941
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,840
as course you may regret it

942
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,260
Oh, Ö

943
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:11,480
I'mMM его

944
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:11,640
I'mMM ос ay

945
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,420
the cup is just to blend

946
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,660
Everything is in a way

947
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,060
leave me with pheas burnt

948
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,480
If there must be a resolve

949
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,140
If there is doubt,

950
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,140
I wrote down the words of the new moon

951
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,140
I also finished this life in the cloud

952
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,140
I also finished this life in the cloud

953
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,140
I also finished this life in the cloud

954
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,140
I also finished this life in the cloud

955
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,140
In the future, from the short talk

956
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,140
to the deep kiss

957
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:13,140
to the deep kiss

958
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,140
to the deep kiss

959
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,140
to the deep kiss

960
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,140
to the deep kiss

961
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,140
to the deep kiss

962
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,140
to the deep kiss

963
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,140
