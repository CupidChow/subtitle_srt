00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,680
Someone smiles and burns

2
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,120
The blue god is playing a joke

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,560
The red god is going to accompany you

4
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:44,840
The red god is like a

5
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,360
The moon is like a hundred years old

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,600
The moon is like a hundred years old

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,000
The moon is like a hundred years old

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
It turns out that the moon is like a

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,080
The moon is like a

Ms. Inayabe

63
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,660
Episode 06

64
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,360
The others are justieren

65
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,260
What do you mean?

66
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,720
The others are just

67
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,420
residents ofител

68
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,800
and their families.

69
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
Down here,

70
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,960
Why are you so low?

71
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Are you not feeling well?

72
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,280
I just feel a little strange.

73
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,600
What's strange?

74
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,480
Before the exam,

75
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,280
I worked hard to study hard.

76
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
But when the exam paper was handed over,

77
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,680
I felt my whole body was empty.

78
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
My heart was empty, too.

79
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,400
Deputy Chief.

80
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,240
That's it?

81
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,560
Yes.

82
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,440
Qi.

83
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Your exam is over.

84
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,720
But for you and me,

85
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,040
it's just the beginning.

86
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,600
Everyone.

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,120
The exam is over.

88
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
You've been working hard.

89
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
It's strange.

90
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,960
You don't have to go to school,

91
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,720
but you feel more empty.

92
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,600
Yes.

93
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,400
I've been at home

94
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
and meeting with Guo Zijian.

95
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,120
I don't know where to go now.

96
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,360
Qi, are you going back?

97
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,080
No.

98
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Dad will ask Dong and Wenqi.

99
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
I'm not going.

100
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
It's not their home.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,280
Since you don't want to go back,

102
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,840
we have to arrange it.

103
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,120
Even if the meeting is over,

104
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,680
you have to

105
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,520
take care of the TV.

106
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
Our teacher

107
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,720
can't help you.

108
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,360
Before, for this exam,

109
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,160
we prepared a very strict

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
and intensive review task for you.

111
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,080
Your efforts and hardships

112
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,400
are in our teacher's eyes

113
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
and in our hearts.

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,640
So, as compensation...

115
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,920
Enough, Lao Feng.

116
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,320
You're so quiet.

117
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,360
We mean

118
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,520
to take you to relax later.

119
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,960
Relax?

120
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,920
We're the masters.

121
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,480
You can choose

122
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,640
where you want to go.

123
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,560
Really?

124
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,240
Yes.

125
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Let's go to

126
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,120
the wind tower.

127
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,800
Go.

128
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,880
Let's go.

129
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,000
Really?

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,560
Of course.

131
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Really?

132
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Let's go.

133
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,000
It's rare to see

134
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,720
all the students of the Imperial College

135
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,920
come here together.

136
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,160
I guess

137
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,640
all the students are here to relax

138
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,840
after the exam.

139
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,560
Am I right, Mr. Zhou?

140
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,160
You're really smart, Miss Qian Jiu.

141
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
In that case,

142
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,880
we'll be the ones to entertain you today.

143
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,880
Miss Qian Jiu,

144
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,240
I don't think you have to bother.

145
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,520
Deputy Chief Yan,

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,880
don't push yourself.

147
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,600
You must be exhausted

148
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,080
from the exam.

149
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
We're here to entertain you.

150
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,680
Mrs. Zhang,

151
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,560
please entertain us.

152
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,400
No problem.

153
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Please come upstairs.

154
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
Please come in.

155
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,280
Mr. Feng.

156
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
You're here.

157
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,600
Why didn't you say hello?

158
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Well...

159
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,720
Well...

160
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Who is Mr. Feng?

161
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,560
Who is Mr. Feng?

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
I've seen you before.

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,120
What's there to hide?

164
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,360
Or

165
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,160
you've forgotten me

166
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,960
after a dozen years?

167
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
You know each other.

168
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,480
We've known each other for a long time.

169
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,880
Well...

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,480
Forget it.

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
I won't make it hard for you.

172
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,080
Today,

173
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,480
I'll give you a discount.

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,320
I'll be your company.

175
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
Great!

176
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,480
Great!

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Please come in, everyone.

178
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,200
Mr. Feng, please come in.

179
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,600
Please come in.

180
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
Please come in.

181
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,960
Please come in.

182
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,440
Please come in.

183
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
You're all here with great joy.

184
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,840
You must be very proud of your work.

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,360
You can look forward to the title of the gold medalist.

186
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,800
Mr. Zhou,

187
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,080
please take care of me.

188
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,240
It's true that Miss Qian Jiu is very smart.

189
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,000
She knows the title of gold medalist

190
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,560
and she still hopes for Mr. Zhuo.

191
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,120
Unlike us,

192
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,800
as long as we don't drag Mr. Zhuo down,

193
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,280
we'll be satisfied.

194
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm a little worried

195
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,920
if you say so.

196
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,840
What if we don't pass the exam

197
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,640
and drag Mr. Zhuo down?

198
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,600
Sang Qi,

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
don't say that.

200
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,280
Tell me,

201
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,360
have you tried your best?

202
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,720
Of course.

203
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
That's enough.

204
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,480
We're all the same.

205
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,160
This exam

206
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
is a chance for you

207
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,440
to test your academic achievements.

208
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,840
In fact,

209
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,120
it's your future career

210
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,360
that has nothing to do with me.

211
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
It's the same.

212
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,360
The official award

213
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,440
is also testing my ability

214
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,960
in the Imperial College.

215
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,760
But to be honest,

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,160
if I can't stay this time,

217
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,240
then I can't get along with everyone here.

218
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Mr. Feng, you didn't look like this when you were young.

219
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
Students are watching.

220
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,880
We don't watch you.

221
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,520
Just like usual.

222
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,440
Okay.

223
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,360
You said I looked like a regular here.

224
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,080
I don't know you at all.

225
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Right, Haohao?

226
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,760
Mr. Yan,

227
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,520
I heard you rejected Miss Su.

228
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,640
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,480
I'm sorry.

230
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm sorry.

231
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm sorry.

233
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,880
Miss Su,

234
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,480
is that true?

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,920
If you don't deny it,

236
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,880
then we'll take it as true.

237
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,360
Have you already fallen in love with someone?

238
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,600
Miss Su,

239
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,120
you're so kind.

240
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,720
You don't even like

241
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,120
the girl in the outside world.

242
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,520
What kind of girl

243
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,880
can make you fall in love with her?

244
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Tell us about it.

245
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,800
Let's have a look.

246
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,520
Right.

247
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,040
Let us know

248
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,520
which girl

249
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,600
we can learn from.

250
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
Have some wine.

251
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,240
No, no, no.

252
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,520
I really don't have much alcohol.

253
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,480
Just drink it.

254
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,320
Have some.

255
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,960
I just had it.

256
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,320
Dr. Feng, Dr. Huo.

257
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,280
Don't be so polite.

258
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,120
Just ask them to drink it.

259
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,600
Miss, ask them to drink it.

260
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,920
Come on, have some.

261
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,520
Mr. Yan,

262
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,000
have some.

263
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,760
Really, really.

264
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,800
Thank you.

265
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,200
Well,

266
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,880
who else wants to drink with Mr. Yan?

267
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,520
Just come to me.

268
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,840
Just come to me.

269
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,400
Actually, I already have a girl in my heart.

270
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
Gentle and gentle,

271
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,800
she's good at reading and managing.

272
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,440
She's good at drawing.

273
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,200
She's virtuous and virtuous.

274
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,360
These words have nothing to do with her.

275
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,840
She even said

276
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,040
these words are

277
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,760
the opposite of her.

278
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,800
She's lively,

279
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,200
free,

280
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
and a good ghost.

281
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
She's different from

282
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,800
all the other girls in your memory.

283
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
But I like her like this.

284
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
I like

285
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,800
her mourning spirit.

286
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,560
Mr. Yan,

287
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,440
you finally said it.

288
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,840
I'm really going to suffocate to death.

289
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,960
Let me tell you.

290
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
When I was on the mountain,

291
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,040
I saw Yan Yan...

292
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,640
Mr. Yan.

293
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,040
Mr. Yan,

294
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,080
it's not easy to be the son-in-law of the Sang family.

295
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,920
I don't think it matters.

296
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Come on, have some.

297
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,160
I've already seen it.

298
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,120
Yan Yan,

299
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,840
you're really a good girl.

300
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,120
You're really a good girl.

301
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
You're really a good girl.

302
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
You're really a good girl.

303
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
You're really a good girl.

304
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,640
You're really a good girl.

305
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,520
Yan Yan

306
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
is different from the Sang family.

307
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Don't you think it's normal?

308
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
I've already calculated it.

309
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,640
There must be a marriage

310
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,840
between us.

311
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,240
Come on.

312
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,520
Mr. Yan,

313
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
it's not a big deal.

314
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,240
When did you have a marriage?

315
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,040
Qi,

316
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
let's get back to work.

317
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,800
Let's have a drink.

318
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,120
Hey,

319
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm your Qin doll.

320
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,080
I didn't expect it.

321
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,360
Alright, alright.

322
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,400
Cheers.

323
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,280
Cheers.

324
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,000
I also don't like you.

325
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,640
Cheers.

326
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,840
Let's drink more.

327
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,800
Yes.

328
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
Ya思 enchanted!

329
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,520
I'll check if there are anything,

330
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,080
anything else that I want.

331
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,480
Try it.

332
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,960
Just try it.

333
00:11:49,200 --> 00:12:03,320
Give me

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,480
You'll win!

335
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,160
Here!

336
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,400
I'll go back to my mansion after walking around.

337
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,640
Right.

338
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,920
I ate too much and I'm not digested.

339
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,560
Deputy Chief, can you digest it?

340
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,760
I'll digest it with you.

341
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,400
I'll go back and tell Master

342
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
that I'll leave you to him.

343
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,840
Deputy Chief.

344
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Deputy Chief.

345
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,560
Deputy Chief.

346
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Deputy Chief.

347
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,400
Disgusting!

348
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
Mr. Bai Shi.

349
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
Go back to rest with me.

350
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,040
Goodbye.

351
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,600
Look.

352
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,400
What're you doing?

353
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,600
Deputy Chief.

354
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,040
The examination's over.

355
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm sorry.

356
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,080
Yun...

357
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,320
I'd better call you Deputy Chief.

358
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
You're my teacher for a day and a lifetime.

359
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,560
Although you're not my teacher,

360
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,400
you're still my Deputy Chief.

361
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,200
I just think

362
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,600
Yun Zhi is closer to Deputy Chief.

363
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,600
But I think Deputy Chief is more comfortable.

364
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,880
Fine.

365
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,760
As long as you're comfortable.

366
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,520
Deputy Chief.

367
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,920
At the banquet,

368
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,120
we don't have to tell them

369
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,000
in such a big way.

370
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,720
Didn't we make a deal?

371
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,960
We won't hide it until the exam is over.

372
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,240
We'll be together often

373
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,720
and don't want others to gossip about you.

374
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,800
I'm not afraid of gossip.

375
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,200
Actually, I didn't care what they said before.

376
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
But now,

377
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,480
I just want everyone to see me.

378
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,800
It's like

379
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,720
I've got the most precious treasure in the world.

380
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,920
I want everyone to know

381
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,280
how proud I am of this treasure.

382
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,320
It's also a warning.

383
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm warning them.

384
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,160
This treasure is mine.

385
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,200
Are you okay, Mr. White-Haired?

386
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,480
Miss and Deputy Chief haven't come back yet.

387
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,040
Why are you in such a hurry?

388
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:41,960
Oh, right.

389
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,560
Where are you going so late?

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
It's so dark. I can't see anything.

391
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,440
Right?

392
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,760
Lian Pian, I'm a little thirsty.

393
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,160
Can I have another cup of water?

394
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,200
Sure.

395
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:53,840
Follow me.

396
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,120
Deputy Chief, they saw us.

397
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,840
It's okay.

398
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,440
Didn't you hear them?

399
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,760
They can't see anything.

400
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,600
They can't see anything.

401
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,200
Since they can't see anything,

402
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
let's keep them for a while.

403
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,200
And

404
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,840
when the time comes

405
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
when you're released from prison,

406
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,760
you'll officially graduate from the Imperial College.

407
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,160
Right.

408
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,280
Actually,

409
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,200
I really hope

410
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,800
I can be kept safe.

411
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,960
And

412
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,240
I can be famous.

413
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,200
And I want to be a little closer.

414
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,880
I've become

415
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,360
the first female student in the country.

416
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,280
I want to be the first female official in the country.

417
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,200
What do you think?

418
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,040
Sure.

419
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,440
Of course.

420
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
But I'm not talking about this.

421
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Qi,

422
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,840
when the time comes

423
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,280
I'll come to Taiwei Prefecture to propose to you.

424
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,280
Okay.

425
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,680
Okay.

426
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,120
You're not good at running.

427
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,240
It's the same to go early or late.

428
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,640
That's different.

429
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,640
Lian Pian, where's Sang Qi?

430
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,320
He's in Young Master's study.

431
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,760
Brother,

432
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,800
it has been a day to be kidnap.

433
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,840
Sis, I'm not nervous at all.

434
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm just a bit flustered.

435
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,760
I really dare not go to see it.

436
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,200
But see if I can,

437
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,360
I'll get kidnapped rightuje.

438
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,200
A street researcher is a alley.

439
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,840
Forget it,

440
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,200
I'd better go to see it.

441
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,120
though Mr. Lin says it's okay.

442
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
I'm really afraid I'll break my promise

443
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,360
and ruin your plan.

444
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,380
I can't bear to do it.

445
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,640
That guideédlaugh...

446
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,280
that guideédlaugh

447
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,520
should've been written in a higher tone.

448
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,720
As for the�� Stark,

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,360
let's review them

450
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,280
based on how Sun Morning

451
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,000
is feeling right now.

452
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,440
I...

453
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,920
Brother,

454
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,760
you'll bless me, won't you?

455
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,400
I'm sorry.

456
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,800
If I didn't do well,

457
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,840
you won't blame me, right?

458
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,720
You're finally out.

459
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,600
Let's go.

460
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,160
Yeah.

461
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,120
I heard I've surrounded them.

462
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,240
We can't see them if we don't go.

463
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,400
Wait.

464
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,360
What did you say?

465
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,440
Surrounded them?

466
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,200
So many people are watching.

467
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,240
If I say something wrong,

468
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,840
it'll be embarrassing.

469
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,320
How about this?

470
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,960
You go.

471
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,520
You go and tell me after you see them.

472
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,280
I'll go back first.

473
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,040
Don't be silent.

474
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,800
Go.

475
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,440
Go.

476
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,320
Go.

477
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,480
Why is Miss so timid now?

478
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Where is Miss?

479
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,760
Master.

480
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
Miss followed Mr. Zhuo

481
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,480
and Mr. Yan to see the treasure.

482
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,000
Why didn't you follow her?

483
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,040
When you got the message,

484
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,200
you came back and told me.

485
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,920
Yes.

486
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,120
Excuse me.

487
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,200
Congratulations.

488
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,480
Zhuo.

489
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,360
Zhuo Yan.

490
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
I...

491
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,280
Mr. Zhuo

492
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
is really a talented man.

493
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,880
You're the only one.

494
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,840
You'd better take care of yourself.

495
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:36,840
Mr. Zhuo.

496
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,960
Congratulations.

497
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,080
Congratulations.

498
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,120
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo.

499
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,280
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo.

500
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,600
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo.

501
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,160
Congratulations.

502
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
You're the best.

503
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,520
Congratulations.

504
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,880
Congratulations.

505
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,080
I'm on the list.

506
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Miss.

507
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,520
Let me help you.

508
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,960
Congratulations.

509
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,880
Congratulations.

510
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,200
Congratulations.

511
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,560
Congratulations.

512
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,280
Congratulations.

513
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,200
Congratulations.

514
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,280
Deputy Chief.

515
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,640
Don't be angry.

516
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,200
Take your time.

517
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,720
Yan Yan, the 20th of the Three Armor,

518
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,960
has been from Jin clan.

519
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,040
Good.

520
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,280
How is it?

521
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,560
I didn't embarrass you, right?

522
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Yes.

523
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
It's a good result for you.

524
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,320
You're on the list.

525
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,400
What about Sang Qi?

526
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,160
How is he?

527
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,680
Sang...

528
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,200
Sang Qi...

529
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,840
He...

530
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,920
What's wrong with him?

531
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,680
Is there anything wrong with him?

532
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,760
Let him tell you.

533
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,140
Yi sweat and critical condition?

534
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,320
He hasavais a high fever.

535
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,360
I'll put it away for him.

536
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
Wait a moment.

537
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,200
Fire.

538
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
To prevent him from getting a fever again.

539
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,640
The air we catch,

540
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,600
we're going to use that effect

541
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,720
on him all the time.

542
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,680
If we don't use that effect on him.

543
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,200
He'll eller he'll get a fever from me.

544
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,400
It'd better be nicknamed

545
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,640
I want to comfort her.

546
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
Deputy Chief.

547
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,400
It's okay, Qi.

548
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,920
Don't blame yourself. It's okay.

549
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,440
18th place in the second round.

550
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,300
I was born in the year of the

551
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,760
four-leaf clover.

552
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,800
Deputy Chief, I passed.

553
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,840
But you passed.

554
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,160
Why did you scare me?

555
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,600
Do you know how worried I was just now?

556
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,960
That's because

557
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,640
you usually scare me too much.

558
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,360
I finally got the chance.

559
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,080
I have to escape from violence.

560
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,400
Escape from violence?

561
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,800
It seems that you have improved

562
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,120
not only in your study,

563
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,040
but also in your playfulness.

564
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,320
It's because you are so kind to me.

565
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
Otherwise, how could I

566
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,520
learn so fast?

567
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,720
It seems that I have lost more than once.

568
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm not a good talker.

569
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
The End

570
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,680
My Lady.

571
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,960
My Lady, she...

572
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,320
My Lady, she passed the exam.

573
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,720
She passed the exam?

574
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,400
She is 18th in the second round.

575
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
My good girl.

576
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,640
You have made me proud.

577
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,360
I have a good reputation.

578
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,040
I have prepared a celebration banquet for you.

579
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,680
My Lord,

580
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,440
you didn't say that just now.

581
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,520
You are just a little girl.

582
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,200
Where is Qi?

583
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,760
My Lady is in the Imperial College

584
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,000
to report to the Deputy Chief.

585
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,160
You went to see him again?

586
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,440
Do you still think I'm not here?

587
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,600
Go.

588
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,760
Find him back.

589
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,400
Okay.

590
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,040
Everything is finally settled.

591
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,360
Actually, it's not the end.

592
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,440
It has just begun.

593
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,520
At that time,

594
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
I hoped

595
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,160
you could change the education system

596
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,880
through your study in the Imperial College

597
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,080
and let more people have the opportunity to study.

598
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,920
Now that you have been promoted to the gold medal,

599
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
I am more confident

600
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,680
to officially announce the promotion

601
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,480
to the official family.

602
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
Our struggle has just begun.

603
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,760
My Lord, I understand.

604
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,640
Did you hear that?

605
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,200
Do you think it's true?

606
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,160
Isn't it true?

607
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,240
Miss Sang is really something.

608
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,200
If I had the chance to enter the Imperial College,

609
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,240
maybe I would have done better than her.

610
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,560
She is the daughter of the Grand Commandant.

611
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,320
How could a girl from a common family

612
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,880
have such a chance?

613
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
Dad has been taking me around for days.

614
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,640
My legs are almost broken.

615
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,800
That's because Grand Commandant Sang

616
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,000
is proud of you.

617
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,680
I'm not.

618
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,000
You are proud of yourself.

619
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,840
After all, you are a new beginning.

620
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,480
I understand what you are saying.

621
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
I can understand her.

622
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,840
But I think it's enough.

623
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,360
Why do you always do this?

624
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,440
If it weren't for you,

625
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,720
I wouldn't have been able to get out of this.

626
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,440
By the way, what can I do for you?

627
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,000
I want...

628
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,240
What's going on between you and Deputy Chief?

629
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,560
Deputy Chief.

630
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,360
Well...

631
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,120
Deputy Chief said it.

632
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,600
You heard it, right?

633
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,800
Deputy Chief doesn't care what he said.

634
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,960
I want to hear it from you.

635
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,200
Why must I tell you?

636
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,920
I just...

637
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,960
I...

638
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,280
I...

639
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,000
Deputy Chief treats me.

640
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,440
And we...

641
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,400
You know it now.

642
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,120
You don't understand?

643
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,480
I mean,

644
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,440
we are in love.

645
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,840
Do you understand?

646
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,720
Forget it.

647
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,920
I'm really...

648
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,680
I'm sorry.

649
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,880
Ying.

650
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,760
Long time no see.

651
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm not like you.

652
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,000
You'll be in trouble if you get caught.

653
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,440
Isn't it because Deputy Chief taught me well?

654
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,680
I have no choice.

655
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,720
You've read the book?

656
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,800
I just want to read it.

657
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,760
Why not?

658
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,280
You read the book?

659
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,560
What?

660
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,600
You are the one who asked me to take the exam.

661
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,840
Why don't you let me read the book?

662
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
Listen.

663
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,720
With my talent,

664
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,040
I can get into the top 18 of the second class.

665
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,640
I'll beg my father to send me to the fruit shop tomorrow.

666
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,240
I'll wait for you.

667
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
Why are you so proud?

668
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,000
Don't think you can get into the Deputy Chief's house

669
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,480
just because of the Qingfeng Building.

670
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,080
Even if you get into the Deputy Chief's house,

671
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,000
remember,

672
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,080
I, Song Jiayin, will take care of this house.

673
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,000
Look at you.

674
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,960
Why are you still here?

675
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,200
I'm here with Sang Qi.

676
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,320
Why do I have to meddle in your business?

677
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,160
I...

678
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,320
I'm here with you, Mr. Hua.

679
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,240
What if...

680
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,880
What if Sang Qi really enters my husband's house?

681
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,160
If others talk about him,

682
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,880
and say he's not a good man,

683
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,480
maybe I'll get into a

684
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,840
bad relationship.

685
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,200
I don't know what to do with Qi.

686
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,600
But if Miss Song criticizes us,

687
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,320
it's a mistake to be followed by others.

688
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,160
I advise you to talk to her.

689
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,040
Besides,

690
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,840
you should keep your parents' secret.

691
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,840
What Qi and Deputy Chief said can't be taken seriously.

692
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,680
Miss Song,

693
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
I advise you not to worry about it.

694
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,080
That's the best.

695
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,960
Let's go.

696
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,880
Why are you talking to him?

697
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,000
He's a quick talker.

698
00:27:59,280 --> 00:27:59,960
Let's go.

699
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,000
I booked a seat in Qingfeng Restaurant.

700
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,800
Let's go for a meal.

701
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,680
Don't go.

702
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,360
Father is waiting for me at home.

703
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
I'll just walk around.

704
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,480
Let's go.

705
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,120
What the hell was laughing at!

706
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,360
Sorry.

707
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,640
Pull harder.

708
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,880
Don't.

709
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:27,960
Sis.

710
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,480
Why am I doing this?

711
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
What should I do?

712
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,680
Why did you move all of a sudden?

713
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,440
What a humiliating shock.

714
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,040
That's strange.

715
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,400
Who's it?

716
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Daji?

717
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,440
Where's Daji?

718
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,640
I'll go get her.

719
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,240
I feel much better.

720
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,040
I feel like I'm going to die.

721
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,080
If you don't want to waste money today,

722
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,400
just don't want to pass this road.

723
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
Cut the crap.

724
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,240
Bring it on.

725
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,880
How dare you to fight under the light?

726
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,800
My leg.

727
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,080
You're quite good.

728
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Let's fight together.

729
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,080
You dare to sneak attack?

730
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,080
How about this?

731
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,680
I'll help you to tie your leg.

732
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
No need.

733
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
No need.

734
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
No need?

735
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Let's go.

736
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No need.

737
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Let's go.

738
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Hurry up.

739
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Let's go.

740
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Let's go.

741
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's go.

742
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Let's go.

743
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's go.

744
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Let's go.

745
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Let's go.

746
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Let's go.

747
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Hurry up.

748
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Not bad.

749
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Your kung fu has improved.

750
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Now it's not my turn to fight.

751
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Didn't we say we would go back for dinner tonight?

752
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We'll go to Bianjing tomorrow.

753
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Why do we still have to go to the town?

754
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
All these years,

755
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
thanks to your and Uncle's care,

756
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I can't just go to your house empty-handed.

757
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Come on.

758
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Why are you so polite?

759
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
My father is waiting for you.

760
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Let's go.

761
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Let's go.

762
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yan Qing.

763
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

764
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
In this year's imperial examination,

765
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Guo Zi Jian's performance is far superior to the previous year.

766
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Even the girl from the Sang family is famous.

767
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You really have a good teaching.

768
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I am very pleased.

769
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Thank you, Steward.

770
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I always reward and punish clearly.

771
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I said before

772
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
that if the performance is inferior to the previous year,

773
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I would remove your private job.

774
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Now it's far superior to the previous year.

775
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Of course, there should be rewards.

776
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Tell me.

777
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
What kind of reward do you want?

778
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I dare not ask for rewards.

779
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
But there is a suggestion.

780
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I hope you can consider it.

781
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I beg you

782
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
to expand Guo Zi Jian's

783
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
recruitment of female disciples.

784
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Steward,

785
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
you can't do that.

786
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
What's your opinion, Grand Tutor Song?

787
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Since our country was established,

788
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Guo Zi Jian has been the highest scholar.

789
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
For hundreds of years,

790
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
he has accepted a girl from the Sang family.

791
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
This special power has already broken the rules.

792
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
If this continues,

793
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
it is absolutely impossible.

794
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Grand Tutor Song is wrong.

795
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Although Guo Zi Jian

796
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
did not take the initiative to recruit girls,

797
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
he has never

798
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
broken the rules of not recruiting girls.

799
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
How can he break the rules?

800
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Sang Qi entered the school.

801
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
There have been many complaints among the people.

802
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
But after Sang Qi entered the school,

803
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
the people have been more active about it.

804
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Many girls

805
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
also want to get such an opportunity.

806
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
That's because...

807
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Enough.

808
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
This matter

809
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
can be settled only when you two argue.

810
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But I think

811
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yan Qing's proposal

812
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
is worth discussing.

813
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Yan Qing,

814
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Guo Zi Jian will have the ceremony in a few days.

815
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Your Majesty,

816
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
everything is ready.

817
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The ceremony is a blessing.

818
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
We bid farewell to the school and go to the disciples.

819
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It is very meaningful for these scholars.

820
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
As the Deputy Chief,

821
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you must take responsibility.

822
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

823
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Next week,

824
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Yuan Meng will start his training course at Songhu Channel.

825
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yes.

826
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
ften it!

827
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Y rings come out,

828
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
the sun rises.

841
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
How many lives are buried in the poison of love?

842
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
The sound of the thousand years of the dream

843
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The sound of the thousand years of the dream

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
A hand is empty, the life is in the hand

When you encounter difficulties,

886
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,060
remember to come to me.

887
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,060

it's also you and me who are going through the same thing.

889

I'm always by your side.

922
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,060
My Lord.

923
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Don't you mean,

924
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Using up your power,

925
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
you chose to kill me?

926
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,060
I didn't kill you.

927
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
You didn't kill me.

928
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
Your 35th Prince

929
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,060
moted me to a corpse.

930
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
It means that

931
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,620
But now I'm told not to report here

932
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,300
and not to study every day.

933
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,180
I feel empty in my heart.

934
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,540
I feel a little uncomfortable.

935
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,060
After you said that,

936
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,180
I feel a little sad, too.

937
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,660
You're much better than me.

938
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,780
You'll be an official in the court in the future.

939
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,540
You'll see some classmates.

940
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,980
As for me,

941
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,940
I might just go back to Guizhou.

942
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,020
When I can see everyone,

943
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,740
I'll see fate.

944
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:25,940
All right.

945
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,300
Let's not talk about it.

946
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,740
My family will celebrate the wedding in a few days.

947
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,780
Remember to come.

948
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,020
Qi.

949
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,180
Are you free tomorrow?

950
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,580
I've prepared a surprise for you.

951
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,820
Surprise?

952
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,940
I'd better not.

953
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,700
You know my relationship with Mr. Si.

954
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,180
It's not good if I go out with you alone.

955
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,980
It's not a surprise if you say it directly.

956
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:05,820
What?

957
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,460
Can't we be together

958
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,340
now?

959
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,020
No, I think...

960
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,100
All right.

961
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,220
All right.

962
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,780
I'll wait for you outside tomorrow.

963
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,500
All right.

964
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,900
Qi.

965
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,020
You're finally here.

966
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,100
Rui Xue?

967
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,180
Rui Xue.

968
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,060
This is your favorite one when you were a kid.

969
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,940
You used to play chess with me.

970
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:14,980
Am I right?

971
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,500
Yes, you are.

972
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,220
But I borrowed it from him in the north of the country

973
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
and got a big coin.

974
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,100
So I left it in the camp.

975
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,820
I asked my uncle to bring it here

976
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,460
as a gift for you to be promoted to the gold medal.

977
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,540
How is it?

978
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,060
Isn't it a good surprise?

979
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
I'm satisfied.

980
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,700
Not only this.

981
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:34,700
Here you are.

982
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,380
This is the bow you used when you were a kid.

983
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,260
Where did you find it?

984
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,540
You don't need to worry about it.

985
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,340
Do you want to go hunting like when you were a kid?

986
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:48,780
Let's go.

987
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,460
Go.

988
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,060
Qi.

989
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,620
I've always wanted to marry you.

990
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,100
But I forgot to tell you something important.

991
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,260
It's so far.

992
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,060
Listen to me first.

993
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,220
I'm the only one who stays in the border.

994
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,900
Only you wait for me.

995
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,300
After we parted, we got to know each other.

996
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,260
To me who lives in the border,

997
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,340
you're my only friend.

998
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,420
When I saw you,

999
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,500
I made up my mind.

1000
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
I'm afraid you'll suffer

1001
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,340
and turn from a yellow half to a yellow half.

1002
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
I want to face it with you.

1003
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,900
I don't want you to be embarrassed.

1004
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,420
So I asked Qian Jiu to help you.

1005
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,660
I'm afraid you'll suffer in the mountains.

1006
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,780
So I stayed in the mountains.

1007
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,420
Qi.

1008
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,780
Actually, I...

1009
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,660
Actually, I've always liked you.

1010
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,860
I can never be unknown

1011
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,260
like a perfect story.

1012
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,060
It's like I'm in the wind.

1013
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,780
My heart is in the city of unknown.

1014
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,780
Changed the beginning

1015
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,380
and lost the promise of love.

1016
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,900
I wrote the lyrics of the new moon.

1017
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:19,140
I also finished the life in this world.

1018
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,780
In the future, we'll be in love

1019
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,580
and become distant friends.

1020
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,780
In the future, we'll be in love

1021
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,380
and become distant friends.
