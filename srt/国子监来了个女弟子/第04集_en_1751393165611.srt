1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Who is he in love with?

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In this life,

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
it's not just people.

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When the spring comes,

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
let's spend the rest of our lives together.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Doctor Wen is here.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hurry.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Doctor Wen is here.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Doctor Wen, please save him.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yan Si Yi, you're too rude.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Please forgive me.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll definitely come back to apologize.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Doctor Wen, please save him.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Forget it. I'll go save him.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where is the patient?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Inside.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In the room.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hurry.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yan Si Yi,

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
how did you bring Doctor Wen here?

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you hear?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Doctor Wen is good at detoxification.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He sent people to search the house.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
When he knew that Doctor Wen was on his way home,

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
he went all the way to look for him.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What about Yan Si Yi?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I just got the news that he was in love with someone.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It happened in the Purple Sword.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We must investigate this.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Zhou Yue.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Zhou Yue.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How are you?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm fine.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Qi.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You must be okay.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm curious.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's obviously a drug.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why is Sang Qi poisoned?

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Was there no one else except you?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I...

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There was no one else.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I...

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And I don't understand

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
what's going on.

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Brother Song.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My father spent a lot of effort

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
to send me to the Purple Sword.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You must help me.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't want to be

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
kicked out because of this.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why are you panicking?

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We didn't find anything about it.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you so stupid?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hurry up.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Go and tell your father.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Qi Lang.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Didn't Dr. Wen already

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
detoxify Sang Qi?

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why is he still unconscious?

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Qi Lang.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sang Qi was poisoned.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Just like Sang Yu before.

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Just like Brother Yu.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There are symptoms of a concussion.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Qi Lang.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There are also marks of blood on it.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not a big deal.

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's just a small wound.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's not a big deal.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's just a small wound.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The investigation has been started.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The food used as evidence

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
has been sealed in the national sword's storage.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You know it.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did the powder found at the crime scene

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
get found in the Jinzhao Mansion?

78
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No news yet.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I have a friend

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
who is studying medicine.

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I can ask him for help.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Qi Lang.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You had a cold last night.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You had a cold.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Go back and rest early.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll stay.

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's okay.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll leave after Sang Qi is more stable.

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You go back first.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If so,

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll go back to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Deputy Chief is still here.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How is Sang Qi?

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He just woke up for a short time.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now he is sleeping.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Deputy Chief.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll get some hot water.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please take care of her.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll go to the Jinzhao Mansion first.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Keke.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Keke.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
Brother.

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,480
Brother.

122
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Am I dead?

123
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,760
Wu Wu

124
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,800
Wu Wu

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Siye.

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,120
I just heard Your song Coulson.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,640
I am really from the Tian family.

128
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,560
I know you.

129
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,400
I do know Brother Yu.

130
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,760
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

131
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,680
I'll tell you later.

132
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,600
This is not what's important now.

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,840
I can still study well in the Imperial College.

134
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,560
But I'm not well at home.

135
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,320
It happened suddenly.

136
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,960
You were poisoned after you ate that day.

137
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,920
You fainted in my study.

138
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,960
Poisoned?

139
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Who poisoned me?

140
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
Maybe I was the one who did it.

141
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,320
So,

142
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,440
you have enemies.

143
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,440
I helped the Imperial Court investigate the case.

144
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,280
I think I offended someone.

145
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,760
Did you find the person who poisoned you?

146
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,360
Not yet.

147
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
But the government has sealed the food and military relics

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
in the national treasury.

149
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,440
We will find out.

150
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,360
Okay.

151
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
When I'm well,

152
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,920
I'll go with the Deputy Chief to investigate the person who poisoned me.

153
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Don't think about this now.

154
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,280
What's important now is your health.

155
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,440
You have to get better.

156
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Master Sang.

157
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
Master Sang.

158
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,200
Master Sang.

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
Lower your voice.

160
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,640
You...

161
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,440
Why are you so rude?

162
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,520
Who are you?

163
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,080
You don't recognize me?

164
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,880
I'm your lady's best friend.

165
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,640
Move aside.

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,760
It's not appropriate for you to sneak in.

167
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
How could she have a friend like you?

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,840
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

169
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,040
Brother Chuo, she doesn't recognize me.

170
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,560
How is Sang Jing?

171
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,040
She's sleeping.

172
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,400
Deputy Chief is looking after her.

173
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
Deputy Chief is still in there?

174
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,280
I'll go and have a look.

175
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,240
Why can she go in but I can't?

176
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,560
You spilled my basin.

177
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,480
Pick it up.

178
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,240
I'll pick up the basin for you.

179
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,800
If you don't pick it up, don't go anywhere.

180
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,960
Move aside.

181
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,560
No.

182
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,200
Move aside.

183
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,800
No.

184
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,360
Fine.

185
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,600
You'll wait.

186
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
Move aside.

187
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,920
You're so rude.

188
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,280
Why are you so rude?

189
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,240
Get out.

190
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,960
Fine.

191
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,240
Deputy Chief.

192
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,560
Brother Chuo...

193
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,440
Deputy Chief is here too.

194
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,640
Did you find out the culprit behind this?

195
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
A'qi is new to Bianjing.

196
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,840
He doesn't have any enemies.

197
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,920
Who would do such a thing?

198
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,440
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

199
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,960
You're so well informed.

200
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,080
Did you find anyone suspicious

201
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,320
when you were hit?

202
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,040
No.

203
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,560
I'll send someone to investigate later.

204
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,960
A'qi, are you okay?

205
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,680
Did you take your medicine?

206
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,640
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

207
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,320
Take good care of her.

208
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,000
Sang Qi, I'll go now.

209
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,000
There's someone I'd like to see.

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,840
I've come across

211
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,360
many weird strings of foulra Remember.

212
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,200
You have weird hands.

213
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,160
I found frightening.

214
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:35,720
learnt the crashed

215
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,560
Baishi.

217
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,440
Baishi is here.

218
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,760
Send this letter to Nanshan Villa.

219
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,920
Send it to the guest.

220
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,120
Miss Su?

221
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,360
Yes, sir.

222
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
Panchen Fść

223
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,600
Here.

224
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,200
Xintian,

225
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,760
stop torturing me.

226
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
I've almost recovered.

227
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,720
has what?

228
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,520
Look at you.

229
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,200
Drink more.

230
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,040
No, no, no.

231
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,840
I gotında.

232
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,440
Besides,

233
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm still healthy.

234
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,560
By the way,

235
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,160
get ready for me.

236
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,680
I'm going back to school tomorrow.

237
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,760
You can go if you want.

238
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,640
Guo Zijian is closed today.

239
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,240
Who will go with you on New Year's Day?

240
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,000
Today?

241
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

242
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,120
Just lie down.

243
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,480
You're sick.

244
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,400
You don't want to go anywhere.

245
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,320
I'll go get you something to eat.

246
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,320
I can't see Guo Zijian after I close the door.

247
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,920
If I can't find the murderer and the poison,

248
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,280
I'm afraid that he will be in danger sooner or later.

249
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,840
Yanyan,

250
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
we're on holiday.

251
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Why don't we go for a drink?

252
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,400
Don't mention it.

253
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,840
Did you see his suitcase?

254
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,920
This is a homework from my mother.

255
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,360
It's okay.

256
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,960
It's not a big deal.

257
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,920
Don't bother me.

258
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,480
Come on.

259
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,040
Let's drink.

260
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,040
I'm not going.

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,480
Let's go.

262
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,160
Let's have a drink.

263
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah.

264
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,720
The wine from the Xiongxing is very good.

265
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,400
Let's go.

266
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,040
Just two bottles.

267
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,520
I don't want to go.

268
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,160
I'll arrange the homework.

269
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not going.

270
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,080
Let's go.

271
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Don't look for me.

272
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,080
Hurry up.

273
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,240
Don't run.

274
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,160
It's not sealed.

275
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,680
Who's there?

276
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,560
The military treasury is the most important place of the country.

277
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Who dares to break in?

278
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
No one.

279
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,440
Let's go.

280
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm warning you.

281
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,040
Don't try to bully me.

282
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,480
I...

283
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Are you kidding me?

284
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,120
What do you mean by bullying me?

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,800
How dare I bully you?

286
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,720
Besides, what...

287
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,280
When have I ever bullied you?

288
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,760
Don't talk nonsense.

289
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,320
Do you think I'm a fool?

290
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,120
I'm not.

291
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm not.

292
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,600
I'm not.

293
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm not.

294
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,280
I'm not.

295
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,120
I'm not.

296
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,920
I'm not.

297
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm not.

298
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
I'm not.

299
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm not.

300
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I didn't say anything.

301
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,920
Why are you here?

302
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,080
I...

303
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,800
I won't punish you for what you did today.

304
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
But you can't tell anyone

305
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
that we met here.

306
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,480
Otherwise,

307
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,880
I'll punish you for copying the library.

308
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,040
Deputy Chief.

309
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,480
I'm a girl of high status.

310
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,920
Why should I tell others

311
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,480
that we're alone

312
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
for a while?

313
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,800
You sound like me.

314
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,720
Why are you here?

315
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,040
You're most hungry and rid of the need for food.

316
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,880
Why are you here?

317
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,560
I...

318
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,480
Deputy Chief.

319
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,440
Look.

320
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,560
What?

321
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,640
Look at this.

322
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,960
What's this?

323
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,640
Bean sprouts.

324
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,400
What bean sprouts?

325
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,080
I made bean sprouts that day.

326
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,360
You should have told me earlier.

327
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,360
I told you earlier.

328
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,920
Did you bring your handkerchief?

329
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Give me your hairpin.

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,920
This is poisonous.

331
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Leave it for further investigation.

332
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,640
It's too late.

333
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,320
Let's take the evidence out.

334
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,640
Let's go.

335
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,480
What's going on?

336
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,080
The door can't be opened.

337
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,880
What's going on?

338
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,680
What's going on?

339
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,480
What's going on?

340
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,280
What's going on?

341
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,080
What's going on?

342
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,040
The door can't be opened.

343
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,800
Somebody!

344
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,320
It's useless.

345
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
The door is locked from outside.

346
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,440
Unless someone comes to save us.

347
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,960
Otherwise,

348
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,840
we will all be frozen to death here tonight.

349
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,320
Somebody!

350
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,280
Somebody!

351
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
Help!

352
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
What are you doing?

353
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm making some noise.

354
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,720
If the guards hear us,

355
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,960
they can save us.

356
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,760
Si Yan,

357
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,560
when he comes,

358
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,200
you run away.

359
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,000
Leave me alone.

360
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,600
You just knocked down the shelf behind you.

361
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,080
Nobody heard such a big noise.

362
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,680
Now you knock the door with a baton.

363
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,480
They can hear you.

364
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,040
You're right.

365
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,120
What should we do?

366
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,160
Before I die,

367
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,880
let's do something meaningful.

368
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,440
Lian Pian,

370
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,880
has Qi come back yet?

371
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,760
No.

372
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,760
He disappeared as soon as I came back.

373
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,040
He's not even recovered yet.

374
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,960
If Master finds out he's gone,

375
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,720
he'll blame me.

376
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,720
Is his student card still there?

377
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,440
I didn't see it just now.

378
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:18,960
I see.

379
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,880
Don't worry.

380
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,280
I'll make sure he comes back safely.

381
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,800
Okay.

382
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,760
Deputy Chief,

383
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,120
do you like watching fireworks?

384
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,720
Fireworks?

385
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,920
Yes.

386
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,320
I love watching fireworks.

387
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,680
The fireworks are flying in the sky

388
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,440
and are blown into a number of

389
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,520
beautiful blue.

390
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,960
When I think of that scene,

391
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,240
I feel like the whole person is hot.

392
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,520
It's hotter than eating steamed lamb

393
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,720
just out of the pot.

394
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,720
In the past, every New Year's Eve,

395
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
my father would take me to watch fireworks.

396
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
When I first went out,

397
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,280
I only felt so cold.

398
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,280
But when I saw fireworks,

399
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,920
I felt so warm.

400
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,840
It's like the cold air was blown away.

401
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,160
It's amazing.

402
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,720
My brother used to love watching fireworks.

403
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,240
Do you think

404
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,680
it's warmer in this scene?

405
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,120
The light shines in the light.

406
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,960
The fireworks are blowing away.

407
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
I guess so.

408
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,600
In the past,

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,280
he would take me to watch fireworks every year.

410
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,960
But now...

411
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,040
Deputy Chief,

412
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,800
why are you so abnormal today?

413
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,520
You can't even take care of me.

414
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,920
How am I abnormal?

415
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,560
Isn't it natural for a teacher to take care of his students?

416
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,360
That's right.

417
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,280
Sang Qi,

418
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,720
didn't you always want to see that Bai?

419
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,840
Didn't you always want to see that Bai?

420
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,080
You just...

421
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,040
When we go out,

422
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
I'll take you to see him.

423
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,240
Are you serious?

424
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,880
Yes.

425
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,920
Gui Yan,

426
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
are you not going out?

427
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,880
We're all going to...

428
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,520
I'm fine.

429
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,280
I'm fine.

430
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,360
But you're not well.

431
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,040
Are you feeling well?

432
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,480
If you really care about me,

433
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,120
why don't you just take the bag away?

434
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,160
Please.

435
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,400
Why are you still thinking about this?

436
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,640
If we can really go out alive,

437
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,440
I'll think about it, okay?

438
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,600
Guo Zi Jian is on vacation on the day of the wedding.

439
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,080
If you can really go out alive,

440
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,600
when you see me next time,

441
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,880
will you really wait until the last day of the lunar month?

442
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,560
Why don't you think about

443
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,640
how many books you've read in the past few months?

444
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,400
No, no, no.

445
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,040
Just cover it up.

446
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,600
What are you doing?

447
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,080
We all have to be fine.

448
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,400
We have to go out well.

449
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,040
Look at him.

450
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,520
Look at him.

451
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,920
He saw me last year.

452
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,640
Cover it up.

453
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,440
Then don't move.

454
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
When are you going to get married?

455
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,560
I'm Si Yi.

456
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,120
Listen to me.

457
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,840
Don't move.

458
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,440
Hurry up.

459
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,240
The snow is covering my body.

460
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,800
The love is short.

461
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,040
The fragrance is bright.

462
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,520
The candlelight is flickering.

463
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,560
The flowers are falling.

464
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,320
You are like a firefly.

465
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,560
All the unfulfilled wishes

466
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,840
are engraved in my heart.

467
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,840
I want to meet you.

468
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,720
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

469
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,000
I want to walk through the fireworks with you.

470
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,640
I want to see the world with you.

471
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,160
One day, we will stop for a while.

472
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,880
The fragrance is bright.

473
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,240
The sun and the moon are in full bloom.

474
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,920
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

475
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,720
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

476
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,440
Young Master.

477
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,560
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

478
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,440
Are you all right?

479
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,520
Bai Shen, are you late?

480
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,760
I...

481
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,640
Help me up.

482
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Miss Sang is...

483
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,840
Slow down.

484
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,560
It's okay.

485
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,640
Sang Qi.

486
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,360
Come on.

487
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
My leg.

488
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
What's wrong with your leg?

489
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,760
I'm fine.

490
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,880
It's probably because my leg is numb.

491
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,440
I don't want to get a fever.

492
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,680
I'll be fine after a rest.

493
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,840
Bai Shen.

494
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,640
Thank you for coming to save us.

495
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,000
Otherwise, Deputy Chief and I

496
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
will really die inside.

497
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,400
It's all Young Master's arrangement.

498
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,280
Young Master asked me to take over the outside.

499
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,440
If he doesn't come out for an hour,

500
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
let me go find him.

501
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,280
Deputy Chief is really a good spirit.

502
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,160
Our Young Master is a cunning man.

503
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,440
He can't be trusted.

504
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,560
He's a good man.

505
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,600
He's a good man.

506
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
He's a good man.

507
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
He's a good man.

508
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
He's a good man.

509
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
He's a good man.

510
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,560
Young Master is a cunning man.

511
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,560
He's a cunning man.

512
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
He can't be trusted.

513
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
You talk too much.

514
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Go get the carriage.

515
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,960
Yes, Young Master.

516
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,200
Deputy Chief.

517
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,400
You know Bai Shi and Zai Fu

518
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
are so nervous inside.

519
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,040
They're so nervous.

520
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,880
I thought we were all going to die.

521
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,800
We have to make the worst plan.

522
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,000
In case Bai Shi can't arrive on time.

523
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,760
When will you take me to see Xiao Bai?

524
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,560
I said that to save you.

525
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,960
I want to cheer you up.

526
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,360
I don't know Xiao Bai.

527
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,560
How can I take you to see her?

528
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,360
Why are you lying again?

529
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,360
You met me?

530
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,160
If it wasn't for saving you,

531
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,360
I, the Imperial College Deputy Chief,

532
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,560
wouldn't be lying.

533
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
You're not lying that often.

534
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,960
Do you want me to list some for you?

535
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,560
Why don't you come down and search for it yourself?

536
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,960
I'll list it another day.

537
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Sang Qi.

538
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Sang Qi.

539
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Sang Qi.

540
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Why are you here?

541
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Deputy Chief.

542
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,760
Why are you here too?

543
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,760
It's a long story.

544
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,960
Why are you here too?

545
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
I went to look for the evidence.

546
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,960
But I was trapped in the freezer.

547
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
Deputy Chief saved me out of the freezer.

548
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,560
Chang An is a police officer.

549
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,760
Chang An is a government official.

550
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,360
Why are you acting on your own?

551
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,560
Luckily, you're fine.

552
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Here.

553
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,760
I'll take you home.

554
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,360
Give the coat back to Deputy Chief.

555
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,160
No need.

556
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm not cold anymore.

557
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Thank you.

558
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
Deputy Chief, go back and rest.

559
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,760
It's enough that Zhuo Wen Yuan takes me home.

560
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,760
I'm fine.

561
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
A poison that's used in the Western Regions.

562
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,160
The Western Regions is a thousand miles away from us.

563
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,360
Why would this poison appear in the territory of Bianjing?

564
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I don't know.

565
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,560
I just know that it's a poison.

566
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
I don't know.

567
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
I just know that it's a poison.

568
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
Go out first.

569
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Don't get hurt.

570
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Yes, Master.

571
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,760
Master, you must be careful.

572
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
She's feeling anxious so her eyes are filling with sports.

573
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,760
Seven pairs of eyes acted appoint one to serve the other.

574
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,760
It's the same poison.

575
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Great!

576
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,200
Great

577
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,280
Awesome

578
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,120
Thank you

579
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
Good

580
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,240
I already dreamed of the same dream.

581
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,060
I

582
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,780
My Lady, you're awake.

583
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,420
What's going on outside? It's so hot.

584
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,100
My Lady, it's the New Year's Eve today.

585
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,780
It's the New Year's Eve?

586
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,620
So soon?

587
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,580
Where's Father?

588
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,260
He went to the Palace to give His Majesty a heart.

589
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,300
I see.

590
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,220
Let's get ready to eat.

591
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:52,980
By the way,

592
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,340
Mr. Zhuo has been waiting for you in the hall.

593
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,500
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

594
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,740
I heard today that you had your birthday.

595
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,100
To celebrate it.

596
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,300
Let's welcome the emperor.

597
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,500
Prepare breakfast.

598
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,180
A decent meal justSteph miseo

599
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,100
You're here.

600
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,780
I specially prepared the tele uyja justfor you.

601
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,020
Hurry up.

602
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,780
Do not catch a cold if you're sick

603
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,300
Thank you so much.

604
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:30,940
I'm sorry.

605
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,580
Slow down. No one is trying to steal it from you.

606
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,220
What's wrong?

607
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,060
Did I do something

608
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,340
that made you unhappy?

609
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,420
No.

610
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,660
I suddenly remember the past years.

611
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,700
In the past years,

612
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,300
my father would hold a

613
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,580
one-year firework party every year.

614
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,620
Although there were few people in the tournament,

615
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,660
it was still lively.

616
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,540
I felt a lot cooler

617
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,100
in the lively border.

618
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,980
The Spring Festival is over.

619
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,940
It's almost the Spring Festival.

620
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,100
When the Spring Festival comes,

621
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,420
it's my day to perform.

622
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,900
All right. Stop thinking.

623
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,580
Let's eat.

624
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,740
Come on.

625
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:13,900
Young Master.

626
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,140
You don't like

627
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,060
smokey dust.

628
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,100
Why did you

629
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,020
suddenly bring so many?

630
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,620
How long will you keep it?

631
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm sorry.

632
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,300
Maybe the person who is smoking

633
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,700
is in the same mind as me.

634
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:32,900
Maybe

635
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,220
he wants me to stop giving up.

636
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,380
Look.

637
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,940
It's so red and purple.

638
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,740
Brother Yu.

639
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,380
I will take care of it for you.

640
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,820
If you really care about me,

641
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,940
why don't you

642
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,540
just take the bag away?

643
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,540
Please.

644
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,540
Why are you still thinking about this?

645
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,740
If we can really get out of here alive,

646
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,340
I will consider it.

647
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:36,740
All right?

648
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,500
Miss.

649
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,740
Get ready to change.

650
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,940
It's all ready.

651
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,380
What?

652
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,540
Are you still thinking about

653
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,660
the gift of the pouch?

654
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,500
I thought about it carefully.

655
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,740
I think the pouch I gave you

656
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,980
was too hasty.

657
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,540
I plan to go to the Yan family

658
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,540
to give you a pouch tomorrow.

659
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,740
Let's see if he will accept it.

660
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,300
Although I know

661
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,340
that it will be a second chance,

662
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,180
he likes to go out and get bored.

663
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,060
But now that the time has come,

664
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,820
I can only wait for the horse to die.

665
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,300
I'm sorry.

666
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,060
I'm sorry.

667
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:19,700
I'm sorry.

668
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,300
I'm sorry.

669
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,060
I'm sorry.

670
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:21,860
I'm sorry.

671
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:22,740
I'm sorry.

672
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,500
I'm sorry.

673
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,060
I'm sorry.

674
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,540
You can come here and have a rest.

675
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,060
I'll treat you to a good meal next time.

676
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,620
Sir, here is your meal.

677
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:35,940
Please.

678
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,620
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

679
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,180
Please come in.

680
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:41,940
After you.

681
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,820
Please, sir.

682
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,980
Please have a seat.

683
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,660
This one!

684
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,180
It seems that the Lantern Festival is coming soon.

685
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,780
It seems that Miss Sang Qi's pouch

686
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,420
hasn't been sent out yet.

687
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,420
I knew it would be like this.

688
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,420
So,

689
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,540
I went to the clothes store to buy a new one.

690
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,860
This time,

691
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,620
I will dress up

692
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,500
and look at the fun of Sang Qi.

693
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,500
How dare you make a bet with me?

694
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,820
You are really ungrateful.

695
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,500
Who is that Ye Yun Zhi?

696
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,460
He is my future husband.

697
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,860
He is just a young man in the mansion.

698
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,300
How can he be so good to Sang Qi?

699
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,300
But I think Zhuo Wen Yuan

700
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,500
is really interested in Sang Qi.

701
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,220
Maybe Sang Qi

702
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,020
has the charm of attracting men.

703
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,980
Zhuo Wen Yuan is just the foreign wife of the royal family.

704
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,020
He has no power or power.

705
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,580
I guess he must be after the position of Grand Commandant Sang.

706
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,180
I despise such a person.

707
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:38,820
Besides,

708
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,660
he is too romantic.

709
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,500
I heard that he always comes to Qingfeng Restaurant

710
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,660
to find a singer.

711
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,980
If a woman only thinks about

712
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,420
being with a man for a lifetime,

713
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,020
I'm afraid he is a good man

714
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,740
for a man like him.

715
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,140
By the way, A Yan.

716
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,460
Where is Sister Su?

717
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,100
Why hasn't she heard anything

718
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,900
since she came here?

719
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,060
Sister Su went back to her hometown to attend the school.

720
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,820
She has been in Nan Shan Village for three years.

721
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,140
The school is almost full.

722
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,020
I heard that she will be back to Bianjing soon.

723
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,860
Sister Su is coming back?

724
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,060
A Yan.

725
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,820
Why don't you worry?

726
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,540
She and Deputy Chief

727
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,940
are all good friends.

728
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,980
Why should I worry?

729
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,100
I, Song Jiayin,

730
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,420
am the destined one for her.

731
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,580
But Sister Su is a nice person.

732
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,780
She is a good teacher and a kind person.

733
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,220
For the sake of her knowledge and knowledge,

734
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,780
she can consider

735
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,260
coming to my Yan Mansion as a concubine.

736
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,420
Come on.

737
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,980
I wish you a happy marriage.

738
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,620
Have you made a decision

739
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,780
about the city?

740
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,820
I have made it clear.

741
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,860
Miss, I don't know who it is.

742
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,780
I just lost a letter in the courtyard.

743
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,620
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,580
I'm sorry.

745
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,460
I'm sorry.

746
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,460
I'm sorry.

747
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,500
I'm sorry.

748
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,580
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
I'm sorry.

750
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,740
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,820
I'm sorry.

752
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,980
I'm sorry.

754
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,060
I'm sorry.

755
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,140
I'm sorry.

756
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
I'm sorry.

757
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,860
I'm sorry.

758
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,980
I'm sorry.

759
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,820
I'm sorry.

760
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,900
I'm sorry.

761
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,980
I'm sorry.

762
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,300
I'm sorry.

763
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:54,800
Shan'ис

764
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,320
Shan'is

765
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,420
Brother Fan

766
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,020
Brother Fan

767
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,300
Can you help me pass word to Professor Ren no. 1

768
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,460
I don't know when she'll be back.

769
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,140
I'll come back another day.

770
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,780
Young Master.

771
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,940
You've been looking forward to this trip.

772
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,260
What's on your mind?

773
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,060
Nothing.

774
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,260
Young Master, the carriage is over there.

775
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,820
Deputy Chief is not home.

776
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,060
Oh, my God.

777
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,820
Am I destined to be embarrassed at the party?

778
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,700
I got it. I got it.

779
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,100
Hurry up.

780
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,140
Don't get wet. Hurry up.

781
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,260
Hurry up.

782
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,220
Hurry up.

783
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:13,820
Hurry up.

784
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,300
It's so hot.

785
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,780
It's so hot.

786
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,580
It's so hot.

787
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,220
It's so hot.

788
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:17,740
Yeah.

789
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,580
It's so hot.

790
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,140
Yeah.

791
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,940
It's so hot.

792
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:20,860
Yeah.

793
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,500
It's so hot.

794
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,460
Yeah.

795
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,780
Yeah.

796
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,460
What a bad weather.

797
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,780
What's the party tomorrow?

798
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,580
Yeah.

799
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,420
Everyone has to wear a wedding dress

800
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,540
at the party.

801
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,420
Xu Chi, please help me.

802
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,340
Help me, Sang Qi.

803
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:38,860
Get off.

804
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,060
Get off the big one.

805
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,340
Get off more.

806
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,100
Qi.

807
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,420
I thought it was a lady from a rich family.

808
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,100
Why are you dressed like this today?

809
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,100
Aren't you afraid of getting cold?

810
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,700
Why didn't I get cold?

811
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,540
Besides,

812
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,100
it's better to get cold.

813
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,980
If you get cold, you don't have to play the zither tomorrow.

814
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,900
Why do you do this?

815
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,100
Don't worry.

816
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,380
I'll arrange it for myself tomorrow.

817
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,580
We fell in love with each other.

818
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,220
That's why I have this vision.

819
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,220
If the past is the past,

820
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,740
it will become my past.

821
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,900
My past.

822
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,780
I can't be the unknown.

823
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,180
I'll tell you a perfect story.

824
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:23,980
I'm a stubborn person.

825
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,660
My heart is in a remote city.

826
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,660
It's changed its beginning.

827
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,260
It's the world of love.

828
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,780
I write the lyrics of the new moon.

829
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,100
I also end this life in silence.

830
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,740
In the future, we will talk about the past.

831
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,620
It will become a deep kiss.

832
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,740
In the future, we will talk about the past.

833
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:56,380
It will become a deep kiss.
