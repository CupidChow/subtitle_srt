00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,720
Someone quietly ignited

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,100
The blue

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,080

32
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,520
Episode 14

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,400
A DIUN

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,620
I always said I wanted to marry you

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,740
But I didn't tell you the most important thing

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,400
Zhuo Wen Yuan

37
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,100
Just listen to me

38
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,940
But I was in the Tournament.

39
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,740
Only you waited for me.

40
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,020
After we parted, we met each other.

41
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,060
To me, who lived in the border,

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,180
you were my only friend.

43
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,100
When I saw you,

44
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,180
I made up my mind.

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,780
Actually, I've always liked you.

46
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,140
Zhou Wen Yuan.

47
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,060
I suddenly feel

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,260
that I don't want to say this to you.

49
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,540
I want to say it to myself.

50
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,500
I know.

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,580
Actually, I know

52
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,580
that you and Yan Yun Zhi

53
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,100
are meant to be.

54
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,780
But...

55
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,660
But I like you.

56
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,700
It's my own business.

57
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,940
style

58
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
No matter how tying dire the hunter is...

59
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,220
If there were no prey,

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,580
he couldn't hit anything.

61
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,100
Besides, we have grown up now.

62
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,820
However good the service of a device with 20 FE36åœ°

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,860
It's not good for me now.

64
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,380
Here.

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,820
For you.

66
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:32,940
Go.

67
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,700
Stop.

68
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,700
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

69
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,420
Let me tell you again.

70
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,180
In my heart,

71
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,620
there's only one Ye Yun Zhi.

72
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,020
You don't have to waste time on me.

73
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,500
So,

74
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,980
we can be friends again.

75
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,460
I'm leaving.

76
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,540
If it weren't for the twenty-seventh day celebration,

77
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,380
we wouldn't be like this.

78
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,980
Sang Qi.

79
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,740
You forced me to take this step.

80
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,860
Let's go together.

81
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,740
You went out with Zhou En Yuan?

82
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,380
How do you know?

83
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,740
Shouldn't I know?

84
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,820
That's not what I meant.

85
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,820
You've been out for so long.

86
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,940
Should I know what you said?

87
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,500
Yes.

88
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,100
You must know.

89
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,780
I don't want to know.

90
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,460
Why are you laughing?

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,300
I'm serious.

92
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,940
You really don't want to know

93
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,900
what we said?

94
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,060
Of course I do.

95
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,500
But I shouldn't know.

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,620
There's no such thing as shouldn't.

97
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,500
This is a human nature.

98
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,580
But I shouldn't know

99
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,420
what you said.

100
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,300
But it doesn't mean I don't mind.

101
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,420
It doesn't mean

102
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,100
you don't need to make it up to me.

103
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,620
Are you angry?

104
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,260
Can you make it up to me?

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,100
Of course I can.

106
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,540
No, I'm not.

107
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,420
I'm not angry.

108
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,860
When we get married,

109
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,060
where do you want to hold the ceremony?

110
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,660
Get married?

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,260
Why are you getting married so soon?

112
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,460
But before getting married,

113
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,660
it should be a proposal.

114
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,260
Yes.

115
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,900
According to the order,

116
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,020
we should make a proposal first.

117
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,060
But the proposal

118
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,900
is made by the elders in the family.

119
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,380
We can't do anything wrong

120
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,420
when we visit them.

121
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,860
The ceremony is different.

122
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,420
We can decide

123
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,940
the ceremony ourselves.

124
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,700
There's only one thing in this life.

125
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,060
I want to make you remember it for the rest of your life.

126
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,580
Let's meet in the Imperial College.

127
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,620
The Imperial College is where we know each other.

128
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,340
It's also important to Yuxiong.

129
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,420
Okay.

130
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,820
Let's meet in the Imperial College.

131
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,580
But

132
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,300
I want to go back to the border

133
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,380
and find a set of wedding dresses.

134
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,140
Okay.

135
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:53,820
I'll listen to you.

136
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,500
What's the name of our child in the future?

137
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,100
You tell me.

138
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,260
What's the name?

139
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,260
Why do you suddenly say that?

140
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:42,220
It's like all the lights on the Duty Loaf

141
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,980
Enough.

142
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,140
Forget about it.

143
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,620
You magnetize me,

144
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,100
and it means you're my new girlfriend again.

145
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,100
Jiang Chen.

146
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,940
I have a big lame.

147
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:08,820
She...

148
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,620
And I didn't expect that

149
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,620
he was so thoughtful and considerate.

150
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,380
He knew that Guo Zijian was very loyal to me.

151
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,340
He even proposed to marry me in Guo Zijian.

152
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,580
And I told him that

153
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,420
I wanted to go back to the border and hold a return party.

154
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,500
He agreed without hesitation.

155
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,860
He also said

156
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,260
that there was a child who could trust me.

157
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,700
He said that he could trust me.

158
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,940
Another child could trust him.

159
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,340
In this way, we could have two children.

160
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,860
No.

161
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,820
He said that it's not worth two children.

162
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,140
He said that we could have many children.

163
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,100
So funny.

164
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,420
Two children.

165
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,340
If there are four children,

166
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,940
it means that two children trust him

167
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,220
and two children trust me.

168
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Sang family has a daughter.

169
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,020
Sang Wei can't escape from this.

170
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,220
Yuxiu.

171
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
I have good news to tell you.

172
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,060
A'qi didn't disappoint you.

173
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,260
This time, the exam was in the second class.

174
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,980
We agreed that

175
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,740
after the exam,

176
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,460
we would tell you about us.

177
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,580
Not only that,

178
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,660
I prepared the gifts for you.

179
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,220
I'm going to propose marriage to you tonight.

180
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,660
Yuxiu.

181
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,780
I won't let you down.

182
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,420
I'll use all my strength

183
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,460
to take care of A'qi.

184
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,700
Good boy.

185
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,260
You're not that close to our family.

186
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,460
Grand Commandant Sang.

187
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,060
I heard that

188
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,380
you and Yu'er are close.

189
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,620
It's rare that you've been

190
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,300
visiting us for so many years.

191
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,060
It's my greatest pleasure

192
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,380
to be your best friend.

193
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,980
But Yu'er is Yu'er.

194
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,100
A'qi is A'qi.

195
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,540
I won't go back on my word.

196
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,700
I don't agree with you and A'qi.

197
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,900
Grand Commandant Sang, are you worried about something?

198
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,180
No matter what,

199
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,380
I'll do my best to make you satisfied.

200
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,980
I'll be frank.

201
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,740
You're not the most satisfying candidate in my heart.

202
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,020
I'm grateful that you wish my daughter

203
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,620
to be reliable.

204
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,700
But I'm just a daughter.

205
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,940
I can't tolerate any grievance.

206
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,900
I need to find

207
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,780
a family that can protect her.

208
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,180
Grand Commandant Sang.

209
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,260
I understand what you mean.

210
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,940
But I'll still propose marriage.

211
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,180
If you don't agree, I'll come again.

212
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,020
I'll make everyone see my determination.

213
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,980
Then you can do whatever you want.

214
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,940
I'll see how long you can do that.

215
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,460
You may leave.

216
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,060
I will.

217
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,660
All right.

218
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
For me to be performant and Miss Including

219
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,540
is considered a puppy before seeing the entrancing military department.

220
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,460
I'll be the one that the guards do everything for.

221
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,740
Yu Xiu, I'm leaving first.

222
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,900
You must have caused me

223
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,300
some trouble outside.

224
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,260
I've completed my studies

225
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,020
and dared to tell you.

226
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,980
I've found someone I like.

227
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,380
Please allow me

228
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,980
to propose to her.

229
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,700
Sure.

230
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,340
I've been thinking about

231
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,700
your marriage.

232
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,740
I've prepared the betrothal gifts for you.

233
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,420
Which family is she from?

234
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,100
The Sang family.

235
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,660
Dr. Sang?

236
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,300
I've heard about it.

237
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,380
But I didn't expect you to marry her.

238
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,940
Mother has known it.

239
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,140
I'm worried...

240
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,060
I know what you're worried about.

241
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,940
The Sang family

242
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,100
is a little bit arrogant.

243
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,780
People outside are so straightforward.

244
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,860
Are you worried that I won't agree

245
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,940
and help her get married?

246
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,340
I don't care what people outside say.

247
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,340
I've liked her for a long time.

248
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,820
She's

249
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,460
lively,

250
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,820
thoughtful

251
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,940
and has her own ideas.

252
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,340
She's not a girl from a common family.

253
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,980
I see.

254
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,780
It's good to hear that.

255
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,660
I heard she grew up outside.

256
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,540
She's in good health.

257
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,740
Then our Yan family

258
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,060
will be very happy.

259
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,620
I'm glad to hear that.

260
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
But she does

261
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
take good care of the Sang family.

262
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,900
She's good at cooking.

263
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,340
She's a virtuous person.

264
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,580
No wonder Dr. Sang likes her so much.

265
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,820
You're right to take care of her.

266
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,980
She's probably

267
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,100
old enough to get married.

268
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,860
But you're sure

269
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
that Dr. Sang likes her so much?

270
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm not

271
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,980
seeing you

272
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,820
because of this.

273
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,780
It's okay.

274
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,900
When I see you,

275
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,340
we'll have a good marriage.

276
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,180
We can't delay it.

277
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,220
We should get what we want first.

278
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,860
Today is a good day.

279
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,100
We'll go now.

280
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,580
Then...

281
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,060
Then I'll bring the betrothal gifts

282
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,260
and wait for the important day.

283
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:38,860
I'll go

284
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,820
and bring someone important.

285
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,220
Look at you.

286
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,340
You're so grumpy.

287
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,340
Go and check on her.

288
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,620
Don't be so stingy.

289
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,660
Yes, Madam.

290
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,820
Yes, Madam.

291
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,620
Lian Pian.

292
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,540
Lian Pian.

293
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,340
Where are you?

294
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,340
Master, what happened?

295
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,220
Such a big thing happened at home.

296
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,900
Why didn't you tell me about it?

297
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,140
I...

298
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,980
I was in a good mood

299
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,260
with Mr. Yan.

300
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,060
Nothing happened

301
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,180
in the music world.

302
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,700
You?

303
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,780
You and Ye Jialang?

304
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,340
I'm confused.

305
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,420
I forgot you and Qi were in the same age.

306
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,820
It's time to talk about marriage.

307
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,940
You've been with the Sang family for so many years.

308
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,940
I usually

309
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,740
didn't care about you.

310
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,460
I didn't know

311
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,420
you and Yan Jialang were in the same age.

312
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,420
I'm just a maid.

313
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,180
I don't want to disappoint her.

314
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,220
If she can decide

315
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,300
her own marriage,

316
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,380
I can

317
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,380
let you marry her.

318
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,660
If her family doesn't trust me,

319
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,820
the Sang family

320
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,620
is not a family

321
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,020
of the ordinary people.

322
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,060
You can live in the ancestral house.

323
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,500
Come on.

324
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,140
Dad,

325
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,500
you're the best brother

326
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,180
in Bianning City.

327
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:26,660
No,

328
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,700
you're the best brother

329
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,860
in the world.

330
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,900
Lin Tian,

331
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,980
call me sister.

332
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,740
Sister.

333
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:33,820
You...

334
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,100
Sister.

335
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:37,900
Come on.

336
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,100
What's wrong?

337
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,300
I'm fine.

338
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:46,980
Fu,

339
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,140
close all the doors in the house.

340
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,980
No one is allowed to enter.

341
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,620
Dad,

342
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,980
why do you close all the doors in the house?

343
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,860
Yan Tian,

344
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,380
do you think I'm weird?

345
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,580
I'm happy and angry at the same time.

346
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,860
No.

347
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,140
I think you're nice.

348
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,060
Call me sister.

349
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,940
Sister.

350
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,740
Sister.

351
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,700
Sister.

352
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,660
Deputy Chief.

353
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,900
Deputy Chief.

354
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,260
Come on.

355
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,460
Tell me to go to the Imperial Guards' Mansion.

356
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,740
Imperial Guards' Mansion?

357
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,580
What's up?

358
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,260
I'm going to propose to Lian Pian today.

359
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,780
Wait.

360
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,540
It seems that good things

361
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,540
are going to happen today.

362
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,220
Look.

363
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,540
Let's go.

364
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,220
Get in the car.

365
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,780
Sorry.

366
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,500
The Imperial Guards' Mansion is not available today.

367
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,660
Please come again some other day.

368
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,140
You have to be available.

369
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,980
Otherwise,

370
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,060
it will delay the good things of your family.

371
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,340
My family doesn't like

372
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,860
to be rejected by others.

373
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,380
Madam Yan.

374
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,580
I'm sorry.

375
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,860
Please come in.

376
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,580
I'll go tell my master.

377
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,220
I'll go tell my master.

378
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,020
I'll go tell my master.

379
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,740
I'll go tell my master.

380
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,380
I'll go tell my master.

381
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,100
I'll go tell my master.

382
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,700
I'll go tell my master.

383
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,380
I'll go tell my master.

384
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,740
I'll go tell my master.

385
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,860
Madam, please.

386
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,300
She is quite

387
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,620
a good girl.

388
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,500
Madam Yan.

389
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,860
I didn't expect you to come so soon.

390
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,980
Grand Commandant Sang.

391
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,820
I'm sure you all know my intention.

392
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,540
Since it's a big event,

393
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,100
we don't have to be in a hurry.

394
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,980
If you're willing to accept it,

395
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,660
I'll be the happiest.

396
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,220
It's all in the children's mind.

397
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,860
We're just going through the process.

398
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,660
Please.

399
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,860
Yesterday, Grandfather just said he would be the host.

400
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,820
Today, he brought so many things to mention.

401
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,100
Grandfather is really

402
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,660
very good at it.

403
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,660
Both of his mother and son are so quick-witted.

404
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,300
I underestimated him.

405
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,420
Okay.

406
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,740
I didn't look carefully before.

407
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,620
Now that I look at him,

408
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,060
he's really a lovely man.

409
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,460
Lovely man.

410
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,740
Grand Commandant.

411
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,540
Grand Commandant Sang.

412
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,140
Mother.

413
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,700
Madam Yan.

414
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:09,700
Mother.

415
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,500
You really have a son's heart.

416
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,580
All right.

417
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,540
Everyone is here.

418
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,580
I won't waste time.

419
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,620
Grand Commandant Sang.

420
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,140
Sang Qi.

421
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,780
From now on,

422
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,540
you're the daughter-in-law of our family.

423
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,540
What?

424
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,740
No, no, no.

425
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,980
Madam Yan.

426
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,500
You must have mistaken me.

427
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,820
I'm not the one that Yan Yan wants to marry.

428
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,060
And I'm not the one that she wants to marry.

429
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,260
I'm not the one that she wants to marry.

430
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,460
Look at you.

431
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,420
Good girl.

432
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,300
Don't be nervous.

433
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,420
You're even saying the wrong thing.

434
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
I'm not saying the wrong thing.

435
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,060
Madam Yan.

436
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,220
I'm the one that Sang Qi wants to marry.

437
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,140
Did you do something wrong?

438
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,220
Yes.

439
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,180
Why didn't you tell me?

440
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,300
I told you yesterday.

441
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,660
I did what I said.

442
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,060
I'm not going to marry you.

443
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,620
Madam Yan.

444
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,100
You may not know this.

445
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
Sang Qi and I

446
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,940
have already made it public.

447
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,780
I'm here today

448
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,220
to tell Grand Commandant Sang

449
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,260
about what happened between us.

450
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,220
And then I'll officially propose to Sang Qi.

451
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,420
Grand Commandant Sang.

452
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,820
This is my birthday gift.

453
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,660
Wait a second.

454
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,900
Madam Yan.

455
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,300
You should be considerate of your parents.

456
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,700
Besides,

457
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,020
it's such a big matter.

458
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,020
You always need your parents to make the decision.

459
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,860
What's going on

460
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,980
if you come here alone?

461
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,340
Don't fight with our family.

462
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,620
Madam Yan.

463
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,020
You should

464
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
ask who Yan Yan

465
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,740
came here to talk to.

466
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,700
Yes.

467
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,580
There's only one lady in the Sang family.

468
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,740
Can't my son

469
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,060
marry her?

470
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,420
Yan.

471
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,380
Ridiculous!

472
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,780
Your father is the Grand Tutor.

473
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,580
He wants to marry a maid?

474
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,100
Madam Yan.

475
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,660
What you said

476
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,300
is a little inappropriate.

477
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,220
Lian Pian and I

478
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,740
grew up together.

479
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,580
We've never been

480
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,820
a maid or a maid.

481
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,820
We work together.

482
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,540
We eat together.

483
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,260
Right, Father?

484
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,500
We've never seen Lian Pian

485
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,420
in person.

486
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,060
Right, Father?

487
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,700
Madam Yan.

488
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,580
You're in a hurry.

489
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,660
I didn't introduce you to her.

490
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,260
Lian Pian grew up with me.

491
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,220
I treat her

492
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,500
as my daughter.

493
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:44,780
Right.

494
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,340
I'm going to choose a good day

495
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,540
to take her into my family

496
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,580
and become the Third Miss

497
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,100
of the Sang family.

498
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,340
Grand Tutor Sang.

499
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,180
We're all

500
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,420
well-known people.

501
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,220
How can we agree

502
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,140
to this ridiculous thing?

503
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,140
A maid

504
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,180
is impossible to get into our family.

505
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,140
Even a concubine

506
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,620
or even a stranger

507
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,500
is not enough.

508
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,580
You're too ungrateful.

509
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,820
Only Sang Qi

510
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,540
is qualified to be in our family.

511
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,540
Mo Xi.

512
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,100
I don't want Sang Qi.

513
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
I want to marry Lian Pian.

514
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,180
Shut up.

515
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,380
Madam Yan.

516
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,420
Don't be angry.

517
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,340
I'm afraid

518
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,820
we can't get married today.

519
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,020
Lian Pian, don't be angry.

520
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,620
Deputy Chief Ye.

521
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,220
You

522
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,300
will come back when you're sure.

523
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,060
Madam Yan.

524
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,820
You and Yan Xiaolang

525
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,220
will discuss it with her later.

526
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,660
Although I'm a martial artist,

527
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,660
I won't

528
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,820
make any decision

529
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,140
about the child's life.

530
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,660
Grand Tutor Sang.

531
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,500
You're right.

532
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
We'll take our leave.

533
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,420
Yan Yan.

534
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,460
Let's go.

535
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
I'm the happiest

536
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,780
when you propose to me.

537
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,300
But I didn't expect

538
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,940
things to turn out like this.

539
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,260
I'm so emotional

540
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,700
every day.

541
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,580
It's up to her

542
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,900
whether she's worthy of Lian Pian.

543
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,340
Madam Yan made a scene

544
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,300
and we didn't get married.

545
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,980
Will you be disappointed

546
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,660
or a little anxious?

547
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,780
Me?

548
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,460
I'm not anxious.

549
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,060
You came to my house

550
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,260
with your body.

551
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,460
You can run away now.

552
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,660
Yes.

553
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,620
Your father told me

554
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,860
to come on time.

555
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,300
I won't let you wait.

556
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:27,860
Father.

557
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,300
Grand Tutor Sang.

558
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
When did you come?

559
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,380
It seems that

560
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,540
I have to run to your house.

561
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,460
Grand Tutor Sang.

562
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,940
I'll take my leave.

563
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
Take care.

564
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,500
Father.

565
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Do you have anything

566
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
to tell me?

567
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,580
What's going on?

568
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,340
I think the two of them

569
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,740
can't make it.

570
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,420
I know.

571
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,180
You think Madam Yan

572
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,260
is a tough girl.

573
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Lian Pian will be bullied

574
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,460
by Yan Yan when she marries Yan Yan.

575
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,300
I understand that.

576
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,540
But why can't Deputy Chief?

577
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,340
First,

578
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,780
they all came to propose in a hurry.

579
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,620
They're not married yet.

580
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
They're not married yet.

581
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,620
They're not married yet.

582
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,620
They're not married yet.

583
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,380
They're not married yet.

584
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,060
They came to me

585
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,860
and put a post.

586
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,300
What did they think

587
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,220
of me as the head of the family?

588
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,020
Second,

589
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,060
Yan Yun Zhi is the son of Yan Xiang.

590
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,420
Yan Xiang is cold to

591
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,460
his own son.

592
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,460
Not to mention you.

593
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,900
He dared not say hello

594
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
and came to propose.

595
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,020
Third,

596
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,020
he's a weirdo.

597
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,820
I'm wrong.

598
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,380
He's a wimp.

599
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,180
He's a wimp?

600
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,500
Father, don't forget.

601
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,620
You're an old wimp.

602
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,700
I'm a little wimp.

603
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,060
We're both weirdos.

604
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,220
Why do you dislike him?

605
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
In this respect,

606
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,420
Zhou Wen Yuan

607
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,940
is much more powerful than him.

608
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,100
Why do you mention him?

609
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,220
Can you not

610
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
mention him?

611
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,580
What does it have to do with him?

612
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,180
You...

613
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,220
Father.

614
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Yan Yan

615
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,420
Lian Pian,

616
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,220
don't take it to heart

617
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,860
what Madam Yan said just now.

618
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,420
Don't worry, Miss.

619
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,620
I've foreseen it.

620
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,220
This scene

621
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,380
is much more new than I expected.

622
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,900
I'm sorry.

623
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
Madam Yan

624
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,740
did scare me today.

625
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,340
Don't worry, Lian Pian.

626
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,860
Father and I support you.

627
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,180
We want you to be our sister

628
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,980
and take you to the Sang Family.

629
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,820
We don't do it for the sake of the family.

630
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,420
It's because I, Sang Qi,

631
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,700
have long regarded you as my own sister.

632
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,260
I know what you mean.

633
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,380
But

634
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,180
it's a little awkward

635
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,740
to ask me to call you Miss.

636
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,060
By the way,

637
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,060
you have to give Master Yan a chance.

638
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,060
Master's temper

639
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,820
is not easy to deal with.

640
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,100
He made such a big mess.

641
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,460
You've embarrassed the Yan family.

642
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,380
I didn't say I married Sang Qi.

643
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,380
You were wrong about it.

644
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,340
The mission is coming soon.

645
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,700
You're staying here

646
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,260
for a while.

647
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,500
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

648
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,820
Mother.

649
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,780
I'll find a man as soon as possible

650
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,260
to complete your marriage.

651
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,380
Don't even think about

652
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,580
those wild flowers outside.

653
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,180
Lian Piancai is not a wild flower.

654
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,060
She's also a daughter of a decent family.

655
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,820
She's just a maid anyway.

656
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,940
She's nothing in the Yan family.

657
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,580
I'll keep her out.

658
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,540
Your Highness.

659
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,140
Your Highness.

660
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,180
Mr. Zhuo wants to see you.

661
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,180
Send him in.

662
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,380
Aunt is in a good mood today.

663
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,820
I'm closer to the official.

664
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
Tonight,

665
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,860
he gave me a reward.

666
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,820
Sit.

667
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,340
Now our Zhuo family is doing great.

668
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,780
You should hurry up

669
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
to the family of Sang.

670
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,380
Sang Qi and Yan Yun Zhi are in the Imperial College.

671
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,300
They openly open the Ming Lang and the Jin Realm.

672
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,620
I'm trying to

673
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,860
find out what they mean.

674
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,820
So what?

675
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,300
Don't bother with these trifles.

676
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,060
Without the order of parents and the words of Meishuo,

677
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,340
their relationship is not strong.

678
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,740
You're so smart.

679
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,660
Just use some tricks.

680
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,940
It seems that Miss Su is alone tonight.

681
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,060
I'm bored at home.

682
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,020
I came out to see the fun outside.

683
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,460
Suddenly, I have a feeling

684
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,420
that Miss Su is a man of her own.

685
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,980
A man of her own?

686
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,060
Are you making fun of me?

687
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,180
What are you talking about?

688
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,500
I'm just making fun of myself.

689
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,860
Okay, Mr. Zhuo.

690
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,900
The scenery is beautiful.

691
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,100
Why bother to make fun of yourself?

692
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,460
Everything is just a burden.

693
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,780
Why don't you go back to the mansion and have some wine?

694
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,100
I'm already in love with you.

695
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,300
You can also have a good time tonight alone.

696
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,420
It's boring to drink alone.

697
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,980
Meeting someone is fate.

698
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,180
Miss Su,

699
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,860
since you're already in the building of the Qingfeng Building,

700
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,100
why don't you go in and have a chat?

701
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,460
Miss Su, don't blame me for being too thoughtful.

702
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,700
I have been busy with something.

703
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,420
About me?

704
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,460
Tell me, Mr. Zhuo.

705
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,740
Yanyun Zhi has always been cold to you.

706
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,300
Now she is openly in love with Sang Qi.

707
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,260
Why do you still remember her?

708
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,460
It's because Mr. Zhuo

709
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,900
only saw Yunchi's side.

710
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,060
Tell me about it.

711
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,180
I remember

712
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,820
when I was eight years old,

713
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,300
my brother played hide-and-seek with me in the garden.

714
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,020
I kept looking for him.

715
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,340
I looked for him for a long time.

716
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,860
So I walked very fast.

717
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,500
I touched him with my hands.

718
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,060
Finally, I caught one.

719
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,820
I was very happy.

720
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:36,580
And then?

721
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,140
Then I found

722
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,060
he was the one I was holding.

723
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,140
Yunchi held my hand and walked far away.

724
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,820
He kept looking at the edge of the room.

725
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,580
Then he raised his head

726
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,740
and asked my brother to come down.

727
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,220
Later,

728
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,740
my brother even took this matter as a warning.

729
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,020
He asked why he didn't come out.

730
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,220
Did he deliberately take advantage of me?

731
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,820
Yunchi answered suddenly.

732
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
It turned out that

733
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,860
I happened to walk to a flower pot.

734
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,220
The plant was a moon.

735
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,300
It was purple.

736
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,340
If I accidentally fell into it,

737
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,740
I would be hurt.

738
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,580
Yanyun Zhi's behavior is called human nature.

739
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,260
If I was the one who held you back,

740
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
then I would be the one

741
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,580
who wanted to marry Miss Su.

742
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,180
Miss Su,

743
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,220
you've already realized

744
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,900
that Yanyun Zhi

745
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:48,900
has no feelings for you.

746
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,860
Since Mr. Zhou has said so,

747
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,740
I can't stay here any longer.

748
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,260
Goodbye.

749
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,260
Miss Su, please wait.

750
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:11,140
I know Miss Su is gentle,

751
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,980
but she's not a person who gives up easily.

752
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,260
Miss Su, do you believe in fate

753
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,820
or in human nature?

754
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,260
Mr. Zhou has said

755
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,660
that Yanyun Zhi has no feelings for me.

756
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,500
Her feelings are not on me.

757
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,900
Do I have to force her?

758
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,460
If you can't get her heart,

759
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,980
you can get her person first.

760
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,540
Once the relationship between two people is tied,

761
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,100
one table to eat,

762
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,420
one bed to sleep.

763
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,740
After a long time,

764
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,060
you can get her heart.

765
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,300
You can get her heart.

766
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,940
Miss Su,

767
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,180
I want to keep Sang Qi.

768
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,140
But I don't know if you

769
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,460
want to keep Yanyun Zhi too.

770
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,340
Good!

771
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:22,940
Good!

772
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,460
Good!

773
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:23,940
Good!

774
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,460
Good!

775
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:24,940
Good!

776
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,540
Good!

777
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,140
Good!

778
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,740
Good!

779
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,500
Miss,

780
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,180
the shop is closed.

781
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,580
You'd better go somewhere else.

782
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,420
It's your honor

783
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,340
that I come to your shop to drink.

784
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,860
Who do you think you are?

785
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,220
You dare to drive me away.

786
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,620
Do you believe that I'll call the people of Taifu

787
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,500
to smash your shop?

788
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,580
You're so arrogant.

789
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,900
You?

790
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,460
The daughter of the Taifu's.

791
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:47,980
You're drinking alone here tonight?

792
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,420
You!

793
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,620
You wait for me.

794
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,340
Get out of the way.

795
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,300
Go! Go! Go!

796
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,020
No one dares to push a woman

797
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,540
in front of me.

798
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,780
Go now.

799
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,460
Go! Go! Go!

800
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,220
It's you.

801
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,500
You don't even say thank you.

802
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,900
You're a man.

803
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,580
Miss Song,

804
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,220
you dressed up so well tonight.

805
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,020
It seems that you went to the bridge

806
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,380
for a walk.

807
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,420
I'm not like you,

808
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,780
a woman who is so far away.

809
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,540
The only one who can walk the bridge with me

810
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,780
is Yan Yuzhi.

811
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,340
Then I guess tonight

812
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,660
you must be alone.

813
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,100
You!

814
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,700
Where have you been?

815
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,380
You have time to beat me up here.

816
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,180
You'd better go to the Sangqi's.

817
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,180
You said I had no one to accompany me.

818
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,100
I'm not like you.

819
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,500
You've been busy for a long time.

820
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,380
You didn't even get a job.

821
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,540
You even lost your life.

822
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:47,620
Miss Song,

823
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,780
you don't have to be angry with me.

824
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,380
But I'm not like you.

825
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,660
I won't waste my time to coax you.

826
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,100
You coax me?

827
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,340
I want you to coax me.

828
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,780
Men in the whole world are dead.

829
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,460
Jinmu.

830
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,500
Yes.

831
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,220
Please send Miss Song back to the mansion.

832
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,140
After all, it's dark and windy at night.

833
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:06,980
Yes.

834
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,020
Zhuo Wenyuan.

835
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,220
Follow your master.

836
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,380
I don't want his kindness.

837
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,420
Go.

838
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,020
Hold it.

839
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,900
Behave yourself.

840
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,220
Qilang.

841
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,940
What's up, Mr. San?

842
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:47,740
Qilang.

843
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,900
Since the last time

844
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,560
the

845
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,620
Wei family was ambushed

846
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,900
and Wei Daren was assassinated,

847
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,500
I've been investigating

848
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,780
the clues about the Wei family.

849
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,540
Have you found out who their superior is?

850
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,500
Not yet.

851
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,940
When we arrived at Wei's house,

852
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,820
we found someone who had already turned a blind eye.

853
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,860
Fortunately,

854
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,220
there were people nearby.

855
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,180
Recently,

856
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,220
a man who had been working for the Wei family

857
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:12,980
had entered the Wei family.

858
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,460
This man

859
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,740
looks like

860
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,220
a businessman who works for the Wei family.

861
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,420
If you know who their superior is,

862
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,500
you'll know that the Shang family is very likely to be the one.

863
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,980
In this way,

864
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,060
we'll know who is the master of the court

865
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,820
and who is in contact with the Western State.

866
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,820
That's right.

867
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,020
This is

868
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,060
their base.

869
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,140
I think it's about Brother Yu.

870
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,660
You must want to investigate it together.

871
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,660
So I'm in a hurry to inform you to help.

872
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,260
Come on.

873
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,300
The Wu Family's

874
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,140
Mr. Qin.

875
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,700
It seems that some of the goods here

876
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,220
have been shipped out.

877
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,820
Check the room.

878
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,820
Okay.

879
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,180
Behave yourself.

880
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:17,700
Hurry and dis ì¢….

881
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,460
Let's go here

882
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,020
Now you can go!

883
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,580
I've never seen it in the Palace of Heaven.

884
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,300
The powder that caused so many funeral memories

885
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,980
must have been extracted from this.

886
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,580
Tell me.

887
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,940
Who told you to bring these spiders here?

888
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,460
I didn't bring them here.

889
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,700
I'm responsible for

890
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,220
protecting the salt here.

891
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,220
Then I transferred the salt

892
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,180
to another place according to the organization's order.

893
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,140
It might be someone else

894
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,220
who received the order.

895
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,460
Ziliang, come with me.

896
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,540
I guess

897
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,980
the border police

898
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,860
transferred the salt to the organization's order.

899
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,540
They changed the salt

900
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,340
and transferred the poison plants

901
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,140
from Xizhao to the border.

902
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,260
Shang family and Xizhao took over the job together.

903
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,540
And this place

904
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,140
should be a stronghold

905
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,340
for them to obtain the illegal materials.

906
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,380
Besides,

907
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,980
they have a pass.

908
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,380
The connection between the two countries is long.

909
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,940
It seems that the people who kidnapped the guards

910
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,980
must have spent a lot of effort

911
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,020
to get this route back.

912
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,620
This is impossible

913
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,620
with the power of Wei family.

914
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,380
Don't you think it smells weird?

915
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,740
After hearing what you said,

916
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,900
it smells good.

917
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:14,820
Smells good?

918
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:15,660
Yes.

919
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,740
It's not different from

920
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,180
the fragrance powder of a girl.

921
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,060
It's not the fragrance powder of a girl.

922
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,420
I feel very uncomfortable

923
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,300
when I come in.

924
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,140
Qi Lang,

925
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,740
you're not in a good condition.

926
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,220
Your nose is red because of the burn.

927
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,820
Why don't you go back and rest?

928
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,980
Then...

929
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,220
Leave it to me.

930
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,060
This is the secret of the Jinzhao family.

931
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,820
I'll order someone to block the wolf's den

932
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,660
and get the evidence as soon as possible.

933
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,980
Thank you.

934
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,460
As you wish.

935
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,380
Let's go.

936
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
We were beaten by Yan Yuzhi and Yan Sanlang

937
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,540
by accident this time.

938
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,140
The wolf's den in the city has been blocked.

939
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:59,420
The goods have been detained.

940
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,620
But fortunately,

941
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,660
they didn't find the account book.

942
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,300
You must be careful with your actions recently.

943
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,460
Yan Sanlang must have kept it from Yan Xin.

944
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:13,980
Remember,

945
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,180
never go to the wolf's den.

946
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:18,820
Yes.

947
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,180
By the way,

948
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,100
the frequency of the goods must be slowed down.

949
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
They are waiting for us to show our flaws.

950
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,740
Mrs. Zhang,

951
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
please follow Mr. Zhuo's order.

952
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,660
Yes.

953
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,300
Mr. Zhang.

954
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,660
What's the news?

955
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,820
Uncle, don't worry.

956
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,420
Yan Yuzhi went to the Imperial College to propose marriage.

957
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,980
But Grand Commandant Sang didn't agree.

958
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:41,660
The land

959
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:43,740
to get her first.

960
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,380
Once the relationship between the two is tied,

961
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,980
they can eat together

962
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,300
and sleep together.

963
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,460
After a long time,

964
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,820
you will be able to get her heart.

965
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,140
I'm here to talk to you.

966
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,460
I know you are alone in the mansion every day.

967
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,820
So I prepared some pastries for you.

968
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,740
That's a good feeling.

969
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,740
I haven't been here for a long time.

970
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,300
Come on.

971
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,100
Come on.

972
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,460
Please sit down.

973
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,260
I know

974
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,820
that you are not suitable

975
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,460
to come to the mansion

976
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,660
with my identity.

977
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,580
After all,

978
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,780
Yun Zhi has proposed to the Grand Commandant's Mansion.

979
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,020
What did you say?

980
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,060
Who proposed to the Grand Commandant's Mansion?

981
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,180
