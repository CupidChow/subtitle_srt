00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
It's cancelled too.

208
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
What should I do?

209
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Okay, be quiet.

210
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Start the class.

211
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm so happy.

212
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
I'm so happy.

213
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
Deputy Chief.

214
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
You and Lan Ji...

215
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
You know it.

216
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Deputy Chief.

217
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I want to ask you...

218
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,560
Deputy Chief.

219
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
I...

220
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
Qingren Yun is looking for you.

221
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
She's waiting outside the door.

222
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
What do you want to ask?

223
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Well,

224
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
she seems to be in a hurry.

225
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Deputy Chief.

226
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
I...

227
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
I...

228
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Si Yan.

229
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Si Yan.

230
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Si Yan, go back to your work.

231
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,560
We'll talk about it another day.

232
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
SOUND Restaurant

233
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Lord Qingquan.

234
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
Qin Lang.

235
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
It's all strange.

236
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:00,340
You should be

237
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,260
What good thing?

238
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,780
But you must have encountered something good.

239
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,180
You looked at me just now.

240
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,860
But I felt a little...

241
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,340
scared.

242
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,060
You got it right.

243
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,020
It turns out that there is something good

244
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,260
that you ruined.

245
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,340
What's the point?

246
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,740
All right, don't ask me.

247
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,740
What are you looking for?

248
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,740
Let's talk when we leave.

249
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,460
I'll think about it later.

250
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,700
You can't do anything.

251
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,420
Dr. Tong said...

252
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:40,860
Qi.

253
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,300
Wen Yuan, when did you come back?

254
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,340
I just entered the city.

255
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,340
If you have nothing to do later,

256
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,140
why don't you go to the Qingfeng House with me?

257
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,860
It's been a long time.

258
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,900
It's not a long time.

259
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,260
It's just a few days.

260
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,860
But I want to see you

261
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,340
live and work.

262
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,380
I'll treat you to a meal.

263
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,460
Let's go.

264
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,380
Let's go.

265
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,620
You called me in such a hurry

266
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,500
just to have a drink with you?

267
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,180
I didn't want to see you.

268
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,380
What do you mean?

269
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,820
Miss, you didn't invite me.

270
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,820
Could you wait in the very bench?

271
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,540
Laanji said she wanted to see you.

272
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,140
Have a drink.

273
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,980
I'll go first.

274
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,780
Here is the money.

275
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,300
Laanji,

276
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,700
you...

277
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
This is a gift from Song Jiayi

278
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,700
on his birthday.

279
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,700
I found some powder on the white cotton paper

280
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
of the gift package.

281
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
After checking,

282
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
these powder was taken out

283
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
from a kind of spider in the Western Zhou.

284
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,700
Western Zhou?

285
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I know you are investigating the matter.

286
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
So I came to tell you.

287
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,700
You mean

288
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,700
the powder in this

289
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,700
is the same as the poison we investigated before?

290
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
Different from before.

291
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
If you use this powder

292
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,700
as a powder,

293
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
it can cause a disease.

294
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
And the price of

295
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
the spider in the powder is not expensive.

296
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,700
You mean

297
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
the spider in the Western Zhou is used for magic?

298
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,700
Yes.

299
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
In recent years,

300
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,700
people around Bianjing found this powder.

301
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
But

302
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
they can't find the reason.

303
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Can we get rid of this spider in Bianjing?

304
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,700
This spider is not easy to survive

305
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
in the climate of Bianjing.

306
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
If you want to plant it,

307
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
you need special environment to cultivate it.

308
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
I see.

309
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
I will leave this to you.

310
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Lan Ji, thank you.

311
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
Yun Zhi,

312
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,700
you should be more careful.

313
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
Don't make me worry.

314
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,700
If there is a place

315
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
I can help you,

316
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
just tell me.

317
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
Then I will leave now.

318
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
You don't have to see me off.

319
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Or people will see you

320
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
and criticize you.

321
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Thank you.

322
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Qi.

323
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Lan Ji.

324
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Mr. Zhou.

325
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
It's a good coincidence that you are here.

326
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
I didn't expect that Yun Zhi invited you.

327
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
I should have stayed longer.

328
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
No.

329
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
Deputy Chief didn't invite us.

330
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
But I heard that

331
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Qing Xuan Jun had something to do with him.

332
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Qi.

333
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
I'm sorry.

334
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
I'm sorry.

335
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm sorry.

336
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm sorry.

337
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
Chu Wen Yuan.

338
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
I just came back from the south.

339
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Qi came to the wind tower

340
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
to welcome me.

341
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
I didn't expect that he would be here

342
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,700
to meet Deputy Chief and Lan Ji.

343
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
When I just entered the city,

344
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I heard that Yan Su and his family had a bad news.

345
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
It seems that the rumor

346
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
can't be fully believed.

347
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Right, Lan Ji?

348
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,700
Yun Zhi.

349
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
I think Mr. Zhou is very tired.

350
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,700
I'm afraid he is exhausted.

351
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,700
Let's not bother them.

352
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
Right, Qi.

353
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
I just came back

354
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,700
before I went back to my home.

355
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Let's go.

356
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
Let's go.

357
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
I'll kill you.

358
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,700
My lady.

359
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,700
My lady.

360
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
What are you doing

361
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
with a sword in the middle of the night?

362
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
What are you doing here?

363
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:20,620
Me?

364
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,300
I'm afraid that the swordsmanship that Master taught me is familiar.

365
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,380
I can come out and practice.

366
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,340
Miss. Miss.

367
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,420
Did you have a bad talk with Deputy Chief Yan?

368
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,380
No.

369
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,060
We didn't have a good talk at all.

370
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,180
Didn't you say that

371
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,060
a deep shot and a short shot are the same?

372
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,380
Why are you being so cowardly at the critical moment?

373
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:51,900
No.

374
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,820
A deep shot is a shot.

375
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,420
A short shot is not enough.

376
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,300
What's wrong with you?

377
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,540
You didn't sleep at midnight.

378
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,860
Why are you holding a big scissors?

379
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:03,940
I...

380
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,900
I think the basin is too dirty.

381
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,220
Let's fix it.

382
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,700
You...

383
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,740
You're a Lantern.

384
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,460
And Yan Xiaolang said that

385
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,820
it's Qi Xuanjun who asked you to come here.

386
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,420
I was wrong.

387
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,820
Why did you explain it to me?

388
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,260
Besides,

389
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,020
you're a Lantern.

390
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,220
It doesn't mean that

391
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,220
you're interested in me.

392
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,260
Right?

393
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,220
Right.

394
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,460
You lied to me and didn't explain it to me.

395
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,060
Who do you think I am?

396
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,740
You...

397
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,100
It's comfortable.

398
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,420
It's comfortable.

399
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,340
What's wrong with you?

400
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,460
Did Yan Xiaolang make you angry?

401
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,980
He doesn't have time to annoy me.

402
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,540
I heard that

403
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,180
he's busy with the proposal.

404
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,980
Didn't he say that he's dragging it?

405
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,180
Who knows?

406
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,660
That girl is from a famous family.

407
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,740
She's quite pretty.

408
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,460
Yan Xiaolang might be having fun now.

409
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,820
But she

410
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,660
is just a playboy.

411
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,500
She's a playboy.

412
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,340
She's not smart.

413
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,740
She's...

414
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,220
She's just like that.

415
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,940
I don't like her.

416
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,740
I think Yan Xiaolang is a good girl.

417
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,420
At least she's

418
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,220
a simple girl.

419
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,740
Unlike someone else.

420
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,460
My lady.

421
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,300
What's wrong with you again?

422
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,140
Don't listen to her.

423
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,420
Go to sleep.

424
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:54,780
Close the door.

425
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:08,980
Lian Pian.

426
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
You insist on sending me to school.

427
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,380
Is it because of someone you want to find

428
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,900
or a novel?

429
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,780
Since you like some young man in the Imperial College,

430
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,100
I can help you talk to him.

431
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,220
As long as you don't fall in love with me,

432
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,980
I'm already in love with you.

433
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,700
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

434
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,100
You're still drunk after drinking the wine last night.

435
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,220
You're drunk.

436
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,340
How is it?

437
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,180
Compare them.

438
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,140
Do you think Yan Xiaolang is much better?

439
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,620
It would be better if he can change Mr. Zhuo's face.

440
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,060
So Lian Pian likes Yan Xiaolang.

441
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,740
Bad news!

442
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,260
Sang Qi.

443
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,460
You don't know, right?

444
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,740
Yan Yan was hurt by Song Luo Tian.

445
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,540
What?

446
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,180
What?

447
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,620
Is he okay?

448
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,260
I didn't see him.

449
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,940
But I heard he was badly hurt.

450
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,100
He needs to rest at home.

451
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,140
Song Luo Tian.

452
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,260
He's always angry.

453
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,940
He's always angry in the Imperial College.

454
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,420
Now he dares to hurt others.

455
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,460
Don't be rash.

456
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,940
The bad guy is here.

457
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,340
Song Luo Tian!

458
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,540
Miss, don't be impulsive.

459
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,300
Song Luo Tian.

460
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,780
You don't care about your classmates.

461
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,820
You're so cruel.

462
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,460
How did Yan Yan do this to you?

463
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,700
Just because he's always against me in the Imperial College,

464
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,460
I don't think he's okay.

465
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,300
Fine.

466
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,900
You admit it, right?

467
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,340
Today I'll make Yan Zhuangsheng pay for it.

468
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,020
Miss!

469
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,500
Miss!

470
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,020
Miss!

471
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:49,500
Miss!

472
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,460
Get out!

473
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,860
Don't hit me!

474
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,100
You don't want to study in the Imperial College, right?

475
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,140
Don't make trouble

476
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,900
in the middle of the night.

477
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,700
I'm not from the Imperial College.

478
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,740
I'm not afraid.

479
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,740
What are you doing?

480
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,140
Didn't you ask me to be impulsive?

481
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:11,940
You...

482
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,540
I didn't persuade myself.

483
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,500
Let go!

484
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,620
Brother Song.

485
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,220
Go back and change your clothes.

486
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,940
So many people are watching.

487
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:20,980
No.

488
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,180
Your master's wife is too cruel.

489
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,700
My brother...

490
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,220
My brother is going to sue Guo Zi Jian.

491
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,180
He's going to sue him.

492
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,060
He's just a teacher.

493
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,980
Who doesn't know that?

494
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,220
I'm going to sue him, too.

495
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,940
I'm telling you, Song Luo Tian.

496
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,380
One day, I'll get this bad luck for Yan Yan.

497
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,700
Let's go and see Yan Yan.

498
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,700
Young Master.

499
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:44,580
Young Master.

500
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,060
Forget it.

501
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,300
Let go!

502
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,700
Yan Yan.

503
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,420
I heard you're getting married.

504
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,060
Who's the girl who's so ungrateful?

505
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,660
Why am I so unlucky today?

506
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,940
How can you be unlucky?

507
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,260
Don't say such unlucky words.

508
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,300
Come on. Smile.

509
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,980
Song Luo Tian.

510
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,180
Are you looking for a fight?

511
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,100
To satisfy you.

512
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:15,900
I...

513
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,300
Young Master.

514
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,940
How dare you do that?

515
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,260
Young Master.

516
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,620
Yan Yan.

517
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,300
Don't hit me.

518
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,500
Young Master.

519
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,060
Wang Qi.

520
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,860
Young Master.

521
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,260
Young Master.

522
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,700
Let go of me.

523
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,180
Useless.

524
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,540
You're a traitor.

525
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,780
What's the use of you looking for these claws?

526
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,060
You can't even hold a rope.

527
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,060
There are so many people on the street.

528
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,620
Why did you hurt Yan Yan?

529
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,540
You made me a stranger.

530
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,580
Everyone thinks I'm going to take care of Yan Yan.

531
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,060
Young Master.

532
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,420
When you two were fighting,

533
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,540
the horse suddenly stopped.

534
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,180
It was an accident.

535
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,500
Besides,

536
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,220
I didn't pull the rope.

537
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,620
You...

538
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,580
I have no choice.

539
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
According to you,

540
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,140
we can't even stop the horse from fighting, right?

541
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,660
I'm the most guilty one.

542
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,380
How dare you...

543
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,740
Mr. Yan!

544
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,500
Get off now.

545
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,980
Yes, Young Master.

546
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,340
Yes.

547
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,700
I heard

548
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,340
that you hurt the son of Mr. Yan.

549
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,100
I know my mistake.

550
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,100
I shouldn't have caused you trouble.

551
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,260
Good job.

552
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,380
It's time to knock on Yan's door.

553
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,780
I need you to do something.

554
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,220
Come here.

555
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:51,980
Come on.

556
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,540
No.

557
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,220
Dad.

558
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,060
Let me knock on Yan's door.

559
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,540
I don't like that woman.

560
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,700
I don't think she's good enough for me.

561
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,980
It's good enough that she's good enough for the Song family.

562
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,340
They're the famous family of Bianjing.

563
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,620
They have a deep foundation.

564
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,060
They sell goods all over the country.

565
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,380
If you can't get a reputation in the official field,

566
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,460
you can rely on your father-in-law's protection

567
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,820
and you can keep your life's glory and wealth.

568
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,300
Our family is big.

569
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,660
We need to rely on others.

570
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,140
It's unpredictable.

571
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,580
There's no harm in leaving a trail.

572
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,140
A father and a son

573
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,340
should be determined by their parents.

574
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,740
I always do it for your good.

575
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,020
No. But I...

576
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,900
Stop talking.

577
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,740
Do it now.

578
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,220
Yes, dad.

579
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,260
Hurry up.

580
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,980
Sirs.

581
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,100
I'm looking for Ye Xiaolang.

582
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,380
This way, please.

583
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,060
Young Master.

584
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,340
Someone is here to see you.

585
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,340
Ye Xiaolang.

586
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,860
Why are you giving up on yourself?

587
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,620
Are you okay?

588
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,620
Lian Pian, you're here.

589
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
I thought I would never see you again.

590
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,140
What are you talking about?

591
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,540
Lian Yan, how's your injury?

592
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,060
Actually, it's okay.

593
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,740
I practiced the iron-bone-swinging skill.

594
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,220
Ordinary people would have lost their energy by now.

595
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,940
Ye Xiaolang, take good care of yourself.

596
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,220
Here are the medicines I brought for you.

597
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,540
Only medicines?

598
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,060
I'm telling you.

599
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,020
Next time,

600
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,820
just bring some food.

601
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,300
As the saying goes,

602
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,620
it's better to have medicine than food.

603
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,460
What do you want to eat?

604
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,980
I'll make it for you next time.

605
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,060
I'll have to think about it.

606
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,500
But don't worry, Yan Yan.

607
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,940
I'll get justice for you.

608
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,780
Forget it.

609
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,780
It's an accident.

610
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,980
I don't blame him.

611
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,940
Song Luo Tian has confessed his crime.

612
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,260
You're still blaming him?

613
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,460
I'm not blaming him.

614
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,140
He said that out of pride.

615
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,580
I know him.

616
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,660
He can make trouble.

617
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,260
He can't do evil things.

618
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,060
He was a blind man who cried a lot when he was killed.

619
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,300
Besides, I...

620
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,380
What kind of a man is he?

621
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,460
He can beat me?

622
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,700
He can beat me?

623
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,540
Young Master.

624
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,180
Something happened.

625
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,500
Miss Ding Qing is being robbed by Song's family.

626
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,780
Song Luo Tian just proposed to her.

627
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,580
Your marriage is ruined.

628
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,900
Fine.

629
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,780
He finally did something good.

630
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,180
It must hurt a lot.

631
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,580
It's okay.

632
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,700
It doesn't hurt as long as you're here.

633
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,020
Lie down.

634
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,620
You still have to recuperate.

635
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,180
Be careful.

636
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,180
Lin Pian.

637
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,060
I'm thirsty.

638
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,020
Don't move.

639
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,260
I'll pour it for you.

640
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,980
Okay.

641
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,780
Let's go.

642
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,980
I want to eat an orange.

643
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,780
Is there any?

644
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,500
Okay. I'll get it for you.

645
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,820
According to you,

646
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,420
the Song family is related to this spider.

647
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,340
I want to visit the Song family.

648
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,260
But I can't be too rash.

649
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,780
I just received the news.

650
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,100
Song Luo Tian is about to get married.

651
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,180
Maybe this is a good chance.

652
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,660
I'll plan it.

653
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,900
Five days and three nights.

654
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,020
Five days and three nights.

655
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,140
Five days and three nights.

656
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,140
Five...

657
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,340
Five days and three nights.

658
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,300
Zang Qi.

659
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,060
Deputy Chief.

660
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,220
Why are you looking so sad?

661
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,980
The witch doctor just announced

662
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,220
that I'm going to have a test in the afternoon.

663
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,060
But I'm only practicing martial arts on the mountain.

664
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,580
I haven't done any research.

665
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,340
Research?

666
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,060
I'm not good at it.

667
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
If you have any questions in the field,

668
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,220
I can explain it to you.

669
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,740
Really?

670
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,220
Like this one.

671
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,980
Deputy Chief, please don't bother him.

672
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
I happen to need to ask for your help.

673
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
I'll tell you.

674
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,420
You're going to hand it over to me?

675
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,580
What? You don't believe me?

676
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,020
Well...

677
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,780
Well, it's not like...

678
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,740
Qi.

679
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,860
The test is about to start.

680
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,460
We need to hurry up.

681
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,700
It's crowded here.

682
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,300
Why don't you go back to the classroom with me

683
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,060
and ask your classmates?

684
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,900
All right.

685
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,540
I'll go back first.

686
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,740
The test is important.

687
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,780
Don't worry, Deputy Chief.

688
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,340
Just leave Qi to me.

689
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,820
I'll do my best to help her.

690
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,860
I'm leaving.

691
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,140
What are you doing?

692
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,420
You don't know how to sit.

693
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,460
You're so naughty.

694
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,620
Qi.

695
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,420
I'll take you back.

696
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,060
You can pay a visit to your uncle by the way.

697
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,220
Well...

698
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,220
Is he in good health these days?

699
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,460
I can get one.

700
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,860
This way.

701
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,540
You're a bit weird, Chu Lete.

702
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,700
Why?

703
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,820
Master.

704
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,420
Is your confidence going up?

705
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,220
Looks like my old

706
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,060
Master,

707
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,100
Zhou Wu Yuan and Sang Qi

708
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,460
are always together.

709
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,340
They took a shower on the way to school.

710
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,460
They almost had a fight on the way to school.

711
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,580
Say it again.

712
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,340
Are you okay, Master?

713
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,220
The tea is so good.

714
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:20,940
It's so good.

715
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,860
It's so good.

716
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
It's so good.

717
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,860
It's so good.

718
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
It's so good.

719
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
It's so good.

720
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,860
It's so good.

721
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
It's so good.

722
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,260
In Bianjing,

723
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,780
people are so kind and generous.

724
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,780
But this tea

725
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,060
is the famous West Mountain micro-fish.

726
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,700
It was a tribute back then.

727
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,940
This tea is only produced for an hour every year.

728
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,420
It needs to be in the clear morning

729
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,340
to pick the most tender leaf

730
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,540
on every tea tree.

731
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,220
There's a bug.

732
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,220
When?

733
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
A lazy bug.

734
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,300
Yan Xiao Lang,

735
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,380
I've been here with you for days.

736
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,380
When will you get better?

737
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,780
You're always

738
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,340
in the wrong place.

739
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,180
You don't look like you're hurt.

740
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
No, no.

741
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,380
I'm just trying to

742
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,140
make a joke out of it.

743
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,860
It really hurts.

744
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,660
Lian Pian.

745
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,700
If I can't get better,

746
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,340
will you take care of me like this?

747
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Will you take care of me?

748
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,300
Of course not.

749
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
I'm very annoyed right now.

750
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Listen,

751
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,020
get better soon.

752
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,020
Don't make me hate you.

753
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
Drink some tea.

754
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Okay.

755
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
Go home after drinking.

756
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
Yan Xiao Ye.

757
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Come in.

758
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Yan Xiao Ye,

759
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
I'm really sorry.

760
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,820
Mr. Song's son is getting married tomorrow.

761
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
The Song family is going to make a feast today.

762
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,620
I'm really embarrassed.

763
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
Yan Xiao Ye,

764
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
our shopkeeper said

765
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,020
to find you a good tea house

766
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
and a small shop before tea.

767
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
How about

768
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
I send a carriage to send you there?

769
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,700
Song Nuan Tian.

770
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,340
He took my marriage

771
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,340
and my second-rate.

772
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Is he going to take away my property tomorrow?

773
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,940
He's really embarrassed.

774
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,500
He thinks I'm a big shot

775
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,260
and I'm a softie.

776
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,460
I'll send him

777
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,940
to take away my big deal.

778
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,340
Yan Xiao Lang, forget it.

779
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
You're not recovered yet.

780
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,140
We won't be angry with the Song family.

781
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,540
I haven't finished my tea.

782
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
It's a bad luck.

783
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
I'm not leaving.

784
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
Didn't the shopkeeper say to buy you tea?

785
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,140
You pay for the tea, right?

786
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,140
No.

787
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,540
Can I have some more snacks?

788
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
No problem.

789
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Yan Xiao Ye is happy.

790
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,540
Then wrap these up for me.

791
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,140
Okay.

792
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,340
Let's go.

793
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
Wait.

794
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,740
You're going to send me some snacks?

795
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,420
Why are you sending me back?

796
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,460
I'm just

797
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
calculating.

798
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
I'm just a little bit late.

799
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Let's go.

800
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
It hurts.

801
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
My leg hurts.

802
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,220
Help me.

803
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
Help yourself.

804
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Help.

805
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,820
Help me.

806
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
Lian Tian.

807
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Lian Tian.

808
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,340
What?

809
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,780
His body was broken

810
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,980
when he fell out of the river,

811
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,620
and he hurt his finger and his injury.

812
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,820
Not his cut informations,

813
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,820
what where wrong battlefield you need to wait and what to stop you.

814
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,980
What did you say?

815
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,820
It is work of work?

816
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,820
I said work of work.

817
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,020
Not because of his cutting even us,

818
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,660
I'm sorry.

819
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,100
Sang Qi,

820
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,060
the rain won't stop for a while.

821
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
Take my carriage back.

822
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,260
No need to bother, Deputy Chief.

823
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,980
Go back.

824
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,980
I'll wait for a while.

825
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,460
I'll send my disciples back.

826
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,340
If you have any trouble,

827
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,420
you're welcome.

828
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,340
Is it really not a trouble?

829
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,460
Of course not.

830
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,100
Okay.

831
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,340
My disciples,

832
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,820
I'm sending you back.

833
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,340
Hurry up.

834
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,140
Go.

835
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,060
Go.

836
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,060
Go.

837
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,060
Go.

838
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
Go.

839
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,060
Go.

840
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,060
Go.

841
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,060
Go.

842
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
Go home.

843
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Go.

844
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
Go home.

845
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Go home.

846
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,060
Go home.

847
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Go home.

848
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,060
Go home.

849
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Go home.

850
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,060
That's great.

851
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,060
Hurry up.

852
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Let's go.

853
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,460
Go.

854
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,460
Go.

855
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,460
Go.

856
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Go.

857
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,460
Go.

858
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,460
Go.

859
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,460
Go.

860
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,460
Go.

861
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
Go.

862
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Go.

863
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,460
Go.

864
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,460
Go.

865
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
Go.

866
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Go.

867
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,460
Go.

868
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
Go.

869
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,460
Go.

870
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,460
Go.

871
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,460
Go.

872
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,460
Deputy Chief,

873
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,460
would you like some

874
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,460
melon seeds and peanuts

875
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,460
for the grilled fish?

876
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,460
How about

877
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,460
some milk wine,

878
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,460
honey and peach jam?

879
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,460
Okay.

880
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,460
Give it to me.

881
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,460
Okay.

882
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Be careful.

883
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,460
Be careful.

884
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,460
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

885
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,460
And Brother Zhuo.

886
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,460
Deputy Chief,

887
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,460
thank you.

888
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,460
You're welcome.

889
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,460
Anxin,

890
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,460
don't you want some honey and peanuts?

891
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,460
I have some.

892
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Is it good?

893
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,460
How is it?

894
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,460
It's really good.

895
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,460
Deputy Chief,

896
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,460
try some.

897
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
He just refused.

898
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
How could he say no?

899
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Don't make it hard for others.

900
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,460
I'll eat for him.

901
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,460
This honey and peanuts

902
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,460
are too bright.

903
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
The sugar on it is also sweet.

904
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
It's like honey.

905
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,460
Deputy Chief,

906
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
what do you mean?

907
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Is there something wrong with the honey?

908
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,460
It smells a little sour.

909
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,460
It's probably because

910
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
it's not stored properly.

911
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,460
It's not bad.

912
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,460
Sang Qi,

913
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,460
do you have any

914
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,460
problems with your stomach?

915
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,460
You said

916
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,460
there's nothing wrong.

917
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
But you said

918
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
there are some problems.

919
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Let me take a pulse for you.

920
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
No need.

921
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
I'll take it.

922
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,460
Come on.

923
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Okay.

924
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,460
Give me your hand.

925
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
Deputy Chief,

926
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
I just tried it.

927
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,460
Don't touch me.

928
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
How is it?

929
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,460
It doesn't seem to be a big deal.

930
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
But

931
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
you can't be careless.

932
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,460
If there's anything wrong,

933
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,460
tell me immediately.

934
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Okay.

935
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,460
Deputy Chief,

936
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
I just ate honey.

937
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,460
Can you help me?

938
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,460
See if I have any disease.

939
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
See if I have any disease.

940
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Eat.

941
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,460
Give me some peanuts.

942
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Let me help you.

943
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Sang Qi.

944
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,460
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

945
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
Anything else?

946
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,460
Xuanwu Zhi Tianxia Wu Ban.

947
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
There's no place

948
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
to study in this world.

949
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
It's so hard for me

950
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
to ask for a good question.

951
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,460
Miss,

952
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,460
something's wrong.

953
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,460
People from Yan's Mansion

954
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,460
said Yan Yan took someone to the Song's Mansion.

955
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,460
What did he do?

956
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,460
I saw him acting strange yesterday.

957
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,460
He said he was going to

958
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,460
give a gift to Song Luo Tian.

959
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
Did he go to make trouble?

960
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
So troublesome.

961
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Let's go.

962
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,460
Yan Xiao Lang,

963
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
I'm here to congratulate you

964
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
on my wedding anniversary.

965
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
I welcome you.

966
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,460
If you're here to find the tea,

967
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
don't blame me for not treating you well.

968
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460
Mr. Song is here to celebrate your wedding anniversary.

969
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,460
Don't be so excited.

970
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,460
I'm here to give you a gift

971
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,460
to express my gratitude.

972
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,460
Bring it here.

973
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,460
Congratulations.

974
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
What are you doing?

975
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,460
Have you never heard of this saying?

976
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,460
It's better to break the ten temples

977
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
than to break the wedding.

978
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Song Luo Tian is not a human being.

979
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
You can settle the score with him later.

980
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,460
It's indeed a bit of a loss

981
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,460
to make trouble here today.

982
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,460
Yan Yan,

983
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,460
go back with me.

984
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,460
What do you think of me?

985
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,460
I'm here to give you a gift.

986
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,460
This is really a gift.

987
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,460
You're so mean.

988
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,460
Go away.

989
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Don't worry.

990
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,460
Don't worry.

991
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Let's go.

992
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,460
Song Luo Tian,

993
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,460
you don't even accept the gift?

994
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,460
Don't you want to know

995
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,460
what I've prepared for you?

996
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,460
I'd like to see

997
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,460
what else you can do.

998
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
Open it.

999
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Come on.

1000
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,460
It's so good.

1001
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
It's good for your lungs and heart.

1002
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
It's good for your knees and feet.

1003
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
It's good for your legs.

1004
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
It's good for your muscles and muscles.

1005
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
It's good for your sleep.

1006
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,460
It's good for your body.

1007
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
It's good for your body.

1008
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,460
And these

1009
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
are all made for you.

1010
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
They're ready for your use in the future.

1011
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,460
You didn't mean to do this, did you?

1012
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,460
Don't worry.

1013
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,460
Don't worry.

1014
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
There's one more box.

1015
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,460
Why don't you go and have a look?

1016
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,460
Come on.

1017
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
Don't be so timid.

1018
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,460
Come on.

1019
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,460
Open it.

1020
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
These

1021
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,460
were all taken from you

1022
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,460
when we were kids.

1023
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,460
We agreed to return them to you

1024
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,460
when we got married.

1025
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Now,

1026
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,460
we're not even related.

1027
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,460
See?

1028
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,460
See?

1029
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
I'm just like that.

1030
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,460
I'm always right.

1031
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,460
I'm always right.

1032
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
I'm always right.

1033
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,460
I'm always right.

1034
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,460
That's right.

1035
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
Isn't it?

1036
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,460
That's right.

1037
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
How do I

1038
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,460
handle these things?

1039
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
Keep it.

1040
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Hurry up.

1041
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,460
Please come in.

1042
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,460
Please treat me well.

1043
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,460
I'll treat you well.

1044
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Then I'll do as you say.

1045
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,460
Congratulations, Mr. Song.

1046
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,460
You'll live a long life.

1047
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
You'll have a good life.

1048
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,460
You'll have a good life.

1049
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Let's go.

1050
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
Let's go.

1051
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,460
Let's go.

1052
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Let's go.

1053
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,460
Are you really going to drink here?

1054
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,460
I'm here.

1055
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,460
I heard that the Song family

1056
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,460
invited the famous chef of Bianjing.

1057
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,460
Do you want to try?

1058
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,460
I'll try.

1059
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
Let's go.

1060
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
Let's go.

1061
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Slow down.

1062
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
Are you sure this is the famous chef?

1063
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,460
All the guests are guests.

1064
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,460
Come on.

1065
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,460
There are so many rules.

1066
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,460
Sit down.

1067
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,460
Sit down.

1068
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
Deputy Chief.

1069
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
Sang Qi.

1070
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,460
You and Yan Yan are here.

1071
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,460
I didn't expect it.

1072
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
Deputy Chief.

1073
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,460
This table is for rich and disabled people.

1074
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
The students are specialized in cooking.

1075
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,460
You are the head of the cookery.

1076
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,460
You should sit over there.

1077
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
You should sit with the adults.

1078
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
You don't understand.

1079
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,460
I understand.

1080
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,460
You only talk about the scene.

1081
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Some people can't understand it.

1082
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,460
But this is the best place.

1083
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,460
So you are here for the food.

1084
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,460
That's it.

1085
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,460
Deputy Chief, this is...

1086
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Shake it.

1087
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
Be clean.

1088
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
You are very particular.

1089
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
Yan Ping.

1090
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
I want to shake it too.

1091
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,460
You haven't done it yet.

1092
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
Why are you so busy?

1093
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Just eat it.

1094
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
For me?

1095
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,460
Yes.

1096
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,460
You can use the spoon for me.

1097
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,460
What else?

1098
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

1099
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,460
Yan Yan.

1100
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:45,460
Eat more.

1101
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,460
Pour me some wine.

1102
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,460
You are all here.

1103
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,460
Deputy Chief.

1104
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,460
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

1105
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,460
I thought you wouldn't come to the banquet.

1106
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,460
I thought you wouldn't come.

1107
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
I didn't come.

1108
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,460
Thanks to Yan Yan.

1109
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,460
Sang Qi, eat.

1110
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,460
Come on.

1111
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
Yellow croaker.

1112
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,460
Congratulations.

1113
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
Congratulations.

1114
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,460
Come on.

1115
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,460
This way.

1116
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
Drink.

1117
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,460
What are you doing?

1118
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
Drink.

1119
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,460
No wine.

1120
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,460
Come on.

1121
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
Where is the wine?

1122
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
Why is there no wine?

1123
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,460
Where is the wine?

1124
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,460
There is no wine.

1125
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,460
Why is there no wine?

1126
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,460
Song Qi, Song Qi.

1127
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,460
It's time to drink with Madam.

1128
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
Don't let her wait for too long.

1129
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,460
She has lost her manners.

1130
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,460
Madam can't run away.

1131
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
Yan Yan finally surrendered to me.

1132
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,460
I must win against her.

1133
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,460
Come on.

1134
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,460
Song Qi.

1135
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Take it.

1136
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,460
Take it.

1137
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,460
Come on.

1138
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
Come on.

1139
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
I'm afraid you can't.

1140
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,460
Come on.

1141
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,460
Good.

1142
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,460
Yan Yan.

1143
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,460
Your legs don't hurt anymore?

1144
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,460
Maybe I just need to get some air.

1145
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,460
That's it.

1146
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,460
Come on.

1147
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
Pour the wine.

1148
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
Where is Deputy Chief?

1149
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,460
Come on.

1150
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,460
I didn't notice.

1151
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,460
Wasn't he still here just now?

1152
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,460
I'm full.

1153
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,460
I'll take a breath and take a nap.

1154
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
Okay.

1155
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460
It's so delicious.

1156
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
