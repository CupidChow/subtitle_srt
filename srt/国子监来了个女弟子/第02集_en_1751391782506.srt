1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm just a little boy

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm a little boy

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a little boy

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm a little boy

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm a little boy

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm a little boy

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm a little boy

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm a little boy

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm a little boy

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm a little boy

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm a little boy

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm a little boy

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm a little boy

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm a little boy

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The rain is clear, the water is clear

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The rain is strong, the wind is strong

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The city is hard, the spring is hard

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The spring is hard, the spring is hard

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The spring is hard, the spring is hard

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The spring is hard, the spring is hard

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The spring is hard, the spring is hard

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Episode 2

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Deputy Chief, you finally found me

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Deputy Chief, in broad daylight

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you afraid you're going to hit me?

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
At this point, Deputy Chief is the mostlection

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sang Qi

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There are no outsiders

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to talk to you

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I understood

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
what should you do from now on

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
so as not to disturb me

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Actually I have done very well

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
As long as Deputy Chief receives my Araki

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will be just and sensible

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Definitely not a trouble for Deputy Chief

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,920
Are you serious?

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
Yes.

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm a good talker.

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,480
Good.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
I'll make an exception.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,640
Give me the pouch now.

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,720
I'll keep it.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
Are you kidding me?

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,600
Of course.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm a private official.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,000
I won't be kidding.

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,480
But I'll give you only this chance.

49
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,240
Give it to me.

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,120
Okay.

51
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,920
The pouch.

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,960
I...

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
I've got the pouch.

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,720
Deputy Chief, I must have brought it with me.

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,720
But I just...

56
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,520
I...

57
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,200
I knew it.

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,400
You gave me the fake pouch.

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
You're messing with the real thing.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,760
I just...

61
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
Enough.

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,240
I've given you a chance.

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,640
You're not sure about it.

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,800
But I really...

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,080
But you're not a good person.

66
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
I can't just let you do it.

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,320
I can let you

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,480
do the rumors.

69
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,320
I hope you can

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
be a good girl in the Imperial College.

71
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,280
And you can learn from your mistakes.

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,800
Don't humiliate your family.

73
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,240
No.

74
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,880
That's not right.

75
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,960
Deputy Chief, you wanted to

76
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,880
kick me out of the Imperial College.

77
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,080
Now I've done this.

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,520
Don't you want to punish me?

79
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
Ask the world.

80
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,880
Which teacher

81
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
would deliberately humiliate his students?

82
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
I know

83
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,920
I was harsh to you before.

84
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,200
But that's for your own good.

85
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,000
I hope you can learn something more.

86
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
I hope you can get the magic.

87
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,080
Sang Qi.

88
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,520
Don't let me down.

89
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,080
Did I

90
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
misunderstand him?

91
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,640
All right.

92
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,320
I know you understand.

93
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,400
Go and learn.

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm going to take the exam.

95
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,240
Go.

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,120
Go.

97
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,800
I'm going to kick you out.

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,080
Deputy Chief, you're so generous today.

99
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,920
This is not your style at all.

100
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,680
Besides,

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,680
I was obviously examined

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,080
before I was asked to do the exam.

103
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,600
This can only mean one thing.

104
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,280
My pouch was stolen by you.

105
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Sang Qi.

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
How could I do that?

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,680
Where did you put it?

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,080
Where?

109
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,680
Sang Qi.

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:04,880
Where?

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,080
Sang Qi.

112
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,880
I want to punish you.

113
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,600
Punish me?

114
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,480
Punish me?

115
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,680
You ran away so fast.

116
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Deputy Chief.

117
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,880
Help me!

118
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,800
You see,

119
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm still looking for one.

120
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
I can wouldn't have done anything

121
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
other than Suit of Romance.

122
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,720
diaphragm Paper

123
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,680
Mr. Liu, what can I do for you?

124
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,320
You're sure powerful!

125
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,760
My lord.

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
However brave you are,

127
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,280
you're stronger than my miss.

128
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,000
What?

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:55,960
Thanks.

130
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,480
Thanks again for your help.

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,200
My lord.

132
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Which position is Miss Sang's?

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,920
happiness?

134
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,480
Yeah.

135
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,360
Thinking highly of yourself.

136
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:33,480
As long as as a person

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
isn't connected to his own sorrow,

138
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,760
よし

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
Let's go

140
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,480
Do you wear this kind of clothes

141
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,360
I'll show you something later

142
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,360
What is it?

143
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,200
Let's see

144
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,880
Enter

145
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,200
Show you the daunting若...

146
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,860
let's call it

147
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,740
Thirty-Quart

148
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,680
It's not her.

149
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,680
I was going to hit her.

150
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,760
But she was too impulsive.

151
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
It's hard for me to deal with her.

152
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,120
It's hard for me to deal with her.

153
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,640
Sang Qi. Sang Qi.

154
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,240
I'm telling you.

155
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
This is my specialty.

156
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,280
I'm not going to buy it.

157
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,600
I'm not going to buy it.

158
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,600
This is really...

159
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
You're really going to buy it?

160
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,200
I just saw it.

161
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,840
What are you looking at?

162
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
I don't know if it's okay.

163
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
The teacher is here.

164
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you sick?

165
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,880
Stand up.

166
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,640
Hello, Dr. Feng.

167
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,400
Okay.

168
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Please sit down.

169
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,840
There is no end to it.

170
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,720
There is a way.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,680
What's the answer?

172
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,840
The first thing you know

173
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
is the end.

174
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,160
Let's go.

175
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,760
Wait a minute.

176
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,360
Hurry up.

177
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,880
Coming.

178
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,200
Let's go.

179
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,600
You mean

180
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,800
everything in the world has a beginning and an end.

181
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,520
Every thing has a beginning and an end.

182
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,760
The way to college is...

183
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
I say, Qi.

184
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,400
It's school break.

185
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,720
Can't you take a break?

186
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,560
You should be more careful in your study.

187
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,280
I know.

188
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,720
Sang Qi.

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,280
So this...

190
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
This is what I taught you.

191
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,600
What's this?

192
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,800
Is it a love letter from Yan Xiao Lang?

193
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,640
Shut up.

194
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,200
What does it say?

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,000
It means

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
you should go to the campus

197
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,920
and meet him.

198
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,720
He even told you to go alone.

199
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,840
I see.

200
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
This is a war letter.

201
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,920
No wonder Yan Yan always criticizes me.

202
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,120
He even cut off my pen and wrote to me.

203
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,120
Then why did Yan Yan make it difficult for you?

204
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,560
Maybe...

205
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,840
Maybe he doesn't like girls in school.

206
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,560
Fine.

207
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,280
Then I'll go with you today.

208
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,760
No need.

209
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,240
I know Yan Yan doesn't dare to teach me.

210
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,720
I'm worried about Yan Yan's safety.

211
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,080
One week later

212
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,800
Don't worry.

213
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
It's just a Tur × Tur game.

214
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,960
I'll do my best.

215
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,280
Thank you.

216
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,200
Here, I'll be there.

217
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,920
No.

218
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,840
I'm not afraid of anything.

219
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,840
I'm just a little bit afraid.

220
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,840
I'm just a little bit afraid.

221
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm just a little bit afraid.

222
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
You're so eager to meet me.

223
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,280
Come on.

224
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,040
What?

225
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,200
What are you pretending?

226
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,360
Let's start.

227
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
No.

228
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
Isn't our progress too fast?

229
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
And this is the school field in the Imperial College.

230
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,380
Yes.

231
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Didn't you choose this place?

232
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
It's spacious enough.

233
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
It just doesn't have a limit.

234
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Hurry up.

235
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
I have a lot of things to do.

236
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,380
No.

237
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,880
Although you admire me,

238
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,880
shouldn't we first have a candy

239
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
and then have a gift?

240
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
Why don't you hide?

241
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Are you trying to make me happy?

242
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,380
I...

243
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
You just said

244
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
that you want to have a candy.

245
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

246
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
This is a box of boxes.

247
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
Didn't you give it to me to show your affection?

248
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Why is my box here?

249
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Someone secretly put it in my drawer.

250
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Didn't you put it in there?

251
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Or did a ghost put it in there?

252
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Who is this bastard?

253
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
What are you doing?

254
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
What bastard?

255
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
I don't allow you to do this to yourself.

256
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,880
Although I don't want to get married for the time being,

257
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
but seeing your love for me,

258
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Sang Die is a hero.

259
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,880
I will accept this marriage.

260
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Yan Yan, this is a misunderstanding.

261
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I have something to do. I'll go first.

262
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,880
What are you doing?

263
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
What do you mean?

264
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Let go of me.

265
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
Are you kidding me?

266
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
Are the boxes delivered at will?

267
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,880
You are insulting me in public.

268
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
I said that the box was not delivered by me.

269
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Moreover, I don't want to spread this news.

270
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,880
If anyone knows, I'll just help you silence it.

271
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Yan Xiaolang,

272
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
you have a day today.

273
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Sister San.

274
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Where are you going?

275
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Don't go.

276
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,880
Sister San, wait for me.

277
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Yan Yan, don't go.

278
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Sit down.

279
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,880
You are so handsome.

280
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Sister San.

281
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Hurry up.

282
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Deputy Chief.

283
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,880
You are tricking me.

284
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
You stole my box

285
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
and transferred it to Yan Yan.

286
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Sister,

287
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
you don't have to go now.

288
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
You can go.

289
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Young Master, be careful.

290
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
assassination.

291
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
Stop.

292
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,880
Where are you going?

293
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
Is there

294
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,880
any problem with her?

295
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,560
I'll see how you explain it

296
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,280
and what other reasons you want to use to cover up for me.

297
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,240
Let's begin.

298
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
What's there to explain?

299
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,840
I did say I'd take some money.

300
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,960
But I didn't say I wouldn't play tricks.

301
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,560
The Ministry of War has been playing tricks since ancient times.

302
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,320
I advise you to read more books

303
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
and accumulate more knowledge.

304
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
If you meet this kind of situation

305
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,640
in other people's hands,

306
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,080
you can also protect yourself.

307
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
You mean

308
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,240
I should thank you?

309
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

310
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,280
It's my duty to teach people.

311
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,320
You're welcome.

312
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,360
Teach people?

313
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,360
Ye Mingzhi,

314
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
I know what you know.

315
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,800
There are people outside the people.

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There are mountains outside the mountains.

317
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Yaniza damaged everything here.

318
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,080
Yan came at the right time.

319
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Look at how he acted just now.

320
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,800
He wanted to tail me.

321
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,980
Sang Qi

322
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,520
jested with Su Wuyi

323
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,640
but tense Yan Yan again.

324
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,040
Now he wants to Mallu's characters

325
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,400
We should give her another chance.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,080
Tell her to get out of here.

327
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,320
Young Master, bad news.

328
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,880
I saw Yan Yan coming here with a bunch of people.

329
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
He's probably going to trouble Miss Sang.

330
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,560
I think you should take care of this.

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,240
She has her own troubles.

332
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,120
It's none of my business.

333
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
But...

334
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,160
But...

335
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,840
You...

336
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,640
If you want to make up for your mistakes,

337
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,840
you can go by yourself.

338
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,640
Yes, sir.

339
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,840
You can stay at the Sang's house tonight.

340
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,800
It's good for your Miss.

341
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,240
Young Master,

342
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,560
I was wrong.

343
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
Yan Yan lost face in public.

344
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,760
She won't give up.

345
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,040
I'll blame Yan Yan for it.

346
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,520
I won't let her get away with it.

347
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Sang Qi!

348
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
Sang Qi!

349
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,120
Over there!

350
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,360
How's the preparation going?

351
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,440
Don't worry.

352
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,880
It's all set.

353
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,160
Yan Yan is here to take revenge.

354
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,160
What should we do?

355
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
If he wants me to be in the Imperial College,

356
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
he must be careful.

357
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,440
I can't take action in public.

358
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,120
We'll take action after Yan Yan is done.

359
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,280
Don't be afraid.

360
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,520
I'm here.

361
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,440
Can you beat so many people?

362
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,960
I can beat ten people. Do you believe me?

363
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,720
No.

364
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
If you don't believe me, leave now!

365
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,800
Young Master.

366
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,520
You...

367
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,920
You want to run away?

368
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,200
Stop!

369
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,440
Stop!

370
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,080
Catch him!

371
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,840
Catch him!

372
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,720
Stop!

373
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,320
Don't run!

374
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,000
Sang Qi, run!

375
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
You guys, stop Sang Qi!

376
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,840
Help Yan Xiao Lang!

377
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,400
Hurry!

378
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,160
Catch him!

379
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,720
Catch him!

380
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
Catch him!

381
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,240
Catch him!

382
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,000
Catch him!

383
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,800
Catch him!

384
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,600
Catch him!

385
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,480
Catch him!

386
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,280
Catch him!

387
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,240
Catch him!

388
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Catch him!

389
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Catch him!

390
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Catch him!

391
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,120
Stop!

392
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
Yan Yan is hit!

393
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,680
He's hit!

394
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,120
Hurry!

395
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,000
No, I...

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
Yan Yan, you two are on the same side.

397
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,600
We are on the same side!

398
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
No!

399
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
Sang Hua Tian,

400
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,720
let's settle this together.

401
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,320
Let me do it!

402
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,920
No!

403
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
No!

404
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,520
It's a misunderstanding!

405
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,320
Let me explain!

406
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,560
Be careful!

407
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,680
Be careful!

408
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,360
Be careful!

409
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,360
Be careful!

410
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,880
Be careful!

411
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
Hold on!

412
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,520
Be careful!

413
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,320
Hold on!

414
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,640
Pull him out!

415
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
Hold on!

416
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,280
Help!

417
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,440
I'll go down and fix the oil.

418
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
What should we do, Tian?

419
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,360
What are you doing?

420
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,760
Go back!

421
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,680
Deputy Chief.

422
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,200
I'm so scared!

423
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,200
Hold on!

424
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Hold on!

425
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Hold on!

426
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Hold on!

427
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Hold on!

428
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Hold on!

429
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Hold on!

430
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Hold on!

431
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Slow down!

432
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Be careful!

433
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Be careful!

434
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Be careful!

435
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Be careful!

436
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,480
Sang Qi!

437
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Deputy Chief!

438
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Don't say it.

439
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
I understand what you want to say.

440
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Let's talk about it later, okay?

441
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Go back and change your clothes.

442
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,120
Don't catch a cold.

443
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
If you catch a cold,

444
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,720
what should we do?

445
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,320
What about Gong Zi Juan?

446
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
We'll be sad, Deputy Chief.

447
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,880
Okay, you...

448
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,520
Take care of yourself.

449
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
You guys!

450
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,000
If anything happens,

451
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,200
I'll punish you!

452
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,680
Yes!

453
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Sang Qi!

454
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,800
I've always been clear about my grudges.

455
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,560
But I'm not done yet!

456
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,080
Let's go!

457
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Let's go!

458
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
Let's go!

459
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,080
Let's go!

460
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,840
Let's go!

461
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,360
I'm not done yet!

462
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,040
Let's go!

463
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I'm not done yet!

464
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Qi,

465
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,240
go back to the classroom and wait for me.

466
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,440
I'll get a fire basin.

467
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Okay, no problem.

468
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Miss Sang Qi,

469
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm Wei Zhan Hong from the whole class.

470
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Hello.

471
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,760
You're all wet.

472
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,920
Why don't I take you to the side room to take a break?

473
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,640
There's a free student uniform over there.

474
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
You can pick one to wear.

475
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
Okay.

476
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Good.

477
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
I'll go.

478
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Thank you!

479
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
See you.

480
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,320
Come with me.

481
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
Hurry up.

482
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Hurry up.

483
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Let's go.

484
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Look.

485
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
You asked me about this last time.

486
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Now that Brother Sang said...

487
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,320
It's my fault.

488
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
He's right.

489
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
He's right.

490
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
He's right.

491
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
He's right.

492
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
There's a small note on it.

493
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Look at it yourself.

494
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
And this.

495
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
These are all to be remembered.

496
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Right.

497
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Did you see Sang Qi?

498
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
She seems to have gone to the side room

499
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
with Wei Zhan Hong from the whole class.

500
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Wei Zhan Hong?

501
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Yes.

502
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Help me take it.

503
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Thank you.

504
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Please.

505
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,320
This is the place.

506
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
I'm a man.

507
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
I have my own problems.

508
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Miss Sang Qi.

509
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Please help yourself.

510
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Thank you.

511
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
But, Brother Wei.

512
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I'm actually a little afraid of the dark.

513
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Why don't you come with me?

514
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
You...

515
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Hurry up.

516
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Hurry up.

517
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
Hurry up.

518
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,320
Let us go.

519
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
Let us go.

520
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,320
You're so polite

521
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
to greet the students.

522
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Listen.

523
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
I, Sang Qi, never want to cause trouble.

524
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
But I will never let you bully me.

525
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
From now on,

526
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
I wish you all the best.

527
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
Don't think about coming to me for trouble.

528
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Do you understand?

529
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Goodbye, students.

530
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
I...

531
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
You...

532
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
You're useless.

533
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
You're useless.

534
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,320
Come on, young master.

535
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
Drink some ginger soup to warm your body.

536
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Young master.

537
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Are you feeling better now?

538
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
It's okay.

539
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
How is Sang Qi?

540
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
He's doing fine.

541
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
But...

542
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
He sent this ginger soup.

543
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,920
He said you were weak.

544
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
So he made this soup

545
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,800
to help you get rid of the cold.

546
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,120
I'm not drinking it.

547
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,680
Sang Qi even dared to provoke me.

548
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,400
Deputy Chief.

549
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,360
Deputy Chief.

550
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,600
Deputy Chief.

551
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Deputy Chief.

552
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You are...

553
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,400
Nothing.

554
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,480
Dr. Feng, you need to talk to me.

555
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Sit down.

556
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,320
Deputy Chief.

557
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,240
This...

558
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,320
Sang Qi

559
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,840
is bullying badly that

560
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,040
he has his classmate.

561
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,240
Song Lu Tian is so furious

562
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,760
that he has held such a high ideal.

563
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,640
Are sang qi Marcel again

564
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,600
bullying a man in our class?

565
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,320
Yes.

566
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,480
This doesn't seem reasonable.

567
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,600
Let me go ask Sang Qi

568
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,620
about this now.

569
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,300
Dr. Feng,

570
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,140
I don't think it's necessary.

571
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,220
Just let them solve the small problems

572
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,460
between the two of them.

573
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,940
As long as it doesn't cause a big trouble,

574
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,380
you don't have to intervene.

575
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,380
But...

576
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,340
Dr. Feng,

577
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,380
I know what to do.

578
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,220
You can go ahead.

579
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,020
Okay.

580
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,500
I'll do whatever you want.

581
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,180
Young Master,

582
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,980
you're really generous.

583
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,700
Sang Qi dragged you into this.

584
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,380
But now you're defending him

585
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,660
and speaking up for him.

586
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,980
It seems that you've forgiven him.

587
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,100
Who said I've forgiven him?

588
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,700
I just want to avenge him.

589
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,100
Amitabha

590
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,580
Why are you sighing?

591
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,220
has Deputy Chief already known

592
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,060
that Grandpa isON bottom Week's Sunday,

593
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:44,980
and he would never dare to make another move.

594
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,900
If he dares to play some tricks,

595
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,860
It's fine.

596
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,260
Just accompany him.

597
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,660
I'm not worried about Yan Yan.

598
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,580
I'm worried about Deputy Chief.

599
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,260
You mean

600
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,900
you're worried that Deputy Chief will make trouble for him?

601
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,660
Deputy Chief has always been a man of his word.

602
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,860
Rumors spread that he was offended

603
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,380
and was forced to wander around the world.

604
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,580
Yesterday, you dragged him into the water.

605
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,860
Today,

606
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,900
he might kill you.

607
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,700
But I've given him ginger soup.

608
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,780
Deputy Chief

609
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,140
won't be so petty, right?

610
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,140
Let's wait and see.

611
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,380
Deputy Chief is here. Hurry up.

612
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,380
Deputy Chief is here.

613
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,220
Today's law class

614
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,780
is not about law.

615
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,900
I want to teach you some skills of crime.

616
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,940
Later,

617
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,260
I'll give you a few

618
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,180
cases of the recent cases of the Jingzhao Prefecture.

619
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,780
You'll play the role of the subordinates

620
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,940
and the five-seat position.

621
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,420
You'll think about it together

622
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,380
and find out the truth.

623
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,060
Deputy Chief?

624
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,460
That's interesting.

625
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,660
We can play it by ear later.

626
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,820
Then you'll see

627
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,540
how I'll catch the real culprit.

628
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,180
Although it's a simulation case,

629
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
we still need to find out the truth.

630
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,540
Later,

631
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,780
we'll draw lots

632
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,020
and choose one of you

633
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,340
to play the role of the victim.

634
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,820
The victim?

635
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,220
And play the role of the victim.

636
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,260
Sang Qi.

637
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,540
You're the first female student

638
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,580
we've ever had in the Imperial College.

639
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,900
We should take good care of you.

640
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,020
You'll draw first.

641
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,100
I think Deputy Chief is not that petty.

642
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,220
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

643
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:41,820
Are you done?

644
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:44,980
Yes.

645
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,500
I'm done.

646
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,940
Be quiet.

647
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,060
Stand back.

648
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,980
You really got me.

649
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,420
It's okay.

650
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,580
It's just once.

651
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,460
This case happened last month.

652
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,780
There was a farm in the mountains.

653
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,980
The victim was buried in the ground like this

654
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,020
with a knife in his back.

655
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,260
But the doors and windows in the room

656
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,460
were locked from the inside.

657
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,900
How did the murderer escape?

658
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,340
Deputy Chief.

659
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,660
I think the victim still has a breath.

660
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,020
We should send him to the hospital as soon as possible.

661
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,580
Whoever says that, go to the back.

662
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,900
Don't play around in the classroom.

663
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,020
Is there anyone

664
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,820
who wants to share his thoughts?

665
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,260
There's only one truth.

666
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,740
I've made my decision.

667
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,460
The victim committed suicide.

668
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,420
Yan Yan.

669
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,140
How could it be suicide?

670
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,220
Remember it.

671
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,060
Remember it.

672
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,980
The doors and windows were locked from the inside.

673
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,100
The murderer couldn't escape.

674
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,660
So there's no murderer.

675
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,100
The victim committed suicide.

676
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,420
He killed himself.

677
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,980
How can we explain the knife in his back?

678
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
It's not simple.

679
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,980
He used ice to make the knife.

680
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,940
He was so sharp that he could cut the blade.

681
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,220
He could cut the blade with his body.

682
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,180
Yan Yan is really smart.

683
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,420
Last month, before autumn,

684
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,540
there was no ice.

685
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,420
Do you think it's the same as the ice in your house?

686
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,620
Last month...

687
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
Then tell me.

688
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,300
How did the murderer escape?

689
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,180
I'll tell you.

690
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,860
I think it's...

691
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,500
You're here to find me?

692
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,780
You scared me.

693
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,700
San Qi.

694
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,540
You're being too filial.

695
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,740
The victim.

696
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,620
Please play your role well.

697
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,540
Don't be too stiff.

698
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,260
Get down.

699
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,180
That's right.

700
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,820
The victim's face is too clear.

701
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,180
Who has a handkerchief?

702
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
Cover his face.

703
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,620
I know.

704
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,300
The murderer will use his magic.

705
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,700
Yan Yan.

706
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,180
Don't read your book.

707
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,540
You're being too much.

708
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,180
Could it be that

709
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,580
the victim didn't die here.

710
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,140
He was injured and hid in the room.

711
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,700
He was injured and died.

712
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,580
That's right.

713
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,780
That's it?

714
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,980
That's it.

715
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,660
That's it?

716
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,500
I brought you here to investigate this case.

717
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,700
I hope that

718
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,180
you won't be deceived by your appearance

719
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,340
when you're investigating the case.

720
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,740
If you become the official of the court

721
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,380
and work for the court in the future,

722
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,540
don't be self-righteous.

723
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,020
Be cautious.

724
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,300
Remember the principle of

725
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,460
life and death are separate.

726
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,420
We still have time

727
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,180
to investigate other cases.

728
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,620
Deputy Chief.

729
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,380
Can we withdraw the money again?

730
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,700
Of course.

731
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,620
Great!

732
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,460
Let's go.

733
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,340
Let's go.

734
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,100
Everyone saw it.

735
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,580
There's a female victim here.

736
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:42,580
She's not young.

737
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,420
Let's continue to investigate.

738
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,340
It's obvious.

739
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,580
If you see a person die,

740
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,020
the first thing to see is the cause of her death.

741
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,900
Don't look here.

742
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,820
It's this knife.

743
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,740
The second thing is to determine the time of death.

744
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,300
How do we usually judge?

745
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,460
The victim usually has a body.

746
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,980
The first is the wrist,

747
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,740
wrist,

748
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,460
neck,

749
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,740
and then the pain.

750
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,060
Huh!

751
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,460
It's you again!

752
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,620
What do you think

753
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,580
about the body of the sword?

754
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,460
No need to guess.

755
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,740
The archer must be there.

756
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,460
Right?

757
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,900
Next,

758
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,380
we need to find this person.

759
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,060
We need to see...

760
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,580
Master.

761
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,420
Please play your role.

762
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,340
It hurts.

763
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,900
Brother.

764
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,100
This is the Guo Zi Jian

765
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,580
you wanted me to come.

766
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Sister Zhang Qi.

767
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,580
Brother.

768
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,300
Brother.

769
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,740
Why did you leave after two days?

770
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,660
Didn't you say you wanted to play with me?

771
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,860
Besides,

772
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,260
it's just a school.

773
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,500
What's the point of thinking about it?

774
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,620
You don't even want your sister.

775
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,980
Qi.

776
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,780
Guo Zi Jian

777
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,100
is not an ordinary place.

778
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,060
He is famous

779
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,460
and grows up to be the pillar of the country.

780
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,260
Moreover,

781
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,500
he can meet

782
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,780
many interesting friends there.

783
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,220
What interesting friends?

784
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,340
You don't even care about your sister.

785
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
His name is...

786
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,940
His name is Xiao Bai.

787
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,340
He is my classmate.

788
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,620
He is a good person

789
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,460
and a good person.

790
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,740
When I go back to Bianjing,

791
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,060
take me to see Xiao Bai.

792
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,620
Okay.

793
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,420
Xiao Bai should

794
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,900
stay in Guo Zi Jian forever.

795
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,740
Qi.

796
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,260
I hope one day,

797
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,460
you can go to Guo Zi Jian to study,

798
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,340
and get a good education.

799
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,860
Show everyone

800
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,100
that not only men can do it

801
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,620
when they study in the palace.

802
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Women can do it too.

803
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,340
Okay.

804
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,340
It's a deal.

805
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,740
It's so tiring to be a man.

806
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,380
Let me tell you.

807
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,780
Bianjing is not as fun as the border.

808
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,420
Actually, I don't know

809
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,380
how my brother endured it.

810
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,340
Where is his best friend Xiao Bai?

811
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:26,900
My brother said

812
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,620
as long as he finds his best friend Xiao Bai,

813
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,220
he will protect me like my brother.

814
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,900
If he finds Xiao Bai,

815
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,260
he will break

816
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Ye Ming Chi's head

817
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,620
and clean up his body.

818
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,860
But I don't know

819
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,860
where he is.

820
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,220
Have you seen Xiao Bai?

821
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,740
Sang Qi.

822
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,340
What are you doing here?

823
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,340
Let's go.

824
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,500
Su Yan.

825
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,420
You've been in Guo Zi Jian for so long.

826
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,780
Do you know my brother Sang Yu's Xiao Bai?

827
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,900
If Sang Qi knows

828
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
that I'm the Xiao Bai that Yu Xiong said,

829
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,100
how will I discipline him?

830
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,820
Next is the chess class.

831
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,780
You don't go to the court.

832
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,900
Do you want to escape?

833
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,540
I'll go right away.

834
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,940
Are you good at chess?

835
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,700
Why don't you go up and show yourself?

836
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,740
I have a lot of things to do recently.

837
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,140
I have to be low-key.

838
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:50,820
Today,

839
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,140
we will learn chess.

840
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,060
Is there anyone who would like to try?

841
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,260
I'm not sure.

842
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,500
I'm not sure.

843
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,220
I'm not sure.

844
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:01,860
I'm not sure.

845
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,500
I'm not sure.

846
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,220
I'm not sure.

847
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:03,980
I'm not sure.

848
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,580
I'm not sure.

849
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,180
I'm not sure.

850
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,740
I'm not sure.

851
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,340
I'm not sure.

852
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,580
Thus, now,

853
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,660
the player only has to play for another 21 hours.

854
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,660
What are you doing?

855
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,220
He is in the practice room.

856
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,020
You said you came for a'Shi Yao.

857
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,980
There is a game.

858
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
You get up in the middle of the usual practice.

859
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,400
Kan 진행

860
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,500
If you don't do it,

861
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,980
you go and take the lesson instead.

862
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,140
Tell me what I should say in my reading.

863
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,180
My ears open wide.

864
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,020
Yu Xu.

865
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,300
I know they're right.

866
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
What do you mean?

867
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,700
Dr. Huo,

868
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,300
let me try.

869
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,940
Let someone see

870
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,020
what a brave man is.

871
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,140
Stress.

872
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,940
Help.

873
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,620
Help.

874
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,140
After you have finished it,

875
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
we shall return to the town together.

876
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,980
Yes.

877
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,180
mentioned it before.

878
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,860
As long as I still have tosam much joss iun

879
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,560
joss iun

880
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,560
Yes.

881
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,000
Well.

882
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,240
I will keep my mouth shut and listen to the words on the joss.

883
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,140
Escaped from the long ware,

884
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,940
who can speak truth?

885
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,840
You have to let me go back to Wudang collect things

886
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,960
I don't care about the joy

887
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,160
I'm just missing you

888
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,360
in my heart

889
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,320
Are you okay?

890
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,160
I want to walk through the long road with you

891
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,360
I want to walk through the fireworks with you

892
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,320
I want to spend the time with you

893
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,800
Grandpa, grandpa, grandpa

894
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,520
Are you okay?

895
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,400
I'm fine

896
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,880
You scared me to death

897
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,720
Deputy Chief

898
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,320
Thank you, Xiang Jiu

899
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,560
You are my student

900
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,280
If anything goes wrong in the Imperial College

901
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,600
I can't be relieved

902
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,960
Qi, are you okay?

903
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm fine

904
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,200
The best of the best

905
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,840
Young Master, you are great

906
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
You are the best

907
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,920
Pei Su Min

908
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:41,280
I also accept this life and death

909
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,640
When the waves of love are gentle

910
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:49,360
They melt into deep kisses

911
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,600
When the waves of love are gentle

912
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:58,000
They melt into deep kisses
