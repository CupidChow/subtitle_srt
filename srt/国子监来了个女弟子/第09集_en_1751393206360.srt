The sound of the zither is like the sound of the water, the sound of the shadow is like the sound of the waves, the sound of the sound of the waves, the sound of the sound of the sound of the waves, the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the sound of the

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 42

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,800
Master Sang.

6
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,560
Master Sang.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Master Sang.

8
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,400
Q.

9
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:53,840
Got up?

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
You're not going out? I shall go in!

11
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,840
I'm in!

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Master Sang.

13
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,640
She's not here.

14
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Her luggage is gone.

15
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,280
No.

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,200
She's gone?

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,800
You're just a female disciple.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,080
It's just the beginning.

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,600
She'll come back.

20
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,600
You're very confident in her.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,440
I've suffered a lot.

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,360
You'll see.

23
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,840
Yan Yan, go back to your training.

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
Come on.

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,720
Here, have a taste.

26
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,120
This is the new tea from the south.

27
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Not bad, right?

28
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,720
You called me here today.

29
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,640
What's the matter?

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
I changed the tea

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
to a new one.

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,840
You mean...

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm afraid

34
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,040
it's hard to come in.

35
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,480
You should come here in person.

36
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
I understand.

37
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Dad.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
I'm back.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,760
You're just a girl.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,360
You know you're back?

41
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,880
Are you

42
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,360
not concerned about your father?

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
How dare I?

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,760
I left a note when I left.

45
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,640
It said I went up the mountain.

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,760
You went up the mountain.

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,240
Who knows which one it is?

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,760
Come here.

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Let me see.

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
How is it?

51
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,760
Do you think your daughter

52
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,000
is prettier?

53
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,920
Not only is she prettier,

54
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,560
she's also darker.

55
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,760
Tell me.

56
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
What did you do up the mountain?

57
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
I went to Shao Lingfeng to learn martial arts.

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,240
Martial arts?

59
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes.

60
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,240
What?

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,800
You didn't learn enough

62
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,960
in our family?

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,560
Dad, you can't say that.

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
We all

65
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,640
learn

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,360
military and gun skills.

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,640
I don't need them in Bianjing.

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,680
I can learn

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,760
some skills.

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Am I right?

71
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
You're right.

72
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,720
Wait.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,640
Lin Mu Feng?

74
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,280
Isn't he

75
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
Yan He Xing's brother?

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,000
You know him?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,320
Of course.

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
He's been with me for a long time.

79
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,160
Of course I know him.

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,360
But he's a man

81
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
who can

82
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,200
teach your father a lesson.

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,720
You can learn from him.

84
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
But if he bullies you,

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,080
tell him

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,800
I'll go up the mountain and kill him.

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,200
Master.

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
Ah...

89
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,080
Master.

90
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,840
I'm thirsty.

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
Thirsty?

92
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm thirsty.

93
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,160
Dad,

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,080
you know me well.

95
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,880
Who can bully your daughter?

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,080
I'm at ease up the mountain.

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,040
I get food and food for my family.

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,640
I get water and a cup.

99
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,880
Deputy Chief gives me a punishment.

100
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,480
Yan Xiao Lang can run my legs.

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,840
He's not tired at all.

102
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm here to get some food.

103
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,880
I'll get some...

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,480
Deputy Chief is also up the mountain.

105
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,360
Zhou Wen Yuan?

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,520
If it's really like what Qi said,

107
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,760
it should be Yan Xiao Lang who runs your legs.

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,840
Why do you go down the mountain

109
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,080
and make trouble yourself?

110
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
It's my daughter's stuff.

111
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,400
Yan Xiao Lang can't take it.

112
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,480
I came back in person.

113
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,840
Don't ask me.

114
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,560
I'm asking you.

115
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,760
Why are you here?

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm here to see Sang Qi.

117
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,480
It seems I'm here at the right time.

118
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,640
If I'm late,

119
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,320
I'm afraid I won't see you again.

120
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,560
You're saying it like

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm not going home.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,920
I agree with her.

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,520
Dad,

124
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,240
why are you helping her?

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm going to do something serious.

126
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,520
Ouch.

127
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,480
Sit.

128
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,400
Let's go.

129
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
What's up?

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,480
I wanted to say goodbye to you.

131
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,440
Where are you going?

132
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,320
I'm going to the south.

133
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,880
But I changed my mind.

134
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm going to the mountain with you.

135
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,880
No.

136
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,760
You don't have to go to the mountain with me.

137
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,440
Just stay with my father.

138
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll get my stuff.

139
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Dad, I'm leaving.

140
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,120
What's there to keep your father company?

141
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,680
Miss,

142
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,720
although Master has been scolding you since you were a kid,

143
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,840
he's been beaten up a lot.

144
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,200
But he never let you

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
beat up or serve people.

146
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,240
You really want to go to the mountain to suffer?

147
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I didn't want to go to the mountain

148
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
to suffer from the power of boxing.

149
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,120
But Ye Meng

150
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,280
has a good chance.

151
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
Look at him.

152
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
He blocked me.

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,400
He blocked me several times.

154
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,720
When I fought him,

155
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,120
I was in the real fight.

156
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,560
If you look at it like this,

157
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,920
my martial arts are far from good.

158
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,760
If I can learn the real kung fu from the mountain,

159
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,640
I'll be a fighter.

160
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
I'll admit it.

161
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
But Miss,

162
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
I think Master Yan

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,720
is trying to teach you a lesson.

164
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
Don't worry.

165
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
Although I'm a person who respects the law,

166
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
he always tries to teach me a lesson

167
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,400
or deliberately misbehave.

168
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
I'll let him change.

169
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,920
Miss,

170
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,280
why do we go to the mountain in the evening

171
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,400
and carry so many things for us?

172
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,720
We have no choice.

173
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,400
I can't let my father know

174
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,120
that I can't learn martial arts from the mountain

175
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
and I'm forced to be a thug.

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,120
What should we do?

177
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
We'll be there soon.

178
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,960
Look ahead.

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,320
Miss, you've said that many times.

180
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Where are we going?

181
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,560
You have to say it to get the motivation.

182
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,200
It's time.

183
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,800
Even if you say you don't want it,

184
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,360
I have no strength to climb the mountain.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,120
Okay.

186
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
Let's take a break.

187
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,000
Come on.

188
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,800
Take a break.

189
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,440
Come on.

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,280
Zhuo Wen Yuan, why are you here?

191
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,200
My son is worried about Miss Cao.

192
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,680
So we've been following you

193
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,440
since you started climbing the mountain.

194
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,360
Qi,

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,960
it's not safe to carry

196
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,560
so many things in the middle of the night, right?

197
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
Master said

198
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,040
we should pay attention to exercise.

199
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,320
It's also an important part of the night practice.

200
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,360
Okay.

201
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
You have to be careful with exercise.

202
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,280
I think you're running out of strength.

203
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,400
Let me help you.

204
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,000
No, no, no.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Qi Mu.

206
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,760
Yes.

207
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,280
No.

208
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,720
Why do you have to climb the mountain?

209
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Give it to me.

210
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,080
It's okay.

211
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,640
Give it to me.

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,320
It's okay.

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,800
You'd better go back.

214
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,280
Why do you climb the mountain?

215
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,040
Miss,

216
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,400
why do you drive Mr. Zhuo away?

217
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
It's good to have someone to carry our bags.

218
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,040
It's convenient to buy sandbags.

219
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,200
If he sees me doing the chores on the mountain,

220
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,720
he can just tell me about it.

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,520
If he tells this to my father,

222
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
he will be angry.

223
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,440
Then the Sang Family will take the spiritual Buddha

224
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,160
and teach me.

225
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,320
I'll learn it.

226
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,120
What are you talking about?

227
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Nothing.

228
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,600
Don't mind it.

229
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,680
You finally took a day off.

230
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,600
Why can't you take a break?

231
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,360
Or do something you like.

232
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
I want to go to the mountain with you.

233
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,480
You can't stay on the mountain

234
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,560
without your brother or dog.

235
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,280
Besides, you don't like to learn martial arts.

236
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,800
Why do you always follow me?

237
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,320
What if you suffer on the mountain?

238
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,400
How can I suffer?

239
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,520
I told you.

240
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,480
The men on the mountain

241
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
have served me well.

242
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,880
Yan Xiaolang runs your legs.

243
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,080
Deputy Chief beats you.

244
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Yes.

245
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,280
I envy Yan Xiaolang.

246
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,120
I won't believe

247
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,520
Deputy Chief beats you.

248
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,600
I want to see

249
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,960
what kind of life you have on the mountain.

250
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,360
Don't you want to go to the temple?

251
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,560
Why don't you go?

252
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,840
After all,

253
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,680
you should take a break.

254
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,280
If you live well,

255
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,640
I'll go to work.

256
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,200
What if I don't live well?

257
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,240
If you don't live well,

258
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
I'll help you get married.

259
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,440
Jing Meng, let's go.

260
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes.

261
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,520
Chu Fengyuan.

262
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
The Temple of the Deceased

263
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,840
We're finally here.

264
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,480
Look.

265
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,760
The gate is magnificent.

266
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,720
There are mountains,

267
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,520
waters, flowers and fields.

268
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,600
How can it be uncomfortable?

269
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,560
The so-called Song Jun...

270
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Let's go in and have a look.

271
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,560
Stop.

272
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Deputy Chief.

273
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
We're finally back.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
Yuan Yan.

275
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,400
It's a good luck to practice martial arts.

276
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,560
Yuan Yan.

277
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,920
Zhuo, why are you here?

278
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,440
Yes.

279
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,920
Help.

280
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,360
Zhuo, help me.

281
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,480
Zhuo.

282
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,080
Sang Qi.

283
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm back.

284
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,800
Since you're back,

285
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
get on the job.

286
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Get on the job?

287
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
What job?

288
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Where's Lian Pian?

289
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,880
Lian Pian is outside.

290
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,680
I'll go find Lian Pian.

291
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,560
I'll go find Lian Pian too.

292
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:49,960
Lian Pian.

293
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,680
Qi.

294
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Don't go.

295
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,280
Tell me what's going on.

296
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,520
What's there to say?

297
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,400
Sang Qi.

298
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,600
Since you're back,

299
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
go and do the chores.

300
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,200
Why are you still lazy?

301
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,920
Qi.

302
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,560
Tell me.

303
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,680
There are great masters on this mountain

304
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,760
who practice martial arts.

305
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,680
You're loved by thousands.

306
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,640
You're skilled and have a good reputation.

307
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,360
You're more free than in the city.

308
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,840
Why do I look at you

309
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,800
differently?

310
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Qi.

311
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,200
Are you really going to learn martial arts?

312
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,280
Of course I'm here to learn martial arts.

313
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,120
But...

314
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,720
But I just had a little accident.

315
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,200
Accident?

316
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Yes.

317
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,480
Accident.

318
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,280
How did I know

319
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,480
that Master Yan only had one disciple?

320
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,080
So he asked me to compete with Yan Yan.

321
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,680
You lost.

322
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,400
I didn't lose.

323
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,360
It's because Master Yan

324
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,280
is very close to me.

325
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,440
He wants to test me.

326
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,200
Think about it.

327
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:55,540
He made me a

328
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,800
but he didn't say he would kick me out.

329
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
What does that mean?

330
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
You understand, right?

331
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,000
That means

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,280
you haven't recognized

333
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,440
this master yet.

334
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,600
That's not important.

335
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,200
Sang Qi.

336
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Zi Yan.

337
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Master Yan.

338
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,680
Sang Qi.

339
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,400
Do you know that this Spirit Wukong

340
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,080
is a secret place?

341
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,640
I asked you and Yan Yan to stay

342
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,040
and you've already done it.

343
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,600
Now you brought someone back.

344
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,400
Aren't you afraid that he'll be angry

345
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,640
and kick you out?

346
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
Master Yan.

347
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,160
Don't kick me out.

348
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,480
I finally came up here.

349
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,600
I can explain.

350
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,280
He...

351
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,040
He won't stay long.

352
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,200
He just came up here to have a look.

353
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,080
Right?

354
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:40,960
Say it.

355
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,080
Right?

356
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,520
Zhuang Wen Yuan.

357
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Say it.

358
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Sang girl.

359
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,360
What are you waiting for?

360
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,560
Come and work.

361
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,560
I'll go first.

362
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,560
Coming.

363
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,200
The master that A Qi has been thinking about

364
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
is Deputy Chief's uncle.

365
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,080
Maybe.

366
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
Deputy Chief has worked so hard

367
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,560
to get A Qi to come up here.

368
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,920
He really worked hard.

369
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
I should do my best

370
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,400
as a student.

371
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,840
But you

372
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,440
should take a good vacation.

373
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,600
Don't you have anything to do?

374
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,000
Leave early.

375
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
Don't waste your time.

376
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,440
I won't bother you then.

377
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,000
But I'm a little thirsty.

378
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,360
You'll leave me some water.

379
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Drink water and go there.

380
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,120
Sang Qi.

381
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,720
Bring me the ball.

382
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,160
Hurry.

383
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,840
Aren't you going to drink water?

384
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,440
I'm not thirsty now.

385
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,120
Sang Qi.

386
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
I want to eat peanuts.

387
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Bring me the peanuts.

388
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
Okay.

389
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,120
Peanuts.

390
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,400
Peanuts are here.

391
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,160
You're hungry?

392
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:08,840
Go cook.

393
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,800
Okay.

394
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,840
You...

395
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Zhuo Yuan.

396
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,840
Why are you still here?

397
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,240
I'm in a hurry.

398
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,440
I want to stay here.

399
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,240
What?

400
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Why?

401
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,040
You're their assistant.

402
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,440
I'm your private.

403
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
You're my private?

404
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,640
Are you kidding me?

405
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,840
Why don't you go with those girls?

406
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
How can I know if I don't try?

407
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,240
With the time you have,

408
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,640
I think you should go down the mountain

409
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
and do something important.

410
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
After all,

411
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,040
you're a free man.

412
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Why bother?

413
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Deputy Chief.

414
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,440
I think you're free here too.

415
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,840
Why don't you go back with me?

416
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Sang Qi.

417
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,240
Sang Qi.

418
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Sang Qi.

419
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,640
Sang Qi.

420
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:54,840
I...

421
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,440
Sang Qi.

422
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm starving.

423
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
What are you doing?

424
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,440
Go cook.

425
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,040
Go cook.

426
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Dad.

427
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Uncle.

428
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,040
Who are you?

429
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Master Yan.

430
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
I'm Zhuo Wen Yuan.

431
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,840
I'm here to disturb you for a few days.

432
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,840
Please forgive me.

433
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
I'm sorry.

434
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,640
Jin Mo.

435
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,440
I brought this

436
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,240
from the Western Jin Dynasty.

437
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
It's a gift for you.

438
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
Good wine.

439
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,640
Fine.

440
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,840
There are so many people here.

441
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,440
You're not the only one.

442
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
But I won't take the painting

443
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
if you insist.

444
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,240
I came here to take care of Sang Qi.

445
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,640
Sang Qi.

446
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Not to study.

447
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,640
Look at the situation now.

448
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
You're so hardworking.

449
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,240
You'll only ruin my uncle.

450
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
He'll have to teach you more.

451
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,440
You won't learn anything

452
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,840
in the future.

453
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
I know.

454
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,640
I have no other way.

455
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,040
Master Yan.

456
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,840
Yes.

457
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,640
Are you satisfied with the wine?

458
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,440
Master Yan, please give me some advice.

459
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,640
As long as you can make it to the top,

460
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,440
it's not impossible.

461
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,040
I have a few

462
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,440
Biling from Dezhou.

463
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
I'll ask someone to bring it to you.

464
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,040
The painting below

465
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,840
is so funny.

466
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,040
You must remember.

467
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
My uncle has two hobbies.

468
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,840
One, he doesn't drink.

469
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
He doesn't drink.

470
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,240
Two, he doesn't eat.

471
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,240
As long as you can control his mouth,

472
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
he'll follow you

473
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
no matter what you say.

474
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
So you mean...

475
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,240
Uncle.

476
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,440
We have the wine.

477
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,640
Let me prepare some good dishes for you.

478
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,840
Good girl.

479
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,440
Go.

480
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Ping Ping.

481
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Help me get the things.

482
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,840
Sang Qi, let me help you.

483
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,040
Master.

484
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
The Noble Consort told us...

485
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,040
It's okay.

486
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
It's okay.

487
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,840
Why are you two following me?

488
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,040
I'm your servant.

489
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Of course I'll help you.

490
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,440
I'm afraid you'll light the kitchen.

491
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Don't worry, Master.

492
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,440
I think you can stay at the door.

493
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,240
Let's go, A'qi.

494
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
Or Master Yan will be angry.

495
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Let's go.

496
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
The dishes are fresh.

497
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,240
Master.

498
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,440
Why don't you go in?

499
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,840
The world is full of good soldiers.

500
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
I invite you to continue watching

501
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,440
the female disciple of the Imperial College.

502
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,440
Deputy Chief.

503
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
I won't light the kitchen.

504
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm worried about you.

505
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,640
If you make a mistake,

506
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
I can solve it at once.

507
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,040
So Uncle won't say I'm a bad guy.

508
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Deputy Chief.

509
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,240
I'm here.

510
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,440
I'm more worried

511
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,840
because you're here.

512
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,440
You two,

513
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,440
have you ever

514
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,440
entered the kitchen since you were in the Jishi?

515
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,840
I've never entered the kitchen.

516
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,040
What can I help you with?

517
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,640
Cut the meal.

518
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,240
Serve the dishes.

519
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,840
You don't know how to do the work.

520
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,640
You're really good at writing.

521
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
That's good.

522
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,040
I'll make the sauce.

523
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,240
You can have the spoon.

524
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,640
The kitchen is complete.

525
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,040
What do you mean?

526
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,240
They're just here to listen to the rumors.

527
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,840
Do you understand?

528
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,040
Go out quickly.

529
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Miss, this is your fault.

530
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,840
Don't be sad.

531
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,640
It's my fault.

532
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,240
Deputy Chief and Mr. Zhuo

533
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
must be good people.

534
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,840
They're here to help you.

535
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,440
How can you dislike them?

536
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,640
Besides,

537
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,840
I'm the only one who can take them.

538
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,040
There won't be any

539
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,840
awkward situation

540
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,640
when the ingredients are not enough.

541
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,240
Don't worry.

542
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Okay.

543
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Don't worry.

544
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,640
If anything goes wrong,

545
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,640
I'll ask you.

546
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,040
Enough.

547
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,440
Think about it.

548
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,840
What should we cook?

549
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,840
How about making roast chicken?

550
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,040
I remember you cooked it

551
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,240
several times.

552
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,640
It's fragrant and not greasy.

553
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
It has a great taste.

554
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,840
Is there chicken?

555
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,840
Zhuo Wenyuan,

556
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
since you want to make roast chicken,

557
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,640
why don't you go out and find one

558
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,640
and get it back?

559
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,640
I'll think of other dishes.

560
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Okay.

561
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Go.

562
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,240
Sang Qi,

563
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,240
how about making sweet potatoes?

564
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Sweet potatoes?

565
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,840
I made some osmanthus sauce.

566
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,440
It goes well with it.

567
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
You did it on purpose.

568
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,440
Sweet potatoes

569
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,640
are better when they are sweet.

570
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
If you eat them for a long time,

571
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
they'll be hard.

572
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,040
It's like silk.

573
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,640
It looks good on the surface.

574
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,840
It smells like alcohol.

575
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,240
It's fishy.

576
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,640
Are the sweet potatoes too plain?

577
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,440
No.

578
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,640
It's perfect with osmanthus sauce.

579
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Okay.

580
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,040
No.

581
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,040
But I only remember

582
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,240
Zhuo Wenyuan who sent me the wine.

583
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,040
But I can't remember Sang Qi who cooked it.

584
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,640
I can't forget him.

585
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
No.

586
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Young Master,

587
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,640
I brought you what you wanted.

588
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Sang Qi.

589
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
What's this?

590
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,440
The natural ingredients of the Western Regions.

591
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,440
It's so good.

592
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,240
I used the crispy roast sheep

593
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,640
to cut the smoke out.

594
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,040
With this strength,

595
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,240
I can make him dream about it.

596
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,640
He wants this every day.

597
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,240
He'll get it back for now.

598
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,640
You're waiting for me?

599
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
No problem.

600
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
Let's help Young Mistress.

601
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,240
Okay.

602
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
Let's start now.

603
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,240
Deputy Chief, you cut the meat.

604
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
Zhuo Wenyuan will prepare the dishes.

605
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,040
Wenbin, you help me.

606
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,640
You two have to do well.

607
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,040
I won't make trouble here.

608
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,040
Don't stay here.

609
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,440
Lianping, come here.

610
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Come.

611
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,640
Are they all inside?

612
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Yes.

613
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
They're all inside.

614
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Come.

615
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,840
Have some.

616
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Thank you, Master.

617
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,040
Master, I got it.

618
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,840
Since you're from Lianping,

619
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
come back and rest.

620
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,040
You...

621
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Go.

622
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Master,

623
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,440
aren't you the one who loves family the most?

624
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,040
Why did you let Zhuo Wenyuan go up the mountain?

625
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,040
Since you went up the mountain,

626
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
I haven't seen anything quiet here.

627
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,840
In this case,

628
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,440
why don't we have some fun?

629
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,840
There's no need to add another Zhuo Wenyuan.

630
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,640
It depends on the size.

631
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Size?

632
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,240
Have you seen a cricket?

633
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
One cricket is nothing.

634
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,640
Two crickets are fighting together.

635
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,440
Like this.

636
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,240
What are you doing?

637
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Ah Jie,

638
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,440
isn't my knife skill good?

639
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,240
My knife skill is still good.

640
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
Lianping.

641
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Lianping!

642
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Lianping!

643
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Lianping!

644
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Lianping!

645
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,240
Lianping!

646
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Lianping!

647
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
Lianping!

648
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
My Lady.

649
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,840
Get them out of here.

650
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
My Lady.

651
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,040
Mr. Zhuo and Mr. Wenyuan are kind.

652
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,040
Get them out.

653
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,440
Get them out!

654
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Then, please leave.

655
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,440
Get them out.

656
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,440
Uncle Wenyuan, how is it?

657
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,040
It's tender and delicious.

658
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,440
It has a strong fragrance.

659
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,840
It's a rare delicacy.

660
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
It's delicious.

661
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,840
This is the recipe for the recipe.

662
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,240
The rest of the ingredients

663
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,640
are in the kitchen.

664
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,640
I'll give you a good laugh.

665
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
You're lucky.

666
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,840
You're lucky.

667
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,240
But I know

668
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
the principle of not taking the credit.

669
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,640
Don't mess with me.

670
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,440
Just tell me.

671
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
It's good that you know.

672
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Actually, it's not a big deal.

673
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,040
I just want you to be free from the burden

674
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,440
and teach me martial arts.

675
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,040
But it's not for nothing.

676
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,840
I've done it.

677
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
I've done all the food and drink I can eat every day.

678
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
I'm satisfied with it.

679
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,240
I'm waiting for your words.

680
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
Let's make a deal.

681
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Deal.

682
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Deal.

683
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Deal.

684
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Please.

685
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Don't bother.

686
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
No need.

687
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
No need.

688
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
No need.

689
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Then Sang Qi

690
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
is my junior.

691
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Junior.

692
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,440
The learning and martial arts

693
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,040
are not for nothing.

694
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,240
What's important is

695
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,840
to have a good day.

696
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,440
I entered the school earlier than you.

697
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,040
I've practiced more than you.

698
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,640
If there's anything you don't understand,

699
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
just tell me.

700
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
I'll tell you.

701
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
I'll tell you.

702
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,640
You're too shy to say it out loud.

703
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,840
To tell you the truth,

704
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
I've already seen

705
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
that Sang Qi is very stubborn.

706
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,040
I've wanted to take her as my disciple.

707
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:46,820
I only made her a

708
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,040
Good.

709
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
For the sake of your study,

710
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,040
I'll teach you the swordplay of the sword from tomorrow.

711
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,040
Swordplay of the sword.

712
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Sit down.

713
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
Sit down.

714
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
Sit down.

715
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Okay.

716
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
You've memorized it all?

717
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,040
Practice it yourself.

718
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Master.

719
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
I've memorized it.

720
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
But I still don't understand it.

721
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,040
If I keep practicing,

722
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I'll only be able to play the zither.

723
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,240
To play the qi and yi,

724
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,640
it'll be a waste of time.

725
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Then I'll ask you now.

726
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,640
What don't you understand?

727
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,440
I can't say it.

728
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,640
I just don't understand it.

729
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Look.

730
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,040
If you don't know the zither,

731
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,240
you won't even be able to understand

732
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
any of the yi.

733
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,640
You practice the circle first.

734
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,040
When you know where you don't understand,

735
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
you'll always ask me.

736
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
I'm going to practice the little wolf.

737
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Just practice more.

738
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Just practice.

739
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Is there anything you don't understand?

740
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
Master.

741
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
This swordplay is very smooth.

742
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
It's extremely natural and clever.

743
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
It's clear that you can pull out a thousand golds

744
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
with four pieces of gold.

745
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
But if you want to change the beautiful moves

746
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
into moves that can hurt people,

747
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
it's really challenging.

748
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,040
The value of the medicine is abstract.

749
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
It's very difficult for me to understand.

750
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
For example, this move.

751
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
This move is called the blue and blue water.

752
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
The so-called blue and blue water

753
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
is the feeling of the breeze floating on the surface of the water

754
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
and the feeling of the layers of layers of layers of layers of layers.

755
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Next move.

756
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
The moon and the stars.

757
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Ah Jie.

758
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,040
It seems that I'm really not in time.

759
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
What's wrong?

760
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
You're really not in time.

761
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
When are you going down the mountain?

762
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
What a coincidence.

763
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Okay.

764
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I'll talk to Master Yan for a while.

765
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
I can't go back for a while.

766
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
It's okay to keep you on the mountain.

767
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
But don't disturb my junior practicing swordsmanship.

768
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Don't worry, Master.

769
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
I have my own plans.

770
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Ah Jie.

771
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
When you're done,

772
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
tell me.

773
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
I'll go to the back hill to pick the leaves with you.

774
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
Master Yan.

775
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
You're still thinking about looking for the wild mushrooms?

776
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,040
The south border army will start to send out goods in a few days.

777
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
If we don't go there,

778
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
it might be too late.

779
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I know.

780
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
You don't have to remind me all the time.

781
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
I'll go back when the time comes.

782
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
I won't be in time.

783
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,040
Yes.

784
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
This mountain is so beautiful.

785
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
It's so beautiful.

786
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
It's so beautiful.

787
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,040
It's so beautiful.

788
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
It's so beautiful.

789
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
It's so beautiful.

790
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
This cave...

791
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
What's wrong with this cave?

792
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Nothing wrong.

793
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
It's just a collection of memories.

794
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,040
When Sang Qi and I met,

795
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
there was also a cave like this.

796
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
I don't understand.

797
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Don't cry.

798
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,040
I'm not crying.

799
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
How can your eyes be wet if you don't cry?

800
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
It's up to you.

801
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Don't be afraid.

802
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
My father will bring someone to save us in a while.

803
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
I'm not afraid.

804
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Besides, your father is here to save you.

805
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,040
There's no one like me who's a coward.

806
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
What is a coward?

807
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
It's...

808
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
It's...

809
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
No one wants you.

810
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Of course, someone will come to save you.

811
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
I'll come to save you if I want you.

812
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Really?

813
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
If no one wants you,

814
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
I'll come to save you.

815
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Hug me.

816
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
If I do it again,

817
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
will An Qi...

818
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Do it again?

819
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Young Master, what are you talking about?

820
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
It seems that there will be a heavy rain tonight.

821
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Jin Mu.

822
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Young Master.

823
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
I have something to ask you.

824
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
I'll listen to you.

825
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
I'll bring Sang Qi here tonight.

826
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
But remember,

827
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
don't tell Yan Yan and Lian Pian about it.

828
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,040
And don't let the Yan family know about it.

829
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
I'll do it right now.

830
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
But Young Master,

831
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
you said it might rain tonight.

832
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
If it's like this,

833
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
won't you and Miss Sang be in danger?

834
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
If it doesn't rain tonight,

835
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
I won't come here.

836
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
I'll go.

837
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Not bad.

838
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,040
You can get it within a few hours.

839
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Thanks to Deputy Chief for calling me.

840
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
If I knew it earlier, I would have asked him to call me.

841
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
I mean...

842
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
I mean,

843
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
it's not that Master is not as good as Deputy Chief.

844
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,040
That's not right.

845
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Anyway, I don't regret calling you Master.

846
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Forget it.

847
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
I understand what you mean.

848
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Do you think I don't want him to teach you?

849
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,040
I don't want to waste my time.

850
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
When he first came to the door,

851
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,040
I asked him to teach you directly.

852
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
So that you won't have to go up the mountain.

853
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,040
What did Deputy Chief say?

854
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
He said that

855
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
you can't go up the mountain without me.

856
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
I don't want you to go up the mountain.

857
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,040
He said that

858
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
if you can't find the person you're looking for,

859
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
you'll keep thinking about him.

860
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040
He really understands me.

861
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
That's what I think.

862
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Also,

863
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
he said that

864
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
you have to decide

865
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,040
whether you want to learn or not.

866
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
So,

867
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
you have to go up the mountain.

868
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Enough.

869
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Let's not talk nonsense.

870
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
Let's just practice.

871
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
When you learn something,

872
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,040
you don't have to be afraid of the man in black who attacked you that day.

873
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Even if you can't win,

874
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
you can win.

875
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
At least, you can escape without any worries.

876
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
My silly nephew

877
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,040
doesn't have to be afraid of you every day

878
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
and protect you in secret.

879
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Wait.

880
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
When did you say that

881
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
Deputy Chief protected me in secret?

882
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
I...

883
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Maybe I...

884
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
I heard it.

885
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Who said that?

886
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
It's...

887
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Baishi.

888
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Baishi?

889
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Probably Baishi.

890
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
I'll go find Baishi.

891
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
Baishi.

892
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Miss Sang, what's wrong?

893
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Look at you.

894
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
Your son has done so many things for me.

895
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
You don't even know me.

896
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Does it mean

897
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
that your son helped you detoxify

898
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,040
and went out to chase the imperial physician overnight?

899
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
You know all of that?

900
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
And this?

901
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Then,

902
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
is it about the fireworks

903
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
that my son and I

904
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
went to the Imperial Household Department

905
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,040
during the New Year?

906
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,040
You also know

907
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,040
about the fireworks

908
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
outside the Imperial Household Department.

909
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
The fireworks

910
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
were put by Deputy Chief?

911
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Well...

912
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
It should be

913
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Deputy Chief was dissatisfied

914
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
with the doctors

915
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
making it difficult for you

916
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,040
to take the exam

917
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,040
when he was in the Imperial College.

918
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
He wanted to put water on purpose.

919
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Is that it?

920
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Deputy Chief did that too?

921
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Where is Deputy Chief?

922
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
I'm asking you, where is Deputy Chief?

923
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
What are you doing?

924
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
Deputy Chief...

925
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
It's me.

926
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
Miss Sang.

927
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Miss Sang.

928
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
My son found a large forest

929
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
in the back hill.

930
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,040
He wants to ask you to go there.

931
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
I'll go and have a look.

932
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
But I'm in a hurry to find Deputy Chief.

933
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,040
But my son

934
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,040
also found it

935
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
for you for several days.

936
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
If you don't go...

937
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Alright.

938
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
I'll go back and tell Lianfeng.

939
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Miss Sang.

940
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,040
It's going to rain soon.

941
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm afraid it will be delayed

942
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
if you come back.

943
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
It's on the way.

944
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
In my opinion,

945
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
we'd better go back quickly.

946
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Alright. Let's go.

947
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Young Master, Miss Sang is here.

948
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Qi.

949
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Shen Wenyuan.

950
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
Where is the wild mushroom you mentioned?

951
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Why didn't I see it?

952
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
I think the weather is not good.

953
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,040
It's going to rain.

954
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Let's go back early.

955
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
Qi.

956
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
You promised to accompany me.

957
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
I did say I would accompany you.

958
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
But I'm going back to the mountain villa to accompany you.

959
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Besides,

960
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,040
the weather is not good today.

961
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
I'll accompany you when the weather is good

962
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
another day, okay?

963
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Look.

964
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
It's raining.

965
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Look.

966
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
It's raining, right?

967
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Let's go back quickly.

968
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Qi.

969
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Do you remember our childhood?

970
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
I remember.

971
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
That time,

972
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
we hid in the cave because it was raining.

973
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
We wanted to have a bad time

974
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
for the second time.

975
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Let's go back quickly.

976
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
Qi.

977
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
That accident

978
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
may be a memory for you.

979
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
But for me...

980
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Qi.

981
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Qi.

982
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Siye.

983
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Why are you here?

984
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
If the past is just a memory,

985
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,040
it will become my memory.

986
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
My memory.

987
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,040
I can never

988
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
forget the perfect story.

989
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,040
It's the way I was in the wind.

990
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
The city in the distance

991
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
has changed its beginning.

992
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,040
The person who lost the love for the first time

993
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,040
wrote the love poem for me.

994
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:17,040
I have also seen this city in the distance.

995
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,040
In the future, we will be together in a moment.

996
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,040
We will be together in a moment.

997
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
In the future, we will be together in a moment.

998
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,040
We will be together in a moment.
