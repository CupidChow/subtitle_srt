1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The sound of the flute is like water, like a shadow, like a wolf

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sound of the flute is like water, like a shadow, like a wolf

3
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Young Master!

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Young Master, I've brought you the list of people you want.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Zhun Wen Yuan, the first-class minister of the Ministry of Personnel.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This guy, he's been playing with Li Zhi He all day.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He's still so good at this. It's really not easy.

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Miss Sang seems to be...

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I knew she wouldn't be killed.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Long Ballad

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Today, everyone can have fun and sing.

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've prepared some non-alcoholic wine for everyone.

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've already told Dr. Feng in advance.

18
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So, he won't suddenly appear by your side and punish you.

19
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Long live the Emperor!

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sit, sit, sit.

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Brother Zhuo, you got the first place and you're now a minister.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You've improved a lot.

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How do you say that?

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Little dog is rich...

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Dog is rich and forgetful. No wonder you're in the top.

26
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's none of your business. I'll call Brother Zhuo first.

27
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't wander around anymore. Don't forget me.

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not a big deal. We're all brothers.

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll remind everyone in the future.

30
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So modest.

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Speaking of which,

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Deputy Chief Yan's teaching is particularly good this year.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I heard he's going to Sang's Mansion to propose a marriage.

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This year is the double harvest of love and business.

35
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Didn't you say you didn't propose?

36
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Since you didn't propose, the target hasn't been set.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Even if you propose, you can cancel the engagement.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Even if you get married, you can still divorce.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So, wine can be really stable.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't say it too slowly.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay, okay, Brother Zhuo.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Eat, eat.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Eat, eat.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yan Yan, have you seen Sang Ji?

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:21,060
This wine is good for the

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you making a promise to bring happiness to Lian Pian?

47
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Then you should think about everything clearly.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And stick to yourself.

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But drinking wine is not a problem.

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yan Yan, can you do it?

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You just drank a little and you're so drunk.

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Song Luo Tian, you're really heartless.

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You drink and think you're a double.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Can you still be a horse?

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's see.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You just got into Jingzhao Mansion.

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In the future, it may be pointed out who is to whom.

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It may be pointed out who is to whom.

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Miss, I'm fine.

60
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Today is Zhang Bao's big day.

61
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I won't be sad.

62
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm happy too.

63
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You're a man.

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you're not happy, then you're not happy.

65
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I have my own way to make you happy.

66
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Today is the birthday banquet of Guo Zijian.

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
When we're full, I'll take you to eat and drink.

68
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay?

69
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're the one who has a good thing.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why do you use the pearl on me?

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Because you're my sister.

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The third lady of the Sang family.

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Of course, it's on you.

74
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's go.

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Miss, no wonder Young Master has been thinking about you.

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let you come to Guo Zijian to study.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I walked in and felt that it was different here.

78
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How is it?

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you want to come to Guo Zijian to study too?

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Miss, don't laugh at me.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What's my identity?

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can only read a script.

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How can I come here?

84
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't you know enough words?

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Anyway, I'm getting more and more careful.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The female disciples of Guo Zijian will read more and more.

87
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Including you.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's go.

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Why didn't I see Sang Qi's name on this mission?

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The officials are already good enough to let her study here.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you want to continue to let her be an official?

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

93
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It seems that even if she is famous in the reading field,

94
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
the female can only go home and be a good wife and a good son.

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A few words will be enough to write a account book.

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I heard that the Deputy Chief has been to the Grand Commandant's Mansion to propose a marriage.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yan Xiaolang and his maidservant are together.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have guessed it long ago.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
From the beginning, the Sang family is the most important person.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's right.

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The two families are not compatible.

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So that's it.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Lian Pian, let's go.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Qi, you're here.

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The main party is here too.

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The maidservant is so famous that she can't face the Deputy Chief.

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't be discouraged.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You have already proved yourself.

110
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why are you here now?

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What's wrong with this?

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why are you all so sad when I come?

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You all are determined by your own abilities.

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This should be happy, right?

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are also on the list.

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You are also on the list.

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You are also on the list.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You are also on the list.

119
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You are also on the list.

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are also on the list.

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You didn't get the appointment.

122
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But your performance is in the eyes of the people in the whole border.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is not fair.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Those who are not as good as you can have official positions.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You should give an explanation.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Sang Qi, at least you can get on the list.

128
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I still have to read for another year.

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Guo Cheng Jun, didn't you say that Guo Jiu didn't get on the list?

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No.

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can't be a person who can't be a person who can't be a person.

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm leaving.

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Excuse me.

134
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Slow down.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
One year.

136
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Enough.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You don't have to comfort me.

138
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have made my decision.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I, Sang Qi, will not give up.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But you are right.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Since my results are on the list,

142
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I should get the same opportunity as you.

143
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Right?

144
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You are quite tough.

145
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't have the precedent of a woman getting married.

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can be the first female student in the Imperial College.

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can also be the first female official in this court.

148
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sang Qi.

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I will continue to support you.

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And help you get your appointment.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Qin.

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We have known each other for many years.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I will also support you.

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And after I get into the Ministry of Personnel,

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will have better methods and channels.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Zhou Yun Yuan.

159
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to remind you again.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You haven't got into the Ministry of Personnel yet.

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
As a newbie in the official field who just arrived,

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
you should think about how to do your job well.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The position of the Minister of Personnel is not big.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The position of the Minister of Personnel is not big.

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The power is not big.

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I might have more opportunities and prospects in the future.

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's okay.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Zhou Yun Yuan.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I want to thank you for your goodwill.

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But I am enough to help Sang Qi.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's go.

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Lin Xiao Lang.

173
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Am I drunk?

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It hurts.

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You must feel bad about what my mother said that day.

176
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I talked to my mother when I got home.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Although she still didn't agree to my marriage...

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Lin Xiao Lang.

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's forget it.

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You are still angry.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I will calm my mother's emotions soon.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Wait for me, okay?

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If Mrs. Yan refuses to let go,

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
will you let go first?

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I won't let go even if I die.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I only want to wait for you.

187
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Qi.

188
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you thinking about?

189
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's Yan Yan and Lin Pian who are still alive.

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I thought

191
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
as long as I could study hard in the Imperial College,

192
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I could change the views of the world on women.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But I didn't expect

194
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
that I would still be controlled by others.

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I am famous on the Internet,

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but I didn't get the recognition.

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Even if Pian is so good,

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
she is still being pushed by Mrs. Yan.

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Qi.

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you get the recognition,

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
what do you want to do most?

202
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I want to go back to the Imperial College.

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I have been thinking for a long time.

204
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
From the time I came to the Imperial College,

205
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I knew you and everyone.

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We are all in the same situation now.

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I seem to understand

208
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
why my brother asked me to study in the Imperial College

209
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and take the real intention of being a citizen.

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Maybe he had expected this result.

211
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So he hoped that

212
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I could fight for the opportunity for the women in the world.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If I can go back to the Imperial College

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
and continue to teach people,

215
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
no,

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
get a very small position in the Imperial College,

217
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
a very small position.

218
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That is also meaningful.

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I didn't disappoint my brother's expectations.

220
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Qi,

221
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I, Yan Yun Zhi,

222
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
even if I have to be the personal assistant of Guo Zijian,

223
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I must help you get a citizen.

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I said I would be your colleague.

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are so strict.

226
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Why don't you object to it?

227
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If you can stay in Guo Zijian,

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
then you are the best role model for women to study in the Imperial College.

229
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You are much more than me.

230
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Let's go.

231
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm going back.

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go back and rest.

233
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Go back.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Go back.

235
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
White Snake,

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

237
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're not going to propose?

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I have to ask the officials

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
for the appointment of Sang Qi first.

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If I propose first,

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
everyone will know that Sang Qi is my fiancee.

242
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At that time, everyone will say that Sang Qi

243
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
can only stay in Guo Zijian because he left the back door.

244
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He can't bear such pressure.

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You are thoughtful.

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

248
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

249
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

250
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

253
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

254
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

255
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

256
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

257
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

258
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

259
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

261
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

264
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

265
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

266
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

267
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

268
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm going to the palace tomorrow.

269
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yan Yanzhi.

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

271
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You specifically entered the palace today

272
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
not to show me what the wooden tile

273
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
looks like?

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,840
I'm thinking about something else.

275
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,240
This matter

276
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,440
concerns the life and death of the officials in the private world.

277
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,240
I want to share some pressure for the officials.

278
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,120
I hope

279
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,000
the officials can leave this matter to me to complete.

280
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,520
Seeing you so uncertain,

281
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,320
why don't I believe you?

282
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,560
What's the matter? Just say it.

283
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,680
I beg the officials

284
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,120
to give Sang Qi an official position.

285
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,000
Just this matter

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,080
can affect my image?

287
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,080
First,

288
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
Sang Qi is indeed famous.

289
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,920
He can get an official position

290
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,480
and serve the court in any way.

291
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,000
Second,

292
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,000
Sang Qi has the first-class experience of a woman

293
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,320
studying in the Imperial College.

294
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,920
Everyone in the country knows it.

295
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,760
If she can become an official in a good way,

296
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,560
the official family will be educated

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,640
and it will be a good story.

298
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
You said that

299
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,880
you like to talk.

300
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,160
But you know what?

301
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,680
Women are controversial in the official field.

302
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Tell me more.

303
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
What's the matter with taking the responsibility for me?

304
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,400
You're right to point out one thing.

305
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,680
It's not a big deal.

306
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,400
It's a good thing for Sang Qi.

307
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,800
If someone opposes it,

308
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
I'll point out

309
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,000
his seniority and all the contradictions

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,080
of his superior.

311
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,080
It has nothing to do with the officials.

312
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,600
In this way,

313
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,520
the officials

314
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,320
have maintained the fair and just official position

315
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,640
and have calmed down the public opinion.

316
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,040
Isn't it wonderful?

317
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,160
The Imperial College is a good place

318
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,960
to be.

319
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,840
Ye Yanzhi,

320
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
what if I'm the one

321
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,360
who opposes it?

322
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,480
Didn't the official family

323
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,800
write down Sang Qi's appointment?

324
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,360
Are you pouring me a soup of confusion?

325
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,160
I dare not.

326
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,960
You dare not?

327
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,480
You're so bold.

328
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,480
I dare not.

329
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,800
Young Master.

330
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,600
Baishi.

331
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,440
Help me change my clothes and go to Sang's Mansion.

332
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,480
It seems that you have good news

333
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,040
for me.

334
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,360
Be careful.

335
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,600
When did An Qi come?

336
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,560
Young Master, I asked the servants.

337
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,960
When Miss Su went out,

338
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,000
she often visited you.

339
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,560
She sat for a long time

340
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,080
and even smiled.

341
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,680
Do you want to say hello to her?

342
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,040
Yes.

343
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Qilang.

344
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,720
Qilang.

345
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,000
I want to ask you.

346
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,800
Why didn't you tell the family

347
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,280
about the important thing

348
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,400
about marriage?

349
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,960
I've made it clear

350
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,320
how to arrange my marriage.

351
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,480
It's just that it doesn't suit you.

352
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
You're too ungrateful.

353
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,560
Don't be so ridiculous.

354
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,480
Listen to me.

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,080
We won't agree

356
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,360
for you to marry Sang Qi.

357
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,120
If you agree,

358
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,680
I'll get married.

359
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,600
You...

360
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,080
Young Master.

361
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,040
You're being too direct.

362
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,560
Good news is on your face.

363
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,440
Miss Sang can tell it at a glance.

364
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,840
Yes.

365
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,640
You're right.

366
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,960
Then I'll pretend that

367
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,640
I didn't make it up

368
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,600
and give her a surprise.

369
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,480
That's good.

370
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,600
Miss.

371
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,080
Try the cakes I made.

372
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,600
Okay.

373
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,600
Qi.

374
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,320
What's wrong with you?

375
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,840
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

376
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,360
I'm sorry.

377
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,600
I failed to get you

378
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,480
the moment you entered the branch.

379
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,560
You scared me.

380
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,200
I thought you were talking about something.

381
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,080
This matter has been resolved.

382
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,920
So you've already known about it.

383
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,520
Yes.

384
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,160
Thanks to Zhuo Wen Yuan

385
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,880
for sending the order to the Ministry of Personnel.

386
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,120
Now I'm the top of the national line.

387
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,880
I'm your colleague.

388
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,040
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

389
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes.

390
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,720
He and you...

391
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,320
Deputy Chief.

392
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,120
Let's not talk about this.

393
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,080
Let's not talk about it.

394
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,400
After all, Sang Qi's happiness

395
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
is the most important thing.

396
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,440
I heard from Deputy Chief that

397
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,800
you refused to meddle in this matter

398
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,880
when you just joined the Ministry of Personnel.

399
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,680
It's a bit different.

400
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,560
But why are you so fast today?

401
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,480
I've never been hard on Qi.

402
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,160
I've never done anything wrong.

403
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,120
A thousand golds

404
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,160
can't make Sang Qi smile.

405
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,720
We've been brothers for many years.

406
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,520
Don't say that.

407
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,840
It's disgusting to say that.

408
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,120
Deputy Chief, sit.

409
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,120
It's okay.

410
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,680
It's good.

411
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm here to tell you this.

412
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Since everything is done,

413
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,160
I'll go first.

414
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,360
You just came and you're leaving?

415
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:40,880
I have something else to do.

416
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,520
What a surprise!

417
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,680
Lan Ji.

418
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,600
I heard that you often visit your mother recently.

419
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,280
You didn't tell me.

420
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,120
Are you worried?

421
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,240
I'm just bored

422
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,400
and didn't go anywhere.

423
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,360
That's good.

424
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,200
I have something to tell you.

425
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,600
I haven't talked to Yun Zhi for a long time.

426
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Let's find a place

427
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,320
to sit down and talk.

428
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,920
Young Master, Miss.

429
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
Young Master, Miss.

430
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,720
Lan Ji.

431
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,120
You often visit your mother.

432
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,560
Are you really just talking to her?

433
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,760
I'm just worried about Yun Zhi.

434
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,440
I told Aunt Yan

435
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
that you mentioned Sang Qi.

436
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,280
She must have stopped you.

437
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,440
I'm serious about this.

438
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,800
No matter who interferes or stops me,

439
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,640
it's useless.

440
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,640
You're thinking too much.

441
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,320
I'm just asking.

442
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,480
When I knew that you were going to propose,

443
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,640
I gave up.

444
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,800
But as a friend,

445
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,360
I'm a little worried about your approach.

446
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,840
You just proposed in a hurry.

447
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,960
You must be ungrateful.

448
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,640
His family is not as familiar with you as my family.

449
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,640
Grand Commandant Sang won't accept it.

450
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,280
The third uncle Liuli is always particular about getting married.

451
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,600
You not only have to take the birthday card,

452
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,360
but also have to write the proposal.

453
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,400
Otherwise, it will seem too rough.

454
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,000
Thank you for your reminder.

455
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,640
glad you had it.

456
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,640
Please eat.

457
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,840
By the way,

458
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,600
My Lady.

459
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,840
Well,

460
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,880
Young Master,

461
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,720
should I go get it or...

462
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,520
Go ahead.

463
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,400
Go back quickly.

464
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,600
Okay.

465
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,720
Yun Zhi,

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
don't be too anxious.

467
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,400
After all,

468
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,960
this is your life.

469
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,360
We've been friends for years.

470
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,000
If there's a place I can help,

471
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,680
I hope you can let go of your worries

472
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,120
and just tell me.

473
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,240
Okay, I will.

474
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,680
I heard that

475
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
Grand Commandant Sang has rejected you once.

476
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,120
Are you sure about it next time?

477
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,000
If not, then I'll keep mentioning it.

478
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,240
As long as he agrees.

479
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,760
Baishi.

480
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,920
Is Deputy Chief here?

481
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,360
Deputy Chief is here.

482
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,080
Wen Yuan?

483
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,680
But...

484
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,000
Lan Ji is here.

485
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,520
She's here.

486
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,760
Qi?

487
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,040
Why is Lan Ji here?

488
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,720
I have nothing to do.

489
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,120
I came here to chat with you.

490
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,160
When I chat with you,

491
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,960
you can bring me with you.

492
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,440
Qi,

493
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,440
have you been here for a long time?

494
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,000
No.

495
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,840
I'm going back.

496
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,400
Let me send you back.

497
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,000
No need.

498
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,320
Lan Ji,

499
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,240
are you going back?

500
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,480
Why don't you burn me up?

501
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,440
I can talk to you in the car.

502
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,280
It's okay.

503
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,960
Get in the car.

504
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,680
Thank you.

505
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,500
Great, boy,

506
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,200
where is Qi common again?

507
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,080
Didn't classes start at 4 yesterday afternoon?

508
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,840
Exactly.

509
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,440
The class is built in the morning.

510
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,960
Our general arrives at 5 a.m.

511
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,800
and comes back to school at 6 p.m.

512
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,760
to meet properties.

513
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,400
Okay.

514
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,560
Who is Zhou Bo pictures for then?

515
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,360
He is the No. 1 divorced man in our school.

516
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,280
Do I see him as you?

517
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,480
On his back.

518
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,640
Why take him to the bank?

519
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,120
Why take him to the bank?

520
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Come on.

521
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,040
Speaking of which,

522
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,520
I should apologize to Lan Ji.

523
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,920
I understand her feelings for you.

524
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,160
But Lan Ji should know

525
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,680
that feelings are not something

526
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,680
that can be forced.

527
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,040
But I knew

528
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,280
that it was you.

529
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,360
Love is not a matter of time,

530
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,840
isn't it?

531
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Come on.

532
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,920
Come on.

533
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Come on.

534
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
Come on.

535
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,960
Qi.

536
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,440
Qi.

537
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,640
I know.

538
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,360
You saw me with Su Jieyu.

539
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,200
Don't get me wrong.

540
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,160
She's looking for my mother.

541
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,640
We didn't have any relationship.

542
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,520
You look like

543
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
you wrote the right question

544
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,120
but you slipped it off.

545
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Yes.

546
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
I've checked myself repeatedly.

547
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
I was wrong.

548
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,440
This is the right answer.

549
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,600
Ye Yanzhi.

550
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,280
Yes.

551
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,760
You can't go out with any woman anymore.

552
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,600
Of course. I promise.

553
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,760
Qi.

554
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,120
Today,

555
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,760
I hope you can go back to your home and have a rest.

556
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Because tomorrow,

557
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,920
I'll have to trouble you to get up early.

558
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Get up early?

559
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,520
Grand Commandant Zeng.

560
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,080
Last time, I was reckless.

561
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,640
I was not considerate of etiquette.

562
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,920
This time,

563
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,560
I wrote a proposal.

564
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,360
The gift is more than last time.

565
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,120
Please think about it carefully.

566
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,320
I'll take care of your happiness.

567
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,320
Dad.

568
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,040
I think it's enough.

569
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm thinking.

570
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,800
How can such an important thing

571
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,080
be decided so easily?

572
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,280
If you think it's missing something,

573
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,280
just say it.

574
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,920
I'll do it now.

575
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,920
Dad.

576
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,840
If you don't take it,

577
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,440
I'll take it.

578
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,520
Wait.

579
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,440
I'm not late, am I?

580
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,920
Come on.

581
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,560
silk fox

582
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,280
Seems Lord Si also chose a good day.

583
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:13,920
Uncle.

584
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,440
I'm engaged to you today.

585
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,880
Hope you can consider my marriage with Sang Qi tonight.

586
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
ZhuoIN! Are you crazy?

587
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,320
You're so young.

588
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I'm wondering

589
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,040
why you didn't come here

590
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,320
for such an important thing.

591
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,320
Good for you.

592
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,880
I'm counting on you.

593
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,560
Father.

594
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,080
Wait.

595
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,640
Uncle.

596
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,840
You should have known

597
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
that I'm in love with Qi.

598
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,080
You wouldn't be so careless, right?

599
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,800
Uncle, I'm just being careful.

600
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,640
You can tell that I'm close to Sang Qi.

601
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,680
I know and care about Sang Qi

602
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,400
much more than you do.

603
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,480
Are you asking about Qi?

604
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,280
Zhong Wen Yuan.

605
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,080
I've always treated you

606
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,560
as my closest friend.

607
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,880
Our relationship

608
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,160
has always been clear.

609
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,080
You've seen

610
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
how I've been with Si Ye.

611
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,440
Why are you doing this today?

612
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,720
Go back now.

613
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,400
Go.

614
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,160
Qi.

615
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,720
I know you and Si Ye are on the same boat.

616
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,160
But I have a chance

617
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,920
to fight for my happiness, right?

618
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,000
Besides,

619
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,080
I think Uncle is more inclined to me.

620
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,560
Master Guoyin should listen to his parents.

621
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,000
My marriage

622
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,360
is up to me.

623
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,440
Qi.

624
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,680
In that case,

625
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,200
let's follow the old rules of the Sang family.

626
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,360
Okay.

627
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,280
Marriage is not a child's play.

628
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,720
Don't blame your daughter

629
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,160
for bullying you.

630
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,840
Qi.

631
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,480
Your father and I

632
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,880
are still young.

633
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Stop fooling around.

634
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,440
Qi,

635
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,560
stop fooling around.

636
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,360
Such that all of you would be at ease

637
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,560
What do you wantme to do

638
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,120
Set someone up

639
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,920
You people

640
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
But if you either do

641
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,960
Don't let your daughter

642
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,440
Don't touch passively

643
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,960
If you, or me

644
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,440
I don't want nothing

645
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,160
You P north

646
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,880
Is it

647
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,520
Who wins?

648
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,720
Who marries Ah Qi?

649
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,520
Dad, I've said it.

650
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,920
I'll decide my own marriage.

651
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
What's your plan?

652
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,320
As long as I decide,

653
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,120
I'll decide the rules.

654
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,520
You...

655
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,720
It's up to me.

656
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
What do you think?

657
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,320
Do you dare to get married?

658
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,320
Why not?

659
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,120
Welcome to the competition for marriage

660
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,720
of our Sang Group.

661
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,320
I hope all young men

662
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,920
can participate.

663
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,520
Welcome to the competition for marriage

664
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,120
of our Sang Group.

665
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,720
I hope all young men

666
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,320
can participate.

667
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,120
Don't worry.

668
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,120
Today, our Sang Family

669
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,520
will build a stage here.

670
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,320
There are two important things

671
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,720
to tell the people of Bianjing.

672
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,120
First, our Sang Family

673
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,320
has a new lady.

674
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,920
She's my new adopted daughter, Lian Pian.

675
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,520
The second important thing

676
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
is that our Sang Family

677
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,320
will hold a competition for marriage.

678
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
The competition for marriage is here.

679
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
You can be participants

680
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,120
or witnesses.

681
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,320
Our Sang Family

682
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
will not look down on our family

683
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,920
or care about our background.

684
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,320
As long as you are old enough

685
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,120
and are a kind and good man,

686
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,520
you can stand on this stage

687
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,920
and stand firmly

688
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,120
to propose marriage.

689
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,120
The second young lady, Sang Qi,

690
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,520
is the first to pass the test.

691
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,720
Bravo!

692
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,520
Young Master,

693
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,320
didn't Sang Tai Wei say

694
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
you and Zhuo Wen Yuan will compete alone?

695
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Now we are

696
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,720
young men

697
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,920
who can stand on the stage.

698
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,120
Sang Tai Wei is the best choice.

699
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,520
If only Zhuo Wen Yuan and I

700
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,720
can stand on the stage,

701
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,720
although it's fair,

702
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
so many people are watching.

703
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,120
It's inevitable that they will talk about our Sang Family

704
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,520
and cause our family to be in discord

705
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,720
and offend others.

706
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,520
It's true.

707
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,920
Besides, I know

708
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,920
the Sang Family has been

709
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
in the West for years.

710
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
We are always in the same boat.

711
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,920
If I can't even deal with the others,

712
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,720
how can I be in Sang Tai Wei's eyes?

713
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't get too close.

714
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,720
I don't want to.

715
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
Then remember,

716
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,120
when you stand on the stage,

717
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,520
don't get hurt.

718
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,320
I don't want to see

719
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,520
Li Ying's face.

720
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,320
Don't worry.

721
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,520
You call me senior.

722
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,520
Zhuo Wen Yuan is under my control.

723
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,720
Just wait to be my wife.

724
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,120
Uncle,

725
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,720
I will win this competition.

726
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,120
I will never let Yan Yun Zhi

727
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,120
take Sang Qi away.

728
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Although it's my organization's competition,

729
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,920
my original intention

730
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,320
is not to oppose my daughter.

731
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,520
I want to give you and Yan Yun Zhi

732
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,320
a chance

733
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,120
to prove Qi's determination.

734
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
You can have your own

735
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,120
happiness.

736
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,520
If you can,

737
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,720
do your best.

738
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,920
If you can't,

739
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:19,920
just admit it.

740
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,720
Yes.

741
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,520
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

742
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,320
the competition hasn't started yet.

743
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,120
It's too late to leave now.

744
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:30,920
Qi,

745
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
if you want me to quit,

746
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,920
don't say anything.

747
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,120
I'm not the kind of person

748
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,920
who will quit before it starts.

749
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:38,920
Qi,

750
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,320
you can choose not to leave me,

751
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,520
or Yan Yun Zhi.

752
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,320
But you can't stop me from pursuing you

753
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,720
and proposing to you.

754
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,720
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

755
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,320
you've been my good friend for years.

756
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
I really don't want to

757
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,520
see you two

758
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,720
have a fight on this stage.

759
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,520
I don't want to just talk about it.

760
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,920
I want to make a move.

761
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm going to win this stage.

762
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,520
Make way.

763
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,720
Back off.

764
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:13,920
You can't do it.

765
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,520
Sang Qi,

766
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
you've gone too far.

767
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
You dare to let Yan Yun Zhi

768
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,920
fight with someone else for you.

769
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,920
If he gets hurt,

770
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
I'll never forgive you.

771
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,520
Miss Song,

772
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,720
you're wearing such a pretty dress today.

773
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,920
You must be here to steal my fans.

774
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,520
But

775
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,520
the smell on your body

776
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,120
is really too strong.

777
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
Did you use all the spices

778
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,920
in the whole spice shop?

779
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,520
That's because you don't have a taste.

780
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,120
This is the perfume

781
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,520
my father asked me to get.

782
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,920
I'm so lucky.

783
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,320
Maybe I'm too ignorant.

784
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,120
I've never smelled

785
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,520
such a strong perfume.

786
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
It's weird.

787
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,720
Why is Yan Xiao Lang

788
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
not here today?

789
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,320
Can you stop it?

790
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,120
It's so hot.

791
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,120
It seems that no one dares to come up.

792
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
If no one comes up,

793
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,120
I'll let them

794
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,120
have a final.

795
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,520
Whoever wins

796
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,920
can marry

797
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,520
my Sang Qi.

798
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,720
My Sang Qi...

799
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
I can do it for a few days.

800
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,720
Yes.

801
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,720
We are looking at each other

802
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,120
I am the one who has this vision

803
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,120
If the past is the past

804
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,120
It becomes my value

805
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,120
My value

806
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,120
I can never be unknown

807
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,120
A perfect story

808
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,120
The way I look when I eat

809
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
My heart is in a small city

810
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Changed the beginning

811
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,120
The person who lost the love for true love

812
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,120
I wrote the love poem

813
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,120
I also wrote this love poem

814
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,120
In the future, I will never sigh

815
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,120
I will never sigh

816
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
In the future, I will never sigh

817
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:07,120
I will never sigh

818
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,120
