1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,680
Someone smiles and burns

2
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,960
The blue god is playing a joke

3
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,400
The red god is waiting for you to accompany

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,920
The red god is waiting for you to accompany

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,200
I turn around and don't regret it

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,600
I want to meet you for a hundred years

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,200
I want to meet you for a hundred years

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,400
I want to meet you for a hundred years

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
I quietly and silently wait

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,000
It turns out that this is how it should be

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,600
How to say that one year is worth it

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
He is in the end of the world

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,400
He left a story

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,400
Who is the hero in this life

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
Who is the hero

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,200
The rain is clear and the water is clear

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,800
The rain is red and the city is bright

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,200
The white hair is in the spring

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,400
I want to meet you for a hundred years

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Red God

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Xiao Qi

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Xiao Qi

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Siye

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why are you here?

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I saw you and Jingmu out

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I was a little worried and came with him

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,400
Did you follow me again?

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,600
What is right?

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
Anyway, I know

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it now

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I'll tell you when I go out

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,600
Zhou Wen Yuan

34
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
Zhou Wen Yuan

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Zhou Wen Yuan

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't shout

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,200
If you can hear it outside, I will respond to you

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
They should go to someone to help

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,600
Siye, your hand is hurt

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Let me see

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Nothing

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
No, no, the wound must be treated in time

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
Let me tell you

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Don't pull your clothes to make me dirty

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,000
I

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You you you

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,600
I

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,200
Don't worry, I won't pull my clothes

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Do you know how expensive my clothes are?

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I don't know, I don't want to know

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
My clothes are very useful

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
So troublesome

53
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
I said

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
In this situation

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Be sure to keep warm

56
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
No

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Look

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
It's better to use clothes as a shadow

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
It's cool, I'm smart

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
You are stupid

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,200
I've been reading for a few days, why am I getting more and more stupid?

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
You burned your clothes

63
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
How long do you think your clothes can burn?

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
How long can this fire burn?

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Don't you wear clothes on your body to keep warm?

66
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
I'm not a fool

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'm not a fool

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
I'm not a fool

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Yes

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,200
You didn't say it, I still feel a little cold

71
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Don't look at me like that

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
You are stupid to burn your clothes

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
And you care about my clothes

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
So petty

75
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
The hero in the picture book is not like this

76
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
The beauty in the picture book is not like you

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
OMG

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
As expected

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
All right, come here.

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Come here.

81
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,960
I didn't say I'd lend you my clothes.

82
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,000
Sit down.

83
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,440
I'll put it on with you.

84
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,120
I hope Zhuo Wen Yuan and the others can come and save me soon.

85
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,200
Don't worry.

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,640
The mountain villa is not far from here.

87
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
He'll come over as soon as he finds someone.

88
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,600
Take a break.

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,960
Your hand...

90
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,440
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,800
I'll take over the mountain villa.

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,440
Are you going to tell me the truth?

93
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,800
Lower, lower, 30 be like this.

94
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,440
Lower again.

95
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,240
You're back.

96
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,520
Where are you going?

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
Sang Qi is trapped in the cave.

98
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,080
What?

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,880
What happened?

100
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,040
I was going to

101
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,200
hide in the cave with Qi,

102
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
but the cave slipped out of the way.

103
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Yan Si, who passed by,

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,080
fell into the cave to protect Qi and him.

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
Now the cave is blocked by the chaos.

106
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Let's go save him.

107
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,000
You mean

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,880
Yun Zhi and Sang Qi are trapped?

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,520
Yes.

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,240
We don't have any tools.

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
Let's go save him.

112
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
Tools?

113
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,200
I remember there are a few

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,680
chef's knives in the cave.

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,160
Chef's knives?

116
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,760
Chef's knives.

117
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,520
Yes.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
The chef's knife is the best for cutting stones.

119
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,720
Where is it?

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,120
Let me think.

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
It's in the backyard.

122
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:06,840
Yes.

123
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's go.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,760
It's in the backyard.

125
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,600
Master,

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,200
I remember the chef's knife

127
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
was in your room.

128
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,520
Of course I know.

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,440
You talk too much.

130
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
Why didn't you tell them?

131
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
It would have taken them time.

132
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
What do you know?

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,840
I know the cave in the back mountain

134
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,520
the most.

135
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,160
I can't kill anyone if I'm trapped for a few days.

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,360
It's just a little time for my stupid nephew.

137
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,600
Silly boy.

138
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,120
He's always like this.

139
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,680
He never tells me what he likes.

140
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,200
He just hides it.

141
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,320
If I don't take this opportunity

142
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,000
to get rid of him,

143
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
he will be the one to blame.

144
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,560
What's good about it?

145
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,880
I can...

146
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,560
You're so stupid and talkative.

147
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,520
Don't be so nosy.

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Come here.

149
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,760
Here.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,160
The horse's foot.

151
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,080
Squat.

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes.

153
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,080
Raise your head.

154
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,160
Chest out.

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,960
Don't move.

156
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,280
Lower.

157
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,400
Good.

158
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,400
Good.

159
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,800
Lower.

160
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,600
One hour.

161
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't move.

162
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,360
You need me for the coffee.

163
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,160
Instead...

164
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Don't go out?

165
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,800
Tell me.

166
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
What are you going to say?

167
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,640
Tell Sixtait.

168
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,680
For me's sake,

169
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,960
to chase after the jade and set the fire

170
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
to protect me secretly?

171
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,360
You don't have to deny it.

172
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
Master and White Stone

173
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,920
made this up.

174
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
They can't talk.

175
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,840
When I first entered the Imperial College,

176
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,600
I thought you were the same as them

177
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
and always made things difficult for me.

178
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
But I didn't expect

179
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,920
you were just secretly

180
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
trying to get me a chance to be equal.

181
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,080
You cared about my life and death.

182
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,200
You remembered my likes and dislikes.

183
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,520
You respected my ideals

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,720
and my habits.

185
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,080
It's not hard to be nice to someone.

186
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,840
The hard part is

187
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,720
to treat him well in the way he likes you.

188
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,720
You respected him.

189
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm glad

190
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,160
I can think of him from his perspective.

191
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,000
You're really the one

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,640
who's obedient and sweet,

193
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,400
considerate, sensible and good-natured.

194
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,280
What are you talking about?

195
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,880
You're so beautiful.

196
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Call me Siye.

197
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
I've been taking care of you

198
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,400
because you're Yuxiu's sister.

199
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,360
You're welcome.

200
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,400
I...

201
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,800
I...

202
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
I'm praising you.

203
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm praising you.

204
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm praising you.

205
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,080
Look at you.

206
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,360
You're always holding Siye's hand.

207
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
You're so boring.

208
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,200
You're cold again?

209
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,280
You're so talkative when you're cold.

210
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,120
Take a break.

211
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,400
They should be here soon.

212
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,440
Sleep a little longer.

213
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,520
Yan Yun Zhi, Yan Yun Zhi.

214
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,680
You were holding hands just now.

215
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,720
But in that situation,

216
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
nothing can be done

217
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,440
to make you feel better.

218
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm so young.

219
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,880
I'm not as good as I was.

220
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
What are you doing?

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm playing with mosquitoes.

222
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,560
There are mosquitoes.

223
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,760
Come here.

224
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,840
I killed them.

225
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,960
I killed them.

226
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
I have mosquitoes on my face.

227
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,960
Yes.

228
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,920
I killed both of them.

229
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,120
You can go to sleep now.

230
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,400
They should be here soon.

231
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,440
I'll go to sleep now.

232
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,040
Okay.

233
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
I'll go to sleep now.

234
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I'll go to sleep now.

235
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll go to sleep now.

236
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
I'll go to sleep now.

237
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
I'll go to sleep now.

238
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
I'll go to sleep now.

239
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
I'll go to sleep now.

240
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
I'll go to sleep now.

241
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
I'll go to sleep now.

242
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
I'll go to sleep now.

243
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
I'll go to sleep now.

244
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
I'll go to sleep now.

245
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
I'll go to sleep now.

246
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
I'll go to sleep now.

247
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
I'll go to sleep now.

248
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I'll go to sleep now.

249
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
I'll go to sleep now.

250
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
I'll go to sleep now.

251
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
I'll go to sleep now.

252
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
I'll go to sleep now.

253
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
I'll go to sleep now.

254
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
I'll go to sleep now.

255
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
I'll go to sleep now.

256
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
I'll go to sleep now.

257
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
I'll go to sleep now.

258
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
I'll go to sleep now.

259
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I'll go to sleep now.

260
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
I'll go to sleep now.

261
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
I'll go to sleep now.

262
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
I'll go to sleep now.

263
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
I'll go to sleep now.

264
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120

I'll go to sleep now.

267
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
I'll go to sleep now.

268
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
I'll go to sleep now.

269
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
I'll go to sleep now.

270
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
I'll go to sleep now.

271
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
I'll go to sleep now.

272
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
I'll go to sleep now.

273
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
I'll go to sleep now.

274
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120

I'll go to sleep now.

280
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
I'll go to sleep now.

281
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
The night is so bright.

282
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
The night is so bright.

283
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,120
When you look back,

284
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,120
I don't dare to disturb you.

285
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
From now on,

286
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,120
I'll pray for you.

287
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
I'll go to sleep now.

288
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
I'll go to sleep now.

289
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
I'll go to sleep now.

290
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I'll go to sleep now.

291
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
I'll go to sleep now.

292
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,120
I'll go to sleep now.

293
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,120
The night is so bright.

294
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,120
The night is so bright.

295
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,120
The night is so bright.

296
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,120
The night is so bright.

297
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
It's here.

298
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
The night is so bright.

299
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Miss, hang in there.

300
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
We'll come and save you.

301
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Okay.

302
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
They came to find us just now.

303
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes, they should be here.

304
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Here.

305
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Are you okay?

306
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
I think I have a cramp.

307
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
It's okay.

308
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
Get up first.

309
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Don't worry about me.

310
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Here, let me help you.

311
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
No, no, no.

312
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
I can do it myself.

313
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I can do it myself.

314
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
I can do it myself.

315
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
Let me help you.

316
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Listen to me.

317
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
I just got better.

318
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
You broke it back again.

319
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Sorry.

320
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
No, no, no.

321
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
I can do it myself.

322
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
I can do it myself.

323
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
I can't see it.

324
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
Let me help you.

325
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,120
Your hand, sir.

326
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
You can't even pull your hand out.

327
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Qi is still inside.

328
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Then you don't need this hand.

329
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
You look smart.

330
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Why are you so stubborn?

331
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Don't tell me you're still looking for someone.

332
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Qi has been inside for a long time.

333
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Who said I was going back?

334
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
You can't pull your hand out.

335
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
You won't use your feet.

336
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Move away.

337
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
Your feet are dirty.

338
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
How can you use your feet so early?

339
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm not sure if they're at the entrance.

340
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
I need to know their positions before I can kick them.

341
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Don't stand there.

342
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Hurry up and save them.

343
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Master Sang.

344
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Qi.

345
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
That's great.

346
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
He's out.

347
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,720
Young Master.

348
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,560
Come in.

349
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,360
Deputy Chief.

350
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,880
Are you okay?

351
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,320
Deputy Chief.

352
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,600
I'm fine.

353
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,160
Water.

354
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,080
Are you okay?

355
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,920
Have some water.

356
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,000
Have some water, Deputy Chief.

357
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:31,840
You drink first.

358
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,720
You drink first.

359
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,560
You drink first.

360
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,360
You drink first.

361
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,200
I'm fine. You drink first.

362
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,880
You drink first.

363
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,720
You're hurt.

364
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,360
Deputy Chief.

365
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Let's go back.

366
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,480
Take Deputy Chief out.

367
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,600
Send Sang Qi out first.

368
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,000
Yan Yan.

369
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,240
You're hurt.

370
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,960
You go out first.

371
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't need to. I said...

372
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,760
Young Master.

373
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,520
Young Master Zhuo.

374
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,560
Young Master.

375
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,000
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

376
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,400
Young Master Zhuo.

377
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,960
Young Master.

378
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:50,920
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

379
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,120
Make it wider.

380
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,040
Good.

381
00:15:59,520 --> 00:15:59,880
Good.

382
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,320
Chen Jian.

383
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,920
Practice by yourself.

384
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,960
I'll go up there to see my nephew.

385
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,440
Okay.

386
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,920
Don't slack off.

387
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:07,960
Okay.

388
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,120
Okay, Young Master.

389
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,120
Xian Zhi.

390
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,640
Let me see.

391
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,720
This little wound won't kill anyone.

392
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,760
What?

393
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,120
I'm only hurt by this little wound.

394
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,280
Do you have any regrets?

395
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,480
How is that possible?

396
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,240
You're my nephew.

397
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,960
You know I'm your nephew?

398
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,360
I thought you didn't know.

399
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,720
If you knew,

400
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,240
Qi and I wouldn't be trapped

401
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,320
in that cave for a whole night.

402
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,320
You don't have to thank me.

403
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,080
This whole night was a good one, right?

404
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,800
What do you think?

405
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,880
What do you think?

406
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,480
I'm going to the palace.

407
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,320
Young Master.

408
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,520
Do you feel better?

409
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,440
I felt pretty good.

410
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,960
But I was so scared on the way.

411
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,240
I was trapped in the cave for a whole night.

412
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,360
I was so anxious.

413
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,240
I didn't even get sick.

414
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,040
But he just fell straight to the ground.

415
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,600
What are you doing here?

416
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,760
Young Master.

417
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
The enemy has his own strategy.

418
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,160
We have our own strategy.

419
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,640
We're just selling the silkworms.

420
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,840
We can be scared.

421
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,120
Wait.

422
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:24,960
Wait.

423
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
I'll get you a wheelchair.

424
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,480
Come here.

425
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,600
You're not allowed to go.

426
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,360
I don't want to do

427
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,280
such a thing.

428
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,920
But...

429
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,120
I'm always honest.

430
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,280
I'll go see Qi.

431
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,560
Qi.

432
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,760
Qi.

433
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,400
Why is it so serious?

434
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,640
What did the doctor say?

435
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,920
Well...

436
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Young Master was hit by a fire.

437
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,920
He got a cold and got a cold.

438
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,800
That's why he got sick.

439
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,200
If it's that serious,

440
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,320
he should go back to the mountain and rest.

441
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,960
The conditions are not up to the mountain.

442
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,400
I'll send you down.

443
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,640
Okay.

444
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,760
You'll go down the mountain with me?

445
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,040
I'll go down the mountain with you.

446
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,200
Then I'll come up.

447
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,080
The doctor said

448
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,320
I need to be treated.

449
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,640
I'll go up the mountain and down the mountain.

450
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,040
I'll go up and down the mountain.

451
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,640
It's not good for me.

452
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Right.

453
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,120
Miss Lianping.

454
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,200
I need you to take me to the fire.

455
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,040
I need to get some medicine for Young Master.

456
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,320
The fire...

457
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,440
We're heading east.

458
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,880
I just got here.

459
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,640
I'm not familiar with the north and east.

460
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,720
Miss Lianping, please take me there.

461
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,680
Wait.

462
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,600
You don't know the way.

463
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
How can you run?

464
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,920
You and Bai Shishi are the same master, right?

465
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,120
Thank you, Miss Lianping.

466
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,760
Yanyan.

467
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,320
Do you know where Sang Qi is?

468
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,000
I saw her take Lianping to Zuo Wen Yuan.

469
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,800
Zuo Wen Yuan?

470
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,320
Nothing.

471
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:33,920
You...

472
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,840
The world's best salesman,

473
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Jaby Aite.

474
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,800
I want you to continue watching

475
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,280
the female disciple of the King of the Nation.

476
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,640
Anxin.

477
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,040
You were locked up in the mountain last night.

478
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,160
You don't know how worried I was about you.

479
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I remember when we were kids,

480
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,800
we went out together and got locked up there.

481
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,160
In the end, I sent you back to the camp.

482
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,680
Since that time,

483
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,880
I've sworn

484
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,720
that I'll take care of you.

485
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,680
No matter what,

486
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
I, the Deputy Chief, will take care of you.

487
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,000
Zuo Wen Yuan.

488
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,320
You're sick now.

489
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,480
Don't worry about it.

490
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,880
Be at ease.

491
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
Wait for someone to take care of you.

492
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,280
Deputy Chief.

493
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Are you okay?

494
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,480
I remember you were hurt on the skin.

495
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,680
Why are you still hanging?

496
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm worse than you.

497
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,880
I've been in the cave for a night.

498
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I didn't have a good rest.

499
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,520
I had the extra power to care about my classmates.

500
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,880
Seeing you

501
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,120
love each other so much,

502
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,120
I feel very relieved.

503
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,600
Don't forget that you're still hurt.

504
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
These words are too low.

505
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,720
Deputy Chief.

506
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,920
You're not recovered yet.

507
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,640
Don't move around.

508
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:05,960
I'm fine.

509
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,520
It's not cold. Don't bother.

510
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,400
I have Ah Qi here.

511
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,720
He'll take care of me.

512
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,120
By the way, Ah Qi.

513
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
I suddenly feel so bitter.

514
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,440
I want to drink some sugar water.

515
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,040
Sugar water?

516
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,760
Okay, wait.

517
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,720
I'll make it for you now.

518
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,800
Deputy Chief.

519
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
Go back and sleep.

520
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
I'll make sugar water.

521
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,920
It's okay. Go ahead.

522
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,560
I'll take care of him.

523
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,920
Ah Qi has left.

524
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,800
Are you feeling better?

525
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,240
I'm only half a kilo

526
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
lighter than Deputy Chief.

527
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,000
I thought

528
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,040
Deputy Chief wouldn't pretend to be sick.

529
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,600
But he's just like that.

530
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,120
I just put my hand here.

531
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,240
I didn't say anything.

532
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,960
Deputy Chief is Deputy Chief.

533
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,600
In terms of exchanging ideas,

534
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,120
students are inferior to themselves.

535
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,600
Zhu Wen Yuan.

536
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,160
Sang Qi is in the mountains.

537
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,160
He's not as good as you.

538
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,120
He's not as good as you.

539
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,000
He's not as good as you.

540
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He's not as good as you.

541
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,440
Sang Qi has been very precious

542
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,240
in the mountains.

543
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,160
I hope he can learn something

544
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,200
and learn martial arts to protect himself.

545
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,360
If you can't go down the mountain

546
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,480
because of this illness,

547
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,640
I'll take care of you for a day.

548
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,120
Deputy Chief.

549
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,480
You've tried your best.

550
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,200
I'm afraid it's not good to spread it.

551
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,360
I've tried my best

552
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,560
to take care of my students.

553
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,480
What's wrong with that?

554
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,360
I said I've tried my best.

555
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,560
I said I've tried my best.

556
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
I didn't say that.

557
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,600
I said Sang Qi.

558
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,600
Even if you're Deputy Chief of the Imperial College,

559
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,720
even if you're Sang Yu's best friend,

560
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,800
even if you're his senior,

561
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,960
all these identities

562
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,440
won't let you

563
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,320
give up such a deep sense of self-esteem.

564
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
What you think in your heart

565
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,840
is what I think in my heart.

566
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,480
I'll definitely do

567
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,440
what I've decided.

568
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,840
I won't give up this round.

569
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,040
Master is here.

570
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,600
There are many fresh fruits in the mountains.

571
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
You must be happy.

572
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,240
Here, have some tea.

573
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,440
Thank you, Miss Sang.

574
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,080
Deputy Chief.

575
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,360
Chong Yuan.

576
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,000
Qi.

577
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,280
I suddenly feel that my arm hurts.

578
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,880
I can't hold it.

579
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Can you feed me?

580
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,240
Come on.

581
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,760
Qi.

582
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,480
It's okay. I'll feed her.

583
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,120
Deputy Chief.

584
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,880
You're not convenient. Let me do it.

585
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,160
Qi, it's okay. Men and women are different.

586
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,560
It's not convenient for Zhou Wen Yuan to feed you.

587
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,600
It's okay.

588
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,400
I can feed her.

589
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,920
It's okay.

590
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,800
Zhou Wen Yuan doesn't want you to feed her.

591
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,040
I can feed her.

592
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,000
Give it to me.

593
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,400
It's okay.

594
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,760
It's okay.

595
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,360
It's okay.

596
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,880
Let me do it.

597
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,240
She said she couldn't...

598
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,520
It's okay.

599
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,040
It's okay.

600
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,920
We still have a bowl here.

601
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,720
It's fast.

602
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,560
It's okay.

603
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,560
I'll go and get another bowl.

604
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,720
Sang Qi.

605
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,120
It's okay. It's just sugar water.

606
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,280
I'll go.

607
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,800
Bai Shi, you stay here.

608
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,360
I...

609
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,840
Stay with them.

610
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,480
Bai Shi.

611
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,040
Take care of Zhou Wen Yuan.

612
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,120
I'll go and have a look.

613
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,080
I'll go and have a look.

614
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,320
Wait for me.

615
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,760
Deputy Chief.

616
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,840
Sang Qi, you don't have to explain.

617
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,560
Wen...

618
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,520
Li Le and Guo Zi Jian.

619
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,040
I'm not Deputy Chief.

620
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,520
You're not a student either.

621
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
I have no right to interfere with your business.

622
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,280
Whatever you want to do,

623
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,360
whoever you want to take care of,

624
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,760
whatever you want to arrange for your time,

625
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,640
it's all your business.

626
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,240
But don't forget

627
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,840
what your original intention was.

628
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,840
Ziyan,

629
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
and I explain to you,

630
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,120
you should explain to me.

631
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
You said it,

632
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,920
why are you still wearing a bandage?

633
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,480
Am I worried for nothing?

634
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,360
You're worried about me?

635
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,600
No, you...

636
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,280
Can you make it clear?

637
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,320
I mean,

638
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,480
why are you still wearing a bandage

639
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,920
when you're well-behaved?

640
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,520
Practice martial arts.

641
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,280
What martial arts?

642
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,120
Iron-head martial arts.

643
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,640
Like this.

644
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,760
Tie this rope

645
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,880
to your neck.

646
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,480
Opposite.

647
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,720
Train your neck's support.

648
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,240
It's the same as the bandage

649
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,520
on your hand and leg.

650
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,240
Like this.

651
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,240
Look.

652
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,320
You're getting

653
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,720
more and more capable

654
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,680
of doing things without thinking.

655
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,760
I'm not.

656
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
I've told you the way.

657
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,600
Believe it or not, you can do it.

658
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,920
The sweet and sour coconut is ready.

659
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,520
Since you're so full of energy,

660
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,440
please cook it for Zhongyuan.

661
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,360
I was almost burnt because of the loss of transportation.

662
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,880
This is really someone.

663
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,240
Brother Yu.

664
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,000
We're brothers.

665
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,000
Why did you make such a big problem for me?

666
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,200
Now,

667
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm in danger and can't sleep.

668
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,800
How can I handle

669
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
my relationship with your sister?

670
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,440
The Sang family

671
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,640
is born to hate me.

672
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,400
No.

673
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,960
I'm the one who went up the mountain with her.

674
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,040
I'm the one who was trapped in the cave with her.

675
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,720
Young Master.

676
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,040
She made a mistake every day.

677
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,800
She didn't forget me.

678
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,480
She cares about my injury.

679
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,200
She must have my food in her heart.

680
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,760
Young Master.

681
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,120
When did you come?

682
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,120
I've been waiting here for a long time.

683
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,280
You look like a fantasy.

684
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Didn't you hear me?

685
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,800
I...

686
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,080
I didn't ask you to stay with them.

687
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,560
After Miss Sang made the sugar water again,

688
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
Jin Mu took care of her son.

689
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,360
Miss Sang also asked me

690
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,400
to bring you another bowl of sugar water.

691
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,040
I don't want it.

692
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,120
You can drink it yourself.

693
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,760
I want to eat it.

694
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,560
But...

695
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,360
But...

696
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,200
You look like you're crazy.

697
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,240
Even if I die of starvation,

698
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,720
I won't dare to touch it again.

699
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,440
Young Master.

700
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,440
Please enjoy it.

701
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Why are you here?

702
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,360
Get out.

703
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,800
Yes, Young Master.

704
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,440
Alright.

705
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,560
Good luck.

706
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
I want to go to see the world

707
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,800
One day, you and I will sit in the front seat

708
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,800
We will talk about the past days and the present year

709
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,800
The sky is full of the stars

710
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,800
I want to walk with you through the night sky

711
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,800
I want to walk with you through the snow

712
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,800
I want to sing with you in all seasons

713
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,800
The dream is that you and I will be together forever

714
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,800
The red city is still there, you are still by my side

715
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,800
The sky is full of the stars

716
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,800
I want to walk with you through the night sky

717
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,800
I want to walk with you through the snow

718
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,800
I want to sing with you in all seasons

719
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,800
The dream is that you and I will be together forever

720
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,800
The red city is still there, you are still by my side

721
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,800
The wind is blowing against me

722
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Miss, what's wrong?

723
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
You are punished by Shifu again

724
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
It has nothing to do with me

725
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,800
Miss, you are still thinking about him

726
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,800
I didn't think about Yan Yuzhu

727
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
I didn't say it was Yan Siyan

728
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
I thought you were thinking about Mr. Zhuo

729
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,800
You didn't want to do it

730
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I was thinking about Yan Yuzhu

731
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
But I was curious

732
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,800
I didn't understand what kind of person he was

733
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Brother told me to find Xiaobai if I had any problem

734
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
But I didn't expect he was my biggest problem

735
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:14,800
He didn't want me to win

736
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,800
He saved me from the fire

737
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,800
He was the one who took care of me

738
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,800
He was the one who made me happy

739
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Do you think he has a brother?

740
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Why I feel like I'm not the same person every time I see him?

741
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,800
I think he looks the same every time I see him

742
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,800
I don't think he has a brother

743
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,800
I'm so tired

744
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
The more you want to vote, the more you want to vote

745
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
I need to take a breath

746
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
You can have a rest if you are sleepy

747
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
Yan Yuzhu

748
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Siyan, you are also out for a breath

749
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
The clothes are cold

750
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
It's not good for the wound

751
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
It's okay, I'm a man of my word

752
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm so worried about your injury today

753
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
So I said something wrong

754
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Don't take it to heart

755
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Are you really worried about me?

756
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Of course I'm worried about you

757
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Siyan is hurt because of me

758
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,800
If there is a three-way, two-way, a little bit wrong

759
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Then I

760
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,800
What do you think

761
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
I

762
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm not hurt

763
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,800
What do you think

764
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
I

765
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I'll give you a raise

766
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,800
I will be responsible for it

767
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
You swear

768
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
I swear

769
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
You have a conscience

770
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
It doesn't hurt anymore

771
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
It's really good now

772
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Help me take it off

773
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Cheat you

774
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,800
Cheat you

775
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Young master, something happened

776
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
The goods in the south were seized

777
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
The imperial concubine already knew about this

778
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Asked why the young master didn't go to the east in time

779
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
And let the young master enter the palace quickly

780
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,800
Discuss how to deal with this

781
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
I can't go now

782
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
If you go now

783
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
I can only be with Sangqi

784
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
Young master, what time is it now?

785
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,800
You still have to stay here

786
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
What about the imperial concubine?

787
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
At that time, Qian Jiu secretly attacked Miss Sang

788
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
It was indeed her five-pointed blood

789
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
But if you are afraid now

790
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm afraid

791
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Yes, in this situation

792
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
If you go down the mountain

793
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
You may lose Miss Sang

794
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
But if you don't go down the mountain

795
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
You will definitely lose Miss Sang

796
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
I know

797
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
You go down the mountain

798
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
Zhou Meng Yan

799
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,800
Are you feeling better?

800
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
You went down the mountain so hastily?

801
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
There are only my diseases on the mountain

802
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
No medicine for me

803
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
You can go back and write it yourself

804
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Okay, open the blood

805
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
You don't keep me

806
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Why should I keep you?

807
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Go back and have a good rest

808
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Open the blood

809
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
I'm not going to eat

810
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
I'm not going to eat

811
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
I'm not going to eat

812
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,800
Open the blood

813
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Take care of a young master

814
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
It's a little unprofessional

815
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
This time I went up the mountain

816
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,800
I paid attention to the situation of Yan Yun Zhi

817
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
He should not have taken the next step

818
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,800
I guess he has enough evidence

819
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
He is a five-headed fly

820
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Yan Yun Zhi is worth your concern

821
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
No need to find excuses

822
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Don't think I don't know

823
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Why you are lagging on the mountain

824
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
I still can't hide it from my aunt

825
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Forget it this time

826
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,800
If you delay our business again next time

827
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Don't blame me for not thinking about my feelings

828
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I remember

829
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
You are still young

830
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Maybe in your opinion

831
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
Children and women are the top priority

832
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:22,400
But in front of the

833
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
I don't want to drag them down

834
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
Aunt

835
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I and Sang Qi are childhood friends

836
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Don't want to give up

837
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Sang family has the power to fight

838
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Maybe it's better to join the Sang family

839
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,800
Since the opening of the official family, everyone has heard about it

840
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
Even if the official loses the Grand Commandant, it's the same

841
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Moreover

842
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Sang Wei is the most stubborn

843
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
You have the ability to convince him

844
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
To become a teacher with us

845
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
If it happens

846
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Can you afford it?

847
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
Aunt

848
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Please give me some more time

849
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
At the latest

850
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,800
When your son graduates and has a name

851
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Then you can think about the marriage

852
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
The Sang family

853
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
If you can make friends, make friends

854
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
If you can't, kill them

855
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
And the Song family

856
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
You have to hold the cards in your hands

857
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I will remember

858
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
While you are not in school

859
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
You go to the south

860
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
To solve the case of Yanluo

861
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Yes

862
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
I will tell you one more time

863
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
The most important thing in the city

864
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
The most unable thing is the love

865
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Love is the most weak thing in the world

866
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Do you understand?

867
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
If you can't be cruel

868
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I can help you

869
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
As long as you have the ability

870
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I will help you

871
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
I will help you

872
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
I will help you

873
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,800
I will help you

874
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I will help you

875
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
I will help you

876
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
I will help you

877
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
I will help you

878
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,800
I will help you

879
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
I will help you

880
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
I will help you

881
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I will help you

882
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,800
I will help you

883
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
I will help you

884
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I will help you

885
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I will help you

886
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I will help you

887
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
I will help you

888
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I will help you

889
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
I will help you

890
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
I will help you

891
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,800
I will help you

892
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Mr. Yan

893
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
Where is Qi

894
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
The lady is in Houshan training

895
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,320
Actually, I'm also

896
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,840
quite free.

897
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,120
It's a pity that

898
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,880
I can't go back to my mother.

899
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,560
What about you?

900
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,480
Will you go back?

901
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,880
Me?

902
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,480
Of course I'll listen to you.

903
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,800
If you want to go, I'll go.

904
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,200
If you want to stay, I'll stay.

905
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,880
You are you.

906
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,160
Qi is Qi.

907
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,680
What do you think?

908
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,080
If you want to stay a few more days,

909
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,640
I'll talk to my mother again.

910
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
See if you can hold it for a few more days.

911
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,360
If you want to go, I'll stay.

912
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,200
If you want to stay,

913
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,600
you have to stay with me for a few more days.

914
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Of course.

915
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,960
Really?

916
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,720
You don't believe me?

917
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,240
It's not that I don't believe you.

918
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,440
It's just...

919
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Help me clean this up.

920
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,040
What?

921
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,200
Come on.

922
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,560
Face the front.

923
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,480
Let me see how you've improved

924
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
in the mountains these days.

925
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,960
Okay.

926
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,320
Then I'll be polite.

927
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,920
The

928
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,920
The

929
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,920
The

930
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,920
The

931
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,920
The

932
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,920
The

933
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,920
The

934
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,920
The

935
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
The

936
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
The

937
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,560
It's just a small test.

938
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,560
You're so hardworking.

939
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
How can I beat you?

940
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,600
You have to be 100% serious

941
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,440
when facing a strong enemy.

942
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm respecting you.

943
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,920
I haven't been able to

944
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,880
get close to you for so long.

945
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,400
It's so boring.

946
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,360
Actually, it's not.

947
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,920
Don't look at my face.

948
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
I've done it.

949
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,920
However, it'd be better

950
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,920
if I could have one morejuke.

951
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,960
Siyue

952
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
We know each other in every life

953
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,960
The past is the only thing that keeps me in place

954
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
If it's the persistence of love

955
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,960
We have deep feelings for each other

956
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
I'm the one who has this life

957
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
If it's the attachment to the past

958
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,960
It becomes my quality

959
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,960
My quality

960
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,960
I can never be unknown

961
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,960
Like a perfect story

962
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,960
Is the look of a ferocious wind

963
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
The city where the heart is in the microcosm

964
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,960
Changed the beginning

965
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,960
The history of love that has been lost

966
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,960
I write down the words of the lucky

967
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:11,960
I also accept this life in the cloud

968
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,960
The future has been diluted

969
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,960
The future has been diluted

970
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,960
The future has been diluted

971
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,960
The future has been diluted

972
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,960
The future has been diluted

973
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,960
The future has been diluted

974
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,960
The future has been diluted

975
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
The future has been diluted

976
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,960
The future has been diluted

977
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,960
The future has been diluted

978
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
The future has been diluted

979
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,960
The future has been diluted

980
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,960
The future has been diluted

981
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,960
The future has been diluted

982
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,960
The future has been diluted
