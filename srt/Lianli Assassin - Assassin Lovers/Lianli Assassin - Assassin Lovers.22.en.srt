3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,720
The wish I made

4
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
was to be with my wife for a lifetime.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,160
Wish to be with my love

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,800
till death.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,960
- May I be with my husband forever.
- May I be with my wife forever.

8
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,880
- Wish to be with my love
- Wish to be with my love

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,440
- till death.
- till death.

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,280
Thinking back now,

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,360
it is quite ironic.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,960
I want to know

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,440
if you

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,000
once loved me.

15
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,040
Or

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,760
I was just a tool for you

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,760
to complete your mission?

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,920
I admit that I deceived you.

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,440
But my love for you is real.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,480
When I was on a mission
about Three Dragons,

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,200
you stepped forward and saved me.

22
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,680
Since then,
I have fallen in love with you.

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,440
Stop!

24
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,040
Let go of that girl.

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,000
I warn you. Stay out of this.

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,520
Buddies.

27
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
Beat him.

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,280
Miss.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,880
Are you alright?

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,840
I often think about it.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,920
If we had different identities

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
and lived simply,

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
how happy that would be.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,320
No!

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
Don't!

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,280
You care about me.

37
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,720
Lin Wanxiu.

38
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,400
You lied to me again.

39
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,320
You deceived me first.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Didn't you say

41
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,960
we were already over?

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,040
Why do you still care so much
about my life?

43
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,040
People in love should be like this.

44
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,000
Why resort to a fight to the death?

45
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
I can forgive Wanxiu.

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,160
But I can't forgive you.

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,600
For what you did to the Feng Family,

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,480
you must pay the price.

49
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,240
Honey.

50
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
You've misunderstood him.

51
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,399
All of this

52
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,720
was arranged by Warlord Li.

53
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,480
He knows your secret

54
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,120
and wants to give you an opportunity
to mend your ways.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
Don't forget where you are.

56
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,360
Without my deliberate arrangement,

57
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,000
how could you come and go as you please?

58
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,440
Warlord Li.

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,240
Feng Xiao has been here.

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,160
Keep an eye on him.

61
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,200
But don't alert him.

62
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
Since he's here,

63
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,720
he will come to find me.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,480
Yes.

65
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
I set fire to the military warehouse.

66
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,400
You all know that?

67
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,720
That's a military site.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,600
If you could

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,240
burn it down easily,

70
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,920
I would be too incompetent.

71
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,320
It's on fire!

72
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,280
It's on fire!

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,000
Somebody, put out the fire.

74
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,280
Put out the fire!

75
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
It's on fire!

76
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
It's on fire! Quick, put it out!

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,360
So,

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
from the moment I entered here,

79
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,600
everything has been within your control.

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,160
Why did you do this?

81
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,480
Warlord Li doesn't
want his old friend's child to see

82
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
a villain as a father.

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,160
He can't see you become a tool
for murder.

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,280
What did you say?

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,320
See a villain as a father?

86
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,200
In fact, your biological father

87
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,280
was the foremost philanthropist
of Yue City,

88
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Zheng Tianming.

89
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
20 years ago,

90
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,880
the Zheng Family was killed.

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,600
At that time,
only a baby boy was missing.

92
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,760
And that baby boy

93
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
was you.

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,960
The ones who slaughtered
the Zheng Family

95
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
were the Feng Family.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,080
Nonsense.

97
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,000
If you slander the Feng Family again,

98
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,120
I swear I will kill you.

99
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,240
Honey.

100
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,920
You are as stubborn
as your biological father.

101
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,160
If he had heeded my advice back then

102
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,320
and cut ties

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,480
with Feng Buxiu,

104
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,720
instead of kindly helping them,

105
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,600
I think

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,480
he shouldn't have ended up like that.

107
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,600
Why should I believe what you say?

108
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,360
Warlord Li.

109
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,920
Feng Xiao.

110
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,040
Listen to this first.

111
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,240
Then you'll know

112
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,320
if Warlord Li lied.

113
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,560
(I know)

114
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,280
(you're afraid I'll tell Feng Xiao)

115
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,800
(about how you killed his family)

116
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,520
(and seized their properties.)

117
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
(If it happens,)

118
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,080
(I'm afraid
your family will never be safe.)

119
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,240
(Speak.)

120
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
(How much will you pay)

121
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,760
(to keep me silent?)

122
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,640
(Good for you.)

123
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,680
(You're brave.)

124
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,240
(My family is willing to cooperate)

125
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,080
(with brave and wise men like you.)

126
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
(Since that's the case,)

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,480
(how about you come with me)

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,880
(and discuss the price with my brother?)

129
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,280
(Why not?)

130
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,080
(Please.)

131
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,400
(Please.)

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
Now you know

133
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,960
what the Feng Family is like.

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,800
Why?

135
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,360
Why?

136
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,880
Why's that?

137
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,240
Honey.

138
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,240
Don't trust them anymore.

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,200
The Feng Family appears
to be patriotic and righteous merchants.

140
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,000
But in fact, they engage

141
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
in shameful dealings in secret.

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,240
They hired grave robbers
to excavate ancient tombs,

143
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,880
and let you kill those people.

144
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,160
They had the antiques
without spending a dime and sold them

145
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,880
to foreigners at a high price.

146
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,680
Yet they deceived you

147
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,960
that the antiques had all been returned

148
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,240
to the tomb owners.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,919
Thanks to Warlord Li,

150
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,039
he stops our national treasures

151
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,200
from going overseas,

152
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,880
so we keep a watch on them,

153
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,799
stopping them from doing anything.

154
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,720
Well,

155
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,200
I killed Ms. Yu and Mr. Huang.

156
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,280
They...

157
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,280
They are...?

158
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,960
They are my confidants

159
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,600
of loyalty and righteousness.

160
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,520
They've worked for me for years,

161
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,320
repeatedly stopping the Feng Family
from trafficking in cultural relics

162
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,960
and getting in their way.

163
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,800
Therefore,

164
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,600
the Feng Family used you

165
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,600
to kill both of them.
