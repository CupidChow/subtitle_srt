00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,843
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,200
Dear.

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,240
He's here.

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,320
Mom.

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,040
Feng Xiao.

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,800
You look so much like someone I know.

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,920
I wonder who you are talking about.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,840
He was a merchant in Yue City.

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,080
Zheng Tianming, Mr. Zheng.

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,320
Have you ever heard of him?

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,280
I'm getting old.

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,000
My memories become blurred.

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,400
I must've remembered it wrong.

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,680
Forget about it.

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,960
It's fine.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
If I look like someone you know,

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
it is my great honor.

19
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,800
Mom.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,400
What have you cooked?

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,720
All your favorites.

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,200
Let us help you with it.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,320
It's okay.

24
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,120
Her dad will help me cook dishes.

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,640
Go cut some fruit.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:34,640
Here.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,160
Okay.

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:35,960
Carry it out.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,120
Give me the plate.

30
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:39,920
Be careful.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,440
Okay.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,600
Give me.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,320
It's okay.

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,600
Which one would you like?

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,120
This one.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,360
I think Feng Xiao

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,720
is a nice guy.

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,800
You cut it well.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,400
Let's eat.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,160
In broad daylight,

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,760
you two are so lovey-dovey.

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,880
Lady Ximei, let me carry it.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:48,960
Okay.

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,920
Eat the fruit.

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Be quiet.

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,760
Wanxiu, Feng Xiao.

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
You go back first.

48
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,280
I'll help them clean up.

49
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Go ahead.

50
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,200
Let's go.

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
You asked them

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
about lots of my embarrassing stories.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Are you happy now?

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
What are you afraid of?

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,840
No matter how much I know,

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,240
I won't love you any less.

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,520
I bet you do not dare.

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,960
What are you doing?

59
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,840
My parents are there.

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,200
It's okay.

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,080
I'm just holding my own wife.

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,160
Honey.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,600
Why do I feel

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,080
that you're a bit different today?

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,840
It's nothing.

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,760
It's just that after I met them

67
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,600
and knew more about your childhood,

68
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,320
a thought occurred to me.

69
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,240
What is it?

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,240
From now on,

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,240
I must trust my wife completely.

72
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
I must take good care of her

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,800
and make her happy forever.

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,440
What do you mean?

75
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Are you saying you didn't trust me?

76
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,560
Occasionally,

77
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,000
I felt doubtful.

78
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,839
All right.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,959
Let's forget it.

80
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
We got married.

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
If we can't even trust each other,

82
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,560
what kind of couple are we?

83
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,360
Right?

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,880
Let's go.

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,240
Well done, Lin Jingshu.

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,240
You asked me to investigate my wife.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,120
You...

88
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,800
I can't believe it.

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,440
The result?

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,600
What about it?

91
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,720
I met her parents.

92
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,720
Did you ask them about her childhood?

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,920
I did.

94
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,920
We talked for almost two hours.

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,080
They even described it in detail.

96
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,240
No.

97
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,240
It's weird.

98
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,560
What's the problem?

99
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,360
I've seen them.

100
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,600
I've investigated.

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
What could be wrong?

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,760
Lin Jingshu, are you

103
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
trying to split us up?

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Am I right?

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Just think about it.

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
How many years has it been?

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,440
They're not young anymore.

108
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
How could they remember it clearly

109
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,640
and describe it in detail?

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,560
Don't you think

111
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,840
it's as if they rehearsed it beforehand?

112
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,320
I don't think so.

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,680
Anyway,

114
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,760
you still need to be careful.

115
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,800
Keep your guard up.

116
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,680
Observe them.

117
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,920
If they are fake parents,

118
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,840
even if they're good at acting,

119
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,440
they can't hide everything.

120
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,320
Honey.

121
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,240
Honey.

122
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,680
Check out the flowers I've planted.

123
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,480
Pretty?

124
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,680
These trumpet flowers look great.

125
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
Don't touch them.

126
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,280
It's not good.

127
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,000
Besides,

128
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,200
trumpet flowers?

129
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,720
They're called lilies.

130
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,680
Do you know their language?

131
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,080
Can they make sounds?

132
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,800
Not that they can make sounds,

133
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,720
but people convey feelings through them.

134
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,320
Hence it's "flower language."

135
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,240
It came to China
in the eighteenth century.

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
They're called Easter lilies.

137
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,020
- Easter lilies.
- It's from ancient Greece.

138
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,320
They're very popular in France.

139
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,520
You didn't know that?

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
So these trumpet...

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,840
These...

142
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
The lilies. What's their language?

143
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,720
Their meaning is

144
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,840
"a hundred years of love"

145
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,120
and "being together forever."

146
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,640
We should plant more.

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,280
A lifetime isn't enough.

148
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,320
I want

149
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,840
to be by your side for all eternity.

150
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,880
Let me teach you.

151
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,760
I'd like to learn.

152
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,960
Give me that watering pot.

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,200
This?

154
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
Water the flowers first.

155
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
Just a little.

156
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,280
Okay.

157
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,760
Let me.

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Thanks, Feng Xiao.

159
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,280
Where's Wanxiu?

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,919
She's cooking.

161
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,240
She's cooking again?
