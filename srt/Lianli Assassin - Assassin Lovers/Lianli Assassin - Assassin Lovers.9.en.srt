00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,864
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,160
Where have you two been?

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,160
I'm looking for you.

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,840
We didn't want to disturb you two.

6
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,760
So we went out for a walk

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,520
and had a chat.

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,600
We talked a little.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,920
How was the chat?

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,480
She was as impressive as you.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,320
Miss Hu is quick-witted

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,280
and intelligent.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,240
I really respect her.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,800
Mr. Lin is erudite

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,879
and well-informed.

16
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,720
Yet he quietly lives among the crowd.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,520
I should learn from him.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,440
Since you two get along well,

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,600
then we can meet more often.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,280
I'd like to.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,240
I have

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,440
a lot to learn from you,

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,520
Miss Hu.

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
I can't wait.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,200
I also want to see

26
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,800
how many things

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,360
Mr. Lin has hidden.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,840
I made some snacks.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,960
Let's go eat them.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,320
Okay.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,400
Let's go.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,520
Please.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,040
Mr. Lin.

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,640
What's wrong?

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,160
Wanxiu.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,880
What's wrong?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,920
You act mysterious.

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
What's going on? You look weird.

40
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,320
I went out with Lin Jingshu today.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,680
He's guarded and constantly probing.

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,040
I suspect

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,080
Feng Xiao might

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,440
begin to suspect our identities.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
So he asked Lin Jingshu to test me.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,680
You must be careful.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,520
I went out with Hu Ximei this afternoon.

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,040
She thought very clearly.

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
Calm and quick-witted.

50
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,240
She's not a normal girl.

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,240
Since she's like this,

52
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,800
then the identity of Lin Wanxiu

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,840
is also in question.

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,040
You're overthinking it.

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
How could it be possible?

56
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,280
Besides,

57
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,040
be careful around my husband?

58
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,480
This is too far.

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,240
You need to be careful.

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,840
Mr. Lin.

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
You must be overthinking.

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,600
Keep on guard against my wife?

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,440
Is that necessary?

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,680
Just listen to me.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,240
Better safe than sorry.

66
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
We have to protect ourselves.

67
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,600
Wanxiu.

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm not joking.

69
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,040
We need to take precautions in advance.

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,320
What do you want to do?

71
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,000
So you are saying...

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,600
The urgent thing right now

73
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,440
should be to ascertain their identities.

74
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,720
Well.

75
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:24,840
You just...

76
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,760
Since he already suspects us,

77
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,160
they'll try to find out our identities.

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,480
Therefore,

79
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,640
I think...

80
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,440
Then we'll know their identities.

81
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,544
(Feng's Residence)

82
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,960
Honey.

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Where's Ximei?

84
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,960
Is she not home?

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,320
She went home to deal with something.

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,720
Don't worry about her.

87
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,520
Let's eat.

88
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,280
Okay.

89
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,160
Here.

90
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,120
Your favorite.

91
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,360
Honey.

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
Something on your mind?

93
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,080
If you have something on your mind,

94
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,680
just talk to me.

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,920
Let me share the burden.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,560
All right?

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:00,960
Honey.

98
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,560
We got married,

99
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,560
but I've never seen your parents.

100
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,440
In my heart,

101
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
I always feel guilty.

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm wondering

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
when I can go with you

104
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,720
and pay a visit to them.

105
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,680
Just this?

106
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,560
Yeah.

107
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,640
I thought it was something serious.

108
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
We can visit them in a few days.

109
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,200
Good.

110
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,400
How about today?

111
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't need to work today.

112
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,120
Is that okay?

113
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,520
In such a hurry?

114
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,880
I want to meet them soon.

115
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,320
Okay.

116
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,440
(Lin's Residence)

117
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,040
Coming.

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,040
Lady Wanxiu, you're back.

119
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,880
Mom and Dad?

120
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,360
Inside.

121
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,080
Come on in.

122
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,720
Let's go.

123
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,040
Master, Madam!

124
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,920
It's Lady Wanxiu and her husband.

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,040
- My parents were talking about
- Master, Madam!

126
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,100
- bringing you back a few days ago.
- It's Lady Wanxiu and her husband.

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,880
This is your home.

128
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,760
Let's go.

129
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,320
Get inside.

130
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,040
There you are.

131
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,360
It's so nice to meet you.

132
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,760
I should've visited you two earlier.

133
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
But I've been busy with work.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,160
So I was unable to come.

135
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
Mr. and Mrs. Lin, please forgive me.

136
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
That's all right.

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,920
Glad you're here now.

138
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,960
Please come inside.

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,120
Dad, this courtyard looks great.

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,680
Can I take a look around?

141
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,560
I just want to see

142
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,240
the place where Wanxiu lived.

143
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,680
Sure.

144
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,880
Just relax.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,560
Mom.

146
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,120
Let's go wash some fruit for Feng Xiao.

147
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,240
Let's go.

148
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,560
Dad, you like to collect antiques?

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,200
Yes.

150
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
I like these ancient objects

151
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,960
because they carry history with them.

152
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,760
Dad,

153
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,920
I remember Wanxiu telling me

154
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,960
that she broke your favorite one

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,880
when she was little.

156
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,120
Because of that,

157
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,000
she didn't dare to go home
for several days,

158
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,240
only to find out

159
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,560
that it wasn't genuine.

160
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,240
Right.

161
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
It did happen.

162
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,520
It was a Song-dynasty porcelain vase.

163
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,240
It's just that

164
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,560
it was not a counterfeit.

165
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,400
When I think of it,

166
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,160
my heart still aches.

167
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,520
Dad.

168
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Why have you never
mentioned this before?

169
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,240
You silly girl.

170
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,680
Since it was broken,

171
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
I didn't want to make you guilty.

172
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,880
So I told a little lie

173
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
to set your mind at ease.

174
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,560
Dad.

175
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,360
I'm sorry.

176
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,960
It's all right.

177
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Come.

178
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:12,720
This way.

179
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,360
Feng Xiao.

180
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,760
This is the room where Wanxiu lived.

181
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,960
Take a look around.

182
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Wanxiu liked playing piano?

183
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,600
Oh, my wife liked it.

184
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,760
She kept pestering her mom to teach her.

185
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
Speaking of my daughter,

186
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,080
she was really talented

187
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,160
and she learned fast.

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
But she lacked patience.

189
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
She practiced it on and off.

190
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,680
So she often got scolded by her mom.

191
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,800
Dad.

192
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,840
Stop.

193
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,920
All right. I'll stop.

194
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,680
