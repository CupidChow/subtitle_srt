00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,704
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,040
Wanxiu.

4
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,640
Feng Xiao.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
What happened?

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,800
He knew I went to
the Warlord Li's Residence.

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,800
He thought I lied.

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,760
Feng Xiao.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,360
Don't blame Wanxiu.

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,640
It's my fault.

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,480
I asked her to go there.

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,760
Then why did you ask her to go there?

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
I have a cousin who serves in the army.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,240
As he's frail, he's always bullied.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,040
Wanxiu is his foster daughter.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,320
So I asked her to plead for help.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,880
See if he could transfer him.

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,720
Then explain it.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,520
What about the fake parents?

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,160
That was also my idea.

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
After I knew she liked you,

22
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,080
I heard you are the son
of the Feng Family

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
and the future successor.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,080
But Wanxiu is an orphan with no parents.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,520
I was afraid you would look down on her.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,720
So I asked them to pretend.

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,920
Then the people I saw
at the Lin's Residence...

28
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,720
They're his subordinates.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,400
They're not my parents.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,360
But the stories they told you are true.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,680
I grew up in the Warlord Li's Residence.

32
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
That place is my home.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
They are my family.

34
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,280
I admit it.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,120
I lied to you.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Honey, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,880
I was just too afraid of losing you.

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,240
I...

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,520
I shouldn't have
spoken to you like that.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,680
You should've told me all this earlier.

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,680
Then it wouldn't have happened.

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
I was afraid you would leave me.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,480
I daren't.

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,880
You fool.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,160
Silly girl.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
How could I possibly leave you?

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,160
We'll be together forever.

49
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,320
Right?

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,480
Will you promise me?

51
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,160
No matter what happens in the future,

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,880
let's not lie to each other.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,200
Fortune or misfortune.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,320
We'll always be together.

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Together forever.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,480
Nothing can split us up.

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,560
I promise.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
I promise.

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,200
Your makeup is all smudged.

60
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,600
Let's...

62
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
Let's go to the fair.

63
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,000
Go fix it upstairs.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
Mr. Lin is waiting for us.

65
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Go ahead.

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,440
That's what happened.

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,200
Wanxiu has told me everything.

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,080
So,

69
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,920
don't be skeptical of her from now on.

70
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Mrs. Feng.

71
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,200
I want to apologize to you.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,400
It's all because

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,760
I didn't want him to get hurt.

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,600
So I was skeptical of you.

75
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,279
Please forgive me.

76
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
It's okay.

77
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,440
You were just worried about him.

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,560
Thank you for forgiving me.

79
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,600
All right.

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,680
The past is in the past.

81
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,760
Let's drink tea in place of wine.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,160
I'll pour it for you.

83
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Cheer up!

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,080
Let's celebrate.

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,160
Cheers.

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,400
Face-changing.

87
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,960
Let's go there.

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,640
Okay.

89
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,360
Let's go.

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,840
Excellent!

91
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,760
Your face is always expressionless.

92
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Unable to smile?

93
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,640
I want to smile.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,920
But my friend is too naive.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
He's just too soft-hearted.

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,440
He can't compete

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,240
with a resourceful adviser like you.

98
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,440
You still haven't let your guard down.

99
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
Full of flaws.

100
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,520
If I say I believe you,

101
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,520
I'm afraid you won't even believe it.

102
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,000
Good!

103
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,600
Then why didn't you just point it out?

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,240
I was worried about him.

105
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
He'd get upset.

106
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,160
Bravo!

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,480
Be careful.

108
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
If you try to harm my friend,

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,120
you'll pay us back twice as much.

110
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,720
Rest assured.

111
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,560
Wanxiu doesn't want to hurt him.

112
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,440
Make a wish.

113
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,800
Honey.

114
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,800
What do you wish for?

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,160
Secret.

116
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,680
I want to know.

117
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,760
Can't tell.

118
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,000
Or it wouldn't come true.

119
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,480
All right.

120
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,400
Is the wish you made the same as mine?

121
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,440
Guess.

122
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
I didn't mean to.

125
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,760
It's okay. Be careful.

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,440
Are you...

127
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,360
Mr. Zheng?

128
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,800
I made a mistake.

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,400
Are you all right?

131
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Let's go.

132
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:33,824
(Feng's Pawn Shop)

133
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,400
Buxiu.

134
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,760
Sun Huzi said the consul's wife

135
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,480
is into this kind of suet jade pot.

136
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,760
She is looking for it.

137
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,320
They asked about the price.

138
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,440
Be gentle.

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,280
How much can it be worth?

140
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,040
Five hundred?

141
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,680
Five thousand.

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,680
Five thousand?

143
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,920
Five thousand for this pot?

144
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,160
What do you know?

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,280
Back when I was in the palace,

146
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,880
I've seen similar items.

147
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,800
Those were all from local officials.

148
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,040
They were the Empress Dowager's
birthday gifts.

149
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,040
Look at the luster of this pot.

150
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,560
It's even better than the previous one.

151
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,160
If it isn't because we got it illegally,

152
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,440
we can ask for more than ten thousand.

153
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:30,960
Look.

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,360
Look around.

155
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,679
These items in our hands.

156
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
The value of each

157
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,200
won't be higher than this suet jade pot.

158
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,240
Buxiu.

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,960
In that case,

160
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,240
let's sell it right away.

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
Or it may cause trouble.

162
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,680
You think I don't want to?

163
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,560
But the warlord is watching us closely.

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,200
Acting rashly

165
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,680
would be like biting the hook.

166
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,640
It's not worth it.

167
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,120
Buxiu.

168
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,560
Bad news!

169
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,360
Tell me inside the room.

170
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,680
Buxiu.

171
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,280
Sun Huzi, who helped sell our goods,

172
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,440
was killed on the street this afternoon.

173
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,080
How can this be?

174
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,000
Who did it?
