00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,928
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,440
It was me.

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,600
Warlord Li,

5
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,640
why do you have to do this?

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,960
I just want to see clearly

7
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,480
what kind of he is.

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,960
You've finally seen it, haven't you?

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
He is of the same ilk as his family.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,480
If he's not killed,

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,360
more innocent people will

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,960
get hurt.

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,520
Acting like you're righteous.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,600
Today,

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,640
even if I die here,

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,720
I will drag you down with me.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,920
- Capture him.
- Yes!

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,520
Feng Xiao.

19
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,440
Father.

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,720
Please.

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,880
Please let him go.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,440
For the sake of my country,

23
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,320
all emotions can be cast aside.

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,240
You've completely forgotten

25
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,240
your promise, right?

26
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,640
No, I haven't.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,240
But please.

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,560
Give me one more chance.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,280
He'll be on the right path.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,479
Good.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,400
I will give you one more chance.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,920
Kill him by yourself.

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,200
What?

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,920
You can't bear it?

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,880
Alright.

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,640
I'll help you.

37
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,480
Don't.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
I'll do it myself.

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Shoot.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,240
Have you forgotten
how Mr. Huang and Ms. Yu died?

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,280
Capture Feng Xiao.

42
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Don't let him escape.

43
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,640
- Yes!
- Yes!

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,040
Letting an enemy go...

45
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,520
Chase him!

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,480
Will surely lead to future troubles.

47
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,080
Lift it up.

48
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Okay.

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Thank you for the rescue.

51
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,560
Feng Xiao,

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,440
it's me,

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,440
Jingshu.

54
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,160
How come it's you?

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,720
Where are we?

56
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,240
This is my secret basement.

57
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,960
Don't worry.

58
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,760
Aren't you afraid of getting involved?

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,960
I can't just watch my good buddy

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,960
go to meet his fate

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,160
and do nothing.

62
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,240
You now owe me a big favor.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,120
In the future,

64
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,640
you'll have to repay a lot.

65
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
That is hiding in plain sight.

66
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
I just checked it.

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,000
The wound on the forehead is minor,

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,760
but the one on your leg
must be treated now.

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,640
Otherwise, you will be crippled.

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
All of you under Warlord Li are alike.

71
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,680
Tell me.

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,920
What are you here for?

73
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,840
Mr. Feng.

74
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:31,840
Mr. Feng.

75
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,680
You're being ungrateful.

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
Without Miss Hu's help today,

77
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,480
you'd already die.

78
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,400
Where is Lin Wanxiu now?

79
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,000
She already set off.

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,520
How's the deployment?

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
As you instructed,

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,160
they are lying in ambush there.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,400
Very good.

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
Listen to my command later.

85
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,880
Feng Xiao is stubborn

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,920
and has bewitched her.

87
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,240
He

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,560
must die today.

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes.

90
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm coming.

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,760
Go.

92
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,760
Go to help Feng Xiao.

93
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,840
OK, let's go.

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
Everything I said is true.

95
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,960
It was arranged by Warlord Li himself.

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,280
Wanxiu had no idea.

97
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,240
Please don't blame her.

98
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,880
You're under Warlord Li.

99
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,120
Why did you save me?

100
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,040
I did it for Wanxiu.

101
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,760
I don't want her to be sad again.

102
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,840
Ximei,

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,360
you just cleaned his wound.

104
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,120
Why not go to wash your hands?

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,520
So, Mr. Feng,

106
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,280
have you thought
about how to repay my favor?

107
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,240
Oh, right.

108
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,480
Mr. Feng,

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
I have something to tell you.

110
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,360
Stay here these days

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,960
and don't let anyone
know your whereabouts,

112
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
including your family.

113
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Why can't even they be told?

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,800
Because your relationship

115
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,120
is much more complicated than you think.

116
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
What do you mean?

117
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,480
On the 3rd day of the 3rd month,

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,680
the Three Dragons died outside the city.

119
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,800
On the 16th day of the 7th month,

120
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,560
three tomb raiders from two families

121
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,160
were stabbed in the throat
at a temple outside the city.

122
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,760
On the 7th day of the 8th month,

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,240
Qian Dahai's steward died abruptly
in the middle of the night.

124
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,320
You know it all.

125
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,560
Of course.

126
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,360
I'm called the all-knowing man.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,680
Not only these.

128
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,800
I know even more.

129
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,120
For instance,
you perform tasks for them.

130
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,760
You have executed

131
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,600
16 assassination tasks
and killed 27 people

132
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,640
for your family.

133
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,920
Mr. Feng,

134
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,680
I say all this

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,120
just to tell you

136
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,800
I have the ability

137
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,920
to uncover anything if I want to.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
If you still consider me a buddy,

139
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,320
don't ask more.

140
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
When the time is ripe,

141
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
I will give you an answer.

142
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:32,920
Here.

143
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,160
Take it.

144
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,960
Is it for Wanxiu to nourish herself?

145
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
Should it be deep-fried
or made into soup?

146
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,280
Could you

147
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,960
stop thinking about food all the time?

148
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,320
This will be our messenger
for future communication.

149
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
What a glutton.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Buxiu.

151
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,200
Is there any news
of Feng Xiao's whereabouts?

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,080
There has been no news

153
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
since he was taken away

154
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
at the pavilion.

155
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,160
Neither hide

156
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
nor hair.

157
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,280
He's not dead,

158
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,360
but he remains hidden.

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
What is he up to?

160
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,200
Well,

161
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,080
Buxiu.

162
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
You don't really care about him, do you?

163
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,880
I don't care if he dies.

164
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,880
But my dog

165
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,080
must not be used by others.

166
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,039
You mean

167
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,760
he might have betrayed us.

168
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,840
If something seems off,
there must be a problem.

169
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
We must be on our guard.

170
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,320
Spread the word

171
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,040
that Warlord Li is searching
everywhere for Feng Xiao

172
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,560
and claims

173
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,840
that anyone who withholds information

174
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,920
will be accused of harboring a criminal.

175
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:02,640
And the word

176
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,560
that because we

177
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,880
refused to reveal
Feng Xiao's whereabouts,

178
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,880
Warlord Li took it out on us,

179
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,240
and a lot of our antiques
have been confiscated

180
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,240
and will be shipped overseas

181
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,040
to get military supplies.

182
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,040
Buxiu,

183
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,480
are you going

184
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,240
to direct the trouble
towards Warlord Li?

185
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,560
Even if Feng Xiao can't be used by me,

186
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,560
he must not become Warlord Li's pawn.

187
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,280
Brilliant, Buxiu.

188
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,440
We can kill two birds with one stone.

189
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
I can never be just as smart.

190
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
But

191
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,080
if we want it to go smoothly,

192
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,440
there's one person
we must watch out for.

193
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,320
Who?

194
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
Lin Jingshu.

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,920
He is exceptionally astute.

196
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,440
His network spans
throughout the Yue City.

197
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,560
And

198
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,800
I've recently heard

199
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,480
he's investigating the death
of Zheng Tianming and his family.

200
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,960
If he finds out something,

201
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm afraid that Feng Xiao

202
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,640
will sooner or later turn against us.

203
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,160
Go talk to Lin Jingshu.

204
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,000
See if he can be of use to us.

205
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
If he can't,

206
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
make sure he stays silent forever.

207
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,680
Understood.

208
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm on it now.

209
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,160
You're here.

210
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,640
Take a seat.

211
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,400
As expected of the all-knowing man.

212
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,600
So calm.

213
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm impressed.

214
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,800
Because I know
the purpose of your visit.

215
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,240
And I

216
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,160
have at least two choices.
