3
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,760
Miss.

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,760
Buy some flowers?

5
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,840
Be serious.

6
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,040
I can joke with you.

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,480
It means the mission went smoothly.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,520
Stop it.

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
Do your thing.

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
Aren't you coming back with me?

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,840
You go back first.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,040
We can't be back together.

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,000
I'll be back later.

14
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,280
Be extra careful.

15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,280
Miss.

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,800
Have you seen anyone suspicious?

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,520
Someone in a trench coat went that way.

18
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,480
Go after her.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,160
Wanxiu, you're finally back.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,760
Feng Xiao is looking for you.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,960
What did you say?

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,000
I just said

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,320
you went to the tailor's on the street.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,160
Is he suspicious?

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,120
He's not, I guess.

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,440
Hide this. Don't let him find it.

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,120
- Hurry.
- Okay.

28
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
You're back, honey.

29
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,880
If you want new clothes,

30
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,680
I'll have the tailor come over.

31
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,960
Why go to him yourself?

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,640
I just didn't want to bother you.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,400
We are married.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,072
Tell me if you need anything.

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,880
What is this?

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Isn't there a secret hidden inside?

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,160
Honey.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:28,880
Come here.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,400
I...

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,160
There's no secret.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,640
That thing

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,520
is a surprise
I had Ximei prepare for you.

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,920
Close your eyes.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,840
Okay.

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520
No peeking.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,320
Is it ready?

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,920
Almost.

48
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,680
Honey.

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,000
You lied to me.

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,240
How come you never told me

51
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,760
that you could play the violin?

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,160
How come you never told me

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,720
that you could dance?

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,760
How many secrets

55
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
do you have?

56
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,519
Take your time to find out.

57
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,160
Stop it.

58
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,440
(Feng Buping, Second Master
of the Feng Family)

59
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,160
Buxiu.

60
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
(Wealthy)
Our business contact

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,360
was killed.

62
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,440
For us,

63
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,120
that is a significant loss.

64
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,520
Do you know who did it?

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,300
(Feng Buhuan, Third Master)
He was shot from a distance.

66
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,120
The useless bodyguards

67
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,640
don't even know where

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,520
the shooter fired.

69
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,560
Currently, the entire antique market
in Yue City is

70
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,400
under our family's control.

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,400
Yes.

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,520
I guess the warlord's man did this.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,360
Warlord Li has been against us.

74
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,160
If I have the chance,

75
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,080
I will chop off his head.

76
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,960
If you could do it,

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,240
you wouldn't have been kicked out
by Hong Gang after they hamstrung you.

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,040
Buxiu.

79
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,800
Please don't...

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Don't bring it up again.

81
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,960
Buhuan.

82
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,520
Speak your mind.

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,200
Buxiu.

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,200
I think

85
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
what we should be concerned about

86
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,680
right now isn't who's behind this.

87
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,200
Now that Qian Dahai is dead,

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,760
his followers will fall from power.

89
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,680
Among them,

90
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,920
there are a few key figures

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,400
who know about the deals

92
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,920
between our family and Qian Dahai.

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,400
Moreover, these people

94
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
don't have a rapport with us.

95
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,320
I'm afraid

96
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,040
that in a life-threatening situation,

97
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,480
they can't keep a secret.

98
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,080
You mean...

99
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,840
The only ones who can keep a secret

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,560
are the dead.

101
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
It's so late.

102
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,680
Why don't you sleep?

103
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you, honey.

104
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,760
What are you looking at?

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,720
Looking at you.

106
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
We are married.

107
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,656
You can't get enough of me?

108
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,160
Not enough.

109
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,112
I can't get enough of you.

110
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,000
Fate is truly amazing.

111
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,800
When I thought I was about to lose you,

112
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,520
fate brought you to me.

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,200
So,

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,200
we should cherish this fate even more.

115
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,200
How?

116
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
You know it.

117
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,520
Who is it?

118
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,400
Mr. Feng.

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
Second Master is here.
He's looking for you.

120
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,040
Why is it you again?

121
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
Let him wait downstairs.

122
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,520
I'll be right there.

123
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
I'll be right back, okay?

124
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,880
No.

125
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,440
Uncle Buping came this late.
It must be urgent.

126
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,520
I'll go to see what's going on.

127
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,480
I'll be right back.

128
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
You hurry back.

129
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,360
Okay.

130
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,200
Uncle Buping.

131
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,176
What happened to your hair?

132
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,960
It's urgent. No time for that.

133
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,440
You may leave.

134
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,640
Yes.

135
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,080
What's so urgent?

136
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
This is a secret letter
from your father.

137
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,060
(I received news that Qian Dahai's butler
Zhou Hailiang and his accountant Lu Hang)

138
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,952
(have committed numerous misdeeds.
Kill them immediately.)

139
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,640
Deadline?

140
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,440
Before sunrise.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,120
Don't forget to make up an alibi.

142
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,360
I get it.

143
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,080
Please tell my father

144
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,520
that I will surely fulfill the mission.

145
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,960
Mr. Feng.

146
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,600
You come again
right after getting married?

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
You didn't have a good time
with your wife?

148
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,960
What would you like to play?

149
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
I'll have them prepare.

150
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,880
Get me two prettiest girls

151
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,280
and the most expensive wine.

152
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,280
Send them to my room.

153
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,160
Okay.

154
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,720
Get the most expensive wine

155
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,040
and let Huangying
and Hudie accompany Mr. Feng.

156
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,240
Okay, boss.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,560
Wanxiu.

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,000
I just saw Feng Xiao hurry out.

159
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Is there something urgent?

160
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,280
He said something
happened to Feng Family.

161
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,736
He went to check it out.

162
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,080
Well...

163
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Should we report this to Warlord Li?

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,400
We report to him
if there's anything suspicious.

165
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,840
Feng Xiao is suspicious?

166
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,000
That's hard to say.

167
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
Everyone says he is a playboy.

168
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,840
Who knows if he went out
for an urgent matter

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
or if he went to see his lover?

170
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
Don't talk about him like that.

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,880
Feng Xiao is not that kind of man.

172
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,880
I believe he won't cheat on me.
