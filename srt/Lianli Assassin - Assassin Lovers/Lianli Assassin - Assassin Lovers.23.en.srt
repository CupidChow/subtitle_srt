00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,864
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,600
Well,

4
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,080
I killed Ms. Yu and Mr. Huang.

5
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,160
They...

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,160
They are...?

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,840
They are my confidants

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
of loyalty and righteousness.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,400
They've worked for me for years,

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,200
repeatedly stopping the Feng Family
from trafficking in cultural relics

11
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,840
and getting in their way.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,680
So,

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,480
the Feng Family used you

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,480
to kill both of them.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,680
I heard from their driver

16
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,400
that they found you're the son
of the Zheng Family

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,680
and wanted to inform Warlord Li of it

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,960
to help you break away
from the Feng Family

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,480
in case you were their tool
for murder again.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,680
Unfortunately...

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,280
You look so much like someone I know.

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
He was a merchant in Yue City,

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,520
Zheng Tianming.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,720
Have you ever heard of him?

25
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,400
It's you.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,280
Feng Xiao.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
That's all right.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,720
Glad you've come.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,280
Come.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,000
Come on in.

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,880
Why?

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,640
Why did you do this?

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,640
I did it for my family.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
I advise you to stop.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,960
Do not help bad people.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,240
Otherwise,

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
you will regret it sooner or later.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,000
What have I done?

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
What have I done?

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
What have I done?

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,720
I made a big mistake,

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
taking a villain as a father,
harming the loyal and good.

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
And I nearly killed you.

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm unforgivable.

45
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,200
I'm willing to make it right
with my life.

46
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,000
Please allow me.

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,320
I wanted to kill you at the pavilion

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,600
because I thought you were
of the same ilk as the Feng Family.

49
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,560
Everyone who threatens our country
and people,

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,840
I must kill them all.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,960
Get up.

52
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,080
Well,

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,360
since your conscience is not lost,

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,480
and you have been misled

55
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,960
by the Feng Family,

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
I can let bygones be bygones.

57
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,400
I just hope

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,920
you can discern right from wrong

59
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
and not be used by villains again.

60
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Your biological father and I
were close friends.

61
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,560
I hope you can live well.

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,680
You must promise

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,000
that you'll never
humiliate my Zheng Family.

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,360
I will not fail
my biological father and you.

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,960
I have another favor to ask.

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,680
Please allow me.

67
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:36,880
Speak.

68
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,920
Please allow me

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
to personally execute the Feng Family

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,920
to avenge my family

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
and the innocent who were victims

72
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,880
of their conspiracies

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,480
and schemes.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,640
Warlord Li.

75
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,040
Please allow me to join my husband

76
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,600
in avenging Ms. Yu and Mr. Huang.

77
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,800
Good.

78
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,960
But the Feng Family is full of tricks.

79
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,200
Both of you

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,400
must be extra careful.

81
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,080
Yes.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,200
Yes.

83
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:11,756
(Feng's Pawn Shop)

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
How's it going?

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
I've found it out.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,040
Feng Xiao has turned to Warlord Li

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
and is prepared
to personally wipe out our family

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
to avenge the Zheng Family.

89
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,240
Buxiu.

90
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,200
Buxiu.

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,680
Alright.

92
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,680
Good.

93
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,720
Let's have a do-or-die battle with them.

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,720
I previously sent you

95
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,720
to hire assassins.

96
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,600
Any response?

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,600
Buxiu.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,880
We've offered half of our wealth.

99
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,520
It's such a large sum of money.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
Who could refuse it?

101
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,200
Hundreds of top assassins are

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,560
on their way here.

103
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,040
However,

104
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,960
even if we are lucky enough
to win this time,

105
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,880
we will

106
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,960
suffer huge losses.

107
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,680
Where there is life,

108
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,160
there is hope.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,480
If we can escape this disaster,

110
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,400
the money we've spent

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,360
can eventually be earned back.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,520
Don't be silly.

113
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,560
Mr. Feng.

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,600
You

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,240
made a wrong judgment.

116
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,080
How so?

117
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,480
The killers you've hired

118
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,680
are enough
to deal with Feng Xiao and others.

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
But don't forget

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,040
that Warlord Li's troops are
behind Feng Xiao.

121
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,480
If your killers

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,680
fight against the regular army
with guns and cannons,

123
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,160
they will lose for sure.

124
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,520
If Warlord Li

125
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,920
is no longer restrained
by public opinion

126
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,280
and insists on sending troops,

127
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,800
all of you will be dead meat

128
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,440
and undoubtedly be defeated.

129
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,080
Mr. Lin, do you have a good strategy?

130
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,680
Do one thing in public

131
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,760
and do another in secret.

132
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,920
Understand?

133
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,480
On the surface, increase the guards
around your pawnshop.

134
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,000
But secretly,

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,280
move most of your henchmen and wealth

136
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
out of the city.

137
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,880
When Feng Xiao comes to seize them,

138
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,920
he'll find your pawnshop is empty.

139
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,520
By then, you'll have left the territory

140
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,280
controlled by Warlord Li.

141
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
If they want to chase you,

142
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,600
it will be too late.

143
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,680
After regaining strength,

144
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,520
can't you have a chance

145
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,600
to make a comeback?

146
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
Will you kindly help us?

147
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,320
Am I helping you?

148
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,800
Now, most of your property is mine.

149
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,560
If your family is gone,

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,640
who will I charge money from?

151
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,080
Good.

152
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,760
Mr. Lin proposed a good idea.

153
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,720
Let's do as he suggested.

154
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,760
Everyone, listen up.

155
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,280
Very soon,

156
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,920
we will leave the warlord's territory.

157
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,560
Buxiu.

158
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,600
I guess that Feng Xiao

159
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,640
is currently fighting

160
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,880
with our assassins.

161
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
If he's killed by them,

162
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,280
that would be good.

163
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,680
If he doesn't die,

164
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
once we regain our strength,

165
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,880
I will make him pay

166
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,440
for betraying us.

167
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,840
Hurry!

168
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,360
Be alert!

169
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,240
Yes!

170
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,400
What's the matter?
