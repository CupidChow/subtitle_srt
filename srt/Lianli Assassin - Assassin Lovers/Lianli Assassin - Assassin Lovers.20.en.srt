=Episode 20=

3
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,560
Since it's not a fight to the death,

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,920
why not

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,320
sit down

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,120
and have a good talk?

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,280
I know

8
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,840
you're afraid I'll tell Feng Xiao

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,280
about how you killed his family

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,160
and seized their properties.

11
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,160
If it happens,

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm afraid
your family will never be safe.

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,920
Speak.

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,319
How much will you pay

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
to keep me silent?

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,680
Sir.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,000
I hear

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,280
that you and Feng Xiao
are as close as brothers.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,240
Are you willing to betray your friend

20
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,720
for a few silver coins?

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,960
I fear there's a trick.

22
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,520
You made two mistakes.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,400
First,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,040
in my line of work,

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,800
loyalty means nothing.

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,080
We only value
how much the betrayal pays off.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,160
Second,

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,840
a few silver coins

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,080
are not enough.

30
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,000
What I want

31
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,600
is half

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,400
of your family's wealth.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,560
Sir, since you are not well,

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,040
don't be so greedy

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,640
in case of hurting yourself.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,520
Moreover,

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,400
we have another option.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,120
To silence me forever, right?

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
Just try it.

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,000
I can guarantee

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,520
that once I'm dead,

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,280
within three days,

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,600
what you have done

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
will be spread

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,400
throughout the entire Yue City.

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,480
Are you threatening me?

47
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,040
What if I give it a try?

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,280
Alright.

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
Just try it.

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,280
Let go.

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,840
Good for you.

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,280
You're brave.

53
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,040
My family is willing to cooperate

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
with brave and wise men like you.

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
In this case,

56
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,240
how about you come with me

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
and discuss the price with my brother?

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,840
Why not?

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,600
Please.

60
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,680
Please.

61
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,840
I have no idea

62
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
where Feng Xiao has gone to.

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,960
I've looked for him for days,

64
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,480
but I still can't find him.

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Feng Xiao is now Warlord Li's enemy.

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,800
Once we found him,

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
we must not spare him.

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,480
I understand.

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,960
He's good at martial arts.

70
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Once captured,

71
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,480
kill him immediately.

72
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,440
Don't worry.

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,560
I'm on it right now.

74
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,680
Warlord Li.

75
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,880
How is it going?

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,360
Still searching for Feng Xiao.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,880
Miss Hu has been informed.

78
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Shoot Feng Xiao on sight.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,920
They're still faking.

80
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,520
Don't alert Lin Wanxiu.

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,960
Follow Miss Hu secretly.

82
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,040
Yes.

83
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,720
Wanxiu.

84
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,440
He has declared
you and Warlord Li are his enemies.

85
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,240
Why are you devoted to him?

86
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,680
Love

87
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,080
is truly incomprehensible.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Take a look!

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
(Wang's Pharmacy)
Miss, western goods.

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,960
Have a look.

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,240
They're all top-quality jewelry.

92
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,680
Take a look!

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,240
Top-quality jewelry!

94
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,040
Imported goods.

95
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,480
Miss, take a look.

96
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,360
Sir.

97
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,480
How much for this?

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,200
You have good taste.

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,720
It costs eight silver coins.

100
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,640
All of these are imported goods.

101
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,920
First-class goods.

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,560
Too expensive.

103
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
This is a top-quality good.

104
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,720
Miss.

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,800
Miss.

106
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,160
Let's go.

107
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,320
Please, sir.

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,560
Look, feather dusters.

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
Please.

110
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,040
I made these feather dusters myself.

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Please have a look.

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,480
Go.

113
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,040
Feng Xiao, halt!

114
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
Otherwise, I'll shoot.

115
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,400
What happened?

116
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,320
Where is Feng Xiao?

117
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,280
Perfect timing.

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,720
He just climbed over the wall.

119
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,640
Go and chase him.

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
- Chase him.
- Go.

121
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,000
Up.

122
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,120
Search.

123
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,920
Search thoroughly.

124
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Don't let him escape.

125
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,440
Wait.

126
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
If someone was here,

127
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800
there would be footprints.

128
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,560
Look.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,560
Oh, no.

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
We're tricked.

131
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,800
Chase!

132
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,720
- Go.
- Go.

133
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,920
Trying to track me?

134
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
What do you want to do?

135
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,520
What do you think?

136
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,240
We're looking for you.

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,960
Lin Wanxiu's younger sister?

138
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,600
You're

139
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,040
carrying medicines.

140
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
They're for Feng Xiao, right?

141
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,720
If you know where Feng Xiao is,

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,440
just tell me.

143
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,200
Wanxiu and I are looking for him.

144
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,440
You explain to me.

145
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,720
Who is

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,120
the medicine for?

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,600
None of your business.

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,240
I think you're up to some trick.

149
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,960
Guys.

150
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,320
Miss Hu is forgetful.

151
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Take her back and help her remember.

152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,920
Pick her up.

153
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,720
You can't escape.

154
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,080
Buxiu.

155
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,720
Speak.

156
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,560
Where is Feng Xiao?

157
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,640
Has he worked for Warlord Li?

158
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
I don't know.

159
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,800
Really?

160
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,600
Alright.

161
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,600
If you don't want some scars

162
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,800
on your pretty face,

163
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,800
you'd best behave yourself.

164
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,720
I don't have much patience.

165
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,120
I'm asking you one last time.

166
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,320
Where is Feng Xiao?

167
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Well,

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,040
you're forcing me to do this.

169
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,320
I've long heard
that the Feng Family is ruthless.

170
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,320
Today I really witnessed it.

171
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,120
On the surface,

172
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,840
you asked me to deal with Warlord Li.

173
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,120
But behind my back,
you kidnapped my wife.

174
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,080
What do you mean?

175
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,040
Are you trying to use my wife

176
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
to coerce me?

177
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,400
Your wife?

178
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,240
How come I've never heard of this?

179
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,600
I don't know either.

180
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,400
I let my wife go undercover to steal

181
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,800
information from Warlord Li.

182
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,120
Can I

183
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,520
casually tell outsiders about this?

184
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,440
Wait.

185
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,080
Who is the medicine for?

186
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,640
It's for me.

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,800
I've caught a cold.

188
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,600
I had my wife get medicine for me.

189
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Is there a problem?

190
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:47,960
Buxiu.

191
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,960
The prescription.

192
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,560
Since you had your wife buy it,

193
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,560
you should know the prescription, right?

194
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,800
What do you mean?

195
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,680
You don't trust me?

196
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,000
The prescription?

197
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,200
Alright.

198
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:12,960
Listen carefully.

199
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
The prescription includes

200
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,080

201
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,400

safflower,

203
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,520

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,640
turmeric,

205
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880

and stem ginger.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,640
How is it?

209
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,560
Do I need to go on?

210
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,640
It's a misunderstanding.

211
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
Sorry about that.

212
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,480
Mr. Lin, please don't take it to heart.

213
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,120
Forget it.

214
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,720
You didn't know who she was.

215
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,320
I forgive you.

216
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,560
However,

217
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,640
keep it a secret.

218
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,520
To deal with Warlord Li,

219
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,960
you need my wife's help.

220
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,520
Otherwise, there's nothing you can do.

221
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
Understand?

222
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,840
Sure.

223
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,840
Got it.

224
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,800
Release her.

225
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,600
Untie her.

226
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,000
Come on. Release her.

227
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,680
Yes.

228
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,720
Quick.

229
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,840
Untie her.
