=Episode 21=

3
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,440
Don't move later.

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,120
Well...

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,600
Miss Hu.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,360
He has already left.

7
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,320
Just now,

8
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,840
I had to do that.

9
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,280
I am truly sorry.

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
Forget it.

11
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,680
You were trying to help me.

12
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,960
Oh, right.

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,880
Why are you here?

14
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm here to help my friend
find out the truth.

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,840
Have you found out?

16
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,720
Miss Hu.

17
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,440
You leave here.

18
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,680
You find the phonograph at my house

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,200
and get a tape from the recorder.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,320
Remember

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,640
to give it to Wanxiu.

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,720
You must be quick.

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,520
Otherwise,

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,920
it will be too late.

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Why don't you go yourself?

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
I know the Feng Family's secret.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,600
They won't let me go easily.

28
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
Will they let me go?

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,400
Of course.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,520
They still need you

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,520
to steal information from Warlord Li.

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,920
So you have already anticipated this.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your husband

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,760
is no ordinary man.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,360
Hurry.

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,360
Tanghulu.

37
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,320
I hear Warlord Li

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,480
has been looking for Feng Xiao
all over the city.

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
If caught, he'll be executed

40
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,600
in a stroke.

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,520
Isn't Mr. Feng the husband

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,320
of the warlord's foster daughter?

43
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,880
Technically, they are family.

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,600
How did it come to this?

45
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,880
Let me tell you.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,040
His daughter's marriage is a trap.

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
The purpose is
to seize the Feng Family's property

48
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,920
to buy arms and expand their power.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,720
In this case,

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,320
it's not surprising it happened.

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,720
I heard

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,520
a few days ago

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,320
that the Feng Family

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,760
didn't say where Feng Xiao was,

55
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,560
so they were accused
by Warlord Li of harboring a criminal.

56
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,040
Their properties were confiscated.

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,080
So I suspect

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,480
that Mr. Feng is already

59
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,880
dead.

60
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
They are playing detective
to get rid of them.

61
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,040
Watch your mouth,

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,000
or you'll be killed.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:20,920
So,

64
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,760
we common folks should stay out of this.

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,920
Just live our lives peacefully.

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,240
Get lost.

67
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,680
The Tanghulu seller.

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,800
Get me two sticks.

69
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:31,960
Okay.

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,040
How much is this knife?

71
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Sir.

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,000
It's up to you.

73
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
It's my first day.

74
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,440
Up to you.

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,200
Any amount.

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,720
I put the money here.

77
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,240
Okay.

78
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
It's on fire!

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Come and put out the fire.

80
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
Put out the fire.

81
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,280
Put out the fire.

82
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,000
Somebody, put out the fire.

83
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,760
Water.

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,280
What's happening outside?

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Why is it so noisy?

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,240
Warlord Li.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
The warehouse caught fire

88
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,440
for some reason.

89
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,520
Hurry to put out the fire.

90
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,480
Yes.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,840
Follow me.

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,680
What are you standing here for?

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,000
You go too.

94
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,760
Yes.

95
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
No need to look for me.

96
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,240
I'm here.

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,360
You pushed us too far.

98
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,680
Today is the day you die.

99
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,360
Somebody!

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,920
Guards!

101
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Capture the assassin!

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,600
Move aside.

103
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,920
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

104
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,200
I won't.

105
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,520
Kill me if you want to.

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,880
Do you think I don't dare?

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,640
What are you doing?

108
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,280
Either you kill me

109
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,840
or I kill you

110
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,480
and myself.

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
Anyway, I won't

112
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,800
let you die alone.

113
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,320
You and I have broken up.

114
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
What's the point of you doing this?

115
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,640
Feng Xiao.

116
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,640
Don't push me.

117
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,160
Fine.

118
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
Since we must settle things today,

119
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,160
let's show each other no mercy.

120
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,360
Life and death are determined by fate.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,000
If we must fight today,

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
given we were husband and wife,

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,960
let's part in a different way.

124
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,800
In what way?

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,240
Just wait.

126
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,760
We'll take turns saying

127
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
what we want to say to each other.

128
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
After each time,

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,440
we fire a shot at ourselves

130
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
until one of us is dead.

131
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,240
Do you dare?

132
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
Why not?

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,480
Good.

134
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's leave our fate to chance.

135
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,160
I'll go first.

136
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,200
I'll go first.

137
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,440
The day I decided to go to the pavilion,

138
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,720
I was thinking

139
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,559
that if you suggested
abandoning everything,

140
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,000
I would definitely agree.

141
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,680
But,

142
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,840
all my fantasies were shattered

143
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,960
by you that day.

144
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,040
Tell me.

145
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,480
If Lin Jingshu hadn't come to save me,

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
would you really have shot me?

147
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,680
Yes.

148
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,520
I am a soldier.

149
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,080
My duty is to obey orders.

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,400
But I had made up my mind
at that moment.

151
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,520
If I really had shot you,

152
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,400
I wouldn't have lived.

153
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,160
I would die with you.

154
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,960
(Honey.)

155
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,440
(I'm sorry.)

156
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,440
(Wait for me.)

157
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,960
(I will come to you soon.)

158
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,160
On the night of

159
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Mid-Autumn Festival,

160
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,880
you wished upon the lanterns.

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,200
Was your wish the same as mine?

162
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
The wish I made

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,040
was to be with my wife for a lifetime.

164
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,280
I wish to be with my only love

165
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,960
till death do us part.
