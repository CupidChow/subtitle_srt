3
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,920
Mr. Lin.

4
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,000
You have more

5
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,920
and more weird stuff.

6
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,600
This pigeon is fat.

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,080
Look at this pigeon.

8
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:06,880
Pigeon.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,560
Pigeon.

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,360
A fat pigeon.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,520
How about we cook it

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,600
and go with a drink?

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,680
So?

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,560
It's a breeding pigeon
I bought from the Netherlands.

15
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,200
And it's of high quality.

16
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,680
If you want to eat pigeons,

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,760
go to a restaurant.

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
You have money

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,000
and can eat as much...

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,560
Be good.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,920
As you want.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,560
But this one is fat.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,800
This is quite exquisite.

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,960
Don't touch it.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,760
You're a troublemaker.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Do you know how long

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,440
I spent on this puzzle box?

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,560
Doesn't this give you the creeps?

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:05,920
Stay away.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,039
It's broken.

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,680
A total of 206 pieces.

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
Guess how long I spent assembling it?

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,360
Do you know how many hours
I spent on it?

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Mr. Lin.

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,680
You're interested in medicine?

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,320
Mr. Lin.

37
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,440
What are you doing?

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,600
If I don't restrain you,

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,880
who knows what trouble you'll cause?

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,120
Just sit here quietly now

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,240
and don't touch anything.

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,560
Anyway,

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,040
you can't even if you want to.

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,480
Say it.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,960
What brought you here?

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
You never come without a reason.

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
You're an all-knowing man.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
Do you know everything?

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,320
No one in this world
is omniscient and omnipotent.

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,280
I just know more

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,320
than others.

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,480
Help me find a man.

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,200
A man?

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,160
Who?

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,240
Qian Dahai's accountant,

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,200
Lu Hang.

57
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,480
Lu Hang?

58
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,160
What for?

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
I hate being deceived.

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,080
He deceived me

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
and played me for a fool.

62
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,880
Fine.

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,520
I'll help you.

64
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,040
What are you doing?

65
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,240
Information fee.

66
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Two silver coins.

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,840
You charged one before.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,760
You broke my stuff.

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,400
Shouldn't you pay for that?

70
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,720
Come on. Don't be petty.

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,280
There are rules

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,520
in my business.

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,320
We don't work for free.

74
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,200
Tonight, I will

75
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,920
let you know.

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,720
I'm off now.

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,680
Untie me.

78
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,040
It's hot.

79
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Lin Jingshu!

80
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,800
- Honey.
- Honey.

81
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,160
Honey, you first.

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,400
Honey.

83
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
I dreamt of my mom last night.

84
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,080
Ever since I married you,

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,120
I haven't visited my family for so long.

86
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,160
I want to go back
to see my parents tonight.

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,720
Sure.

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,600
I will prepare some gifts

89
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,640
for your parents.

90
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,720
Will you be mad?

91
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,800
Of course not.

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,560
It's natural for children

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,760
to visit their parents.

94
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,920
You're the best.

95
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,600
What were you about to tell me?

96
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
Mr. Lin said
he hadn't seen me for a while.

97
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,760
So he wants to drink with me.

98
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,760
I fear you will worry about me.

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,840
So,

100
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,360
I need your consent.

101
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,160
It's hard

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
to find a true friend.

103
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,840
It's okay to drink

104
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,160
when friends hang out.

105
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Just go.

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,360
I will be away tonight.

107
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,160
I have no time to worry about you.

108
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,120
How thoughtful of you.

109
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,400
I want to eat the sugar cake.

110
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,280
Let's go.

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:34,960
Okay.

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:35,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,920
Lu Hang.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,080
Warlord Li sent me
to take you to his house.

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,080
Come with me.

116
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:08,680
Okay.

117
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,840
Honey.

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,400
Come.

119
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,120
Go.

120
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,800
Hurry.

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,440
Hurry.

122
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,400
I only take his life.

123
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,040
Others stay out of this.

124
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,040
Honey.

125
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,920
Are you okay?

126
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm fine.

127
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,440
It's all right.

128
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,240
(He's skilled in martial arts.)

129
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
(I must be careful.)

130
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,120
Get out of here.

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,800
Hurry.

132
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,159
(I have to get rid of this person)

133
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,240
(before killing Lu Hang.)

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,679
(Since you must save this bad guy,)

135
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,679
(I have to do it.)

136
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,880
Leave.

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
- Lu.
- Dad.

138
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,040
- Lu.
- Dad.

139
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,280
- Lu.
- Dad.

140
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,760
Lu.

141
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,280
Dad.

142
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
Lu.

143
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,600
Lu.

144
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,680
(Who exactly are you?)

145
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
Dad.
