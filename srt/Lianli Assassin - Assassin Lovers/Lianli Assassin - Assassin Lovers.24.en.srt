00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,796
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,520
What's the matter?

4
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,400
Oh, no.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're tricked.

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,840
Mr. Lin.

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,240
Feng Buxiu!

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,360
You killed my entire family
for your own gain.

9
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,200
Today,

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,920
I will make you pay back with blood.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,880
Feng Xiao.

12
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,800
We'll see if you can do it.

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,000
What are you waiting for?

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,360
- Take him down!
- Yes!

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,000
Quick! Kill him!

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,040
Buxiu.

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,160
Buxiu.

18
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,960
A bunch of losers.

19
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Go!

20
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,520
Go quickly!

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,280
Don't run!

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,520
Stop.

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,400
Don't run.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,040
Come on!

25
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,720
Or

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
you'll end up like this.

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,320
Feng Buxiu!

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,320
Today, I'll avenge Ms. Yu and Mr. Huang.

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,440
Buxiu.

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,720
Xiao.

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,760
Don't.

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,240
Please don't kill me.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,800
I've raised you for 20 years.

34
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,240
Please spare me.

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,480
I will surely mend my ways.

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,560
Even if I let you go,

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,800
the innocent that died at your hands

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
won't allow me.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
Considering you've raised me

40
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,920
for 20 years,

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,000
you kill yourself.

42
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,360
I indeed love money.

43
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,880
But I told you.

44
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
If you harm my buddy,

45
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,720
I will surely make you pay back double.

46
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:21,959
So,

47
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,600
what are your plans?

48
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,760
Warlord Li has dismissed me.

49
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,680
From now on, I am free.

50
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,640
Wherever my husband goes,

51
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,160
I will follow him.

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,760
My wife and I will go

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,720
wherever we like

54
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,600
and live an ordinary life.

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,840
This pawnshop

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,600
was originally your family's property.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Now Warlord Li has returned it to you.

58
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,600
It is justified.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Do you really want to give this pawnshop

60
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,440
to me?

61
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,560
I have no business acumen.

62
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,000
You can make the pawnshop

63
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,760
play a much greater role.

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,080
I hope

65
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,880
you use its profits

66
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,320
to do more things
that benefit the country and people.

67
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,080
Mr. Zheng.

68
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,440
You think it over.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,840
You give this pawnshop

70
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,600
to someone like me who loves money.

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
If you want it back in the future,

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
it will be hard for you.

73
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Mr. Lin.

74
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,280
Money will come and go.

75
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm content
as long as my wife is with me.

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,440
Listen to him.

77
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,760
Sweet words.

78
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
You learn from him.

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,720
Okay then.

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,440
I don't want the pawnshop either.

81
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,720
With a good wife like you,

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,560
I am satisfied.

83
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,640
Take it.

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Why not take it?

85
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,200
It could be your pawnshop.

86
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,160
I could be your wife.

87
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
It's compatible.

88
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,480
Ximei.

89
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,320
Take good care of yourself.

90
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,080
Take care, Wanxiu.

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
I will definitely miss you.

92
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,440
I will miss you too.

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,160
Lin Jingshu.

94
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,040
You must take good care of her.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,360
If you don't,

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
I'll come for you.

97
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't worry, Wanxiu.

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,920
He doesn't have the guts.

99
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,040
Mr. Lin.

100
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,600
See you around.

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,960
Mr. Zheng.

102
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,520
See you around.

103
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,440
Take care.

104
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
- See you.
- See you.

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,280
See you.

106
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
See you!

107
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
Write to me.

108
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,820
Let's go.

109
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:04,544
(Several years later)

110
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:22,840
Harder.

111
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
A straight punch.

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,040
Look forward.

113
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,920
Fist guards the hand.

114
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,480
Come on.

115
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,440
Yes.

116
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,800
Raise your arm.

117
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,800
Yes.

118
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,280
Look straight ahead.

119
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,000
Stab.

120
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,160
Yes.

121
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,040
Slash.

122
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,280
Downward.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,160
Twirl.

124
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,480
Correct.

125
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,840
Come.

126
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,680
Three, two, one.

127
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,200
Stab.

128
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,840
Yes.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,680
Raise your hand.

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,080
Time to eat.

131
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,760
Come.

132
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,000
Your mom is calling us.

133
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
Yue'er has made great progress.

134
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,200
I've seen it.

135
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,480
Work harder.

136
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,120
Here.

137
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,440
Eat more meat.

138
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Get the energy for it.

139
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,679
Xinxin.

140
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,799
Eat.

141
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,159
Come, Xinxin.

142
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,799
You learn from your brother.

143
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,480
You're also great.

144
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,600
Grow up to be as capable as your mom.

145
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,280
Eat more.

146
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
Mom, you eat too.

147
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,240
My good girl.

148
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,000
Here,

149
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,080
Yue'er.

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
Eat more, Yue'er.

151
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,000
Tired?

152
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,960
You get thinner.

153
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,560
Ximei has missed us.

154
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,040
Haven't seen her for long.

155
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,960
Does she want us to gather in the city?

156
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,160
Let me read.

157
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,920
What was said?

158
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,800
Great turmoil in Yue City.

159
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,000
The pawnshop is in crisis.

160
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,040
Return quickly.

161
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,640
We need to make a trip to Yue City.

162
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,760
Yue'er.

163
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,400
Take care of yourself and Xinxin.

164
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,680
Don't worry.

165
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
Be quick about it.

166
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
I'll take care of Xinxin.

167
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,480
Yue'er.

168
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,960
Take care of Xinxin.

169
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,120
Xinxin.

170
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,960
You must be good at home.

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,040
Got it?

172
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Take care of your sister.

173
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,120
Mom.

174
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,400
Don't worry.

175
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,040
I will take good care of my sister.

176
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,520
You do it quickly.

177
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Have a safe trip.

178
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,000
Mom, do it quickly.

179
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,360
See you!

180
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:50,208
(Warlord Li stops wars with violence,)

181
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:53,120
(foolishly trying to achieve peace
with this method.)

182
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,194
(However, more than a decade
of relentless wars)

183
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:59,810
(has resulted in warlord conflicts
and the suffering of the people.)

184
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,944
(The common people are filled
with complaints.)

185
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:07,688
(A greater chaos is thus set to begin.)
