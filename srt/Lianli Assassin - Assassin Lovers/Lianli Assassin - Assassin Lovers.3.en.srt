=Episode 3=

3
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,160
Ximei.

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,480
Wanxiu.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,800
Why are you here?

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,872
Where is my letter?

7
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,160
Right here.

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,040
No time to explain.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,120
Burn it quickly.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,640
Hurry up.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,440
Wait.

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,280
Wanxiu.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,480
I'm a bit confused.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,120
Can you tell me

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
- what is going on?
- Not now. Just burn it.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:00:59,840
Alright.

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,600
Hurry up.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,440
You two

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,920
know each other?

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,920
This is my distant cousin.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,960
Right.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I am her cousin.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,880
You're my sister-in-law.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,880
So what is the important thing for me?
You said I would regret

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,848
If I don't see it.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,560
Did I say that?

27
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,960
I heard it with my own ears.

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,920
I'm certain of that.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,000
The important thing?

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,200
Isn't it already in front of you?

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,360
You?

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,320
What?

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,960
To my sister,

34
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,240
am I not important?

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
If you didn't see me,

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,120
you would have

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
missed a helper
to take care of your wife.

38
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,560
Wouldn't you regret that?

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,360
I will take care of my own wife.

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,000
Why do you meddle?

41
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,240
Tell me.

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,440
Does she like sweet or salty food?
Is she sensitive to the cold or heat?

43
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,448
If she's ill, she takes Chinese
or Western medicine?

44
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:01,880
She prefers orchid or wintersweet?

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,480
And...

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,600
Ximei.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Darling.

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Clean up the guest room upstairs.

49
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,840
Let Ximei stay

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
and sleep in there.

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Thank you.

52
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,440
Your distant cousin?

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,640
How many relatives do I not know about?

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,400
There's plenty.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,080
You do the math.

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,080
Okay.

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,640
I'll go back with you

58
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,240
and do the math.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,640
What are you busy with
early this morning?

60
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,920
You're awake.

61
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,520
Meal will be ready.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,680
You could just

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,200
have the servants cook.

64
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,800
Why do it yourself?

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Can what I make be the same
as what the servants make?

66
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,160
Why are you looking at me?

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,480
I am feeling happy.

68
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,120
Smooth talker.

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
You sit and wait.

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:38,800
Sit?

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay.

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,200
Wanxiu.

73
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,800
I can't believe this.

74
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,760
You're actually cooking?

75
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,760
Why can't I cook?

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,880
Yeah, you can.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,560
I just can't take it

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,040
for the moment.

79
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,600
Serve the porridge.

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,160
Okay.

81
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,960
Here it comes.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,240
You are my good wife.

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
The meals you make are so appetizing.

84
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,240
Try it right now.

85
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,080
Okay.

86
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,360
Here.

87
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
Try the egg and see how it tastes.

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,240
How is it?

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,440
Is it delicious?

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,040
Yes.

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,320
Then have some more.

92
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,480
Ximei.

93
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,600
Eat up.

94
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,000
Try the food I made.

95
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:50,760
Eat more.

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
How did your wedding night go?

97
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,160
Such a big meal.

98
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
Mr. Lin.

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,800
Perfect timing.

100
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,560
Well,

101
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,040
what is the book

102
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,040
you wanted to borrow?

103
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,960
I've forgotten.

104
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Since you're here...

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,120
I'll look for that book for him.

106
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,520
Go to the study.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,560
Book?

108
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,600
What book?

109
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,720
You must be my husband's friend.

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,520
Why don't you sit and eat with us?

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm Lin Jingshu.

112
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
Mrs. Feng.

113
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,240
Mrs. Feng.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
Did you

115
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,560
make all of these dishes?

116
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,440
Here.

117
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,680
- Taste this.
- Give it a try.

118
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,960
Okay, sure.

119
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,440
So how does

120
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,360
it taste?

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,280
It has a unique taste.

122
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
If you like it, eat more.

123
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,600
I can make more.

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,280
Mr. Feng.

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,680
I remembered the book

126
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,400
I wanted is Bamboo Forest Things.

127
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Do you know where it is?

128
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,000
Of course, I do.

129
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,720
I'll get it.

130
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,880
- Let's go.
- Good.

131
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,200
It's in that room. Come on.

132
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,920
Does the food taste bad?

133
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,800
Wanxiu.

134
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,120
You can

135
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,840
kill people with your hands.

136
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,320
But as for cooking...

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,480
Shut up.

138
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,400
Why didn't you say so just now?

139
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,400
I followed the recipe.

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,400
It's horrible.

141
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,800
The warlord is gathering sources.

142
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,440
He has a new mission.

143
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,480
I'll go to see him.

144
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,560
Find a way to keep it from Feng Xiao.

145
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,920
Mr. Qian, you're here.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,600
Ms. Hao.

147
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,280
Good business.

148
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,240
Thanks to you.

149
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Where is Mr. Sun?

150
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,280
Yeah.

151
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,240
He's waiting for you.

152
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,800
Where is he?

153
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,600
Over here.

154
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,440
This way, please.

155
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,560
Mr. Sun.

156
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,400
- Buddy.
- Long time no see.

157
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
(Qian Dahai,)

158
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,160
(a so-called antique dealer
in Yue City.)

159
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,624
(In fact, he sells funerary objects.)

160
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,240
(Grave robbing is rampant in Yue City.)

161
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
(And this man is part of this.)

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,800
Mr. Qian, please.

163
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,920
How about it?

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,440
(He's done many evil things,)

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
(and afraid of retaliation.)

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,400
(Thus, he always has bodyguards
around him)

167
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,240
(and clears the place he goes to.)

168
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,600
(It's extremely hard
to get close to him.)

169
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,760
Mr. Qian, have a taste.

170
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
Top-grade Tieguanyin tea.

171
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,600
Gun attack.

172
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,880
Look over there.

173
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
Come on. Hurry up.

174
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,960
Hurry up.
