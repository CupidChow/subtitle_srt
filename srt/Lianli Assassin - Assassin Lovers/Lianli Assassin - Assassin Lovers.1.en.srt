00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,664
=Assassin Lovers=

2
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,695
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,880
(This is Yue City,)

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,520
(a bustling and beautiful metropolis,)

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,320
(boasting bright lights)

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
(and ostentatious wealth)

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,560
(and luxury.)

8
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,800
(This is a paradise for the wealthy.)

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
(There are many big spenders)

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,000
(living luxurious lives.)

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,640
(But beneath the false prosperity,)

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,040
(unknown evil deals)

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,200
(are going on.)

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:22,880
Mr. Sun.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,960
(Qian Dahai, a tycoon)
- Buddy. - Long time no see.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
(Qian Dahai,)

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,000
(a so-called antique dealer
in Yue City.)

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,040
(In fact, he sells funerary objects.)

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,160
(Grave robbing is rampant in Yue City.)

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
(And this man is part of this.)

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,040
(Lin Wanxiu, the warlord Li's adopted daughter)
(I'm Lin Wanxiu, returning from abroad.)

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,280
(On the surface,)

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,120
(I'm a lady everyone envies.)

24
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,000
(However,)

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,360
(I have another identity
unknown to others.)

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,512
(Three days ago)

27
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:18,464
(Feng Xiao of the Feng Family)

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,960
Grave robbers.

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,840
Buddy.

30
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
How did you get started?

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,920
What kind of robbers are you?

32
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Mr. Feng.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,480
We're leaving.

34
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,920
Mr. Feng is a freak.

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,680
He likes playing with this stuff.

36
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,720
But he's generous,

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,920
or who could stand it?

38
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Get out of here.

39
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,280
Extra!

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,024
(Times)
Three grave robbers had their throat slashed

41
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:06,600
at a suburban ruined temple.

42
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,600
No wrong goes unpunished.

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,200
Extra!

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,880
Three grave robbers had their throat
slashed at a suburban ruined temple.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,959
Shen Wei, you bad guy.

46
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
You caused the death
of my son's family of three.

47
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,600
(Shen Wei, a tycoon)
You can't just let him go.

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
Madam, no worries.

49
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,880
Your son died ahead of you.

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,000
It's alright.

51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,160
I will make a plan

52
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,360
to let your son reunite with you.

53
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,720
Mr. Shen.

54
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,440
Go and chase her!

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,200
Out of the way!

56
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,480
Stop!

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,040
Stop. Don't move.

58
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,880
Be careful.

59
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,840
Come on.

60
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,840
Stand up.

61
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
Miss, we've arrived.

62
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you.

63
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,800
What's wrong?

64
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,720
Come.

65
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,520
I'm alright.

66
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,840
In case you waited too long,

67
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,920
I walked a bit faster.

68
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,200
- You hurt your ankle?
- I hurt my ankle.

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
You should have been careful.

70
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,480
Let me take a look.

71
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Many people are watching.

72
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,680
I am so embarrassed.

73
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,760
It doesn't hurt anymore.

74
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,840
Put me down, please.

75
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,560
It's swollen.

76
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
It's really okay now.

77
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,600
No way.

78
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,920
I said no.

79
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,840
It's really okay.

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

81
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,680
Adapt to this quickly.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,800
After all, we will live together soon.

83
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,920
So when will you marry me?

84
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,840
Tonight.

85
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,480
I'll tell my foster father

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,600
to talk to your father
about our marriage.

87
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,840
Wait for my news.

88
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Okay.

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,880
Let's go.

90
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,768
(Feng's Pawn Shop)

91
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,040
Father.

92
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:48,560
(Feng Buxiu,)
Xiao.

93
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,940
(the Head of the Feng Family)
Come. Sit down.

94
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,680
Try the new tea from your uncle.

95
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,920
By the way,

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,640
I have something to say to you.

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,800
Go ahead, father.

98
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,520
Just tell me if you need anything.

99
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,320
I want to arrange a marriage for you.

100
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,080
Look at you. You are falling in love.

101
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,920
(Hu Ximei)
Are you thinking about Mr. Feng?

102
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,040
He proposed to me today.

103
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,880
He finally decided to marry you.

104
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,520
So,

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,920
you already have a lady you like

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
and cannot marry another one.

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
If I remember correctly,

108
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,840
this is the first time
you have refused me.

109
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,320
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,120
I can follow your orders
in anything else,

111
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,480
but about my marriage,

112
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,160
I want to decide myself.

113
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,200
Good for you.

114
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,200
You've won over the top playboy

115
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,600
in Yue City.

116
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,440
Don't judge him like that.

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
He is not a playboy.

118
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,520
Alright.

119
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,640
Then I will call him

120
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,880
brother-in-law.

121
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,040
Come on.

122
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,400
Actually,

123
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,160
he's not what he looks like.

124
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
He's a very nice man.

125
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
I shouldn't force you

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,920
to do things you don't want to.

127
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,760
But this time,

128
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,000
you must do what I say.

129
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,679
Father.

130
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,799
What are you doing?

131
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,640
Please get up.

132
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,600
I will listen to you.

133
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,240
Father.

134
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,799
Xiao.

135
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,664
The one who wants to ally
with our family by marriage

136
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,320
is powerful, influential,

137
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,520
and ruthless.

138
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,120
Moreover,

139
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,520
he has been coveting our wealth
for many years.

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,960
This time,

141
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,640
he arranged this marriage
with ulterior motives.

142
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,680
If we directly refuse,

143
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,520
I'm afraid our family

144
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,200
will be in huge trouble.

145
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,840
Now,

146
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,520
we can only compromise.

147
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,920
After we figure out his motives,

148
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,200
we will make further plans.

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,080
Xiao.

150
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,640
If you're grateful to the Feng Family

151
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,120
for raising you for 20 years,

152
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
consider the bigger picture

153
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,560
and save our family.

154
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,600
I can't bear to let you go.

155
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,680
I don't want to leave.

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,800
So when will you marry me?

157
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,520
Tonight.

158
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
I'll tell my foster father

159
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,120
to talk to your dad about our marriage.

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,520
Wanxiu.

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Please forgive me for giving you up.

162
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Does Feng Xiao know your true identity?

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,040
I haven't told him yet.

164
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,080
I'm afraid he will be scared.

165
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,400
But if I don't tell him,

166
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,120
I feel like I'm deceiving him.

167
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,040
What should I do?

168
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,720
I have to play it by ear.

169
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,320
Summon the secret source?

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,800
Strange.

171
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,280
The warlord has never seen you
at this late hour.

172
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
What happened today?

173
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,920
He sees you for an urgent mission?

174
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
I guess so.

175
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,920
Have you understood what I told you?

176
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

177
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,120
Warlord Li.

178
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,600
I want to know whom I will marry.
