=Episode 16=

3
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,760
Do you know

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,120
who killed the two of them?

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,760
Come.

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
Listen to him.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,720
It was Feng Xiao.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,160
Who?

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,560
Feng Xiao.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,960
How could it be my husband?

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,000
Father.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,560
He doesn't know martial arts.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,240
He can't be the murderer.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,200
You must have made a mistake.

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,200
You must have made a mistake, right?

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Mr. Huang said Feng Xiao's name
before he died.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,480
And that person confessed

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,920
he did it for the Feng Family.

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,640
That's not true.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,520
It can't be my husband.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,720
How could it possibly be him?

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,120
If your husband was the murderer,

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,600
what would you do?

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,720
If Feng Xiao did it,

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,080
I would kill him with my own hands

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,240
to avenge Ms. Yu and Mr. Huang.

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,520
Good.

28
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,840
I hope you will remember it.

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,800
Remember what you said today.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,840
Wanxiu.

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
The Feng Family.

32
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,720
I will definitely make you pay
with your blood.

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,440
This tomb is filled with treasures.

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,680
We have been working on it

35
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
for about an hour.

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm exhausted.

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,120
Yes.

38
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,000
It seems we can get a good share today.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:28,840
How is it?

40
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,520
Are you done?

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,600
Almost.

42
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,960
Sir.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,840
Right on time.

44
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,760
See, we've dug out burial goods.

45
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,760
You promised us...

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,960
I get it.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,200
The Feng Family always keeps its word.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:44,960
Yes.

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,480
Buping.

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,600
Just pay immediately.

51
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,160
Don't worry.

52
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,440
You will get your share.

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,240
Buddy.

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,960
I give up.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,960
I want nothing.

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,760
No way.

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
The Feng Family always keeps its word.

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Since I promised you,

60
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,800
I will burn joss paper

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,200
for you.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,480
I didn't need

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,200
to do these dirty jobs before.

64
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,560
I just left it to Feng Xiao.

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,560
Yes.

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
- Great.
- Buping.

67
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,400
You have a bad leg.

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,360
Let me do it.

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Feng Xiao

70
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,640
has lost Buxiu's trust.

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
He helped us

72
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,920
kill Warlord Li's right-hand man,

73
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
but as you know

74
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,880
about Buxiu,

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,760
he cannot

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,280
let him handle the financial affairs

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,960
of our family.

78
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,880
We have to do this job.

79
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,000
Who is it?

80
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,880
Buping.

81
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
This...

82
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
Wanxiu?

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
At this late hour,

84
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,400
are you here to visit us?

85
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,320
Yes.

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
I want to borrow something from you.

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
We're a family.

88
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,200
Tell me if you need anything.

89
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,640
Speak.

90
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,280
What is it?

91
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,079
Your lives.

92
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,560
Buping.

93
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,360
Wanxiu.

94
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,200
Nice try.

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,560
My life

96
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,080
is right here.

97
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,600
Just take it

98
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,240
if you have the ability.

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,600
Buping.

100
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Wanxiu.

101
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,344
Don't.

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,480
We can talk about this.

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,880
(Half-Step Slope)

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,397
(Half-Step Slope)

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,520
Buxiu.

106
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,400
Buxiu.

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,960
What's wrong?

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,640
Buping...

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,560
Buping was killed.

110
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,840
Who did it?

112
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Lin Wanxiu.

113
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,480
You...

114
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,520
Get Feng Xiao here immediately.

115
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,760
Yes.

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,880
Buping.

117
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,880
You're so useless.

118
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
Why do you think she deceived me?

119
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,480
Didn't you deceive her?

120
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,720
Do you love her?

121
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Of course.

122
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,840
I love her.

123
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Do you think

124
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,920
she loves you?

125
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,840
Since you love each other,

126
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,720
why not be honest with each other?

127
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
You must understand

128
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,520
that once the trust

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,480
is broken,

130
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,400
it will be hard

131
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,960
to repair.

132
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,640
But I'm afraid

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,800
after telling her the truth,

134
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,480
she might leave me.

135
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,320
Put yourself in her shoes.

136
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,080
If she deceives you,

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
does she also worry

138
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,320
that you will leave her?

139
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,600
Feng Xiao.

140
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
Feng Xiao.

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,880
You still have time to eat here?

142
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,560
Hurry and come with me.

143
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,280
Wanxiu killed Uncle Buping?

144
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
That's impossible.

145
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,480
He saw it with his own eyes.

146
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,040
Could...

147
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,840
Could this be false?

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,600
Exactly.

149
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,960
If I hadn't run fast,

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,320
I would have lost my life there.

151
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,240
Impossible.

152
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,000
No.

153
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:00,920
I...

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wanxiu doesn't know martial arts at all.

155
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,240
How could she kill Uncle Buping?

156
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,040
You...

157
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
You have been bewitched

158
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,000
by that woman.

159
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,360
If you're grateful

160
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,160
that I've raised you for 20 years,

161
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,960
go and kill Lin Wanxiu

162
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,280
to avenge Buping.

163
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,440
Otherwise,

164
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,280
I will disown you,

165
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,320
an unfilial son.

166
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,679
Buxiu.

167
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,320
Father.

168
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,919
You're so unfilial.

169
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,559
Rest assured, father.

170
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
If Lin Wanxiu killed Uncle Buping,

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,600
I will kill her for Uncle Buping.

172
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
Honey, where have you been?

173
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,280
Do you hate to return to this home?

174
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,200
I've been busy at the pawnshop.

175
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Sorry for making you worry.

176
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,000
With your abilities,

177
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,920
I doubt there's a need for me to worry.

178
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
You flatter me.

179
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,880
Compared to you,

180
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,880
my abilities are nothing.

181
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,480
Food is ready.

182
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,280
Let's eat.

183
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,840
Don't you have anything to say to me?

184
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
What do you want me to say?

185
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,240
Say what you should say.

186
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,760
I have nothing to say.

187
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,800
Do you have anything to say to me?

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,320
If you have nothing to say to me,

189
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,960
what could I want to say?

190
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,800
Let's eat.

191
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Honey, you're awake?

192
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,040
Aren't you also awake?

193
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
How many secrets do you have?

194
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,720
As many as you have.

195
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,160
Do we really have to talk like this?
