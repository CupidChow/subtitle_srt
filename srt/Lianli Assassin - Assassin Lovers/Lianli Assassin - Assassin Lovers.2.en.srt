3
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,679
(Lin Jingshu, an all-knowing man)

4
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,256
(Feng Xiao of the Feng Family will marry
the Warlord Li's adopted daughter.)

5
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,840
Mr. Feng.

6
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,640
What's up?

7
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,160
I'm utterly bored.

8
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:36,800
By the way,

9
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,480
will you marry

10
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,560
Warlord Li's adopted daughter?

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
News travels fast.

12
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,360
You're an all-knowing man.

13
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
I know you pretty well.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,960
You're not a snob.

15
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,200
Why will you marry her?

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,400
Well,

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,760
if you have any reasons,

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,520
just tell me.

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,640
If I can be of any help,

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,160
I will definitely do it.

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,280
Marriage is a huge thing.

22
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,360
I'm afraid you might regret it.

23
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,200
My mind is made up.

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,840
No need to persuade me.

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,160
Fine.

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,920
Since it's your decision,

27
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,960
I will respect your choice.

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,480
Remember

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,120
to invite me to your wedding.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,280
Here they come.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,080
Congratulations.

32
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,840
(Feng Residence)
Thanks for coming.

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
Thanks for your rewards, Mr. Feng.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
May you two

35
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,480
happiness,

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,280
and treat each other with respect.

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,280
Go have a look.

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,120
It's your wedding day.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,760
Why the long face?

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,640
Just smile.

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I can't smile right now.

42
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,600
This is your decision.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,720
You must smile.

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,600
Besides,

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
the bride is innocent.

46
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,880
Look at your face.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,160
What will she think?

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,040
Don't miss a propitious time.

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,280
Hurry up.

50
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,280
Bow to heaven and earth.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
Bow to the parents.

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,080
The couple bows to each other.

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,800
Be careful.

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,200
Come on.

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,760
It's your own decision.

56
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,240
Why did you get drunk?

57
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,520
Alright.

58
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,400
I gotta go.

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,120
See you.

60
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,880
Hold on.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,840
Well,

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,000
you come in with me for more drinks.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,520
Are you kidding?

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,560
Can I enter this room with you?

65
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,520
I...

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,160
Besides,

67
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,760
your bride is waiting for you.

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,040
Wait.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,720
What bride?

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,568
(What should I do?)

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,720
(Get out of here?)

72
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,280
(Will the Feng Family be in trouble?)

73
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,760
(Otherwise,)

74
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,200
(do I really need to stay?)

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,680
(Feng Xiao.)

76
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,824
(What are you thinking?)

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,640
(You can't betray Wanxiu.)

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,560
(I've married her anyway.)

79
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
(If she asks for a divorce,)

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,600
(I can be with Wanxiu again.)

81
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,040
Honey.

82
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Are you waiting for me?

83
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,480
Here I am.

84
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,040
Have you understood what I told you?

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,240
Yes.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,360
Warlord Li.

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,080
I want to know whom I will marry.

88
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,120
You never had so many questions before.

89
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,920
Right.

90
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,368
I shouldn't have asked.

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,440
I know you're unwilling to marry.

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
But I have no choice.

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,800
Do you still remember the vow

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,800
you made to me back then?

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,000
For the sake of my country,

96
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,560
all feelings can be ignored.

97
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,960
Now is the time for you
to contribute to our nation.

98
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,560
Our country is infested
with many scourges.

99
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,480
If we don't root out these scourges,

100
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,560
our nation is likely to perish.

101
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,080
What do you need me to do?

102
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,200
You get married into the Feng Family

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,160
and keep a close watch on their move.

104
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,000
If there's anything unusual,

105
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,720
let me know immediately.

106
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,040
Yes.

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
- It's you?
- It's you?

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,520
It's my wedding.

109
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,320
It's my wedding.

110
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,400
You're my wife?

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,680
You're my husband?

112
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,360
Get up.

113
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,400
So,

114
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,760
you planned to marry someone else?

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,480
Right.

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,040
I have my reason.

117
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I'll explain later.

118
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,760
What about you?

119
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
You also planned to marry someone else?

120
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,200
Right.

121
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,320
I have my reason.

122
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,280
You just called me

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,920
honey and said

124
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,800
"Here I am."

125
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,840
What does that mean?

126
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,560
Never mind.

127
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:34,880
Forget it.

128
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,040
And most importantly,

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
since we're meant

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
to be together,

131
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,480
we might as well

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,200
follow our fate.

133
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,000
Mr. Feng.

134
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,480
Someone is here to see you.

135
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,680
Get lost!

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,880
It's my wedding night.

137
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,640
No visitors.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,120
I've stopped her.

139
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,840
But she insisted on seeing you.

140
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,400
She has something important to give you.

141
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,640
You'll regret if you don't see it.

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
Something important?

143
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,960
Who is it?

144
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,480
It's a lady.

145
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,200
A lady?

146
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,040
- Wait.
- Oh, no.

147
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,200
I already warned Wanxiu.

148
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,880
Mr. Feng is not a good man.

149
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,920
He promised to marry Wanxiu.

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
But he suddenly married someone else.

151
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,480
(To Feng Xiao)
Wanxiu is so affectionate.

152
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,280
What?

153
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,400
Getting married?

154
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,960
How could Warlord Li do this?

155
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,679
No way.

156
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,120
I need to ask him why.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,679
Sit down.

158
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,640
You can't.

159
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Anyway, what's the point?

160
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,400
Without Warlord Li,

161
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
we would have died in the war.

162
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,600
But he can't make you
marry a strange man.

163
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,480
The wedding is approaching,

164
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,520
but you don't even know
whom you'll marry.

165
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,560
Don't you think it's crazy?

166
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
I believe Warlord Li has reasons

167
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,760
for this.

168
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,080
Wanxiu.

169
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,960
Sometimes you're too considerate
of others.

170
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360
When is the wedding?

171
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,224
The day after tomorrow.

172
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
What?

173
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,080
It's too hasty.

174
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,480
Well,

175
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,000
how are you gonna tell Feng Xiao
about it?

176
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
On my wedding day,

177
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,920
you give him this letter.

178
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,320
In the letter,

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,440
I have confessed everything to him.

180
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,480
Maybe we're meant to part.

181
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,840
Ximei.

182
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,160
Wanxiu.

183
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,480
Why are you here?

184
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
Where is my letter?

185
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,840
Right here.

186
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,720
No time to explain.

187
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,800
Burn it quickly.

188
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,320
Hurry up.

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,120
Wait.

190
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Wanxiu.

191
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,160
I'm a bit confused.

192
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,800
Can you tell me

193
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
- what is going on?
- Not now. Just burn it.

194
