=Episode 6=

3
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:49,920
So beautiful.

4
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Stop it.

5
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,800
Stop washing.

6
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,160
What's wrong?

7
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,440
You look tired

8
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,720
and haggard.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,960
Have some rest.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,800
I'll be done soon.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,520
Look.

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,080
Look at you.

13
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,040
Stop.

14
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,520
Come on.

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,760
Honey.

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
You are not only sexy and pretty now.

17
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,600
You are even cuter.

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,640
Are you making fun of me?

19
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,240
You wet my face.

20
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,160
What?

21
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Were you chased by someone?

22
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,680
Did you hear that?

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,880
Qian Dahai's butler was killed.

24
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,960
It's terrible.

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,480
Exactly.

26
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,640
I also heard

27
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,880
that Qian Dahai's accountant
was targeted last night.

28
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,800
Fortunately,
he narrowly escaped unharmed.

29
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,320
Well,

30
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,600
did they

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,160
know some secrets

32
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,360
they shouldn't know?

33
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
That's why they were murdered?

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,280
You may leave.

35
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,240
You just let Lu Hang go like that?

36
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,040
Do you realize

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,160
what kind of punishment you'll face
if the mission fails?

38
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,200
I know.

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,840
I am willing to be punished.

40
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,160
You...

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Tell me.

42
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,920
Why?

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,240
I remember you said

44
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
that those I've killed

45
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,000
were all heinous criminals
who deserved death.

46
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,240
But Lu Hang was just an accountant.

47
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,400
He has never done anything atrocious.

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,000
He...

49
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,560
How could he appear
on the assassination list?

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,440
Never committed any atrocities?

51
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,519
How do you know?

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,680
He said so himself

53
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
under oath.

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,160
Under oath?

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,320
If the oath comes true,

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
in this world,

57
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
there won't be so many bad people.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,280
Xiao.

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,880
I know you're inherently kind-hearted.

60
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,800
But your kindness

61
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,400
can sometimes become a tool

62
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,200
exploited by the wicked.

63
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,760
Guess what?

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,960
You pitied him

65
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,480
and let him go.

66
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560
But it may cause many to suffer.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,600
Have you thought about them?

68
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,200
I...

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,800
Enough.

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,840
No more talking.

71
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,640
Think carefully about what I just said.

72
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,600
You're here.

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,720
You look weary.

74
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,640
You didn't sleep well last night.

75
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,480
I drank with two girls till midnight

76
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,120
and hardly got any sleep.

77
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
You were out for a night run.

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,160
Good for you.

79
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,760
Yesterday I had a good time

80
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,200
with Huangying and Hudie.

81
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
I didn't go for a night run.

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,160
Hold on.

83
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,000
Have a good time?

84
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,920
What's with the mud on your shoes?

85
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Waiter.

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
A bottle of red wine.

87
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,240
Wanxiu.

88
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,280
I made you marry Feng Xiao.

89
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
And it's hard on you.

90
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,360
What makes you say that?

91
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,560
I'm grateful to you, actually.

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,280
After you married into the Feng Family,

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,400
has anything unusual happened?

94
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
Not yet for now.

95
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,760
Warlord Li.

96
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,320
I have a question.

97
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,440
I hope you can answer me.

98
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,280
Go ahead.

99
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,040
In the eyes of the people,

100
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,360
isn't the Feng Family famous

101
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,080
for their kindness
and loyalty to the nation?

102
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,560
That indicates their cunning nature.

103
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,400
Now you can be honest with me?

104
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,160
You're truly an all-knowing man.

105
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,680
I can hide nothing from you.

106
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,400
After drinking this,

107
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,400
we'll keep it

108
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,840
between you

109
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,120
and me.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Go ahead.

111
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
What can I do for you?

112
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,480
Do you think

113
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
I should reveal my true identity
to Wanxiu?

114
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
Last night, to handle a mission,

115
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,000
I lied to her.

116
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,800
In my heart,

117
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
I always feel guilty to her.

118
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,280
Trust is the foundation

119
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,040
between husband and wife.

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
If deceiving her causes you great pain,

121
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,240
why not come clean to her?

122
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
But I'm worried

123
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,240
that if I do so,

124
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,200
she will

125
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,960
be frightened

126
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
or disappointed in me.

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,240
Besides,

128
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
what if she leaves me?

129
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,000
So today you've come to me for answers.

130
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,160
I want to hear your advice.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,160
One silver coin.

132
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,000
Heads, come clean.

133
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Tails, conceal.

134
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,920
That's it.

135
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,640
Isn't this too hasty?

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,600
I haven't even seen what it is yet.

137
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
Why did you take it away?

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,240
You already have the answer

139
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,880
in your heart, right?

140
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,040
I'm off.

141
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,360
Give me back my money.

142
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,640
The information fee.

143
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,840
One silver coin.

144
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,840
I'm off.

145
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,720
Grave robbing is rampant in Yue City.

146
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,679
They sell funeral artifacts as antiques.

147
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
The Feng Family is behind this.

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,840
But they are cunning and sly,

149
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,040
never leaving behind any evidence.

150
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,040
Instead, they pretend to be righteous
and win great popularity.

151
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,720
Therefore,

152
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,600
I made you marry into the Feng Family.

153
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,720
I want you to find the evidence

154
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,720
to bring them to justice.

155
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,800
(Are they that kind of people?)

156
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
(What about Feng Xiao?)

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,960
(Impossible.)

158
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
(Feng Xiao is kind-hearted.)

159
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,080
(He certainly will not associate
with bad people.)

160
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,480
Wanxiu.

161
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,680
What are you thinking?

162
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,200
Nothing.

163
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,440
I just didn't expect

164
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,000
the Feng Family could be that evil.

165
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
So,

166
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,280
no one is trustworthy
in the Feng Family.

167
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,760
By the way,

168
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,520
I called you here

169
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
for another matter.

170
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
One of Qian Dahai's men

171
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,560
is a spy of mine.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
His name is Lu Hang.

173
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,920
He has information
about Qian Dahai's crimes.

174
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,600
And he was supposed
to deliver this information to me.

175
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,440
But unexpectedly,

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,360
last night he was ambushed.

177
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
And the four bodyguards I sent

178
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,880
were all killed by the assassin.

179
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,000
Four bodyguards?

180
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,400
How many assassins?

181
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,160
Just one.

182
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,160
Only one?

183
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,520
Most strangely,

184
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,200
this assassin
could have taken Lu Hang's life,

185
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,800
but unexpectedly,

186
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
he let him go.

187
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,120
Why did this assassin act so strange?

188
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
That's what puzzles me too.

189
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,280
I don't know what they're up to.

190
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,920
Lu Hang is hiding

191
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,720
in a dilapidated house on the outskirts.

192
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,480
You must find him.

193
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,360
Tonight,

194
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,280
