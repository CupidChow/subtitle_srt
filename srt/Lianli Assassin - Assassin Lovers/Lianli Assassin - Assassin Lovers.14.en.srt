3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,920
Captain, I heard a shot fired.

4
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,080
Follow me.

5
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:10,840
Quick.

6
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,600
Brother.

7
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
The patrol is coming.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,280
What now?

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,880
Retreat.

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:18,800
Retreat.

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,640
Hurry.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,560
Wanxiu.

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,400
What happened?

14
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,760
I was tricked.

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,520
Someone threw lime at me.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,000
My eyes hurt.

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,120
Come in.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,640
Come with me.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,080
Try to open your eyes.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,640
Any better?

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,800
Feeling burn.

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
But it's fine.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,360
I didn't expect the Feng Family
to be so malicious.

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,960
They deliberately set a trap for you.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,520
Lower your voice.

26
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,560
Don't wake up others.

27
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,560
No worries, Wanxiu.

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,600
I've knocked them out.

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,440
Wanxiu.

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,760
Well,

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,120
they set you up.

32
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,560
Does Feng Xiao know about it?

33
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,480
Has he woken up?

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,520
Rest assured, Wanxiu.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,880
The sleeping powder

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
keeps him asleep till tomorrow morning.

37
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,480
I don't think he knows.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,600
They must have been suspicious

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,040
of my identity.

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,400
They even used Feng Xiao

41
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,880
to lure me in.

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,560
The Feng Family is full of tricks.

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,440
Wanxiu.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,440
You must be extra careful.

45
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,600
Sure.

46
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,600
Honey.

47
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,920
Are you okay?

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,320
My head is so dizzy.

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,640
It's already daylight.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,240
We drank too much last night.

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,360
Unexpectedly,

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,920
the liquor was strong.

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
Did you delay your things yesterday?

54
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,240
I will apologize to my father later.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,400
Go back to your room.

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
Let Ximei make ginger soup for you.

57
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,800
You slept here last night.

58
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,640
Don't catch a cold.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,840
It's all my fault.

60
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,640
I delayed your things.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,800
It's okay.

62
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,640
I'll apologize to my father later.

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
At most, he'll just yell at me a little.

64
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Take care.

65
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,720
Be quick about it.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,640
Okay.

67
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm off.

68
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,440
Father.

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
Seize him.

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
I apologize

71
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
and pay any price.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,920
You still know I'm your foster father?

73
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,760
Why collude with Warlord Li

74
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,680
to seize my family's property?

75
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,240
What do you mean?

76
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,440
Last night, I ordered you
to escort goods.

77
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,480
Why did you not come?

78
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,760
Instead, Warlord Li's assassin came.

79
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,040
Last night, I drank with my wife.

80
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,520
I got drunk.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,560
I didn't wake up until morning.

82
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,080
I know I made a mistake,

83
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
so I'm here to apologize to you.

84
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,080
Regarding the assassin,

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,360
I truly had no knowledge of it.

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,120
Get up.

87
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Xiao.

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,720
I know

89
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,720
it has nothing to do with you.

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,680
Have a seat.

91
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,720
If you were guilty,

92
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,240
you wouldn't have come

93
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,400
under my control without resisting.

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,440
After all,

95
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
my men cannot beat you.

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Thank you for your trust.

97
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,000
Xiao.

98
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,600
About escorting the goods,

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,080
who have you mentioned it to?

100
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,880
Only my wife Wanxiu knows.

101
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,240
I see.

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,720
I've always suspected that the warlord
let his adopted daughter marry you

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,960
to plant a spy in my house

104
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,240
to watch our family.

105
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,160
Now it seems

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,880
this pawn

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,520
has started to make a move.

108
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,120
Are you suspecting Wanxiu?

109
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,840
We drank together yesterday

110
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,520
and woke up this morning.

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,640
It can't be her.

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,960
Xiao.

113
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,200
You're just too gullible.

114
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
To be honest,

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,040
transporting goods

116
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,080
is actually a decoy for my actual plan.

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,280
If you are not a spy,

118
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,320
the only person
who knows the delivery details

119
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,600
will be your wife,

120
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,640
Lin Wanxiu.

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,200
No.

122
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,080
It can't be her.

123
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,480
Even if she wasn't the assassin
last night,

124
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,680
she is suspected
of signaling Warlord Li.

125
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,120
Furthermore,

126
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,000
before Qian Dahai
and Sun Huzi were killed,

127
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
someone saw her

128
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
near the scene.

129
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,600
You tell me.

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,720
How could there be such a coincidence?

131
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,840
Therefore,

132
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,600
whether your wife is a spy

133
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,200
or not,

134
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,040
you'd better think it over carefully.

135
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,320
Mr. Feng.

136
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,160
Are you really going to do this?

137
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,919
I do not want

138
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,200
to believe
that this matter is related to Wanxiu.

139
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,919
But all the clues point to her.

140
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,440
And it makes me suspect her.

141
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,720
I hope you understand

142
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,559
that trust is a foundation

143
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,320
between husband and wife.

144
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,600
If you start investigating this matter,

145
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,520
the relationship between you two

146
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,040
will definitely not return
to how it was before.

147
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
I just want the truth.

148
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,080
Fine.

149
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400
In that case,

150
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,800
I respect your choice.

151
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,720
I took it out of your wound.

152
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,360
I've checked.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
After Lu Hang died,

154
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
his wife and daughters were taken
into Warlord Li's house.

155
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,600
It means

156
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,640
the person protecting Lu Hang

157
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,760
was sent by Warlord Li,

158
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,880
the same person
who attacked the Feng Family's shop.

159
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,640
When you're home,

160
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,880
put this dart

161
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,560
in where Lin Wanxiu can see it.

162
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,400
If she truly knows nothing,

163
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,160
she will surely tell the truth

164
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,880
when you ask her about the dart.

165
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,040
But if she knows the assassin,

166
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,560
she will certainly hide something
from you.

167
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,000
Then you will know if she's suspicious.

168
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,600
Mr. Feng.

169
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,800
I remind you one last time.

170
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,000
Once you start this,

171
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,240
there's no turning back.

172
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,800
(Ximei is so careless.)

173
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,840
(How could she carelessly
leave it here?)

174
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,920
(I have to blame her for this.)

175
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,440
Honey.

176
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,000
It's time to eat.
