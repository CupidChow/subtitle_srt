=Episode 15=

3
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,120
Honey.

4
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,960
Honey.

5
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,480
What are you looking for?

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,000
Well...

7
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,720
I borrowed a little gadget

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,920
from Mr. Lin.

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,360
I forgot where it is.

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,560
Honey.

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,120
Have you seen anything strange?

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,720
No, I haven't.

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,880
Honey.

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,200
You always leave things everywhere.

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,400
Don't worry.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,560
If I find it,

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,200
I'll tell you.

18
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,800
Let's eat.

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,600
It's getting cold.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,720
Come on.

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,240
Honey.

22
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,080
Is the food good today?

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,280
Yes.

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
Eat more.

25
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,880
Come on.

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,720
Father.

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
You were right.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,120
Lin Wanxiu is indeed working
for Warlord Li.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
I was so stupid

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,240
that I found her true colors
until today.

31
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,440
It's not too late

32
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,160
to make up for it.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,080
However,

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,640
the fierce battle
between Warlord Li and us

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,080
is now inevitable.

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,840
I'm sorry
I didn't discover her identity in time,

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,240
causing us

38
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,040
to suffer a great loss.

39
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,400
I'm willing to be punished.

40
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,560
You didn't know her identity.

41
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,680
Get up.

42
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,480
I am just worried.

43
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,960
Now that Lin Wanxiu's identity
is exposed,

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,800
Warlord Li might become desperate

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,800
and directly target us.

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,240
Once they seize the initiative,

47
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,120
it will be disadvantageous

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,960
for us.

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
So you mean...?

50
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,440
Instead of sitting by passively,

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,880
it's better to take the initiative.

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,720
What do you need me to do?

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
The heads
of the warlord's intelligence agency

54
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,360
are Mr. Huang and Ms. Yu.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,320
They have worked
for Warlord Li for many years.

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
His right arm and his left.

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,280
They are wise

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,920
martial arts masters.

59
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,640
With these two around,

60
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,680
our family cannot hide anything

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,520
from Warlord Li.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,160
If we want to contend with Warlord Li,

63
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,520
we must get rid of both of them.

64
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
I'll carry out the order.

65
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,680
When I saw Feng Xiao,

66
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:21,640
I felt

67
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,880
that he and Mr. Zheng

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,880
looked alike.

69
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,120
After investigation,

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,800
I found
when Mr. Zheng's family was killed,

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
a male infant survived and was missing.

72
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,520
Do you think

73
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Feng Xiao could be the missing child?

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,680
Feng Xiao is kind-hearted,

75
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,320
unlike the Feng Family members.

76
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,280
If he is Mr. Zheng's son,

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
I should promptly ask Warlord Li

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,640
to help him leave the Feng Family

79
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
in case he's used by them.

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,400
What's going on?

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,080
A tree fell ahead.

82
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,040
The road is blocked.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,840
You handle it.

84
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,960
We have important things
to tell Warlord Li.

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,600
Yes.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,960
Greetings.

87
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,360
I should have come
to visit you both earlier.

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,200
Unfortunately, I have been busy

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,560
without finding the time.

90
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,080
Please forgive me, Mr. Lin, Mrs. Lin.

91
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,280
It's you.

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,280
Feng Xiao.

93
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
Mr. Huang.

94
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
Mr. Huang.

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,720
Feng Xiao is kind-hearted,

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,520
unlike the Feng Family members.

97
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,560
If he is Mr. Zheng's son,

98
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,520
I should promptly ask Warlord Li

99
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,080
to help him leave the Feng Family

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,440
in case he's used by them.

101
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,320
Mr. Huang.

102
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,520
Why?

103
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
Why?

104
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,520
Why did you do this?

105
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,520
I did it for my family.

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
I advise you to stop.

107
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,680
Do not help bad people.

108
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,000
Otherwise,

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,120
you will regret it sooner or later.

110
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,120
Wanxiu.

111
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,600
Ximei.

112
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
Have you seen Feng Xiao?

113
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
No, I haven't.

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
Where has he gone?

115
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
He wasn't back last night.

116
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,520
Wanxiu.

117
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Don't worry.

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,080
Perhaps he went to Lin Jingshu

119
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,960
and drank with him.

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,760
I'm very restless.

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm worried that something happened.

122
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,000
Wanxiu.

123
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't scare yourself.

124
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,400
Feng Xiao is fine.

125
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,360
I hope so.

126
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,920
Why are you so careless?

127
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,760
You left such a crucial thing
lying about.

128
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,280
If Feng Xiao finds this,

129
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,160
it will be awful.

130
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:57,920
No.

131
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,600
Wanxiu.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,760
I've taken good care of all your stuff.

133
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,320
How could I leave it everywhere?

134
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Well...

135
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,520
You come with me.

136
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,440
Look.

137
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,880
It's all here.

138
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,480
What about this one?

139
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,440
Oh, no.

140
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,680
Feng Xiao must have
found our identities.

141
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,920
It's a parting whistle.

142
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,960
It means someone died.

143
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,920
Ms. Yu.

144
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,640
Mr. Huang.

145
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,160
Wanxiu.

146
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,240
Try it.

147
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Does it taste good?

148
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,000
I let you learn to read or write.

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,000
But you only draw.

150
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,320
Stop yelling.

151
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,720
How dare you.

152
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,640
Stop.

153
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,200
It's all my fault.

154
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,600
Wanxiu is back.

155
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,920
You've grown up.

156
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,760
I missed you so much.

157
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,000
Well done.

158
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,040
Go on.

159
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,560
Go on?

160
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,040
Keep practicing.

161
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,280
Who did this?

162
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,800
The Feng Family.

163
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,280
If so,

164
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,280
why not send troops to annihilate them

165
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
to avenge Ms. Yu and Mr. Huang.

166
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,720
The Feng Family is now seen
as righteous merchants by the people.

167
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,200
If we send troops rashly,

168
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,360
the public's anger will be aroused.

169
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,760
If there's a mutiny,

170
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,400
it will cause even more trouble.

171
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Do you know

172
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
who killed the two of them?
