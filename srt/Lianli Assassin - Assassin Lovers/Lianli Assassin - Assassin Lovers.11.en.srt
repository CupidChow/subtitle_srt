2
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,768
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,880
People are twice
as homesick at the festival.

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,520
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,320
We sit together,

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,640
admiring the moon and drinking wine.

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,040
It's really good.

8
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,640
Honey.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,120
I learned some new dishes.

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:01,960
Try them.

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,960
See if you like them.

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,400
Honey.

13
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,280
During the festival,

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,280
why not dine out at a restaurant?

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,360
Exactly.

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,920
Eating at home

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
is not necessary.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,840
How could they be the same?

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,040
Eating at home is better.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,120
We can eat

21
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,200
while admiring the moon.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,800
How romantic!

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,480
Yeah.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
But,

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,720
these

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,480
dishes...

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
What do you mean?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,640
Are you saying I'm a bad cook?

29
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,400
How could that be?

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,680
The dishes you made

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,800
are better than anyone else's.

32
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,120
Honey.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,520
Look at this one.

34
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
I cooked it especially for you.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
It's made with lotus roots and lilies,

36
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,800
along with other ingredients.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,440
I call it "A Perfect Match."

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,000
Try it.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,080
You cooked it for me.

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,920
I must try it.

41
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,360
Honey, you cooked it?

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,800
Yeah.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,840
Eat slowly.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,040
Your cooking skills improve so swiftly.

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,400
That's right.

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
To cook a dish you might like,

47
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,120
she practices secretly every day.

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,840
She even cut her finger several times.

49
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,680
Finger?

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,720
Let me see.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,600
Where?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,720
Show me.

53
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,880
Honey, thank you.

54
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,000
Honey.

55
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,720
As long as it's for you,

56
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm willing to do everything.

57
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,200
Let's eat.

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,840
Honey, you must be tired.

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,520
Here.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,680
Eat more.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,720
Eat more.

62
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,760
Thank you, honey.

63
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,920
Here.

64
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,040
Eat this.

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,720
Honey.

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,880
What's wrong?

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,280
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,400
I want to go back to see my parents

69
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,840
and bring them some mooncakes

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,840
as a present.

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:39,840
Good.

72
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,840
Then I'll pay a visit
to my foster father.

73
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
How about

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,280
we visit our families separately

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,480
and go to the fair

76
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,400
after we get back?

77
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,160
Is that okay?

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes.

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
You decide.

80
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,200
Brother.

81
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,840
Don't keep looking over there.

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,440
Look at my dress.

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,160
Familiar?

84
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,000
It's the dress I bought you last month.

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,120
It suits you well.

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,080
It gets wrinkled.

87
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,360
I'll buy you a new one.

88
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,000
I want one.

89
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,840
I'll get you one.

90
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,800
Don't worry.

91
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,400
No big deal.

92
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,360
- Are you drunk?
- Later,

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,560
have a few more drinks.

94
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,880
Uncle.

95
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,680
Feng Xiao.

96
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,480
Good to see you.

97
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,360
At home, I'm your uncle.

98
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Outside,

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,760
I'm your brother.

100
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,360
I don't dare.

101
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,200
You are...

102
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,640
Why don't you celebrate with your wife?

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,840
What are you doing here?

104
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
I'm going to visit my foster father

105
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,400
and bring him a present.

106
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,920
Terrible timing.

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
He went out of town to buy goods.

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
He'll be back in three to five days.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,480
If so,

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,120
Uncle,

111
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,960
please bring back the present.

112
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,920
When he gets back,

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,840
I'll visit him then.

114
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,320
You're such a good son.

115
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,640
I'll bring it back.

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Goodbye.

117
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,120
Let's go.

118
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,280
Walnuts, peanuts,

119
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,120
and all kinds of mountain products.

120
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,400
Come take a look.

121
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,560
(She wanted to bring them mooncakes.)

122
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
(Why is she empty-handed?)

123
00:06:07,104 --> 00:06:08,608
(Zhou's Residence)

124
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,560
Hello.

125
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,640
May I ask

126
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,200
is Mr. Lin at home?

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,160
There's no such person.

128
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,160
Then who is the owner of this house?

129
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,760
It's me.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,120
My surname is Zhou.

131
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,200
Not Lin.

132
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,520
But when I came here not long ago,

133
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,760
this was Lin's Residence.

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,120
You must be referring to

135
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,760
the person who paid a lot
to rent my house a while ago.

136
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,720
- Rent?
- What about it?

137
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,640
Who rented it?

138
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,080
They were in military uniforms.

139
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,120
As for what they rented it for,

140
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,480
I didn't dare to ask.

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,600
What's the matter?

142
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,120
It's okay.

143
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,040
Thank you.

144
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,680
Honey.

145
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm home.

146
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,120
You're back.

147
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,280
Let's go.

148
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,840
Go to the fair.

149
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,840
Were your parents happy?

150
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,680
Yes.

151
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,840
They were asking about you.

152
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,560
Lin Wanxiu.

153
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
How long will you keep lying to me?

154
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,840
What's wrong?

155
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,760
You said you wanted to see your parents.

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
But you entered
the Warlord Li's Residence.

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
Lin Wanxiu.

158
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
I trusted you so much.

159
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,120
But you've been lying to me.

160
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,320
You followed me?

161
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,320
Of course I did.

162
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,880
How long will you keep lying to me?

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,760
Honey.

164
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
I can explain that.

165
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,200
I don't want to listen.

166
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,360
I only believe what I saw with my eyes.

167
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,040
Oh, right.

168
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,920
I went to see your parents.

169
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,600
Guess what?

170
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,960
You must know what happened.

171
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,840
I just want to know

172
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,840
which word you said is true.

173
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,760
Wanxiu.

174
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,200
What did Warlord Li say?

175
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,280
Did he agree?

176
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
Wanxiu.

177
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,600
Feng Xiao.

178
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,240
What happened?
