00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:40,608
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,640
How can this be?

4
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,840
Who did it?

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,640
No one saw what the killer looked like.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,640
He got shot to death from afar.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,960
Again?

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,560
Shen Wei.

9
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,400
Qian Dahai.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Even Sun Huzi was killed.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,480
Buxiu.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,920
There's one more thing.
Not sure if I should tell you.

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,000
Go ahead.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,240
Near the crime scene,

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,680
someone saw Feng Xiao's wife,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Lin Wanxiu.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,480
Her again?

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,800
When Qian Dahai was killed,

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,800
someone saw her appear nearby as well.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,840
It could've been a coincidence.

21
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,040
But twice?

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,840
It's a bit too...

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,840
I've always felt

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,760
it was unusual that the foster daughter

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,040
of Warlord Li married into our family.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,040
Buxiu.

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,440
Be careful. She might cause us trouble.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,040
Buxiu.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,640
I don't mean to smear Feng Xiao.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,560
Such big incidents have occurred.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,840
He hasn't reported any of them to you.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
I think

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,240
it's necessary to verify

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,760
which side he's really on.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,080
What do you think?

36
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,640
Buxiu.

37
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,120
Get the word out.

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,640
Feng's Pawn Shop is going to

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,480
transfer a batch of important goods

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,680
to a branch in another city.

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,800
Make sure Warlord Li knows it.

42
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,040
I get it, Buxiu.

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,080
I'll do it right away.

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,039
Report, sir.

45
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,720
Come in.

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,880
Warlord Li.

47
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
Sun Jiyuan was shot to death.

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,960
Well done.

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
Now those who sold goods

50
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,960
for the Feng Family
in Yue City have all died.

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
They must be in great turmoil.

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
I'd like to see

53
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
what tricks they still have.

54
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,560
Report, sir.

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,600
Come in.

56
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,600
Warlord Li.

57
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,040
We intercepted a message.

58
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,680
Feng's Pawn Shop will transfer
a batch of important goods

59
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,080
to a branch in another city.

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,600
Okay, I see.

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,840
You may leave.

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,240
Yes, sir.

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,320
Wanxiu.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,640
We must make every effort

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
(Map of Yue City)
to know the time and the place.

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,120
We must catch them red-handed.

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,240
Yes, sir.

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,280
Father.

69
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,680
Xiao.

70
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,720
Come here.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,160
Look.

72
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,760
Luohe.

73
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,200
Shiling.

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,360
Longshan.

75
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,680
Which city would be the best choice

76
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,280
to transfer our goods to?

77
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,720
I wonder why you want to
transfer these goods.

78
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
Warlord Li wants to make more money.

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,600
They procured arms
and expanded their influence.

80
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,840
They want to get merchants' properties.

81
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,760
Shen Wei, Qian Dahai, and Sun Huzi
have been killed.

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,680
Next,

83
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,520
I'm afraid they'll target us.

84
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
We old people don't fear death.

85
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,600
But the Feng Family's properties

86
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,760
mustn't be a tool for inciting wars

87
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,760
and causing suffering to the people.

88
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I get it, Father.

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,360
I suggest

90
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
we transfer goods to Luohe.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,760
Why?

92
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,800
The Luohe branch is close to
the local police station.

93
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,880
If they want to rob us,

94
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,040
they must have concerns.

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Next, the Luohe branch
is near the Liang River.

96
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,040
If we're in danger,
we can transfer goods by water.

97
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,480
The bottom line is,

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,960
it's closest to Yue City.

99
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
At most half a day's journey.

100
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,520
It could reduce the risk
of the goods being robbed.

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,400
Good.

102
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,440
I'll listen to you.

103
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,480
I want you to transfer them

104
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,680
and ensure their safety.

105
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,240
Father, rest assured.

106
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,040
I will complete the task.

107
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,880
Honey.

108
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Honey.

109
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
Where are you going?

110
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,640
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,400
I've got something to do today.

112
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,280
I must do it.

113
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,640
I'm afraid I won't be able to
have dinner with you.

114
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
I've prepared the meal.

115
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,560
It's classified information.

116
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
I can't tell you.

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
Don't you trust me?

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,920
Yes.

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,400
Then why can't you tell me?

120
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
Honey, don't be mad.

121
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
I'll tell you.

122
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,200
The Feng Family is going to
transfer important goods

123
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,840
to the Luohe branch today.

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,880
Therefore,

125
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,680
as the son,

126
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,480
I should take the responsibility.

127
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:44,880
Right?

128
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Don't be mad.

129
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,640
Right.

130
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,400
You should go.

131
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,840
But you have to eat something first.

132
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,480
I...

133
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,440
Ximei's cousin

134
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,800
brought a bottle of wine today.

135
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,440
I'll bring it here. Try it.

136
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,320
Just a sec.

137
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,760
Honey.

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
Honey.

139
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,360
This is our first time drinking.

140
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,440
Thank you.

141
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,920
A toast to you.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
I wish you success.

143
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Drink a little more.

144
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,360
Wanxiu. Feng Xiao.

145
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,680
How much have you drunk?

146
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,240
Feng Xiao.

147
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,680
Feng Xiao.

148
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Wanxiu.

149
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,600
I didn't expect

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,520
that the sleeping powder

151
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,160
would be so powerful.

152
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,200
Keep an eye on him.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
I'll go get changed.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,560
Rest assured.

155
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
Did anything happen?

156
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,120
Don't worry.

157
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,240
He's sleeping tightly.

158
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,919
Honey.

159
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,200
I can't let you wade into this mess.

160
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,320
Keep an eye on him.

161
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,320
I'll be right back.

162
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,840
You also need to be careful.

163
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,328
(Feng's Pawn Shop)

164
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
Mr. Feng was always punctual before.

165
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,440
What happened today?

166
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,680
I drank too much water.

167
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm going to take a piss.

168
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,880
Hurry up.

169
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,600
He goofs around all day long.

170
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,120
Master Feng said

171
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,400
whoever captures him alive

172
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,840
will get a hundred silver coins.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,720
Go!
