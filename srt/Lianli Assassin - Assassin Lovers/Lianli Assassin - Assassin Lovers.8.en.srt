=Episode 8=

3
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,360
I failed to protect the Lu Family.

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,320
It was my negligence.

5
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,440
Please punish me.

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,280
He can kill people you protected.

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,880
He's really something!

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,200
How's your injury?

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,000
No big deal.

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,560
Go treat your wounds.

11
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,240
About your injury,

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,840
don't let anyone
in the Feng Family know it.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,560
You must be very careful.

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,720
Yes.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,640
You can go now.

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,280
Feng Xiao.

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,360
You're injured.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,840
- I'm fine.
- Come in.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,280
Don't wake the servants.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,320
Has Feng Xiao returned?

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,240
Not yet.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Help me with it.

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay.

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
You're lucky to have worn a soft armor.

25
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,280
It took a hit for you.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,920
And this dart isn't poisoned.

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
Otherwise, we'd only be brothers
in the next life.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,360
You got injured

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,120
for the first time, right?

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,120
I didn't expect

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,560
that there'd be someone
who could hurt you in this world.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
That person used a long sword.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,280
It was extremely fast.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,200
I couldn't tell where it came from.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,120
(So fast.)

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,680
(He must be the one
who stabbed the guard.)

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,680
(But he could've taken Lu Hang's life.)

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,440
(Why did he suddenly stop?)

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,640
(Because he didn't want to
hurt the innocent?)

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
(How could that be possible?)

41
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,160
I feel

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,560
he wasn't at full strength.

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,040
Even so,

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,080
he had many chances to kill me.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,360
Are you mocking me?

46
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:46,960
No.

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm just curious to know

48
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,600
what kind of person hurt you like this.

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,320
Not Lu Hang, right?

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,920
I don't want to admit it,

51
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,800
but that person was good at shooting

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,960
and using hidden weapons.

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,520
(Who is this person?)

54
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
(So good at shooting.)

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,080
(This person figured it out every time)

56
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,960
(and successfully stopped me.)

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,280
If that person

58
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,880
tried to kill me back then,

59
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,640
I might have died.

60
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,360
Lu!

61
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,600
Help me find the owner of this dart.

62
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
I'll pay in silver coins.

63
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,520
Oh, right.

64
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,000
When you have time,

65
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,160
ask Mr. Huang and Ms. Yu

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
to help me investigate

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,880
who this person is.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,600
Come on.

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
Even you are no match.

70
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
Then if I go,

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,960
I'll be killed.

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Besides,

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,680
even if I love money,

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,440
I have to be alive first.

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,160
Well then,

76
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,800
help me find an excuse for my injury.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:56,840
I don't want

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,200
Wanxiu to worry.

79
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,200
Also,

80
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
help me figure out

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,640
how to explain it to Feng Xiao

82
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,280
about my wounds.

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,840
Okay.

84
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:05,840
No problem.

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,080
Honey.

86
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,760
Mrs. Feng.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,440
Honey.

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,000
You're back.

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,360
What's wrong?

90
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,680
Mrs. Feng.

91
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,520
It's because

92
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,640
Mr. Feng and I drank too much
at the tavern last night.

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,800
He fell down the stairs by accident

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,840
and got injured.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Let me see.

96
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
But it's not serious.

97
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,120
We've seen a physician.

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:04:59,960
He's fine.

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,000
A minor injury.

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,920
It's not serious.

101
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,920
How could you be so careless?

102
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll be fine in a few days.

103
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:06,960
It's okay.

104
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,120
Honey.

105
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,000
What's wrong?

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
Not feeling well?

107
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,560
Feng Xiao, I'm sorry.

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
After I got back,

109
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,640
I wanted to cook for my uncle and aunt.

110
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
I almost scalded myself.

111
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
She wanted to protect me.

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
As a result...

113
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
She got hurt while protecting me.

114
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Thankfully, the physician said
it was fine.

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
How could you be so careless?

116
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
It worries me.

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,480
And you.

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,160
What were you doing?

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
She got hurt for you.

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,760
It's all my fault.

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,800
I didn't take good care of her.

122
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,120
It's okay, honey.

123
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,440
Don't blame Ximei.

124
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,400
It's not her fault.

125
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,920
Why didn't you take care of him?

126
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,880
I'm not against him going out drinking.

127
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
But why did you let him drink too much?

128
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,080
He even fell down the stairs.

129
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,120
How can I ever

130
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,400
let him go out with you?

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,840
Yes.

132
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,040
You're right.

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,160
It's all my fault.

134
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,920
I didn't take good care of him.

135
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,040
It's not his fault.

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,320
I wanted to drink more.

137
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,640
I shouldn't make you worry.

139
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
Remember to be careful in the future.

140
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,440
You too.

141
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,680
Otherwise,

142
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,760
once you're hurt,

143
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
my heart aches.

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,480
- Does it hurt?
- You?

145
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,480
We shouldn't stay here.

146
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,960
I feel the same.

147
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,600
How about

148
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,200
we go for a walk?

149
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,560
Let's go eat now,

150
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,160
okay?

151
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,640
Let's go.

152
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,960
It's okay.

153
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,520
The coffee here is really good.

154
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,880
Try it and see how it tastes.

155
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,000
This coffee is a bit bitter.

156
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,240
It's made from the finest

157
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,640
Italian blended coffee beans.

158
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
They were perfectly roasted

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,160
and then brewed with 85-degree water.

160
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,080
Therefore, it has a rich taste

161
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,080
and a long finish.

162
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,080
I didn't expect

163
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,800
you know so much about coffee.

164
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,880
I learned it
when my sister and I were abroad.

165
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Miss Hu,

166
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,600
I think

167
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,720
sometimes coffee is like people.

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,320
Look.

169
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,080
The dark color

170
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,480
seems melancholy and solitary.

171
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,120
Like someone
who's seen a great deal of life

172
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,880
and understood everything.

173
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,600
It's almost identical.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
Sometimes coffee

175
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,600
also contains many different flavors.

176
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
When facing someone it loves,

177
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,480
it can change itself infinitely.

178
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,600
Elusive and unfathomable.

179
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,200
Do you think I'm right,

180
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,200
Miss Hu?

181
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,160
You compare coffee to people.

182
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
It's impressive.

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,200
Are you implying

184
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,680
that you are such a person?

185
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,600
No, I'm not.

186
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,600
I actually think that you

187
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,800
and the coffee

188
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,200
have some similarities.

189
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,720
You think too highly of me.

190
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,320
I'm at most a cup of plain water.

191
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,680
Bland and tasteless.

192
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,400
You are too modest.

193
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,520
Oh, right.

194
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,920
Back then

195
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,360
you went abroad with Lin Wanxiu.

196
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes.

197
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
I went with my sister.

198
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,200
You went abroad with her

199
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,400
and take care of her now.

200
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,640
It seems that you and your sister

201
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,200
are really close to each other.

202
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
We're cousins,

203
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,840
but we're even closer than sisters.

204
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,040
However,

205
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
if that's the case,

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,400
you two are so close,

207
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,360
then why has Lin Wanxiu

208
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,240
never mentioned you

209
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
in front of others?

210
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
(Smart move, Lin Jingshu.)

211
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,039
(You beat around the bush to test me.)

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,840
When my sister is with Mr. Feng,

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,280
they only care about each other.

214
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,480
How can she think of me?

215
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,560
Otherwise,

216
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
we wouldn't be sitting here now.

217
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
That's true.

218
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,680
I've heard a lot about Feng Xiao
being a womanizer

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,680
and being dissolute.

220
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,640
He often went to nightclubs.

221
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,040
But my sister always told me

222
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,560
he was misunderstood.

223
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,600
As his close friend,

224
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
in your opinion,

225
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,440
what kind of person Feng Xiao is?

226
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,920
I think,

227
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,160
Miss Hu,

228
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,880
you can trust her judgment.

229
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,840
But

230
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
there's no smoke without fire.

231
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,200
Why do people
misunderstand him that much?

232
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,440
Even if Feng Xiao is magnanimous

233
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,760
and ignores them,

234
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,760
as his close friend,

235
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,560
shouldn't you defend him?

236
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,960
(What a clever girl!)

237
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,400
(She's implying)

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,200
(I don't care about his reputation.)

239
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,360
(She's quick-witted.)

240
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,360
(She's not a normal girl.)

241
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
If we have a clear conscience,

242
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,960
why bother caring about that?

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,400
Mr. Feng and I

244
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
as well as your sister

245
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,280
all understand this.

246
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
Miss Hu, why do you

247
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
care about what they said?

248
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,360
It seems I have been petty.

249
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
Thanks for reminding me.

250
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,880
It's inspiring.
