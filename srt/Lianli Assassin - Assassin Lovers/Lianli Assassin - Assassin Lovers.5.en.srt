3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,880
If you

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,120
finish this wine,

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,240
the money is all yours.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,720
Is that okay?

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,320
Wanxiu.

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,800
Feng Xiao hasn't come back yet.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
Maybe you shouldn't wait.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Go to sleep.

11
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,800
How can I sleep if he doesn't come back?

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,200
Wanxiu.

13
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,640
Since you met Feng Xiao,

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,840
you've changed completely.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,640
You used to be so carefree.

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,280
But now,

17
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,240
you're always worried about him.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
That's because you haven't met someone

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,160
worth your love.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Once you meet him,

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
you will understand me.

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,800
I'll see if it happens.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,880
Oh, right, Wanxiu.

24
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,320
How did you meet Feng Xiao?

25
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,440
I remember I was on a mission

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,920
when I met him for the first time.

27
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,840
You are the notorious burglars,

28
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,280
Three Worms of the Shi Family?

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,360
Nonsense!

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,000
We are the Three Dragons
of the Shi Family.

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,560
Young lady.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,240
Are you looking for me?

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,480
Do you want to have fun with me?

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
You are so tough.

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,680
Stop!

36
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,720
Let go of that girl.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Who do you think you are?

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
Where are you from?

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,200
Buddies.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,320
Beat him up.

41
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,680
Stop.

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
That's it?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,720
Wanxiu.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,360
You're too gullible.

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,440
Isn't he just a reckless young fool?

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
Stop it.

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,120
You're so ignorant.

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
True courage is not

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,200
about being unbeatable,

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
but about trying to protect those

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,600
you want to protect

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,320
even if you know you'll get hurt.

53
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
From that moment on,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
I made up my mind

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,600
to protect Feng Xiao.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,160
After all, I rarely saw people

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,680
like him now.

58
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,000
Drink to your heart's content.

59
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,600
Maybe someday

60
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
you want to drink,

61
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,680
but you can't.

62
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,016
(Butler of the Qian Family)

63
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,040
Who is it

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,080
at this hour of night?

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,800
Open the door.

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,440
Hurry up.

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,320
Open the door.

68
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,120
(Lu Hang, accountant of the Qian family)
- What's going on? - Don't ask.

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,760
Take the kid, pack your stuff,
and go with me.

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,024
Where are we going?

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,920
You go first.

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,240
We'll hold him off.

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:03:59,880
Come on.

74
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,000
Go.

75
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,720
Mom.

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,440
I can't run.

77
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,760
Are you okay?

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,360
You have to run.

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,000
If he catches up, we will die.

80
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,520
Who have you offended?

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,880
I'll explain it to you later.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Get up. Let's run quickly.

83
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't kill my dad.

84
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,360
Sir.

85
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,720
The things Qian Dahai has done

86
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,880
really have nothing to do with me.

87
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,520
Don't be afraid.

88
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,160
I...

89
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,160
I'm just an ordinary accountant

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
and know nothing but bookkeeping.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
I beg you.

92
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,480
I have a family to take care of.

93
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,240
Please spare my family.

94
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,200
Are you sure
you haven't done anything bad?

95
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Yes.

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,200
If I ever did something
against my conscience,

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,120
I may get struck by lightening

98
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,600
and get killed.

99
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
You're awake, Mr. Feng.

100
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,240
Mr. Feng.

101
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,280
How did you sleep last night?

102
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,520
It's alright.

103
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
The bed is too hard.

104
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,840
Really?

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't think so.

106
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,720
You drank too much last night.

107
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
The hangover soup is ready for you.

108
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,320
I bet that after you have it,

109
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,040
you'll feel better right away.

110
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,560
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

111
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,280
Mr. Feng.

112
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,680
Come again.

113
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,280
Huangying's belly upset me.

114
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,040
You're back.

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,880
Tell me.

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Did you not sleep all night?

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
I couldn't sleep without you.

118
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,320
Come on.

119
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,920
Sit.

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,560
I took care of something for my father.

121
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
No need to worry about me.

122
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,280
But I'm worried.

123
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,480
You didn't come back,

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,680
so I was worried about you.

125
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,560
(I can't let her be worried.)

126
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,120
(It seems I have to)

127
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,320
(tell her the truth later.)

128
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,400
Alright.

129
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,800
I'm back.

130
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,560
Don't worry.

131
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,000
Did things go smoothly last night?

132
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,360
What's wrong?

133
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,120
Well,

134
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,600
if you did something wrong

135
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
out of good intentions,

136
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,280
what would you do?

137
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
If it happened to me,

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,360
I would try to make up for it

139
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,000
as long as the intentions were good.

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,800
What's wrong?

141
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
Did I say something wrong?

142
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,960
No.

143
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,720
You're absolutely right.

144
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,120
I know what to do now.

145
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,600
Thank you.

146
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:02,920
Honey.

147
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
You've been out all night.

148
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,520
You have a sweaty smell.

149
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,800
Take it off, and I'll wash it.

150
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,160
You've been up all night.

151
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,480
Let's go to sleep.

152
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,600
The laundress will wash the clothes.

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,920
I'll do it.

154
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,600
How can I let them
wash my husband's clothes?

155
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,600
Anyway,

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
I'm not sleepy right now.

157
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,280
I'll do it.
