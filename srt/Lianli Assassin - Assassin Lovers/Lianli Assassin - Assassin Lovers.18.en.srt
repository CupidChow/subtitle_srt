=Episode 18=

3
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,720
The next time I see you,

4
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,040
I will show no mercy.

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,080
Wanxiu.

6
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,280
Wanxiu.

7
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,720
Wanxiu.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
Are you alright?

9
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,720
I'm fine.

10
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,480
Its flower language is,

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,560
"May us be together

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,080
for a lifetime."

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,720
Let's plant a lot.

14
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,200
A lifetime is not enough.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,360
I hope

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,840
to always stay
by your side forever and ever.

17
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,240
I've never seen
Wanxiu so heartbroken before.

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,720
I haven't seen it either.

19
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,960
I've never seen Mr. Feng

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,400
so drunk.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,480
How about

22
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,840
persuading him?

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,680
It's no use.

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,280
I have said all that needs to be said.

25
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,120
It's useless.

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,360
How about

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,720
persuading Lin Wanxiu?

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,640
Come on.

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,480
I can't even mention him
in front of her now.

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,480
Do you think

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
they will go back to how it was before?

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,480
Sir,

33
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,360
check.

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,160
Coming!

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,400
Sir, take another look.

36
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,800
Sorry, sir.

37
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,600
Are you okay?

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,160
Yeah.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,960
Watch it.

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,280
Stop!

41
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't you see me?

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,000
What did you steal?

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,080
Hand it over!

44
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't chase

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,520
him.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Thank you, sir.

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,280
Step aside.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,720
Stop!

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
Hand over his wallet.

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,400
What?

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,080
When we get physical,

52
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,400
you run away.

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll hold them off.

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,040
You

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,200
protect me?

56
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,560
I know

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,680
I'm no match for them.

58
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,040
But it's better
than both of us getting beat up.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,600
Run now.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
True courage is not

61
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
about being unbeatable,

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,000
but about trying to protect those

63
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,440
you want to protect

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,200
even if you know you'll get hurt.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,120
(When you meet)

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
(someone who would risk it all for you,)

67
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,760
(you may understand.)

68
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,040
Run now.

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,600
Get lost.

70
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,320
Yes.

71
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,520
Let's go.

72
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,680
Wanxiu,

73
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,960
are you blaming me in your heart

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
for making you marry him?

75
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,480
If I had known
it would end up like this today,

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,080
I would never have made that decision.

77
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,400
It was my fault.

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
I failed to keep my promise

79
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
and fell for the enemy.

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
I know you well.

81
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,080
If Feng Xiao
were an utterly villainous man,

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,440
you'd never develop feelings for him.

83
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,640
Perhaps he was

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,040
just being used by his family,

85
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,040
and that's why he did
wrong things against his will.

86
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
If

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,760
he comes to us

88
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,720
and cuts all ties with his family,

89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,520
I will forgive and forget

90
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,120
what he did

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,680
so that

92
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,160
you two will get back together.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,680
Thank you.

94
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,520
I will persuade Feng Xiao to come to us.

95
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,640
Go ahead.

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,960
If you had known this day,

97
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,320
you shouldn't have.

98
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,400
Love

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,440
truly causes no small harm.

100
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,440
Is Feng Xiao

101
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,640
here?

102
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,200
Please hand this letter over to him.

103
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,280
Make sure he reads it.

104
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,920
We should leave him alone for a while.

105
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,200
I don't want him

106
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
to get hurt again because of Lin Wanxiu.

107
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,760
Anyway, you got the letter.

108
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,560
It's up to you how to deal with it.

109
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,120
I just don't want to see my sister sad.

110
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:15,424
(To Feng Xiao)

111
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
Give me the letter.

112
00:07:56,992 --> 00:08:01,632
(See me at the pavilion outside the city
tomorrow at the hour of Shen.)

113
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,040
I know you would go.

114
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
I'd advise you not to go.

115
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,720
But I know

116
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,760
you would definitely go.

117
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
Then

118
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,200
just take care of yourself.

119
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,520
I remember you said

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,560
the day we saw each other again
would be my deathday.

121
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,680
Well.

122
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,080
You can't wait to take my life?

123
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,320
But here you are, aren't you?

124
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,320
Say it.

125
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,680
What's it?

126
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,320
Feng Xiao,

127
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
I know you.

128
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,080
You'd stop siding
with the Fengs after knowing

129
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
about what they did, right?

130
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,960
Warlord Li wants you
to sever your ties with them.

131
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,320
As long as you come to us,

132
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,800
he'll forget everything

133
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,600
you have done before.

134
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,840
Do you think I'd be a betrayer?

135
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,760
No, not a betrayer.

136
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,920
You're on the wrong side.

137
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,320
They are all evil.

138
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Feng Xiao,

139
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,160
I don't want you to make more mistakes.

140
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
Would you do it for me, please?

141
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
I will judge right from wrong myself.

142
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:36,960
If today,

143
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,480
you just came
to persuade me for Warlord Li,

144
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,000
don't waste your time.

145
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,480
Why are you so stubborn?

146
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm doing this for you.

147
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,520
Do you really think what the Feng Family

148
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,560
have done are right?

149
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,360
Don't waste your energy.

150
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,520
I will not betray my family.

151
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
And I stand against you and Warlord Li

152
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
irreconcilably.

153
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
Today, I will not kill you.

154
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,280
Please tell Warlord Li.

155
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,840
Sooner or later, I will take his head.

156
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,840
Feng Xiao.

157
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,400
You...

158
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,080
Lin Wanxiu.

159
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,400
You're still lying to me.

160
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,120
It wasn't me.

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
I don't know.

162
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Drop the act.

163
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,960
It's my fault.

164
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Even now, I still believe

165
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
you are different from Warlord Li!

166
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,720
Who asked you to come?

167
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,200
Now go away.

168
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,320
It was me.
