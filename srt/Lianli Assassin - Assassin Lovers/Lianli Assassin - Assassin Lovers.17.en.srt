=Episode 17=

3
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,560
Have you ever loved me?

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,840
Yes.

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,120
You mattered most to me.

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,480
And you?

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,440
Apart from the lies,

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
have you ever loved me?

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,120
Don't you know how much I love you?

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,000
No, I don't.

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,520
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,040
I just...

13
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Your injury

14
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
was not caused by a fall?

15
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,800
Your injury

16
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,960
is not a burn injury, either.

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,040
- You killed my uncle Buping?
- Yes.

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,360
He got what he deserved.

19
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,880
You killed Mr. Huang and Ms. Yu?

20
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,400
Yes.

21
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,400
They deserved to die.

22
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
You may leave.

23
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,920
I never want to see you again.

24
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
The next time I see you,

25
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,760
I will show no mercy.

26
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Today,

27
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,360
our ties are severed.

28
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
The day I see you again

29
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,680
is your deathday.

30
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,320
Mr. Feng, have a drink.

31
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,240
Have a drink.

32
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
Right, have a drink.

33
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,720
Are you unhappy, Mr. Feng?

34
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
You drank it up.

35
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,160
Impressive.

36
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,440
- What a great drinker!
- Fantastic.

37
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,640
Have another one.

38
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,880
Drink up.

39
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,280
Come on, another glass.

40
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,200
Drink.

41
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,600
Have one more.

42
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,080
Here's another for you, Mr. Feng.

43
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
Mr. Feng.

44
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,400
Have another drink.

45
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can drink a lot.

46
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
Mr. Feng, don't just drink hers.

47
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,720
Drink some of mine.

48
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,760
Today,

49
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,640
our ties are severed.

50
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,600
The day I see you again

51
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,000
is your deathday.

52
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Wanxiu has been practicing secretly

53
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,760
to make the food you like.

54
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,560
Her hands were cut several times.

55
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,760
Her hands?

56
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,760
Let me look.

57
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,920
Let me look.

58
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,080
Where?

59
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:56,800
Come on.

60
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,800
Mr. Feng.

61
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Mr. Feng, stop looking.

62
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,400
- Have another drink.
- Mr. Feng.

63
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,240
Drink.

64
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,680
What?

65
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,960
You are making fun of me.

66
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
You are making fun of me.

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,680
I'll get it on you.

68
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,920
I'll get it on you.

69
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,840
Honey.

70
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,000
You've finally returned.

71
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
Did you not sleep all night?

72
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,800
I couldn't sleep without you.

73
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,640
Mr. Feng, you're impressive.

74
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,080
Awesome.

75
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,960
Another one.

76
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,120
Mr. Feng,

77
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,120
let me serve you.

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,680
Mr. Feng.

79
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,400
Have a drink.

80
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,840
Mr. Feng, please take it slow.

81
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,880
Mr. Lin.

82
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,920
Is this the person you are here for?

83
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,480
Thank you.

84
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,600
You're welcome.

85
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,679
I'll do it.

86
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,799
Yes.

87
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,520
Mr. Feng.

88
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,680
Come on.

89
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,840
Why put yourself through this?

90
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,040
You may leave.

91
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,520
I never want to see you again.

92
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,360
The next time I see you,

93
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,440
I will show no mercy.

94
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,600
How?

95
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
You know it.

96
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,400
So when will you marry me?

97
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,280
Tonight.

98
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll tell my foster father

99
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,920
to pay a formal proposal visit.

100
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
The next time I see you,

101
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,000
I will show no mercy.
