You...

41
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,030
Who are you?

42
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,390
Who am I?

43
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,520
I've seen you before.

44
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,030
Are you the demonic hand
at the Sangbo lakebed?

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
I am called Shen Shu.

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,710
I wish to borrow your body

47
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,790
to nourish my severed arm.

48
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,760
I hope you can understand.

49
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,760
Why were you at the Sangbo lakebed?

50
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,710
Sangbo Lake?

51
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
Why was I sealed in Sangbo Lake?

52
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,880
Where did I come from?

53
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,030
Why am I here?

54
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,350
Who am I?

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,210
I can't remember.

56
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,560
In Sangbo Lake.

57
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,440
At the lakebed.

58
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,200
Why was I at Sangbo?

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,230
Where did I come from?

60
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,270
I...

61
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,470
I got off the point.

62
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,880
My primordial spirit is incomplete.

63
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,270
So, I can't remember
what happened in the past.

64
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,230
I only know my sacred title

65
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,960
but can't recall where I came from

66
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,030
or what happened before.

67
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,990
Master,

68
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,790
I have no grievance with you.

69
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,120
Why must you enter my body?

70
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,440
Someone

71
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,830
brought me to you.

72
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,640
Because we are the same kind of people.

73
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,520
Master, can you explain it more clearly?

74
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,080
I instinctively feel this way.

75
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,440
I can't remember

76
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,270
more than that.

77
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,560
Who brought you here, Master?

78
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,750
Follow me.

79
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,660
(Linyuan Pass)

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,340
(High with Moat)

81
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,470
That man in black

82
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,910
is the one who brought me here.

83
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,710
I once merged with him

84
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,270
and got this memory
from his primordial spirit.

85
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,520
Who is that man in black?

86
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,640
I don't know.

87
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,590
You merged with him

88
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,880
like you did with Heng Hui.

89
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,350
(The Sangbo Case)

90
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,620
(still has secrets behind it.)

91
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,030
(Could it be to merge with this demon?)

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,640
I am not a demon.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
I am called Shen Shu.

94
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,640
How can you hear what I'm thinking?

95
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,200
I have merged with you.

96
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,760
I know what you're thinking.

97
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,390
Nonsense.

98
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,280
Nine, eight.

99
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,310
One, two.

100
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,520
Two, zero.

101
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,390
3.14159265597.

102
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,150
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 4, 3, 2, 1.

103
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,080
Stop.

105
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't worry.

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,200
I won't harm you.

107
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,430
Yes,

108
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,390
I need to stay in your body for a while.

109
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,520
But your body

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,470
is much stronger than Heng Hui's.

111
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,560
I won't devour your energy
or kill the innocent.

112
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,680
I won't possess you

113
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,470
nor control you.

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,230
Fine, fine,

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,470
I get it.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,080
You're like the worm in my stomach.

117
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,440
You know everything I think.

118
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,470
In that case,

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,350
I'll stay here and recover.

120
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
Thank you, benefactor.

121
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,000
No, no, wait.

122
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,590
Master, I'm just a humble Guardian.

123
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,200
I can't help you with anything.

124
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,960
You might as well find another host.

125
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,830
No.

126
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,790
Your body

127
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,200
is very strong.

128
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,750
I feel very comfortable in your body.

129
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,110
Also, inside you, there is something

130
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,510
that can help me nourish my severed arm.

131
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,310
Something?

132
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,110
What thing?

133
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,960
I don't know.

134
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I only know

135
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,960
that thing

136
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,040
was not originally inside you.

137
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
Someone deliberately

138
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,680
put it there.

139
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,920
Well then.

140
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,080
Master, you can just
take that thing away.

141
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,510
- I absolutely won't...
- It's connected to you.

142
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,400
I don't know its origin,

143
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,350
and I can't take it away.

144
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,160
So, you're sticking to me now.

145
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,810
Besides using this place to recover,

146
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
there's one more thing

147
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,590
I need to ask you for.

148
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,110
Now you're going too far.

149
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,400
Help me search for the past

150
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,450
and recover my memories.

151
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,990
In the process,

152
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,710
I will give you some help.

153
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,710
Help?

154
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,560
There are few in this world

155
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,710
who can defeat me.

156
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,080
Those three Gold Gongs

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,300
and the sorcerer from the Bureau
were no match for me.

158
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,710
As long as I'm here,

159
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,590
it's like you have an extra trump card.

160
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,510
A cheat.

161
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,800
What cheat?

162
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,830
I am called Shen Shu.

163
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Cheat Shen Shu.

164
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,590
No.

165
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,680
Master Shen Shu.

166
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,230
Master Shen Shu,

167
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,110
from my observations,

168
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,080
I now know some things

169
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,870
about your origin.

170
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
What do you know?

171
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,710
You must be

172
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,630
from Tianyu.

173
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,350
How can you tell?

174
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,680
Your demeanor.

175
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
I see.

176
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,440
So, I am from Tianyu.

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,560
Good, good.

178
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,810
I'll rely on you in the future.

179
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,750
Please take care of me.

180
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,680
Of course.

181
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,500
(Tianyu)

182
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,110
The soup base from the Dafeng

183
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,350
is way better than our Tianyu's.

184
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,190
Come on.

185
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,350
Bro,

186
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,830
we're lucky today.

187
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,320
With that wild rabbit,

188
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,990
plus a marten,

189
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,190
it's enough to make a fur coat

190
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,320
for our younger brother.

191
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,380
I'll go up the mountain

192
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,830
and catch a snow deer

193
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,160
to make you one

194
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,040
for the winter.

195
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,400
Stop.

196
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,040
Where are your parents?

197
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,400
I don't know.

198
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,750
Don't know?

199
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,350
It's a hallucination.

200
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,830
Without this,

201
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,440
how could I see the true form
of Tianyu Dharma?

202
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,590
Reveal yourself.

203
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,390
Who are you?

204
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,580
(Du'e, Tianyu Prophet, 3rd Rank Vajra)
Why disturb us?

205
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,730
(Duku, Tianyu Prophet, 2nd Rank Arhat)
A Hypnotizer.

206
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,080
(3rd Rank Hypnotizer
from the Witcher's Sect)

207
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,470
Greetings, Prophets.

208
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,440
Sorry for my rudeness.

209
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,920
I came to deliver a message.

210
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,160
Shen Shu

211
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,590
has emerged.

212
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,820
(Xu Mansion)

213
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,440
(What to do?)

214
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,630
(Should I)

215
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,750
(report this?)

216
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,600
(Guardian, Lord Wei)
As a Guardian,

217
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,280
you only need to stick to your duty.

218
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,400
Remember.

219
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,200
Even if the sky falls,

220
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,800
I will protect you.

221
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,110
(Lord Wei surely values me.)

222
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,630
(If he can remove
this severed hand from me,)

223
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,710
(then it's not a problem.)

224
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,000
(But if he can't...)

225
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,030
(Sangbo Lake, demonic hand, explosion)
(It's from the Sangbo lakebed.)

226
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,800
(Will he cover for me)

227
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,320
(or seal me along with it?)

228
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,500
(Tell the Supervisor)
The Supervisor...

229
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,810
(With his abilities,)

230
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,670
(he's surely able
to remove the severed hand.)

231
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,040
(But he's too mysterious.)

232
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,510
(Though I've never met him,)

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,990
(he seems to have always been
watching me.)

234
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,050
(Will he help me?)

235
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,420
(Tell the Supervisor)

236
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,160
(That Hypnotizer)

237
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,530
(used great effort to release the seal.)

238
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,040
(Why did it end up in my body?)

239
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,350
(Who is he?)

240
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,510
(What's his real purpose?)

241
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,650
(Will he take the severed hand back?)

242
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,760
(For now,)

243
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,450
(I need to find out his identity asap.)

244
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,680
(Well, the problem is back.)

245
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,680
(How should I figure it out?)

246
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,470
(Should I seek help from others?)

247
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
Keep the secret.

248
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,830
Master?

249
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,470
You're here?

250
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
Master,

251
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,160
do you have more clues about that man?

252
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,510
Tell me more.

253
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,760
Master,

254
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,680
you said we were
the same kind of people.

255
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,510
What does that mean?

256
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,630
Do you also pick up silver every day?

257
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,990
Or are you good at pitch-pot?

258
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,190
Ring toss?

259
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,110
Do you never miss it?

260
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,470
Master, say something.

261
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,230
Why not come out for a chat?

262
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,800
I'll make you a cup of milk tea.

263
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,400
Come on, Master.

264
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,310
Master.

265
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,190
Master.

266
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,680
Master, Master.

267
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Master, say something.

268
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,280
Why just those three words?

269
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,470
Master.

270
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,710
Master.

271
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,510
Master.

272
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,620
(Haoqi Tower)

273
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,400
Greetings, Lord Wei.

274
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,920
You're here.

275
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,070
Lord Wei,

276
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,590
I heard that His Majesty
was upset at the Bureau

277
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,230
after knowing I took the Elixir of Life.

278
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,360
His Majesty's asked for it
for three years,

279
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,030
but the Supervisor didn't give him.

280
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,960
Now,

281
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,080
you must keep a low profile

282
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,870
and conceal your talent.

283
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,830
Make good use of the Elixir of Life.

284
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:06,920
Pair it with this diagram,

285
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,380
and it will make your efforts

286
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,560
twice as effective.

287
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,920
Open it and see.

288
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,680
The Visualization Chart.

289
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,920
Do you know it?

290
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,550
I do.

291
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,040
I heard my uncle mention it.

292
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,110
This Visualization Chart is
the key for me to break through.

293
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,400
Consider it your reward
for going to Yunzhou.

294
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,800
This booklet

295
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,870
records the methods of visualization.

296
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,160
You must learn it exactly.

297
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,250
Remember.

298
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,000
(Visualization Method)
The visualized form

299
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
affects the Fighter's mindset.

300
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,000
This spiritual energy is imprinted
by the painter

301
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,710
into the painting.

302
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,660
(Spontaneously)
After careful consideration,

303
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,080
I think this is the best for you.

304
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,470
Thank you, Lord Wei.

305
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,520
Lord Wei,

306
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,910
can I visualize

307
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,600
this diagram with others?

308
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,550
You only need to return it to me
in three months.

309
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,400
Regarding

310
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,920
what you do with it

311
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,790
and who you visualize it with,

312
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,680
that's none of my business.

313
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,960
Do I need to return it?

314
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,160
Of course.

315
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,230
Every diagram is priceless.

316
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,070
If it's damaged,

317
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,070
you'll lose your salary
for the rest of your life.

318
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,280
Understood.

319
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,390
By the way, Lord Wei,

320
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,400
there's one more thing I need to report.

321
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,550
Tell me.

322
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Do you still remember

323
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,900
the Battle of Linyuan Pass?

324
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,750
Honey,

325
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,160
are you on duty today?

326
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,640
It wasn't supposed to be,

327
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,550
but I just received news

328
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,470
that Duchess Zhenbei has gone missing.

329
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,840
On-duty and off-duty officials
have been sent to search for her.

330
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,550
Good luck with your work.

331
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,840
But don't forget

332
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,470
to ask someone
to inquire at Yunlu Academy.

333
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,470
That unfilial child.

334
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,070
Why worry about him?

335
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,480
Come back.

336
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,470
Logically,

337
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,840
Xinnian should have returned by now.

338
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,880
When we moved,

339
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,270
Ningyan did write to him, right?

340
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

341
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,000
Come back!

342
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,840
What do you mean by that?

343
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,100
Dear, he's grown up.

344
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,750
He has hands and feet. He won't be lost.

345
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,710
What if he's lost?

346
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,590
- Will you ask around?
- What are you doing?

347
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,360
What's the matter with you?

348
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,030
You're not worried at all.

349
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,920
That's roughly the situation.

350
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,550
At first, I didn't believe it either.

351
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,790
But that old man was very certain.

352
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,470
He said he participated
in the Battle of Linyuan Pass.

353
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,840
He even said he was standing
on the city wall at that time.

354
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,600
What's his name?

355
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,120
He's just an ordinary old man.

356
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
I didn't ask much.

357
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,520
By the way,

358
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,960
he also said that he was standing
right behind you.

359
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,640
There's no one like that.

360
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,990
Lord Wei, think again.

361
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,600
He was right behind you,

362
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,160
roughly at this distance.

363
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,570
There must be someone there.

364
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,160
I'm a bit tired.

365
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,600
I'll take my leave now.

366
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,520
Lord Wei,

367
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,440
I think that old man is quite pitiful.

368
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,510
He's alone, with no relatives.

369
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,920
I thought

370
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,510
if you remember him,

371
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,960
we could leave him a way out.

372
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,550
Maybe some retirement money.

373
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,960
Why are you so sure?

374
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,880
He looks like a good guy.

375
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,510
He doesn't look like a bad person.

376
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,790
Besides, who'd want
to deceive a Guardian?

377
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,520
Alright.

378
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,360
Bring him to me.

379
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,160
I'll ask him myself.

380
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,870
What's wrong?

381
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
I...

382
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,880
I met him while drinking on the street.

383
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,750
Where am I supposed to find him?

384
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,590
You can.

385
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,370
You can definitely find him.

386
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,070
Signature Whitening Cream.

387
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,990
Take a look. Give it a try.

388
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,880
It'll make your skin
look as white as snow.

389
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
You'll look stunning.

390
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,030
Who is this person?

391
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,030
Anyone who could stand behind Lord Wei

392
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,030
must be no ordinary person.

393
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,740
(Zhi)

394
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,160
This unlucky fellow again.

395
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,070
I didn't pick up any money in Yunzhou.

396
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
This could cover my loss.

397
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,550
It should have fallen around here.

398
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,400
Right.

399
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,310
I just searched along the way.

400
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,790
Where could it have gone?

401
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,920
It shouldn't be.

402
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,400
In the last three months,
I've never lost my purse.

403
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,360
Why is it gone again today?

404
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,790
They're gone.

405
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:53,710
Let's keep looking.

406
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,790
Where did it go?

407
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,710
I heard that Duchess Zhenbei

408
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,600
loved wandering through the streets
in search of treasures.

409
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,510
In these busy streets,

410
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,840
we must keep our eyes wide open
and search carefully.

411
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,040
Yes.

412
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,600
Xu is back.

413
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,440
Yeah.

414
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,750
- Long time no see.
- I'm back.

415
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
You all go ahead.

416
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,590
You guys,

417
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,810
take a look over there.

418
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,200
Yes.

419
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,700
(Xu Residence)

420
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,280
Who is it?

421
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,960
Who are you?

422
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,550
Xin...

423
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,680
Xinnian?

424
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,870
You...

425
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,120
Ningyan didn't write to you.

426
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,360
When I heard about this,
I rushed over to pick you up.

427
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,840
Why didn't you stay at an inn?

428
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,070
I don't have any money.

429
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,920
You can stay in the house.

430
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,990
There's no bed.

431
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,170
Why didn't you go back to the Academy?

432
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,920
The city gates are closed.

433
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,070
I've come to pick you up.

434
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,680
Let's go home.

435
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,880
My Lord,

436
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,120
I have

437
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,880
no family.

438
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,400
Xinnian, you can't jump.

439
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,550
- You can't do this.
- Don't stop me.

440
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,790
- No.
- I'd rather die.

441
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,600
You can't do this, Xinnian.

442
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,710
I have no family.

443
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:26,680
You have a family.

444
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,670
- I'm here to pick you up.
- No one remembers me.

445
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,120
Xinnian, listen to me.

446
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,990
Your room is all tidied up.

447
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
Come home with me.

448
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,360
- Come here.
- Let me jump!

449
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,310
Hurry, hurry!

450
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,720
Master,

451
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,070
are you sure there was someone
behind Lord Wei?

452
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,510
I've asked Lord Wei.

453
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,600
He said he didn't remember this man.

454
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,270
Did you get the wrong info?

455
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,150
Master,

456
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,160
are you there?

457
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,790
If you're there, answer me.

458
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,230
Why are you so quiet?

459
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,740
(Looks like he's sleeping again.)

460
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,690
(Maybe I should take this chance)

461
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,340
(to tell Lord Wei about this.)

462
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,980
(That way...)

463
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,790
Master, you're back.

464
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,880
Master, what's going on?

465
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Master, I'm sorry.

466
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,440
I was just joking.
Don't take it seriously.

467
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,000
Master.

468
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,640
You don't understand.

469
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,710
The human heart is complex.

470
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,750
People don't always do what they think.

471
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,710
I was just thinking.

472
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,640
I'll never tell anyone.

473
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,480
Don't worry.

474
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,990
Calm down.

475
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,070
Don't be angry.

476
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,710
That's more like it, Master.

477
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,550
Thank you for sparing my life.

478
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,600
Thank you.

479
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,230
You're going too far.

480
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,510
I only hit you once.

481
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,960
You're holding a grudge.

482
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,510
Master, I'm sorry.

483
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,830
Master.

484
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,600
Master, I'm really sorry.

485
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,360
I'm sorry, Master.

486
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,160
Ningyan.

487
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,550
Cijiu.

488
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,030
Ningyan.

489
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,310
Cijiu.

490
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,120
You scared me to death.

491
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,600
I thought you were dead.

492
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,680
It's fine now.

493
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,790
I'm fine.

494
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm glad you're fine.

495
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:34,600
I really thought you were dead.

496
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,160
When did you wake up?

497
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,230
I have great luck.

498
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,270
I woke up long ago.

499
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,790
How long ago?

500
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,790
A few days ago.

501
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
What happened?

502
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
My Lord,

503
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,550
didn't you just say

504
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,960
he woke up two hours ago?

505
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,270
Yes, two hours ago.

506
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,470
Right, dear?

507
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,960
He woke up two hours ago.

508
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,070
Right?

509
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,360
I can testify.

510
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,640
It was two hours ago.

511
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,510
It was two hours ago.

512
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,520
Xinnian,

513
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,790
you must have heard it wrong.

514
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
I clearly...

515
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,710
It's clearly in the middle of the night.

516
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,110
Cijiu,

517
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,200
hurry back to bathe, change,
and rest early.

518
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,640
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

519
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,840
Yes, yes.

520
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,720
No.

521
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,070
I clearly...

522
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,960
Lingyue,

523
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,960
don't just stand there.

524
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,440
Hurry and take Xinnian back to rest.

525
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,680
Yes, yes.

526
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,280
Xinnian,

527
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,310
let's go.

528
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,000
Wait.

529
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,640
Is this our new home?

530
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,270
Wow.

531
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,310
Green tiles and red eaves.

532
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,270
Luxury and opulence.

533
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,550
I'm sure

534
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,510
my room

535
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,030
must be very nice too, right?

536
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,510
Right, sis?

537
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,070
Take me there now, sis.

538
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,470
Our home is so beautiful.

539
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,310
(Modest and Curious)

540
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,030
This pond is so big.

541
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,470
Such a beautiful garden.

542
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,360
Every step is a new view.

543
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,270
My room is this way.

544
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:17,990
Father,

545
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,160
where is

546
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,510
Xinnian's room?

547
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,790
- Ningyan.
- Uncle.

548
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,600
Let's have a match.

549
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,630
Mosquito.

550
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,280
Go away.

551
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,280
Go away, mosquito.

552
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:55,220
(Modest and Curious)

553
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,600
Don't be so petty.

554
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,990
You'll be a Prime Minister.

555
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,960
Don't act so bashfully

556
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,510
like a little girl.

557
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,400
We didn't mean to forget you.

558
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,790
We just forgot.

559
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,720
How about this?

560
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,440
I'll pay for your new room tomorrow.

561
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,330
You can choose

562
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,270
whatever you want.

Why has your temper gotten bigger

565
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,510
in these months of studying?

566
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,120
I can't please you now, huh?

567
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,270
You're going too far.

568
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,840
It's late. Will you let me sleep?

569
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,990
I have to work tomorrow.

570
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,440
What's going on with you?

571
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,590

of Linyuan Pass?

00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,550
Right, go find it for me.

607
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,370
My Lord, I'm afraid you'll have to go
to the Ministry of Personnel.

608
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,880
The Manual Archive doesn't have it.

609
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,070
Are you kidding me?

610
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,200
Our Guardian's Archive

611
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,990
must have more comprehensive records.

612
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,790
My Lord, you don't understand.

613
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,270
For normal secrets,

614
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,280
the Archive is indeed more thorough.

615
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,160
However,

616
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,710
our yamen was established
in Yuanjing Year 19,

617
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,600
which is two years after that battle.

618
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,860
So, our archives
about the Battle of Linyuan Pass

619
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,640
are indeed not very thorough.

620
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,930
I see. Get back to your work.

621
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,750
Why is it two years early?

622
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,470
The Ministry of Personnel is
under Wang Zhenwen's control.

623
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,400
He and the Guardians
have never been on good terms.

624
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,030
How do I get in there?

625
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,310
Should I break in?

626
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,630
My Lord,

627
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,990
is the food not to your liking?

628
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,710
Shall I change your dishes?

629
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,630
No need.

630
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,440
Sir,

631
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,880
you hurt me.

632
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,110
Sir,

633
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,240
come with me.

634
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,350
Yes.

635
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,950
Come here.

636
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,310
Yes.

637
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,590
I have something to ask you.

638
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,240
Answer honestly.

639
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,080
Yes.

640
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,470
Is Song Changfu,
Commissioner of Yunzhou,

641
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,150
a member of the Witcher's Sect?

642
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,860
Yes.

643
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,590
Well.

644
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,070
What about Yang Chuannan,
Commander of Yunzhou?

645
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,150
Is he also a member
of the Witcher's Sect?

646
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,590
No.

647
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,800
He has nothing to do with the Sect.

648
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,670
The master is right.

649
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,920
Though Yang Chuannan is stubborn,

650
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,360
he wouldn't ally with traitors.

651
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,320
One last question.

652
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,190
What kind of person

653
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,510
is your younger brother?

654
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,240
Aren't you

655
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,470
the eldest brother of No. 3?

656
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,630
What kind of person

657
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,840
is he?

658
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,870
You...

659
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,110
You're not No. 2.

660
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,920
You're so weak.

661
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,920
You're not Li Miaozhen.

662
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,320
Let go.

663
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,360
You're hurting me.

664
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,800
Why are you unaffected?

665
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,920
You fell under my Charm Spell.

666
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,800
Just a gimmick.

667
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,130
It's a trap!

668
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:26,740
(Brightness Spell)

669
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,030
A spell book from the Yunlu Academy?

670
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,070
Who exactly are you?

671
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,150
Miss,

672
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,830
it's my turn to ask.

673
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,670
Answer my questions

674
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,030
honestly.

675
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,870
Understand?

676
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,550
Where's No. 2,

677
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,550
Li Miaozhen?

678
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,550
Why isn't she back yet?

679
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,550
Is she coughing again?

680
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,240
I had you ask him a few questions.

681
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,400
What did you do?

682
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,630
What took you so long?

683
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,160
Where is he?

684
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
Watch out, Master!

685
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,110
Winged Woman, Li Miaozhen.

686
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,510
You deserve your reputation.

687
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,240
Are you Xu Qi'an?

688
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,560
I am.

689
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,840
What could a mere Fighter do for me?

690
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,190
No. 3 is so ignorant.

691
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,720
Did you know I was here?

692
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,720
Did you tell him?

693
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,070
He forced me to.

694
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,720
What else did you tell him?

695
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,070
Just a little.

696
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,070
How much did you tell him?

697
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,920
Just a little.

698
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,240
I didn't say much.

699
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,150
Just your identity, age, cultivation,

700
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,280
your worldly experience,

701
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,150
and your crush on your senior.

702
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,440
I'm warning you.

703
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,630
Don't tell No. 3 anything about me.

704
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,650
If there is even the slightest leak,
I'll guarantee your tragic death.

705
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,190
Xinnian told me

706
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,360
that you both came to the capital
with a mission

707
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,510
and needed his help.

708
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,360
This isn't helping.

709
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,760
It's something he owes me.

710
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,900
No. 3 told me
you were good at solving cases.

711
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,800
I'm just okay.

712
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,240
Then help me with something.

713
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,960
Let's hear it. I'll consider it.

714
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,760
Do you think we should
wrap things up here?

715
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,250
It's up to you.

716
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,590
- Then let's wrap it up.
- Three.

717
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,510
- Two.
- One.

718
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,350
Wrap up.

719
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,070
- Su Su, close the door.
- Okay.

720
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,240
Close your eyes.

721
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,480
Steady your primordial spirit.

722
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,390
I...

723
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:16,990
Where am I?

724
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,720
In my memories.

725
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,990
This is the Empathy Spell,

726
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,110
a secret method of our sect

727
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,190
that allows both sides
to merge their consciousness

728
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,070
and exchange memories.

729
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,760
Is there a way to make it one-sided?

730
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,840
I don't want my memories
to be pried into.

731
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm not as despicable as you.

732
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,840
I'll only merge this portion
of memory with you.

733
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,470
Very good.

734
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,030
Master, if you want
to interrogate Xu Qi'an,

735
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,510
why not try my Charm Spell on him?

736
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,430
Okay.

737
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,360
Know when to stop.

738
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,440
Don't go overboard.

739
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,720
Don't worry, Master.

740
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,720
Knowing when to stop

741
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,150
is my expertise with men.

742
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,120
That...

743
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,070
Is that a man?

744
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
Xu Qi'an.

745
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,150
Can you tell who this man is?

746
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,760
This man should be from the north.

747
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,840
How can you tell?

748
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,660
A person is shaped
by the land they live on.

749
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,240
From their appearance and skin,
you can tell where the victim is from.

750
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,880
Also, he has calluses on their palms,

751
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,280
and there's a thick callus
on their index finger as well.

752
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,610
People who use knives and swords

753
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,960
don't develop such calluses.

754
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,150
So, what weapon did he use?

755
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,630
Just tell us.

756
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,160
It was a bow.

757
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,010
Exactly.

758
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,400
This man was good with a bow.

759
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,110
How can you tell that he is

760
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,320
from the north based on that?

761
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,940
I think you're just making things up.

762
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,630
Many people are good with a bow.

763
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,280
Couldn't he be from the military?

764
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,180
He's definitely not
from the military.

765
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,980
He doesn't have calluses
around his thighs.

766
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,360
If he were a soldier
who rode horses for a long time,

767
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,070
he'd definitely have calluses there.

768
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,880
He's not a soldier

769
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,860
but skilled with a bow,

770
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,980
which fits the profile
of northern people.

771
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,760
People from the underworld of the Dafeng

772
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,360
aren't known for their archery skills.

773
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,550
Could he be a bowman?

774
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,470
Who'd send a bowman
to deliver a message?

775
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,840
This is most likely

776
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,360
a person from the northern underworld.

777
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,670
As for what he wanted to convey,

778
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,400
who he was sent by,

779
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,920
and who killed them,

780
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,240
I don't know.

781
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,190
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

782
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,720
Blood

783
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,450
shall be shed for 3,000 li.

784
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,240
Troops

785
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,390
shall be sent

786
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,240
to suppress it.

787
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,280
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

788
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,760
What did he mean
by "Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li"?

789
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,550
What you saw is exactly what I saw.

790
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,800
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.
