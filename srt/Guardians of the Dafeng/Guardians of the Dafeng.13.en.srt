00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,360
No. 3,

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,210
I can't believe you'd do this

42
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,030
- for No. 6.
- I'd die for a bosom friend.

43
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,800
The words No. 6 said earlier were

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,110
touching and heart-rending,

45
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,390
deafening and enlightening.

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,390
A righteous person like No. 6

47
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,910
should not have been captured,

48
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,310
nor should he have been tortured
by those Guardians.

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,110
As a comrade of No. 6,

50
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,910
these are things I should bear.

51
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,750
Rest assured.

52
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,670
Even if I die and my path is lost,

53
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,080
I will have no regrets.

54
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,160
Well said.

55
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
(No. 1, No. 3, No. 4)
No. 3

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,960
is truly a model for us all,

57
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,110
unlike No. 4,

58
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,270
who often talks about morality,

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,110
but when real trouble comes,

60
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,800
no one knows where he hides.

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,990
(No. 2)
Come on.

62
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,480
Didn't I tell you?

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
I wasn't in the capital last night.

64
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,800
What right do you have to condemn me?

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,760
Didn't you claim

66
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,990
to be some Winged Woman?

67
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,870
Don't you have wings?

68
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,990
Fly over and see.

69
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,040
Fly over?

70
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,640
If I flew to the capital,

71
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,390
I'd first go to Treasure Sect
and stab you.

72
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,800
You just talk and do nothing.

73
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,360
I'm waiting for you, Little Wings.

74
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,830
Just wait. You really have a death wish.

75
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,860
I'm right here.

76
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,240
If you want to kill me, come here.

77
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,640
- Just wait.
- I'm waiting.

78
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,480
Just wait.

79
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,580
(Puppet)

80
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,670
Guangxiao, what's on your mind?

81
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,320
It must be a young lady.

82
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,930
I heard you went to Haoqi Tower
again yesterday.

83
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,110
I also heard you dismissed
Mr. Yang and Ms. Nangong.

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,670
Who told you that?

85
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,960
The people involved.

86
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,520
Ms. Nangong
went to see the chief

87
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,430
and cursed you

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,870
for four hours at Breeze Hall.

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
It looks like I won't be able to stay

90
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,040
at Breeze Hall for much longer.

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,090
Today, I'm going all out.

92
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,360
(Guo's Bamboo Crafts)
Forget about the power and wealth.

93
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,150
I must express my feelings.

94
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:37,150
Huaiqing is nothing but a hollow title,

95
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,480
ruining people's futures.

96
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,110
She drove me away for a new lover.

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,150
I really had no eyes

98
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,390
to be deceived like this.

99
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,640
Huaiqing has wronged me.

100
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,360
Huaiqing has wronged me.

101
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,550
I have been wronged.

102
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,590
Huaiqing has wronged me.

103
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,390
She mentioned a millennium-old lingzhi
on the mountain,

104
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,430
and I ate it.

105
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,110
It blinded my eyes.

106
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,360
Huaiqing has wronged me.

107
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,200
Huaiqing has wronged me.

108
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Huaiqing?

109
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,480
A beggar,

110
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,430
a prisoner,

111
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,270
and a blind physician

112
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,200
will soon appear one after another
before Xu Qi'an

113
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,470
to tell him about their tragic plight.

114
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,520
The reason for all this is simple:

115
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,880
Huaiqing has wronged me.

116
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,000
Moreover, we have arranged everything
on this street.

117
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,150
This will not spread,

118
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,790
but it's enough to make Mr. Xu

119
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,080
believe it.

120
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,030
This way,

121
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,390
Huaiqing's name will be enough
to scare off Xu Qi'an.

122
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,480
Then

123
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,390
I will reveal my identity

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,910
and try to win him over,

125
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,390
showing I can forgive the past.

126
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,200
He will surely think

127
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,120
I am magnanimous

128
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,830
and will be

129
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,760
deeply grateful to me.

130
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,830
Your Highness, how wise of you.

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,160
Your Highness.

132
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,770
Xu Qi'an is outside asking to see you.

133
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,560
This is also fake?

134
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,680
Aren't you blind now?

135
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Kneel.

136
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,470
What does this mean?

137
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,520
Your Highness,

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,390
this is simply horrifying.

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,200
I encountered
these sinister people today,

140
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,270
and they maliciously
slandered you in public.

141
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
How absurd.

142
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,820
Your intentions
are worthy of punishment.

143
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,030
Xuan, take them down

144
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,560
for interrogation.

145
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,680
Let's see who's behind this.

146
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,200
- Hurry.
- Yes.

147
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,200
No need.

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
I've interrogated them.

149
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,000
These people

150
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
are not unruly mobs

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,760
acting out of malice

152
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,560
but are being manipulated from behind,

153
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,230
aiming to slander your reputation.

154
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
Your Highness,

155
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,590
guess who this person is.

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,640
You wouldn't have guessed.

157
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,000
The person behind this wicked plot

158
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
is your younger sister,

159
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,350
Princess Lin'an.

160
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,390
I feel ashamed to say it,

161
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,640
but I've also uncovered the motive
behind this crime.

162
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,680
Princess Lin'an

163
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,710
wants to recruit me.

164
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,150
What do you think?

165
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,710
Your Highness,

166
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,350
I don't need to think.

167
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,590
Though Princess Lin'an
wants to recruit me,

168
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,680
she probably doesn't understand
my character.

169
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,390
Otherwise, she wouldn't have resorted
to such methods,

170
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,520
and she wouldn't know that I'm loyal
and don't serve two masters.

171
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,560
Don't be so absolute in your words.

172
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,350
Lin'an went

173
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,080
through so much trouble.

174
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,470
She must be genuinely trying
to recruit you.

175
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,220
How about giving it a second thought?

176
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
I understand now.

177
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,030
You understand again?

178
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,790
I understand the reason
you tested me earlier.

179
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,080
Your Highness, you are

180
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,150
truly brilliant

181
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,590
and well-informed.

182
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,120
You knew Princess Lin'an
wanted to recruit me,

183
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,710
so you deliberately tested me

184
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,790
to see if I would seek another master.

185
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,910
You figured it all out?

186
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,560
Rest assured, Your Highness.

187
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,200
I am willing to prove my loyalty

188
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,640
with action.

189
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,030
I will take these rogues
back to the yamen and punish them.

190
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,480
No need for that.

191
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,710
I already know your loyalty,

192
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,350
but this is quite suspicious.

193
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,030
I need to personally interrogate them.

194
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,190
Xuan,

195
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
keep an eye on them.

196
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,630
As for you,

197
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,000
you can go on with your business.

198
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,150
Alright then, I will take my leave.

199
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,520
Xuan.

200
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,870
- Don't let them harm the princess.
- Sure.

201
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,310
Alright.

202
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,680
Take care.

203
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,580
Are you alright?

204
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,030
What's wrong with you?

205
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,320
How did you get caught?

206
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,200
At first, we followed the orders

207
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,470
and swore it was all Huaiqing's doing.

208
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,560
But who would've known

209
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,280
Mr. Xu knows

210
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,630
a Master from the Academy?

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,750
(Heart Spell)
A gentleman must be sincere,

212
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,060
and so must an ordinary person.

213
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,080
Before meeting the Master,

214
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,920
we still stuck to the same answer.

215
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,080
But who would've thought

216
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
they'd use the Heart Spell on us?

217
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,080
We were even beaten.

218
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,870
Our bodies and minds
suffered double torture.

219
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,350
Your Highness, we really had no choice.

220
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,800
Alright, alright.

221
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,750
Xuan, give them each 20 liang

222
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,920
and let them go home.

223
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
Alright.

224
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,590
Thank you, Your Highness.

225
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,940
Please.

226
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,800
Take care.

227
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,870
Sorry.

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,230
Your Highness.

229
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,750
What should we do?

230
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,320
I didn't expect Mr. Xu to be so clever.

231
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,080
Did we just

232
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,160
lose more than we gained?

233
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,110
Even I'm moved to hear this,

234
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,110
let alone the Grand Princess.

235
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,350
She was indeed greatly shocked.

236
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,680
Are you saying Huaiqing

237
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,320
was wary of you back then?

238
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,320
She did.

239
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,510
She had tested me with words before.

240
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,280
I was confused for quite a while.

241
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,750
It's perfect
that Lin'an came right to me.

242
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,920
I took this chance to show my loyalty.

243
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,040
Now, the Grand Princess
must trust you completely, right?

244
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,750
Not just the Grand Princess.

245
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,870
Yesterday, I also did a good job

246
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,200
in front of Lord Wei,

247
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,960
and now

248
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,470
he trusts me quite a lot.

249
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,750
Two major patrons in one day.

250
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
Ningyan,

251
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,040
thanks to you,

252
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,510
our family's glory and wealth
are just around the corner.

253
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,870
Uncle, you're too kind.

254
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,280
I still have a lot to learn from you.

255
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,560
After all,
when it comes to serving others,

256
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,960
you have more experience.

257
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,990
No, no, no.

258
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,230
The student has surpassed the teacher.

259
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,470
You're on the verge of surpassing me.

260
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,920
You taught me

261
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,590
all my martial arts skills, Uncle.

262
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,450
No, no, no.

263
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,830
The younger generation

264
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,990
surpasses the older.

265
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,160
No, no, no.

266
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,960
You'll always be my uncle.

267
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,560
No, no, no. The world is yours,

268
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,590
and the future is yours.

269
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,800
Everything is yours.

270
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,440
Without you, where would we be?

271
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,510
Uncle, I'll kowtow to you.

272
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,870
Please don't be modest, Ningyan.

273
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,440
- No, no. I'll kowtow to you.
- I'll kowtow to you.

274
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,710
No, no, no.

275
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,300
(Guardians)

276
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,230
Mr. Tao.

277
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,190
Where is Xu Qi'an?

278
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,990
I don't know. He was just here.

279
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,350
Mr. Li.

280
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,640
Where is Xu Qi'an?

281
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
(Breeze Hall)

282
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,630
What are you looking for Xu Qi'an for?

283
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
I like this Copper Gong.

284
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,960
I want him to join my Grandeur Hall.

285
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,590
What do you mean?

286
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,870
Mr. Jiang likes him,

287
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,230
so I'm here to take him.

288
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,510
What luck this kid has.

289
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,960
Don't touch it.

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,870
Go back and tell Mr. Jiang

291
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,160
that I don't agree.

292
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,710
How dare you refuse Mr. Jiang?

293
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,160
Listen, I came here just to inform you.

294
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,160
Mr. Jiang is waiting.

295
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,110
Even if Mr. Jiang comes himself,
I'll still say the same thing.

296
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
I don't agree.

297
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,320
Are you crazy?

298
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,470
How dare you disrespect Mr. Jiang?

299
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,470
I don't care
if he's Mr. Jiang or Mr. Li.

300
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,320
Listen to me.

301
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,970
You can't just show up at my Breeze Hall

302
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,960
and take my subordinate

303
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,990
from me!

304
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,920
Did you just drink fake liquor?

305
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,440
You're the one drinking fake liquor.

306
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,040
Do you think you can just come here
and boss around?

307
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,400
How foul-mouthed of you.

308
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,150
Who are you calling foul-mouthed?

309
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,440
Speak clearly.

310
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,590
You are.

311
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,800
How dare you disobey Mr. Jiang's orders?

312
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,990
Fine, I'm foul-mouthed.

313
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,990
Listen, stop talking to me.

314
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,700
(Focus Tower)

315
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,980
(Xu Qi'an's A-Record)

316
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,200
So, Xu Qi'an

317
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
is the Changle Speed
who solved the tax silver case.

318
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,790
The one who cracked the tax silver case

319
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,020
just by looking at the files?

320
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,210
That's right. Now, I'm in charge
of the Earl Pingyuan murder case.

321
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,200
Though Lord Wei has helped me

322
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
shoulder the pressure from the court,

323
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,200
I can't slack off.

324
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,870
Otherwise, Lord Wei
will question my abilities.

325
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,870
This kid is good at investigating
and solving cases.

326
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,590
He's just the kind of talent I need.

327
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,470
Chief, you have a sharp eye for talent.

328
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,960
Once Mr. Tao brings him in,

329
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,200
you can send him to investigate
the Earl Pingyuan case.

330
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,160
It's not the only reason I like him.

331
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,590
There's another thing.

332
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,670
What's that?

333
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,710
This kid has close ties
with the Astronomical Bureau.

334
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,750
If I can get him under my command,

335
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,160
I can buy weapons

336
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,560
from the Bureau through him,

337
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,470
which will boost our fighting power.

338
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,550
Chief.

339
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
What's wrong?

340
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Li Yuchun

341
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,800
sent me back.

342
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,070
What?

343
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,800
Father, I've made up my mind.

344
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,510
I want Xu Qi'an under my command.

345
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,550
Why?

346
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,870
I have a major case
to investigate these days,

347
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,830
and Xu Qi'an is good at solving cases.

348
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,080
He can assist me,

349
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,440
and I'll ensure he receives
the best training.

350
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,640
Father,

351
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,120
I also have many cases on my end.

352
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,760
As for training,

353
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,830
Xu Qi'an has made great progress
under my command.

354
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,320
This is evident to everyone.

355
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,640
Yang Yan,

356
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,710
I'll let you have
the position of Commander.

357
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,200
I just want Xu Qi'an under my command.

358
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,800
The position of Commander
is already mine.

359
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,440
What do you mean by "let me have it"?

360
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,040
Father,

361
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,830
I don't want to be
the Commander anymore.

362
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,230
I don't want the weapon
from the Bureau either.

363
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,080
I just want Xu Qi'an.

364
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,060
I don't want the weapon.

365
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,990
I only want Xu Qi'an.

366
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,110
I want Xu Qi'an, Father.

367
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,440
I want Xu Qi'an, Father.

368
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,590
This is between you two.

369
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,080
I won't decide.

370
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,620
Fine. Give me a straight answer.

371
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,300
What will it take for me
to have Xu Qi'an?

372
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,990
I'll give you a straight answer:

373
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,160
There's no way I'll give him to you.

374
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,000
You...

375
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,830
Mr. Yang,

376
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
I have urgent news to report.

377
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,430
Speak.

378
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,870
Mr. Jiang wants
to take Xu Qi'an from us.

379
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,640
What?

380
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,310
My Lord,

381
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,200
standing here and waiting won't help.

382
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,350
How about you go back first?

383
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,750
We'll tell you when he's here.

384
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,670
No need.

385
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,470
- Mr. Yang.
- Mr. Yang.

386
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
Mr. Yang, you arrived just in time.

387
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,680
Can I transfer Xu Qi'an to my command?

388
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,310
No.

389
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,830
What if I insist?

390
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
We'll do it by the rules.

391
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,120
Have you heard?

392
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,400
(Haoqi Tower)
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Yang went

393
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,090
to the Training Arena
over a Copper Gong.

394
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,450
They'll settle it by the rules.

395
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,470
How could that be?

396
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,460
They'll fight for a Copper Gong?

397
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,780
This morning, Tao Man went
to ask Li Yuchun for that guy

398
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,750
but was refused.

399
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,810
They argued,

400
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,560
and then each went
to find their Gold Gong.

401
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,400
A contest
among high-ranking Fighters is rare.

402
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,140
Let's go and look.

403
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:29,920
Let's go.

404
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,880
What's going on with Yang Yan
and Jiang Lyuzhong?

405
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,920
Hurry to get a good spot.

406
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,960
Dignified Gold Gongs

407
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,990
fighting over a Copper Gong.

408
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,230
How embarrassing.

409
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,600
Isn't this going to make us
the laughingstock?

410
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,560
You don't understand.

411
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,110
This Copper Gong

412
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,040
isn't ordinary.

413
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,160
Yang Yan,

414
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,920
are you serious?

415
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,920
If you want to fight, let's fight.

416
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,130
Stop wasting time with words.

417
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,970
Fine.

418
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,360
They're coming to take him too?

419
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,550
Mr. Jiang,
it looks like you don't know it.

420
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,440
The Copper Gong you're fighting over

421
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,360
is an A+.

422
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,120
An A+?

423
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,240
Yang Yan,

424
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,270
your opponent is me.

425
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,720
(Go and fight.)

426
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,470
(The more people, the better.)

427
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,840
(As long as he's not with Yang Yan,)

428
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,880
(I don't care who he's with.)

429
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,400
What did she just say?

430
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,870
She said

431
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,270
the Copper Gong you were fighting over

432
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,880
is an A+.

433
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,870
An A+?

434
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,520
Xu Qi'an?

435
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,550
I just became a B+,

436
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,270
but he's an A+?

437
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,230
Where is everyone?

438
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,360
Where did everyone go?

439
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,750
Hurry up. We're going to be late!

440
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,590
Hurry!

441
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,350
Bro, where are you going?

442
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,600
Gold Gongs are fighting.

443
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,550
Hurry up!

444
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:54,310
Gold Gongs are fighting?

445
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,070
Wait for me!

446
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,850
This punch is impressive.

447
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,790
Bro, what's the deal?

448
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,960
I heard the yamen just got
an A+ Copper Gong.

449
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,610
Look, those Gold Gongs are fighting.

450
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,400
Since the Guardian Yamen
was established,

451
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,920
we've never seen an A+.

452
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,990
So impressive.

453
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,640
That's the unfairness of the world.

454
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,720
By the way,

455
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,990
what's that Copper Gong's name?

456
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,930
Which hall is he from?

457
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,360
Why are you asking about him?

458
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,840
Are you dumb?

459
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,680
This person's future is bright.

460
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,550
While he's still a small Copper Gong,

461
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,550
we should take the chance

462
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,920
and make connections now.

463
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,470
You're right.

464
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,850
Does anyone know
who that Copper Gong is?

465
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,790
I think

466
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,400
he's from the Breeze Hall.

467
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,070
His last name is Xu.

468
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,360
He's just a Copper Gong.

469
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,800
Right.

470
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,090
Which one is Copper Gong Xu
from Breeze Hall?

471
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
That would be me.

472
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,310
- He's Mr. Xu?
- Mr. Xu.

473
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,460
Lord Wei is asking for you.

474
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,870
Come with me.

475
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,230
Bro, I can't see Lord Wei with this.

476
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,240
Can you handle this for me?
I'll buy you a drink.

477
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,070
- Lord Wei.
- Lord Wei.

478
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,790
He's going to see Lord Wei.

479
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,860
(Peace)

480
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,960
Lord Wei,

481
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,580
you're looking for me?

482
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,350
Come here.

483
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,280
Yes.

484
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,700
(Rule With Virtue)

485
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,920
Yang Yan has mastered

486
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,710
the spear intent with his willpower.

487
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,470
If he continues to strengthen
his physique,

488
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,510
in less than ten years,

489
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,390
he will surely break through
to the 3rd Rank.

490
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,750
As for Lyuzhong,

491
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,840
his vitality is abundant,

492
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,840
and his physique is unparalleled.

493
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,360
If he integrates his martial arts

494
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,230
into his fists and feet

495
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,120
like Yang Yan,

496
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,750
his future achievements
will not be less than Yang Yan's.

497
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,240
So,

498
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,640
have you decided who to go with?

499
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,510
I...

500
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't dare.

501
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,070
Are there things you don't dare to do?

502
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
The matter with No. 6 of the Realm Sect

503
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,600
came up suddenly.

504
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,070
I...

505
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,920
Alright.

506
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm not blaming you.

507
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Sit down.

508
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,030
This concerns your future.

509
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,280
So,

510
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,640
I want to hear your true thoughts.

511
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,600
In the arena,

512
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,160
they're Gold Gongs.

513
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,160
Off the arena,

514
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,920
everyone is idle.

515
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,680
If it's because of an A+,

516
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,870
all of them

517
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,160
are willing to bow.

518
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,200
How is it?
Have I made progress in my poetry?

519
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,920
Focus your energy on martial arts.

520
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,030
Top Xu.

521
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,510
How was it?

522
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,070
What did Lord Wei say to you?

523
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,960
We just chatted a bit.

524
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,010
He asked me which Gold Gong
I wanted to choose.

525
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,230
Top Xu, what did you say?

526
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,840
We'll talk about it later.
Let's watch for now.

527
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,120
I...

528
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,390
Father,

529
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,410
you're looking for me?

530
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,440
They've all gone up.

531
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,070
Why haven't you?

532
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,710
Not interested.

533
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,200
Didn't you just say

534
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,360
you wanted to recruit Xu Qi'an?

535
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,200
What happened?

536
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,750
You know the answer.

537
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,600
Yang Yan has been ignoring me lately.

538
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,810
It's all because of Xu Qi'an.

539
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,440
So,

540
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,230
you leaked the A+ thing.

541
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,440
I just want to suppress
Yang Yan's prestige.

542
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,200
Alright.

543
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,200
Call them all back.

544
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,150
Yes.

545
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,310
Has it been decided

546
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,360
on Xu Qi'an's matter?

547
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,710
Who did he choose?

548
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,120
Think about it.

549
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,640
If I had chosen Mr. Yang,

550
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,790
wouldn't that have offended
the other Gold Gongs?

551
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,880
How would I work here in the future?

552
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,110
Yes.

553
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,990
Then choose Mr. Jiang.

554
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,230
Mr. Jiang's is very tough.

555
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,890
If you follow him,
no one will bully you.

556
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,640
That's even worse.

557
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,640
First, I'd offend Mr. Yang,

558
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,960
and with Mr. Jiang,

559
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,990
I'd just be a petty person
who changes sides.

560
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,470
After this,

561
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,200
he'll never trust me completely.

562
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,880
It'll be uncomfortable.

563
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,640
Makes sense.

564
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,920
So, you're really not choosing anyone?

565
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,680
Of course, I'll choose.

566
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,030
But,

567
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,510
I'll need someone else to choose for me.

568
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,010
Choose for you?

569
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,240
Choose for you?

570
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,840
What does that mean?

571
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,710
Who won?

572
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,160
- I won.
- I won.

573
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,510
If I hadn't reined in my breath,

574
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,120
you wouldn't have lasted ten rounds.

575
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,990
If I used my spear,

576
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,310
you wouldn't have lasted one round.

577
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,230
Talking big, huh?

578
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,990
Want to give it another try?

579
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,030
Sure, let's try.

580
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,440
- Alright.
- Yang Yan.

581
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,070
Yes.

582
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,200
Serve the tea.

583
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,280
Yes.

584
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,200
Xu Qi'an said

585
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,230
that about the transfer,

586
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,200
he had his own thoughts.

587
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,270
What did he say?

588
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,120
With what I know about the Gold Gongs,

589
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,400
I can't make
the most correct choice now.

590
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,790
What's so hard about it?

591
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,850
If you want better martial arts,

592
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,880
choose Yang Yan.

593
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,270
If you want a better physique,

594
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,360
Jiang Lyuzhong is your best choice.

595
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,780
I don't favor martial arts.

596
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,400
Or rather, as a Guardian,

597
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,160
what I pursue is not

598
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,030
the absolute level of martial power.

599
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,400
Then what is it?

600
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,400
Lord Wei, do you still remember

601
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,120
why you rated me as A+?

602
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,710
Our little Copper Gong said

603
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,990
this poem represented

604
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,230
(You live off the people's resources.)
what he wants.

605
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,740
(You can't fool the heavens.)

606
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,200
You let Lord Wei choose for you?

607
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,390
That's right.

608
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
Since either choice is wrong,

609
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,680
it's better to stay quiet

610
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,470
and give the choice to Lord Wei.

611
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,640
Then why did you write that poem?

612
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,960
Wasn't that unnecessary?

613
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,310
You don't understand.

614
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,400
If I had started
by suggesting Lord Wei choose,

615
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,030
it'd have left a bad impression,

616
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,990
as if I were timid and indecisive.

617
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,200
But if I presented that poem,

618
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,040
first,

619
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,200
it would show that my stance is clear

620
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,600
that I am a Guardian with integrity.

621
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,070
Second, it allows me
to express my aspirations,

622
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,680
which brings me closer to Lord Wei.

623
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,800
After all,

624
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,310
he must have liked the poem,

625
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,360
so he rated me as A+.

626
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,510
Brilliant! Brilliant!

627
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,550
Brilliant!

628
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,840
Xu Qi'an, you're hitting two birds
with one stone.

629
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,060
Xu Qi'an, come and let me take a look.

630
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,640
No, I'll come over to check.

631
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,080
I'll come over to look at you.

632
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,550
I'll go check if you have
a hundred cunning schemes.

633
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,790
Go away.

634
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,200
This is nothing.

635
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,880
Mastering the preferences
of your superior

636
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,400
is a fundamental skill for every worker.

637
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,990
Worker?

638
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,200
Guardian.

639
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,270
Clever.

640
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,160
Lord Wei will surely choose
the best Gold Gong for you.

641
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,310
Well.

642
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,310
Can you help us get assigned over there?

643
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,360
You two want a transfer?

644
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
Gold Gongs
are better than Silver Gongs.

645
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,070
Mr. Xu,

646
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,840
Lord Wei's Transfer Order has arrived.

647
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,440
Who has Lord Wei assigned him to?

648
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,280
I don't know.

649
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,070
Mr. Li asked you to go over there.

650
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,440
Make way.

651
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,520
Move.

652
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,920
Clear this way.

653
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,400
Mr. Xu is leaving.

654
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,070
Applause.

655
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,200
Chief.

656
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,510
Is this really your decision?

657
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,480
Well.

658
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,440
It's Lord Wei's decision.

659
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
I heard you went to Haoqi Tower.

660
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,960
Wasn't that your choice?

661
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,270
Of course not.

662
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm just a small Copper Gong.

663
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,880
I don't have the right to choose.

664
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,440
But I still argued my case

665
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,470
and bravely asked Lord Wei

666
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,790
if I could stay at Breeze Hall

667
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,230
and if I could stay under your command.

668
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,880
Stay under my command?

669
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,800
Chief,

670
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,280
honestly,

671
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,750
at first, I wanted to leave.

672
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,710
But after spending this time together,

673
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,030
I've already considered myself

674
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,990
a member of Breeze Hall.

675
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,680
When I entered this room,

676
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,640
I thought so.

677
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,030
When out on cases,

678
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,990
I still thought so.

679
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,470
Although

680
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,120
you still have
some misunderstandings about me,

681
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,800
I genuinely want

682
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,200
to stay at Breeze Hall.

683
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,750
So, what did Lord Wei say?

684
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,230
Lord Wei found it strange.

685
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,400
You chose me, a Silver Gong,

686
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,200
instead of a Gold Gong.

687
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,310
Anyone would find that strange.

688
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,550
That's just prejudice.

689
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,710
Gold Gongs and Silver Gongs

690
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,230
are all Guardians.

691
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,030
We all serve the people.

692
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,120
What's so superior or inferior
about that?

693
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,510
Do you really think so?

694
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,230
I've always thought so.

695
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,840
It's a pity that my opinion alone
doesn't matter.

696
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,000
Who am I?

697
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,360
I'm just a small Copper Gong.

698
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,640
My words are insignificant.

699
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,680
In the end,
Lord Wei didn't take me seriously.

700
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,310
Chief,

701
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,600
I owe you this.

702
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,990
If there's ever anything needed
in the hall,

703
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,360
I will

704
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,920
risk my life

705
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,990
for you.

706
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,960
No, Ningyan.

707
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,530
There's no need for that.

708
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,640
There must be.

709
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,200
One day at Breeze Hall

710
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,840
is enough to make it forever.

711
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,990
Wherever Lord Wei
assigns me in the future,

712
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,800
my heart

713
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,310
will always stay with you, Chief.

714
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,200
It'll always stay at Breeze Hall.

715
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,070
With your words,

716
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,230
I am content.

717
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,120
I'll go get your Transfer Order.

718
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,910
Your Transfer Order.

719
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,470
Is it appropriate to look at it here?

720
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,140
(Transfer Order)

721
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,500
(For the next three years,
Xu Qi'an will stay at Breeze Hall)

722
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,660
(under Li Yuchun's command.)

723
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,990
Didn't expect it, did you?

724
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,190
You persuaded Lord Wei!

725
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,670
Ningyan, you...

726
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,400
What's wrong?

727
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,630
It's nothing, bro.

728
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,510
I'm just too excited.

729
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,720
Lord Wei really assigned me to you?

730
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,320
Lord Wei wrote this Transfer Order.

731
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,590
No one can change it.

732
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,960
No one can change it?

733
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,080
Don't worry.

734
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,400
Not only can it not be changed,

735
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,190
but to prevent others
from taking you away,

736
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,880
Lord Wei specifically added
a time limit:

737
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,030
Three years.

738
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,190
For the next three years,
you'll stay with me,

739
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,800
and there will be no personnel changes.

740
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,740
(Transfer Order)

741
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,440
Three years.

742
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,760
Li Yuchun?

743
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,840
So, he's still
under Yang Yan's command?

744
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,150
Lord Wei, although Yang Yan
is your adopted son,

745
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,110
you still can't be
so biased towards him.

746
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
How insolent!

747
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,630
How long has it been?

748
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,590
Quite a while.

749
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,320
It must be hard for the chief
to accept it.

750
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,990
After all, he's an A+.

751
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,470
These past few days,

752
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,920
he'll surely be upset.

753
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,150
We should hold off

754
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,510
on the transfer for now.

755
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,750
I'm a bit reluctant to leave the chief.

756
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,470
People strive for higher positions,

757
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,240
and water flows to lower places, right?

758
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,070
Well, with this development,

759
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,590
I'll be Gold Gong Song,

760
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,590
and you'll be

761
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,990
Silver Gong Zhu.

762
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,680
That's right.

763
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,800
Every banquet ends.

764
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,150
Let's invite him
to the Imperial Office of Music.

765
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,070
Who? The chief?

766
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,960
Why are you still sitting there?

767
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,800
- No.
- Come here.

768
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,470
Did I see it wrong?

769
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,400
Why is he smiling?

770
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,070
He's just acting tough.

771
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,470
Then it's settled.

772
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,590
(Breeze Hall)
We'll call each other brothers.

773
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,190
Anyone who dares to bully you

774
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,110
is bullying Breeze Hall.

775
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,150
I'll never let them off.

776
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,240
Call each other brothers?

777
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,590
Just his final plea for him to stay.

778
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,070
From now on, work hard with me.

779
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,880
I'll train you with all my might.

780
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:57,830
What?

781
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,920
Work hard?

782
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,400
His final...

783
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,290
Why are you two still sitting there?

784
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,310
Get to work.

785
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,160
Alright.

786
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,070
Later, pick a place,

787
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,760
and we'll have a good drink.

788
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,720
My treat.

789
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,030
Yes, Chief.

790
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,440
What did you just call me?

791
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,870
Yuchun.

792
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,680
Yuchun.

793
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,280
Right.

794
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Ningyan.

795
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,590
Ningyan.

796
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,590
(Breeze Hall)

797
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,470
What's going on?

798
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,630
Did I hear that wrong?

799
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,630
What's going on?

800
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,470
I want to know what's going on too.

801
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,470
Let's go.

802
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,870
Gold Gong Song.

803
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,350
Do I still have a chance to be
a Gold Gong?

804
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,360
Actually, I think
it's nice to stay with us...

805
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,120
How about

806
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,070
we go drink?

807
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,590
I just want to be quiet for a while.

808
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,820
(Go Straight)

809
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,670
Lord Wei, please calm down.

810
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,920
I spoke out of turn.

811
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,760
Since you have made a decision,

812
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,600
I will

813
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,150
follow your orders.

814
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,990
But

815
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,960
may I ask

816
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,320
why you chose Li Yuchun?

817
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,150
Xu Qi'an is quick-witted

818
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
and doesn't follow rigid rules

819
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,150
but his own heart.

820
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,080
Therefore,

821
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,670
he needs a rigid and disciplined person
as a superior.

822
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,840
Li Yuchun is a person

823
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,840
who won't tolerate anything amiss.

824
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
If it were any one of you,

825
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,510
you'd have had conflicts with him.

826
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,150
That may be true,

827
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:06,590
but Li Yuchun is just a Silver Gong.

828
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,840
How could Xu Qi'an
be willing to follow him?

829
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,840
He will.

830
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,100
They

831
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,700
(You live off the people's resources.)

832
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,580
(You can't fool the heavens.)
are like-minded.

833
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,630
Since you've chosen me,

834
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,760
you must do things my way.

835
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,960
As a Guardian,

836
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,560
you cannot take bribes
or pervert the law.

837
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,150
You cannot disrespect your superiors,

838
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,110
nor can you bully the common people.

839
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,870
Otherwise,

840
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,320
even if you are A+,

841
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,990
and even if one day

842
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:45,070
you stand higher than A+,

843
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,990
I will never tolerate you.

844
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,320
I will remember

845
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,150
your words in my heart.

846
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,760
In that case,

847
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
I can rest assured.

848
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,160
Today,

849
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,400
let's not discuss business

850
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,240
and only drink.

851
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,820
Who will play with me?

852
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,290
- Come on.
- Rock, Paper, Scissors.

853
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,510
From now on, at Breeze Hall,

854
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,280
I've got your back. Come on.

855
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,440
One day at Breeze Hall

856
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,920
is enough to make it forever.

857
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,470
Are there any other games?

858
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,820
(Unmatched Beauty)

859
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,310
Come here.

860
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Get to work

861
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,390
as I just ordered.

862
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,250
