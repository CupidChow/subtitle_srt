and Secretary Xu

66
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,710
have both been taken away.

Jiuzhi.

68
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,990
I didn't expect

69
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,110
you could convince the Guardians.

70
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,990
Mr. Zhu, you flatter me.

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,670

72

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
Very good.

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,520
He's a talent.

77
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,150
Tell me.

78
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,030
How did we not notice him earlier?

79
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,180
Mr. Zhu, it's not too late now.

80
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Of course not.

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,660
Do no wrong,

82
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,820
and fear no Guardians.

83
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,020
Do no wrong,

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,180
and fear no

85
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,020
Guardians.

86
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,660
Enough.

87
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,500
Stop practicing.

88
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,860
Otherwise, you'll break

89
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,220
all our plates.

90
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
But this is very effective.

91
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,380
Look, I can now easily catch this
with my bare hands.

92
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,940
I understand your intentions.

93
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,420
Who wouldn't want to be a Guardian?

94
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,220
Being a Guardian

95
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
has always been my dream.

96
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,300
But to be one, you need someone
to recommend you,

97
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,860
and you have to go
through layers of assessment.

98
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,740
Back then,

99
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,700
I spent hundreds
of liang of silver to try.

100
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,780
What happened later?

101
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,420
I was scammed by a fraud.

102
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,500
Listen to me.

103
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,900
Just stay steady

104
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,500
and be a constable
at the County Government.

105
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
They're Guardians,

106
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,020
yet I'm just a worker.

107
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,380
No, I have to think of a way.

108
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,420
Ningyan.

109
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,220
Ningyan.

110
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,420
Why are you only here now?

111
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,580
Good news.

112
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,660
The County Governor wants to reward you.

113
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,060
It's a big reward.

114
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,740
Chief,

115
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,380
what does this mean?

116
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,460
It's your reward.

117
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,420
Shut the door.

118
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,420
What's going on?

119
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,780
The Governor ordered it.

120
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,900
At any cost,

121
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,780
we will create the best environment
for you to gain merit.

122
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,060
From today on,

123
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,700
everyone in our yamen
will be Ningyan's protector.

124
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,380
No one will disturb you.

125
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,940
If you need anything, just tell me.

126
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,740
I'll provide supplies for you regularly.

127
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,180
You just focus

128
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
on solving cases.

129
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,260
Okay?

130
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,180
Sorry.

131
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,300
Leave me a living creature!

132
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,780
Can Bo stay with me?

133
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,620
Open it.

134
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,860
What are you standing there for?

135
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,740
Get some locks.

136
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,380
Seal all the doors and windows.

137
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,220
Hurry up.

138
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,140
Bo.

139
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,180
The Dafeng is not worth it.

140
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,340
(Xu Residence, three days later)

141
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:17,900
Father.

142
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,180
It's been several days.

143
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,580
Why hasn't Ningyan come back?

144
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,140
I'll go to the government to check.

145
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,260
They can't use him like this.

146
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,780
He's a young man.

147
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,420
He should be gaining experience.

148
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,460
Is he still a child?

149
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,500
Stop worrying.

150
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,340
It's nothing serious.

151
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,580
What happened?

152
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,700
What's wrong, kiddo?

153
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,460
Who bullied our child?

154
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
What happened?

155
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,660
Don't, don't.

156
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,100
Don't cry.

157
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,980
I can't stand this.

158
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,060
What happened?

159
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,260
What's wrong?

160
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,100
Who bullied you?

161
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,980
Forget it.

162
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm not eating anymore.

163
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,620
I'm going to rest in my room.

164
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,220
Go on. Go rest.

165
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,580
By the way,

166
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,700
Ningyan,

167
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,980
I'll call you when it's time to work.

168
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,220
Call me?

169
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,780
Never call me again.

170
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,980
Not even if the king of heaven comes.

171
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,380
Ningyan.

172
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,940
Uncle Pingzhi.

173
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,700
Hurry and stop him!

174
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,700
Mr. Wang.

175
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,060
- Long time no see.
- Mr. Xu, I hope you're doing well.

176
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,420
Ningyan.

177
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,420
How's it going?

178
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,940
How's the rest?

179
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,060
Rest?

180
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,140
I haven't even touched my bed.

181
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,260
How can I rest?

182
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,040
Yeah.

183
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,160
The capable do more work.

184
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,260
The capable do more work.

185
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,700
Don't worry.

186
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,260
I've told the County Governor.

187
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,380
Starting today,

188
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,840
you don't need to go
to the yamen.

189
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,940
- Really?
- Really.

190
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,780
Just handle things at home.

191
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,820
It'd be convenient.

192
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,420
I've brought over the case files.

193
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,540
Come on.

194
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,540
Uncle Pingzhi.

195
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,140
No, no, wait.

196
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,980
Mr. Wang,

197
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,460
this is not right.

198
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,500
Government business

199
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,980
shouldn't be handled at home.

200
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,380
Mr. Xu,

201
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,300
don't you know?

202
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,620
He can handle it at home

203
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,500
with pay.

204
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,540
It's not right.

205
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,940
He's my nephew.

206
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,540
Alright, alright.

207
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,500
Sure.

208
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,220
Come on.

209
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,740
Help Mr. Wang bring in the case files.

210
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,940
- This way.
- Slow down.

211
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,300
Why move the case files?

212
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,460
- Move them to the side yard.
- Please come in.

213
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,980
This way. The side yard is this way.

214
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,020
This way, please.

215
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,980
This way.

216
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,660
This way.

217
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,900
Be careful.

218
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,980
Mr. Wang.

219
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,530
- Thank you.
- Hurry up.

220
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,180
Yes, turn right.

221
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,100
After we're done, let's have some tea.

222
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,540
Ningyan,

223
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,460
your family

224
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,260
is amazing.

225
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,340
The Dafeng

226
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,820
is not worth it.

227
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,380
Thanks, Mr. Xu.

228
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,620
(Peace and Prosperity)

229
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,180
Mr. Wang,

230
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,880
does my nephew really have

231
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,820
a knack for solving cases?

232
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,780
Of course.

233
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,620
The County Governor said

234
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,660
as long as Ningyan

235
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,960
reviews the case files properly

236
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,260
during this period

237
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,300
and earns merit for the government

238
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,020
during the inspection,

239
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,220
he'll be

240
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,740
promoted and given a title.

241
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,980
It's perfect now.

242
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,460
After all,
my nephew is a 9th Rank Fighter.

243
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,620
What if he escapes?

244
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,300
You're being too careless.

245
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,860
Yes, yes.

246
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,980
Wouldn't this be

247
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,620
too much?

248
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,500
This is nothing.

249
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,820
He's young, strong, and healthy.

250
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,360
What's the problem with some hardship?

251
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,300
Besides,

252
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,300
if he doesn't seize
such a good opportunity,

253
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,900
he'll definitely regret it.

254
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,380
Mr. Xu, you have great foresight.

255
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,340
I admire you.

256
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,860
You flatter me.

257
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,980
I'm just

258
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,060
- thinking about my nephew's future.
- Yes.

259
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,260
This has nothing to do
with what we just talked about.

260
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,100
Of course.

261
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,060
Ningyan,

262
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,380
you should

263
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,340
just review the case files at home.

264
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,820
Don't waste my good intentions.

265
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,680
Don't worry.

266
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,340
No one will disturb you.

267
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,500
If you need anything,

268
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,860
I'll come
and bring you supplies regularly.

269
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,340
Just focus on the case files

270
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,060
and don't get distracted

271
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,860
in your room.

272
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,780
Okay.

273
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,180
Let's go.

274
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,100
Let's have a drink.

275
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,740
(Today is March 11.)

276
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,560
(I've been reading case files
all night again.)

277
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,100
(If this continues,)

278
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,580
(I'm going to become
a corporate slave again.)

279
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,020
(No way.)

280
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,820
(I cannot just sit here and wait.)

281
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,780
(Step one,)

282
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,220
(escape.)

283
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,780
(Step One: Escape.)

284
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,500
Go back.

285
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,420
(I didn't expect
Uncle has sided with the enemy.)

286
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,900
(But it doesn't matter.)

287
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,340
(He can't watch me 24/7.)

288
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,500
(I was so naive.)

289
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,020
(Uncle would do anything)

290
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,100
(for money.)

291
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,660
Before Mr. Wang arrives,

292
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,740
you can't come out.

293
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,620
(I understand now.)

294
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,900
(Mr. Wang is the key to the problem.)

295
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,060
- Let's go have a drink.
- Let's go.

296
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,280
Ningyan, why are you sleeping here?

297
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,220
Cover yourself up. Don't catch a cold.

298
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,460
(After gradually earning
Mr. Wang's trust,)

299
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,220
(I finally succeeded
in lowering his guard.)

300
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
(Good.)

301
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,980
(Now it's time for my second step.)

302
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,620
(Pretend to be pitiful.)

303
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,980
I don't want to live anymore.

304
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,100
Just put me out of my misery.

305
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Just kill me.

306
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,980
Let me die.

307
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,940
Let me die.

308
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,060
(As expected,)

309
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,340
(he softened.)

310
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,740
(He said he'd take me
somewhere to relax.)

311
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,420
Let's go to the brothel.

312
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,340
(As a good young man,)

313
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,460
(how could he bring me
to a place like this?)

314
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,780
(It clearly doesn't match my style.)

315
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,980
It's okay.

316
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,340
- Don't.
- Ningyan.

317
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,460
You're such a blockhead.

318
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,300
Relax.

319
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,340
Come on, sir.

320
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,260
Live in the moment.

321
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,900
Thank you.

322
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,170
Come on, sit.

323
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,620
(I'll hold back.)

324
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,980
(On March 13,)

325
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,380
(Mr. Wang took me to the brothel
again to enjoy music.)

326
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,220
(He probably thinks I'll fall for this)

327
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,820
(and be eternally grateful.)

328
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,580
(It's just a karaoke bar.)

329
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,860
(I'm too familiar
with the tricks of capitalists.)

330
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,020
(He wants to numb me.)

331
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,420
(It's not gonna happen.)

332
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,520
(But this is still
a work-related social event.)

333
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,740
(I have no choice.)

334
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,940
(On March 14, brothel.)

335
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,880
(I have to say)

336
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,580
- (I found money again.)
- Drink up, sir.

337
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,980
(I find it every day.)

338
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,340
(Isn't this a bit too frequent?)

339
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,540
(On March 15, brothel.)
Give it to me. I'll drink.

340
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,220
- (The money keeps increasing.)
- Drink.

341
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,740
(This is faster than doing business.)

342
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,140
Ningyan,

343
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,120
keep reading the files.

344
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,180
In a few days,
I'll take you out to play.

345
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,540
Sure thing, Chief. I'm on it.

346
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,620
Alright, alright.

347
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,140
(On March 18, brothel.)
(Life has worn down my edges.)

348
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,260
(I can't keep going like this.)

349
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,500
(But I have to play it all the way.)

350
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,980
(Being part of the group is the key
to success in the workplace.)

351
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,180
(On March 20, brothel.)

352
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,980
(Xu Residence)

353
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,980
Father, you first.

354
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,860
Three liang and two qian.

355
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,380
Father,

356
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,340
why is it one liang less
than last month?

357
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,700
I was just released.

358
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,720
I paid a lot for favors.

359
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,700
Next month,

360
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,860
I'll definitely pay more.

361
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,380
There's nothing left. It's all here.

362
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,580
Alright, go sit inside first.

363
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,900
Thank you, dear.

364
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,980
Thank you, dear.

365
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,420
Three liang and five qian.

366
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,660
I copied books and sold my calligraphy.

367
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,260
Five liang and two qian.

368
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,860
Xinnian,

369
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,540
well done. Good.

370
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,380
Go in and sit down.
Get ready for dinner.

371
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,020
Stones?

372
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,900
So much silver.

373
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,920
Where did you get all this money?

374
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,140
Government reward
from case file reading.

375
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,340
Come on, eat.

376
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,100
Thanks, dear. Thanks, dear.

377
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,340
Good boy, eat.

378
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,780
Eat.

379
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,140
Aunt,

380
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,900
my salary was the most,

381
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,620
but you only gave me this?

382
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,180
Give me if you don't want it.

383
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,260
Xinnian is going
to take the Spring Exam.

384
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,860
He needs nutrients.

385
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,340
You two are just Fighters.

386
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,700
Bun slices are good enough.

387
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,940
Xinnian,

388
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,060
here.

389
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,260
Have this too.

390
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,300
Xinnian, what's wrong?

391
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,140
Anything on your mind?

392
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,540
Xinnian,

393
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,020
are you troubled?

394
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,950
An elder at the academy
is going to take office

395
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,900
in Qingzhou.

396
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,180
Tomorrow, all the students are going
to send him off with poems.

397
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,740
But

398
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,660
I haven't written the farewell poem.

399
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,260
If you can't write it, just don't.

400
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,460
That elder is a famous Master.

401
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,660
He excels in poetry.

402
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,700
If he likes my work,

403
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,380
there will be many benefits.

404
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,940
If at that time,

405
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,620
I had befriended this literary elder,

406
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,640
maybe I could've saved you from prison.

407
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,300
I wouldn't have been

408
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,860
at a loss for help.

409
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,860
It's a shame.

410
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,840
Xinnian doesn't have any talent
for poetry.

411
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,780
Your maternal grandfather is the same.

412
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,100
He only writes essays

413
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,780
and has no talent for poetry at all.

414
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,420
What's so funny?

415
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,240
What does that have to do
with my father?

416
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,380
Is it my father's fault?

417
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,660
Xinnian is a Juren now.

418
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,380
It's all thanks to my maiden family.

419
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,500
Because he's like me.

420
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,640
Come on.

421
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,610
Look at Lingyin.

422
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,500
She's like your family.

423
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,260
She still hasn't started her education.

424
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,680
What are you laughing at?

425
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,780
You're the same.

426
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,500
Come on.

427
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,140
Why blame me
when your son can't write poetry?

428
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,740
You're quite loud.

429
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,700
Did I say something wrong?

430
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,220
If you had the ability to study,

431
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,140
you wouldn't have learned martial arts.

432
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,620
What's wrong with that?

433
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,020
Does that mean I have no knowledge?

434
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,060
- Who could be a constable then?
- You're funny.

435
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,500
Who could read the case files then?

436
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,540
Who would seek justice?

437
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,780
Am I underestimating you?

438
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,020
Ningyan.

439
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,060
Dear.

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,860
I'm off today.

441
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,980
- Let's have a battle later.
- Did I say it wrong?

442
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,540
Stop.

443
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,260
Sit down and eat.

444
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,060
Write a poem and let me hear it then.

445
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,820
It's just a poem. That's easy.

446
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,720
Alone in a foreign land,

447
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,740
I suffer nostalgia even more
on this festive day.

448
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,340
- Is this a poem?
- Yes.

449
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,380
Eat.

450
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,420
Alone in a foreign land,

451
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,540
I suffer nostalgia even more
on this festive day.

452
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,220
Alone

453
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,340
in a foreign land,

454
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,100
I suffer nostalgia even more

455
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,500
on this festive day.

456
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,060
What a good poem!

457
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,540
It's simply divine.

458
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,900
You...

459
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,020
When did you start writing poetry?

460
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,900
When did I say I couldn't write poetry?

461
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,860
Is this poem good?

462
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,860
Is it a good poem?

463
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,900
It's very beautiful.

464
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,100
So, all along,

465
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,380
the scholar in our family
is actually Ningyan.

466
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,380
Had I known,
I would've sent you to study

467
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,300
and sent Cijiu to learn martial arts.

468
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,940
But it's Ningyan

469
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,640
who wrote this poem.

470
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,570
- Just listen.
- I suffer nostalgia even more

471
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,040
- Cijiu, don't claim it as your own.
- on this festive day.

472
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,380
This is not what scholars do, right?

473
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,580
It's not good enough for that.

474
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,940
Ningyan, can I borrow this poem?

475
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,080
I will definitely credit you

476
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:54,940
as the author.

477
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,740
Ningyan,

478
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,940
eat more.

479
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,260
Eat more meat.

480
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,060
Martial artists should eat more meat.

481
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,100
Come on.

482
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,820
I'll feed you.

483
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,500
Alright, alright.

484
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,100
Take this poem and show it off.

485
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,060
Go show it off in front of people.

486
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,340
Sure.

487
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,820
Alone

488
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,140
in a foreign land,

489
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,740
I suffer nostalgia even more

490
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,420
on this festive day.

491
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,780
Good poem.

492
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,940
Ningyan,

493
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:35,260
what about the last three lines?

494
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,180
I have case files to read.

495
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,460
I'll head back first.

496
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,200
I'll read them with you.

497
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,520
I'll read them with you.

498
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,260
Is there any student

499
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,860
who would like to recite a poem

500
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,900
(Zhang Shen, Elder, 4th Rank Gent)
to say goodbye to Ziyang Scholar?

501
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,740
(Yang Gong, 4th Rank Gent)
Even your poem got rejected.

502
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,500
Let's not go embarrass ourselves.

503
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,340
Sir,

504
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,940
I have a poem.

505
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,060
Alone in a foreign land,

506
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,660
I suffer nostalgia even more
on this festive day.

507
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,340
Fear not you've no admirers.

508
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,420
There's someone

509
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,380
who loves your song.

510
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,460
(Li Mubai, 4th Rank Gent)
Good poem!

511
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,180
What a good poem!

512
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,380
Really good.

513
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,180
Good poem.

514
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,940
Fear not you've no admirers.

515
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,660
There's someone who loves your song.

516
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,940
Cijiu,

517
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,860
why is there only half a poem?

518
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,340
That's what it is.

519
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,300
Only half?

520
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,780
It's okay.

521
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,860
It's okay.

522
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,420
Half a poem

523
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,260
is good enough.

524
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,020
Xu Cijiu,

525
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,820
does this poem have a name?

526
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,620
No.

527
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,020
Then let's call it

528
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,320
Seeing Yang Gong off to Qingzhou

529
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,340
at Mianyang Pavilion.

530
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,220
Fear not you've no admirers.

531
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,740
There's someone who loves your song.

532
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,700
He actually linked the poem
to his name.

533
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,020
Truly lucky for him.

534
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,260
When I first read this poem,

535
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,300
I found it extraordinary.

536
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,260
It'll surely be passed down
for generations.

537
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:34,980
Xu Cijiu,

538
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,380
come here.

539
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,980
What's wrong, Master?

540
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,940
It's such a good poem.

541
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,300
Why didn't you show it to me earlier?

542
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,940
Actually,

543
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,300
I didn't write this poem.

544
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
Someone else did.

545
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,620
Who?

546
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,160
Is it one of our academy's students?

547
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,260
It's my older brother.

548
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,100
Your older brother?

549
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,260
Why have I never heard you
mention him before?

550
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,460
What's his name?

551
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,700
Who is his Master?

552
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,340
My older brother is Xu Ningyan.

553
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,940
He's been studying classics at home

554
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,020
but hasn't taken a master.

555
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,780
Come on.

556
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,100
Sit down.

557
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,980
Alright, alright.

558
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,900
Sit down.

559
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,860
Have some tea.

560
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,220
I've suddenly developed an interest
in taking a disciple.

561
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,340
Today, I'm free.

562
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,020
Why not take me to your house

563
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,180
to meet your older brother?

564
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,820
Xu Cijiu,

565
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,420
where does your older brother live?

566
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,180
I'd like to visit him,

567
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,780
have a deep conversation,

568
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,100
and discuss the art of Go.

569
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,620
Go is not the mainstream.

570
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,940
Scholars must first understand

571
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
theories and strategies

572
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,220
to cultivate themselves.

573
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,380
Masters,

574
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,500
my older brother is not a scholar.

575
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,860
He is a Fighter.

576
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,300
A Fighter?

577
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,280
What are you laughing at?

578
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,660
You lousy Go player.

579
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,500
You've never won

580
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,180
against Wei Yuan.

581
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,660
How shameless!

582
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,580
Shut up!

583
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,280
Don't bring up Wei Yuan in front of me.

584
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,100
I've always valued talents.

585
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,620
I've decided

586
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,620
to take this student.

587
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,260
You're just after his poetry.

588
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,980
How shameless!

589
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,520
My righteous energy

590
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,540
will shock you to death.

591
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,700
Good! I'm not afraid of you!

592
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,960
I can turn leaves into troops.

593
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,900
I'll burn you!

594
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,900
I'll shock you!

595
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,840
I'm not afraid of you!

596
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,060
How impressive!

597
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,020
Uncle Pingzhi.

598
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,940
Are you okay, Uncle?

599
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,780
I'm fine.

600
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,060
Totally fine.

601
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,380
I'm totally fine.

602
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,740
Not bad.

603
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,900
There's progress.

604
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,260
But if you want to take it further,

605
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,700
you'll have to reach the Qi Stage.

606
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,420
The Qi Stage?

607
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,980
It's different from the Essence Stage.

608
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,180
To reach the 8th Rank Qi Stage,

609
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,660
you must nourish yourself
with marrow liquid

610
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,660
or find a 7th Rank Spirit Stage expert

611
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,900
to open your Heaven Gate.

612
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,820
Take a deep breath.

613
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,180
Back in the day,

614
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,820
when I was in the Battle
of Linyuan Pass,

615
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,540
I risked my life

616
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,380
and accumulated a bit of military merit.

617
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,100
I asked experts from the army
to open my Heaven Gate.

618
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,340
But now, in this peaceful era,

619
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,680
how can you gain military merit?

620
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,900
How can you reach the Qi Stage?

621
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,900
Yes.

622
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,780
If you don't reach the Qi Stage,

623
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,740
does that mean

624
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,100
you can't start a family?

625
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,660
I'm getting old.

626
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,100
My only wish

627
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,820
is to see you

628
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,380
get married and have kids.

629
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,020
That's the only way
to honor your late parents.

630
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,140
No, wait a second.

631
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,140
What does the Qi Stage have to do
with starting a family?

632
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,380
Of course, it's related.

633
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,940
If you start a family

634
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,180
at the Essence Stage,

635
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,260
you'll be stuck here forever.

636
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,140
It'll be extremely hard
to improve your skills.

637
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,860
Isn't there another way?

638
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,900
There is

639
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,500
another way.

640
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,620
Just spend money.

641
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,900
Spend money?

642
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,460
Money can get you

643
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,420
the marrow liquid and experts.

644
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
Uncle Pingzhi,

645
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,740
give me back my money.

646
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,980
I want to reach the Qi Stage.

647
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,060
I want to start a family.

648
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,740
When did I take your money?

649
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,300
Didn't you say you'd save it for me?

650
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,900
Now I want to take it. Give it to me.

651
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,320
I handed it in as my salary.

652
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,020
Did you hide it in your shoes?
I saw it.

653
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,280
When did I hide it in my shoes?

654
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,980
I don't have any money.
No more nonsense.

655
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,460
How could I do such dirty things?

656
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,860
Don't ruin my reputation.

657
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,340
I need to start a family.

658
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,700
Father,

659
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,620
I've almost finished plowing the land.

660
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,840
The weather is so nice today.

661
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,500
How about you take me
and Lingyin out for a stroll?

662
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,460
I have something to do.

663
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,460
What is it?

664
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,900
Drinking with colleagues again?

665
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,140
You have a lot of money.

666
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,220
No, no.

667
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,140
It's official business today.

668
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,460
It's about work.

669
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,700
Lingyue, you too.

670
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,580
You've been running out all the time.

671
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,300
Is our house no longer
big enough for you?

672
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,220
No, Mother.

673
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,180
We're running out of flour,

674
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,660
so I wanted to go buy some.

675
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,140
Let Ningyan go with you.

676
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,900
Me?

677
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,140
I need to read the case files.

678
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,400
I can't leave without Mr. Wang.

679
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,240
Stop right there.

680
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,780
Do you want to be locked up again?

681
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,060
Bring me the lock.

682
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,900
Wait.

683
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,380
Ladies,

684
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,340
let's go.

685
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,340
Little one, hop on.

686
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,100
Ningyan.

687
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,460
Return early.

688
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,620
- Return early.
- Be careful.

689
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,260
Return early.

690
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,070
Give it to me.

691
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,380
- Give me one.
- I want one too.

692
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,180
(Gu Ruohan the Swordsman)

693
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,600
Sir, I'll have one serving.

694
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,220
- Alright.
- I want this one.

695
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,780
- Little one.
- You'll all get it.

696
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,560
Little one,

697
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,580
you can't eat anymore.

698
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,900
You've had two servings.

699
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,060
Sis.

700
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,100
Sis.

701
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,060
Control her.

702
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,270
No pushing. You'll all get it.

703
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,340
(Gu Ruohan the Swordsman)
You've had enough.

704
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,820
Let's go. You can have it tomorrow.

705
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,220
Little girl, it's all here.

706
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,300
What flavor would you like?

707
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,260
Your last one.

708
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,490
Here, take it.

709
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,640
Come on, take it. Let's go.

710
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,800
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.

711
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,020
Take it slow.

712
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,940
You finished another jar.

713
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,980
Sis,

714
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
thanks to you.

715
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,900
Or I wouldn't have been able
to handle this little foodie.

716
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,860
She just treats people differently.

717
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,500
She knows you'll spoil her.

718
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,180
By the way,

719
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,520
I saw you stay at the book stall
for quite a while.

720
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,480
What were you reading?

721
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,140
There were some calligraphy
and poetry collections.

722
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,580
Though I'm not a scholar like Xinnian,

723
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,420
I still wanted to appreciate some poems.

724
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,020
You like poetry?

725
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,540
Not really.

726
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,540
Those poetry collections are nothing

727
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,180
compared to the lines you casually said.

728
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,140
By the way,

729
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,020
Ningyan,

730
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
when did you start writing poetry?

731
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,620
You're really a different person now.

732
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,300
The old you

733
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,620
could never have written poetry.

734
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,820
Then what did I use to do?

735
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,100
I don't know.

736
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,500
You don't know?

737
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,060
You used

738
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,280
to be silent.

739
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,660
Father invited you several times,

740
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,620
but you still refused
to join us for meals.

741
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,700
But now,

742
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,260
you eat the most at every meal

743
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,500
and dare to bicker with Mother.

744
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,860
You're really outrageous.

745
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,900
But it's made us like a family now.

746
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,260
Candied hawthorn!

747
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,220
Sweet candied hawthorn!

748
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,940
Ningyan, candied hawthorn.

749
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,380
Do you still want it?

750
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,620
Ningyan can't help you.

751
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,860
The candied hawthorn is sweet.

752
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,220
Don't you care about your teeth?

753
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,180
How about this? Say something nice.

754
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,980
Please.

755
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,340
Ningyan...

756
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,060
Alright, I'll go buy it for you.

757
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,980
Wait for me here.

758
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,850
- Look.
- A butterfly!

759
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,940
Look, over there.

760
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,800
A butterfly!

761
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,660
Over there!

762
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,140
A butterfly!

763
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,940
A butterfly!

764
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,740
Look.

765
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,220
(Zhou Li,
Vice Minister of Revenue's son)

766
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,260
I want to swing.

767
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,380
Lingyue, push me.

768
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,060
Don't go, little girl.

769
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm catching butterflies for you.

770
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,300
No need.

771
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,900
Of course, I need to.

772
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,300
Where are you going?

773
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,020
You're a bad man.

774
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,780
Little girl,

775
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,380
I caught a butterfly for you.

776
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,220
Look.

777
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,540
It's dead.

778
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,620
Don't be afraid.

779
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,250
Don't move.

780
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,660
Come, let me touch you.

781
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,020
Let me touch you. Hurry.

782
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,740
Candied hawthorn!

783
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,500
Candied hawthorn!

784
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,300
Sweet candied hawthorn!

785
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,220
Where are they?

786
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,780
What's going on?

787
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,660
Do you remember what I told you?

788
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,980
Do you know how to cherish beauty?

789
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,300
And you.

790
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,660
They wanted live butterflies,
but you caught a dead one.

791
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,620
Learn from this.

792
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,540
Let me through. Excuse me.

793
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,460
Little girl.

794
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,140
Move aside.

795
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,540
Come here.

796
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,460
Mr. Zhou.

797
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,140
Little one, don't be afraid.
I'm here. Take it.

798
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,420
Ningyan.

799
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,900
Lingyue, take Lingyin and go.

800
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,940
Go!

801
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,160
Sir.

802
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,780
I'm sorry. I was too agitated earlier.

803
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,700
I'm so sorry.

804
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,640
I ruined your clothes.

805
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,480
Go away.

806
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,100
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

807
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,940
So many people.

808
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,060
Hurry to the yamen with me.

809
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,020
Sir,

810
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,420
my uncle is Xu Pingzhi,
Baihu of the Imperial Guards.

811
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,780
Those two were my sisters.

812
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,100
What did they do to offend you?

813
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,380
Xu Pingzhi?

814
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,700
The one

815
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,660
who lost the tax silver?

816
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,420
Yes.

817
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,960
Oh, you know my uncle.

818
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,820
This will be easy.

819
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,540
I can bring my uncle to visit you later.

820
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,940
Go to hell!

821
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,940
Disable him!

822
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,140
Disable him!

823
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,060
Who's seeking justice?

824
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,380
- Lingyue?
- Mr. Wang!

825
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,700
Ningyan is in trouble.

826
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,860
Please go rescue him now.

827
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,380
Also, go notify my father.

828
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,720
He's drinking at Mr. Li's house.

829
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,940
Sir,

830
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,300
my sisters and I only argued with you.

831
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,140
No need to be so violent, right?

832
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,580
Sever the tendons

833
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,180
in his hands and feet.

834
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,100
Don't come any closer.

835
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,700
Otherwise, I'll kill him.

836
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,260
You...

837
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,660
Do you know

838
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,380
who I am?

839
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,660
I don't care who you are.

840
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,220
Let me tell you something.

841
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,820
Even a common man has his limits.

842
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,060
When a common man gets angry...

843
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,540
- I...
- Stop!

844
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,320
Move aside!

845
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,380
Who dares to commit a crime

846
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,740
on the street
in front of the government?

847
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,700
Get him arrested!

848
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,260
I will

849
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,660
have him

850
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,940
torn apart!

851
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,820
- Take them away!
- Yes.

852
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:11,460
What does this mean?

853
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,410
Let go of me!

854
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,140
- Let go of me!
- Why did you provoke him?

855
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,380
He's the Vice Minister of Revenue's son.

856
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,540
Are you blind?

857
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,860
Don't you know who I am?

858
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,740
I have face blindness.

859
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,220
I don't recognize people.

860
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,540
If you have a problem,

861
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,380
go tell the County Governor.

862
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,380
Let's go. Take them away.

863
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,620
Scoundrel!

864
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,530
- Let go of me!
- Move!

865
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,780
Have you notified my uncle?

866
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,060
Someone has gone to tell him.

867
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,340
Think of a way out.

868
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,220
Let's go back first.

869
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,380
(Huadeng House)

870
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,260
You're really a troublemaker.

871
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,180
(Open and Righteous)

872
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,020
Ningyan.

873
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,660
Where's Lingyin?

874
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,140
She was startled

875
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,780
and fell asleep in the side hall.

876
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,540
My Lord.

877
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,120
Take her to the back.

878
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,460
Whatever happens, don't come out.

879
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,780
Yes, let's go.

880
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,980
Who told you to leave?

881
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:07,980
Stop right there!

882
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,620
Go away.

883
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,540
Isn't this Mr. Zhou?

884
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,620
How is your father?

885
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,540
He attempted to murder me
in the streets.

886
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,780
Arrest him now!

887
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,780
That's an exaggeration.

888
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,660
Mr. Zhou,

889
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,860
what an unfortunate coincidence.

890
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,940
We're all family here.

891
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,820
You're magnanimous.

892
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,220
Don't bother with this small fry.

893
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,700
Don't give me that.

894
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,640
Are you going to arrest him?

895
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,680
You won't arrest him, huh?

896
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,180
Fine.

897
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,320
I'll arrest him myself.

898
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,260
Someone, bring that brat out here!

899
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,020
Don't, Mr. Zhou.

900
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,820
I am a government official.

901
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,620
I will handle this according to the law.

902
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,100
Someone.

903
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,860
I have

904
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,260
an indictment

905
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,580
against you, Mr. Zhou,

906
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,660
for bullying a good woman.

907
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,300
The complainant is Xu Lingyue.

908
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,980
(Complainant: Xu Lingyue)

909
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,100
Mr. Zhou,

910
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,700
may I speak with you privately?

911
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,300
Mr. Zhou,

912
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,940
during the Year of Capital Inspection,

913
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,380
if this goes to the Emperor,

914
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,020
it might affect your father.

915
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,860
Don't you think so?

916
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,700
Go to hell!

917
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,180
Jiuzhi, are you alright?

918
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,460
What are you waiting for?

919
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,380
Arrest him!

920
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,620
Zhou Li,

921
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,460
you injured someone in our government.

922
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,420
Someone!

923
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,900
Arrest him!

924
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,780
Zhu,

925
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,540
how dare you touch me?

926
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,700
Do you think I won't?

927
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,820
Good.

928
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,260
You're a mere County Governor.

929
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,460
You've got some guts.

930
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Tell my father

931
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,300
someone dares to despise him.

932
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,460
Yes.

933
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,100
This is bad.

934
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,660
That little brat Zhou Li

935
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,000
is probably going to get backup.

936
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,340
It looks like you're doomed today.

937
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,580
Just leave.

938
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,520
Leave now.

939
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,780
Someone will escort you out.

940
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,780
The further, the better.

941
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,620
Go.

942
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,460
If I leave,

943
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,620
what will happen to my uncle?

944
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,260
Now, it's too urgent

945
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,540
to think about that.

946
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,320
Just take any chance to escape.

947
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,860
Chief,

948
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,340
lend me one liang of silver.

949
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,620
One liang?

950
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,580
That's too much.

951
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,500
I don't think I have it.

952
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,220
It's all I have.

953
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,820
It should be enough for your journey.

954
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,660
It's enough.

955
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,580
Now, ride to my house.

956
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,300
In the cabinet by my bed,

957
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,380
find a blue-covered book.

958
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,360
Don't get the wrong one.

959
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,820
Take it to the Astronomical Bureau

960
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,300
and find a girl named Caiwei.

961
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,340
Just tell her this:

962
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,420
Xu Qi'an is in trouble.

963
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,260
Hurry and help.

964
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,780
Alright.

965
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,620
Wait.

966
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,700
The Astronomical Bureau

967
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,100
is not a place for people like me.

968
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,060
If something happens to me,

969
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,780
no one will repay you.

970
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,860
If it's done,

971
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,480
my salary next month will be all yours.

972
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,980
The money

973
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,420
doesn't matter,

974
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,700
but remember to return it to me.

975
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,540
- Yellow?
- Blue cover.

976
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,380
Blue cover. Alright.

977
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,300
Ningyan.

978
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,940
Don't worry.

979
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,060
I'll take care of it.

980
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,900
Mr. Zhou,

981
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,180
calm down.

982
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,940
It's not that big of a deal.

983
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,020
How about this?

984
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,500
He'll suffer 20 strokes of the cane

985
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:53,310
to vent your anger.

986
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,180
If that's not enough,

987
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,340
I'll give him fifty.

988
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,700
I want him dead!

989
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,620
You...

990
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,800
The Ministry of Justice is here.

991
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,300
All bystanders, step aside!

992
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,420
Anyone who interferes

993
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,100
will be convicted too!

994
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,100
Ministry...

995
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,340
Ministry of Justice?

996
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,020
Xu Qi'an.

997
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,780
You brat!

998
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,600
Xu Qi'an!

999
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,020
Don't pretend you can't hear me!

1000
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,060
Come out!

1001
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,980
Take him!

1002
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,220
Ningyan!

1003
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,340
- My Lord.
- Lingyue.

1004
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,580
He humiliated me first.

1005
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,900
Ningyan was only stopping him.

1006
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,380
Why are you convicting my brother?

1007
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,460
I'll decide

1008
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,420
whether he's guilty or not.

1009
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,860
- Step aside!
- My Lord.

1010
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,820
- Lingyue!
- You...
