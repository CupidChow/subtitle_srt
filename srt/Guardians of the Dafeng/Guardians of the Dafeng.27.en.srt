bully the weak,

48

only preying on defenseless commoners.

We who practice martial arts

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,200
have a duty to uphold justice
and eliminate evil.

51
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,360
That is my...

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
That is

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,920
the true spirit

00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,200
of righteousness among us.

55
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,390
Well said.

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,800
A heroine like you

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,110
is rare in my life.

58
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,360
I didn't expect

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,960
to meet a man of such sincerity
in the capital.

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,200
It is truly my fortune

61
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,110
to know you today.

62
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,590
- Come on.
- Come on.

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
Don't mess around.

64
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,390
It seems

65
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,640
that the thing in your box
is no ordinary item.

66
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,590
It resonates with the Qi force
of my spear.

67
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,830
You have a sharp eye.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,360
As they say,

69
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,960
"A heroic sword in a jade box"

70
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,800
"is tempered by a hundred times."

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
This treasured sword

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
has remained in its box for ten years.

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,520
To nurture its sword energy?

74
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Exactly.

75
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,660
For these ten years,

76
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,520
the sword hasn't left its scabbard
in the box,

77
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,890
and the box hasn't left my hand.

78
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,240
I nourish it with my Qi Force every day

79
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,150
awaiting the day when it can break free

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,110
with full sword energy.

81
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,270
Why go through such trouble?

82
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,200
Convenience matters
when wandering the martial world.

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,080
Does this box

84
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,960
hold some

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,040
hidden mystery?

86
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,870
To prevent dust.

87
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,200
Extraordinary indeed.

88
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,040
You've nurtured this sword
for ten years.

89
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,920
It must be extraordinary once drawn,

90
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,270
radiating with brilliance.

91
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
One day, it will surely serve
a great purpose.

92
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,080
I have a duel with someone,

93
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,320
and this sword

94
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,390
is meant for that person.

95
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,430
That person must be a vile villain.

96
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,520
Then I wish you

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,920
success in avenging

98
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,960
your grievances.

99
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,690
Thank you for your kind words.

100
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,270
Your spear

101
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,440
also seems extraordinary.

102
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,000
You have a keen eye.

103
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,230
This spear was forged
from the Tianyu divine iron.

104
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,590
It's razor-sharp

105
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,640
and indestructible.

106
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Even a 4th Rank Fighter

107
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,520
cannot easily damage it.

108
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,080
To be honest,

109
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,680
I am also diligently training my skills

110
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,150
for the day I can battle my enemy.

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,200
With such determination,

112
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,590
you will surely

113
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
kill your enemy.

114
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,770
Thank you for your blessing.

115
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,440
I wonder whose is stronger,

116
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
your sword or my spear.

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,640
That's easy to settle.

118
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,000
After I defeat my foe,

119
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,470
perhaps you and I

120
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,520
can have a friendly duel.

121
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:08,870
It's a deal.

122
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,120
It's a deal.

123
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:11,920
Cijiu,

124
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,760
isn't this too exaggerated?

125
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,200
The wind is strong tonight.

126
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,320
It's better to be safe than sorry.

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,080
Ningyan, hold the fuse tight.

128
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't let go. I'll finish soon.

129
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,320
When have I ever let you down?

130
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,790
You're the one I trust least.

131
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,520
In that case, go to your father.

132
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,150

Lanterns?

167
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,440
Is it Xu?

168
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,350
My Lady, hurry up.

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,910
But such extravagance

170
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,910
isn't like him.

171
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,400
My Lady,

172
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,570
(See you at Meixi Bridge)
There are words.

173
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,790
It's him, My Lady.

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,230
Your Highness,

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,640
who did you think it was?

189
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,710
Lake Villa.

190
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,160
How am I back here?

191
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,990
How did I return?

192
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,310
I remember...

193
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,510
I seemed to have gone to Xu Mansion,

194
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,400
and I think

195
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,200
I saw Xu Qi'an.

196
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,870
Indeed, Mr. Xu brought you back.

197
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,830
Really? He's alive?

198
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:53,990
Yes.

199
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,110
Mr. Xu took the Elixir of Life
from the Astronomical Bureau,

200
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,400
so he survived,

201
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,590
narrowly escaping death.

202
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,560
Didn't I write to you?

203
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,350
That's wonderful.

204
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,520
That's wonderful.

205
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,700
- That's wonderful.
- Your Highness.

206
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,200
Please calm down.

207
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,990
The physician said you were exhausted,

208
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,960
and strong emotions

209
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,590
might cause you to faint again

210
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,550
like last night.

211
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,990
I fainted last night?

212
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,590
Mr. Xu, this...

213
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,870
What's wrong with the princess?

214
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,630
It's nothing. She's seen a physician.

215
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,990
The princess is simply exhausted.

216
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,600
She just needs to rest for a few days.

217
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,350
Mr. Xu kept

218
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,750
lifting you and putting you down.

219
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,870
Lifting you and putting you down.

220
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,510
He did this over and over again.

221
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,880
- Get to the point.
- Lifting...

222
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,230
The point is

223
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,040
you refused to let go

224
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,880
no matter what.

225
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,080
Fortunately, at that moment,

226
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,990
Mr. Xu came up with a clever idea,

227
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,960
replacing himself with me,

228
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,450
and only then could he escape.

229
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,680
That's because I was

230
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,870
too exhausted from traveling,

231
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,040
trapped in a nightmare.

232
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,920
There's no other reason.

233
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,080
Your Highness,

234
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
you're awake.

235
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,920
Pull the curtain down.

236
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,590
Why is he still here?

237
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,350
Mr. Xu said he'd wait until you woke up.

238
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,450
He stayed in the guest room last night.

239
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,560
How embarrassing.

240
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,160
I heard the princess just now.

241
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,230
Mr. Xu, you must have misheard it.

242
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,960
The princess has been asleep

243
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,040
and hasn't woken up.

244
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,310
Fine.

245
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,710
I recently upgraded
the chicken powder recipe.

246
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,440
Keep this food for now.

247
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,660
After such a long sleep,

248
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,680
the princess will be starving
when she wakes up.

249
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,560
What's that sound?

250
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,230
There's no sound.

251
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,400
Mr. Xu, are you hearing things?

252
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,320
Mr. Xu,

253
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,230
you're so busy with official duties,

254
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,200
but you still need to rest.

255
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,540
Thank you for your concern.

256
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,630
By the way, Gang,

257
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,800
are you free right now?

258
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
I have something to ask you.

259
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
Yes.

260
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,960
No, I'm not free.

261
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,000
I mean...

262
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,960
If you have something to say,
say it here.

263
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,350
Alright.

264
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,870
Didn't the princess go on a long trip?

265
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,440
When did she return?

266
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,810
The princess returned yesterday...

267
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,400
No, the princess

268
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,400
came back a few days ago.

269
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,800
Then why didn't the princess summon me?

270
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,830
Also,

271
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,160
I thought about it all night
and couldn't figure it out.

272
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,080
Why was the princess
so disheveled last night,

273
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,180
with her clothes in tatters

274
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,960
and no attendants by her side?

275
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,750
That's because the princess...

276
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,400
That's because...

277
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,440
Because

278
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,590
the princess got lost

279
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,470
and ran into a gang of bandits.

280
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,280
Bandits?

281
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,120
Yes.

282
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,830
Those bandits were ferocious

283
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,750
and persistent.

284
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,960
They chased the princess
for three whole streets.

285
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,320
Fortunately, the princess,

286
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
blessed and courageous,

287
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,750
managed to escape unscathed

288
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,280
and found your home.

289
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,110
No wonder

290
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,920
that she cried and ran toward me
as soon as she saw me.

291
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,800
Were those bandits caught?

292
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,990
Rest assured, Mr. Xu.

293
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,110
The bandits have all been apprehended.

294
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,520
That's good.

295
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,200
I thought...

296
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,870
The princess

297
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,040
must have been frightened.

298
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,510
Mr. Xu,

299
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,750
what were you thinking?

300
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,000
Nothing.

301
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,080
I'm glad the princess is fine.

302
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,650
I have to go now.

303
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,750
When the princess wakes up,

304
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,590
tell her I came.

305
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,680
Take care, Mr. Xu.

306
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,630
Your Highness, Mr. Xu has left.

307
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,110
Why did you let him leave?

308
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,830
Did you...

309
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,350
You were just getting to the point.

310
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,560
The point?

311
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,750
Shall I go and bring him back?

312
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,590
Forget it.

313
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,320
He's already gone.

314
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,240
The princess has woken up?

315
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,590
Mr. Xu, what else do you need?

316
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,920
I just heard her voice again.

317
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,990
The princess...

318
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,350
The princess hasn't woken up.

319
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,590
Alright.

320
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,750
I forgot to mention earlier

321
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,710
that this chicken powder is made
from natural ingredients.

322
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,040
It has a shelf life,

323
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,260
so she should consume it soon.

324
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,400
Please let her know.

325
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,200
Understood, Mr. Xu.

326
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,120
Goodbye.

327
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,640
Your Highness,

328
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,200
since Mr. Xu was back,

329
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,830
why didn't you ask him?

330
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,440
You fool.

331
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,470
The timing is off.

332
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,230
Such matters shouldn't be chased after.

333
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,710
Ningyan, can you be quiet?

334
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,030
You've been humming
four songs in a row.

335
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,470
Don't mind me.

336
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,710
Will your friend
stand you up again today?

337
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,400
She'll definitely come.

338
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,560
Xu.

339
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,830
Simu.

340
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,870
Simu.

341
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,830
I'm here.

342
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800

♪People are strange and noisy♪

377
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,540
♪Thankfully, there's still warmth♪

378
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,390
Simu.

379
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,440
Xu.

381
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:57,320
♪And know your uniqueness♪

382
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,230
Miss Wang,

383
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,030
please don't call me Xu.

384
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,400
It's inappropriate.

385
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,960
Alright.

386
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,710
Mr. Xu.

387
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,840
Mr. Xu, what do you need from me?

388
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,040
Nothing.

389
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,310
(You asked me out
for two days straight.)

390
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,840
(You must have something to say.)

391
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,640
(Let's see if you'll ask me to stay.)

392
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,840
Since it's nothing,

393
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,550
I'll take my leave.

394
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,920
Mr. Xu,

395
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,230
see you next time.

396
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,200
(She says she's leaving,)

397
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,070
(but her slow steps)

398
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,400
(reveal her reluctance.)

399
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,840
(Could she be waiting
for Cijiu to stop her?)

400
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,790
(This girl)

401
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,030
(is interesting.)

402
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,470
(This useless fool.)

403
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,790
Miss, please wait.

404
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,160
Who are you?

405
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,960
I am Xu Qi'an,

406
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,980
Xu Cijiu's elder brother.

407
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,990
(Xu Qi'an,)

408
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,400
(Xu's elder brother.)

409
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,390
(He grew up with Xu.)

410
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:27,860
(They're like biological brothers.)

411
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,650
(If I win him over,)

412
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,740
(he might be my breakthrough.)

413
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,880
Elder Xu,

414
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,680
I've long heard of your reputation.

415
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,070
They say you are the most promising

416
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,230
and brilliant Guardian,

417
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,470
and you're bound for greatness.

418
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,750
Meeting you today confirms it.

419
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,310
You truly are an extraordinary

420
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,400
and talented young man.

421
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,270
(A kind word warms the coldest winter.)

422
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,360
(Xinnian,)

423
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,990
(this girl is way)

424
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,710
(out of your league.)

425
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,470
Today, it's not Cijiu
who sought you out.

426
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,880
I need a favor from you,

427
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,030
so I asked Cijiu
to arrange this meeting.

428
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,200
Elder Xu, please tell me.

429
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,070
Since it concerns the Xu Family,

430
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,550
I'll do my utmost

431
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,600
to help.

432
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,790
Thank you, Miss.

433
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,360
For official matters,

434
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,470
I need to access
the Personnel's Library.

435
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,550
Cijiu said

436
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,880
you might have a way.

437
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,960
I see.

438
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,230
I do have a way into the Personnel,

439
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,990
but...

440
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm afraid my limited knowledge

441
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,960
couldn't help you find the files

442
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,510
and might delay your work.

443
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,890
(I was worrying
about having no excuse to act.)

444
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,170
(Now you come seeking my help.)

445
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,710
(But)

446
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,920
(nothing is for free.)

447
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,750
(Let's see if you know the rules.)

448
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,030
(I surely know the rules.)

449
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,440
What you said is indeed a problem.

450
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,160
Though I'd prefer to handle it myself,

451
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,840
as a Guardian,

452
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,430
it's inappropriate for me
to trespass into the Personnel.

453
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,640
What should we do?

454
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,030
How about this?

455
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,840
I'll trouble Xinnian to accompany you.

456
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,280
Well.

457
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,840
Seems it's our only choice.

458
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,160
Thank you for your help, Miss.

459
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,550
It's a mere trifle.

460
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,200
How about this?

461
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,470
I'll first scout the Personnel

462
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,070
to avoid running into my father.

463
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,800
Tomorrow,

464
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,200
I'll wait under the tree
in front of the Personnel.

465
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,310
Take care.

466
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,270
Xi, let's go.

467
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,070
Ningyan, where is she?

468
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,630
Where is she?

469
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,710
She's gone.

470
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,720
You...

471
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,680
What? Is he still following us?

472
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,840
Of course, he's followed us
for three streets.

473
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
I knew it.

474
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,840
Xu must have me in his heart.

475
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,910
What's wrong?

476
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,440
Mr. Xu took quite a tumble.

477
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,070
Slow down.

478
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,960
Slow down a bit.

479
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:27,960
What are you doing?

480
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,550
Sorry.

481
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,510
Come on.

482
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,470
Xinnian, that's enough.

483
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,740
That's a bit much.

484
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,990
Ningyan, you go home.
I have to go. Don't follow me.

485
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,510
Enough already.

486
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,640
They've left.

487
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,710
Why are you stopping me?

488
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,120
I just came to check on you
since I saw you fall.

489
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,920
Why are you being ungrateful?

490
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Sir.

491
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,990
Sorry.

492
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,990
What are you doing here?

493
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,640
If you like her, just tell her.

494
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,750
Your heart is burning like fire,

495
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,340
but outwardly,
you keep her at arm's length.

496
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,230
Are all scholars
this conflicted about this?

497
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,990
Ningyan, what do you know?

498
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,310
Between us,

499
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,120
we are like the sky and the earth.

500
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,400
Nothing can happen.

501
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,510
Why belittle yourself?

502
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,510
Even if you can't do this,

503
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,960
I am a Silver Gong

504
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,310
and also a guest advisor
of two princesses.

505
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,470
I can help you.

506
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,510
What can you do?

507
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,790
Compared to her father,
you're just a pawn.

508
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,120
That's too harsh.

509
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,550
What kind of person is her father

510
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,360
that you're so afraid of him?

511
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,710
Where is your backbone as a scholar?

512
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,790
Where is the spirit of a top student
of Yunlu Academy?

513
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,470
He's Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen.

514
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,990
Xinnian, you can still chase her.

515
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,300
(Self-disciplined and Pure)

516
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:55,020
Yuan Xiong impeaches you
for accepting bribes.

517
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,470
State Duke Cao impeaches you
for embezzling military provisions.

518
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,470
And this.

519
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,940
They all are impeaching you.

520
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,680
There are so many impeachment memorials

521
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,990
that I can't even
finish reading them today.

522
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,990
Wang Zhenwen,

523
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,030
you've been the Prime Minister
of the Cabinet for years.

524
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,600
How many things have you done

525
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,070
that I don't know about?

526
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,060
(Memorial: From Song Shanchang,
State Duke Cao)

527
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,960
Father,

528
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,880
I heard the State Duke Cao
has impeached him again.

529
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,200
It seems that even if the Wang faction
doesn't fall,

530
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,760
they will lose half of their strength.

531
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,920
However,

532
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,840
we Guardians knew nothing
of this evidence.

533
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,120
How interesting.

534
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,920
In recent years, Prime Minister Wang

535
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,470
has enjoyed his prestige.

536
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,920
A few days ago, due to delivery corvee,

537
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,270
he clashed with His Majesty.

538
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,710
It's only reasonable
that His Majesty took the chance

539
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,790
to reprimand him.

540
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,130
Since it's His Majesty's will,

541
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,760
why don't you just go along with it?

542
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,030
Once the Wang faction falls,

543
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,270
no one will be in your way.

544
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,230
It seems

545
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,880
you think their downfall is best.

546
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,880
Of course.

547
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,870
Rou,

548
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,710
remember.

549
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,550
A familiar opponent

550
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,440
is always better

551
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,990
than an unknown enemy.

552
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,070
Take it.

553
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,700
(IV)

554
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,700
(Left Censor Yuan Xiong's
brother-in-law seized land.)

555
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,650
I left the Palace out of impulse.

556
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
I went against the princess's code

557
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,840
and worried Mother.

558
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,270
Now, I came to apologize.

559
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,360
Mother, please punish me.

560
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,450
Mother, please don't be mad.

561
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,710
Pingyang's death hit Lin'an hard,

562
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,980
so she left to clear her mind.

563
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,840
She left a letter before leaving.

564
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,680
Now...

565
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,710
Now, she's returned safely.

566
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,720
Get out.

567
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,640
- Mother.
- Get out!

568
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,470
I've realized my mistake.

569
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,920
I'm willing to be punished.

570
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,160
You should be punished.

571
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,750
You're thinner

572
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,640
and darker,

573
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,990
but luckily,

574
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,470
you're safe and sound.

575
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,310
Get up.

576
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,600
Sit down.

577
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,880
The Imperial Kitchen made this.

578
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,040
Have a try.

579
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,960
It's salty.

580
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm ashamed to say

581
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,790
that as a mother,

582
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,470
I didn't even know
whether you prefer sweet or salty.

583
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,400
You left without saying a word.

584
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,960
That's really upsetting.

585
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,270
I was angry that you left
without permission

586
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,270
and that you didn't understand
what was important.

587
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,750
But after a few days,

588
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,200
that anger slowly faded.

589
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,840
What replaced it

590
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,550
was fear.

591
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,230
I'm afraid you might leave

592
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,370
and never return like Pingyang.

593
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
All these years,

594
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,030
I've been uneasy.

595
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
I've been busy
building your brother's power

596
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,680
and blaming you for your faults.

597
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,920
In the end,

598
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,600
I realized I lost
the most important thing.

599
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,920
No.

600
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,960
Mother, you're the best.

601
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,990
It's me who isn't good enough.

602
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,310
My studies are sloppy,

603
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,840
and I don't do things seriously.

604
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,790
This time, I even ran away
and made you worry.

605
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,600
Mother, I know your life in the Palace

606
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,990
is not easy.

607
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,460
I also know
Brother's life in the East Palace

608
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,070
is not easy.

609
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,880
I understand everything.

610
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,070
Before I knew it,

611
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,120
Lin'an had grown up

612
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,880
and become sensible.

613
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:02,680
Mother, you don't know.

614
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
I've traveled
through mountains and waters,

615
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,790
making do with everything,

616
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,400
going to many places,

617
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,030
and experiencing
many interesting things.

618
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,270
I went to the Desert,

619
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,640
where I saw Crescent Bay
under the night sky

620
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:16,340
and the ice waterfall that had been
silent for a thousand years.

621
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,120
There were many dangers,

622
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,510
but luckily, I met many kind people

623
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,070
who helped me overcome them.

624
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,550
Duchess Yu said

625
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,360
I was born lucky,

626
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,440
but I think it's Pingyang
who's been watching over me.

627
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,470
(Xu Qi'an said)

628
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,700
(it was better to travel ten thousand li
than to read ten thousand books.)

629
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,510
(My journey this time,)

630
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,610
(though I haven't traveled
the whole world,)

631
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,880
(has made me feel much clearer.)

632
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,470
(My life is not only
about the Dafeng capital)

633
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,640
(but also the vast world.)

634
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,360
(The things I've been so obsessed with)

635
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,680
(are just fleeting human concerns,)

636
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,310
(like a speck of dust.)

637
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,170
(If I hadn't heard the news
of Xu Qi'an's death)

638
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,400
(and rushed back in a hurry...)

639
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,200
Xu Qi'an.

640
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,030
(Justice and Balance)
Let's proceed as discussed earlier.

641
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,120
It's still

642
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,270
up to His Majesty's attitude.

643
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,680
Based on His Majesty's actions,

644
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,600
it won't be long

645
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,840
before it's our turn.

646
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,790
Prime Minister, goodbye.

647
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,990
Thank you, everyone.

648
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,960
Simu is here?

649
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,630
Yes.

650
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,070
Miss Simu has gone to the Library.

651
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,940
(Work Without Regrets)

652
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,510
Xu,

653
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,280
are you cold?

654
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,280
Do you want an extra coat?

655
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,880
I'm not cold.

656
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,760
Then are you hot?

657
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,720
I'll open the window for you.

658
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,040
I'm not hot.

659
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,150
Miss,

660
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,980
this is the dessert from Moon Resto.

661
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,080
Leave.

662
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,470
Xu,

663
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,670
these are cakes I made myself.

664
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,870
Try it.

665
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,760
I'm not eating.

666
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,280
I'm...

667
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,720
I'm not hungry.

668
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:18,920
Miss Wang,

669
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,440
we talked about this before.

670
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,030
- We are just...
- Understood.

671
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,550
This is inappropriate.

672
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,360
Mr. Xu.

673
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,880
(How clueless about romance.)

674
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,070
(What a nerd.)

675
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,510
Mr. Xu,

676
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,240
there are too many files.

677
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,030
Would you like to rest a bit
before continuing?

678
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,430
I...

679
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,510
Xu...

680
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,150
You...

681
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,120
I...

682
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,680
Simu.

683
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:25,920
Father, why are you here?

684
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,470
Who

685
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,160
is this?

686
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,120
This is

687
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,070
my new coachman.

688
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,630
Greetings, My Lord.

689
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,510
I heard you called yourself a gentleman,

690
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,590
but it seems you're still reckless.

691
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
Am I right?

692
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,240
Xu Xinnian.

693
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,820
(Ministry of Personnel)

694
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,470
This place

695
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,360
is not for rogues.

696
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,720
Don't come back here.

697
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,550
Take the young lady back.

698
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,670
Miss, let's go back.

699
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,500
(Ministry of Personnel)

700
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,360
Whose foolish child is this?

701
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,760
Ningyan.

702
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,240
Ningyan,

703
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,190
am I your darling?

704
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,800
Why ask this all of a sudden?

705
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,510
Yesterday, I heard
Father call Mother darling,

706
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:45,070
but no one ever calls me that.

707
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,190
Because you're not a darling.

708
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
Then what am I?

709
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,800
You are

710
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,150
a fatty liver.

711
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,720
What's fatty liver?

712
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,760
Can I eat it?

713
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,880
Probably not.

714
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,320
By the way, have you seen Xinnian?

715
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,760
Let me see.

716
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,760
He's back now.

717
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,240
What happened, Xinnian?

718
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,470
Did you go to the Personnel?

719
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,550
- Miss Wang.
- Where is Xu?

720
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,680
He's inside.

721
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,070
What happened? Is something wrong?

722
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:27,950
He was

723
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,800
humiliated today.

724
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,670
He said

725
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,760
he'd never step
into the Personnel again.

726
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,320
It's nothing. I'll go check on him.

727
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,720
Xu is thoughtful and sensitive.

728
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,190
I'm really worried about him.

729
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,630
Sorry to trouble you.

730
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,640
It's no trouble.

731
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,920
Go play by yourself.

732
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,360
Miss Pretty.

733
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,240
Good girl.

734
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,280
Can you tell me

735
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,110
where your parents are?

736
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,360
I have delicious food here.

737
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,280
It's all for you.

738
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,240
They're over there.

739
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,670
Let's go find them.

740
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,430
Cijiu.

741
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,840
Xu Qi'an.

742
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,510
It's all your fault.

743
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,990
How can you blame me?

744
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,510
It was you who asked me to go.

745
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
As a scholar, I was humiliated,

746
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,990
my future ruined,

747
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,960
and my reputation shattered.

748
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,400
I've become a rat in the street.

749
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,760
If you ask me,

750
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,150
it's not that serious.

751
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,110
You were just kicked out
of the Personnel.

752
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,070
In a few days,

753
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,960
everyone will forget about it.

754
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,280
Just kicked out?

755
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,360
I was kicked out!

756
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,030
I believe in you.

757
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,550
Though you were kicked out today,

758
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,720
in the future,

759
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,070
you will surely return to the Personnel

760
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,550
with your own ability.

761
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,540
Then you'll clear your name

762
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,320
and hold your head high.

763
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,470
At that time,

764
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,150
even Wang Zhenwen
will look at you differently.

765
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
Really?

766
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,720
You must not lose your ambition
because of this.

767
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,320
If anything happens to you,

768
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,630
Uncle and Aunt

769
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,150
will be heartbroken.

770
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,780
(Harmonious and Happy)

771
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,440
I thought

772
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,280
Xinnian was handsome enough,

773
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,280
but today I realized

774
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,400
he only inherited 50% of your grace

775
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,240
and 30% of Mrs. Xu's beauty.

776
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,840
This girl

777
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,880
is always so honest.

778
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,240
You're so sweet to say that.

779
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,920
Didn't you say they'd be heartbroken?

780
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,360
They don't know about this,

781
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,590
so you can't blame them.

782
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,110
Miss Wang.

783
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,880
Miss Wang admires you.

784
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,110
Seeing you down,

785
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,440
she was so upset just now.

786
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,120
I understand.

787
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,960
May I ask what your name is?

788
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,400
How did you

789
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,320
meet our Cijiu?

790
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,990
I am a poet friend of Cijiu.

791
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,510
Mrs. Xu, you can just call me Simu.

792
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,110
Simu.

793
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,800
What a nice name.

794
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,920
(They may be a small household,)

795
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,240
(but their wealth is
not to be underestimated.)

796
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,360
(They even have antique porcelain.)

797
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,880
(It seems they are hiding
their true strength.)

798
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,730
(Luckily, I was prepared.)

799
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,920
I almost forgot.

800
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,190
As this is my first visit,

801
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,470
I've brought a small gift.

802
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,720
I hope you'll like it.

803
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,920
You're too polite.

804
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,030
You don't have to do this.

805
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,960
Right.

806
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,200
Mrs. Xu,

807
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:39,400
this set

808
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,150
is for you.

809
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:48,950
This...

810
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,590
This is too precious.

811
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,840
I can't accept it.

812
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,280
Compared to your identity and grace,

813
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,860
how could this be considered precious?

814
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,880
I painted this for you

815
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,800
and entrusted it to a craftsman.

816
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,150
I hope you like it.

817
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,110
You painted this yourself?

818
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,800
Wow, it's too beautiful.

819
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,390
(Very good.)

820
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,590
(It seems the mistress
is a simple-hearted woman.)

821
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Miss Wang, this is our first meeting.

822
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,280
How can we accept
such a valuable gift from you?

823
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,910
My Lord,

824
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:30,150
this saber was made
by the Sabersmith Gu Huanzhen.

825
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,880
Gu Huanzhen?

826
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,720
Isn't he living in seclusion
in the mountains?

827
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:36,870
Yes.

828
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,760
I visited him three times

829
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,630
before he was finally moved
by my sincerity

830
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,190
and agreed

831
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,280
to forge this saber.

832
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,150
It must've cost you a lot of money.

833
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,030
(As expected.)

834
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,110
(My future father-in-law is a Fighter
obsessed with martial arts.)

835
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,030
(He shouldn't be hard
to get along with.)

836
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,840
A hero deserves a treasured saber.

837
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,150
How can it be measured by money?

838
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,190
Thank you, Miss.
