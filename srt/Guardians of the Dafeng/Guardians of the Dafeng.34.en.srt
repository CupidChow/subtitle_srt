201

215
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
Dear Master,

216
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,680
the situation keeps deteriorating.

217
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
A few days ago,

218
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,830
Tianyu monks came to the Dafeng,

219
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,710
attempting to take Xu Qi'an away.

220
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,750
Meanwhile,

221
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,960
I lost all contact with that person.

222
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,510
The Sangbo Explosion,

223
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,160
Shen Shu's reappearance,

224
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,440
and all that happened

225
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,470
(Yeji)
were part of his scheme to abduct Xu

226
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,630
(Kui, 4th Rank Fox)
and steal the national fortune.

227
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,960
Our alliance with him

228
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,320
was a joke from the very beginning.

229
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,630
What's worse,

230
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,800
it was his long-brewing conspiracy.

231
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,470
Fortunately,

232
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,510
it didn't work.

233
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,440
Supervisor and Tianyu monks

234
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,630
seemed to reach a consensus.

235
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,560
Both sides and Emperor Yuanjing

236
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,960
found a delicate balance as well.

237
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,710
I guess

238
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,350
at this point,

239
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,630
Emperor Yuanjing is stuck.

240
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,710
He discovered the national fortune in Xu

241
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,680
but couldn't do anything.

242
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,320
He couldn't get rid of Xu easily

243
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,750
to draw out the fortune.

244
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,280
In that case,

245
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,590
Xu Qi'an is safe

246
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,350
for now at least.

247
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,200
Shen Shu

248
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,470
will also remain safe.

249
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,400
Wei Yuan surprised me the most.

250
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,420
(Rule With Virtue)
After the battle in Yunzhou,

251
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,110
Kui's three stations in the Dafeng

252
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,590
were destroyed by Gold Gong Guardians.

253
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,710
Four of them were badly injured,

254
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,680
while all our troops were eliminated
from the Dafeng.

255
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,040
As for

256
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,960
why that person wants the national fortune,

257
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,680
and what he's going to do next,

258
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,960
I have no idea yet.

259
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
But so far,

260
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,200
I'm sure about one thing.

261
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,470
That person

262
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,710
will not give up.

263
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,830
Search carefully.

264
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,230
Don't miss any spots.

265
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,070
Yes.

266
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,830
What are you doing?

267
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,000
Search it!

268
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,440
How dare you!

269
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,400
This is the tri-ministries' meeting cabin.

270
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,440
What are you doing?

271
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Mr. Xu said it's confidential.

272
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,280
Does he know

273
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,680
what this place is?

274
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,710
Yes, Minister,

275
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,040
the tri-ministries' meeting cabin.

276
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,960
How bold of you to break in!

277
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,590
Mr. Xu said

278
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,040
we could search it.

279
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
He's abusing his power.

280
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,080
Isn't he afraid that we'll impeach him?

281
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,160
Mr. Xu said

282
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,190
yes.

283
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,160
Yes?

284
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,590
Then scram now!

285
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,160
He is afraid,

286
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,990
but he doesn't care.

287
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,830
You...

288
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,240
Sir,

289
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,400
please step aside.

290
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,430
Please.

291
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,160
Sorry for the trouble.

292
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,350
You two stay with them.

293
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,190
- Yes.
- Yes.

294
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,400
How wild!

295
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,870
What game

296
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,590
is Xu Qi'an playing?

297
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,110
Mr. Xu,

298
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,630
we've searched the cabin inside out.

299
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,570
No one is hidden there.

300
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,870
No?

301
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,960
Search again.

302
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,320
Check every official's room carefully.

303
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
Yes.

304
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,630
How come?

305
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
Xu Qi'an,

306
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,630
don't cross the line.

307
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,160
Like I said,

308
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,920
only one Gold Gong is

309
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,230
going to Chuzhou with you, and that's me.

310
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,870
That can't be right.

311
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
Lord Wei said he'd send

312
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,200
12 Gold Gongs to escort me.

313
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,400
But why you of all people?

314
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,230
I get it.

315
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,400
No wonder he insisted that I join you.

316
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,020
(Gold Gong, XII)

317
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,920
Nangong...

318
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,760
XII.

319
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
That 12?

320
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,560
According to seniority,

321
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,560
I joined the Guardians later than others,

322
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,400
so

323
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,400
I was ranked 12 or XII.

324
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,750
Sir, we found no strangers

325
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,590
in those rooms.

326
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,710
This trip to Chuzhou
depends on you, Mr. Nangong.

327
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,780
(Waters of Chuzhou)

328
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,000
Pass my order.

329
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,510
Have our men

330
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,560
work on two shifts

331
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,590
to go at full speed.

332
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,160
We must arrive

333
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,830
in Chuzhou in five days.

334
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,920
Yes.

335
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,350
Mr. Chu said

336
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,560
to go at full speed.

337
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

338
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,440
Deputy Xie.

339
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,910
What's the rush?

340
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,210
The war in the North is critical.

341
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,150
There's no time to lose.

342
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,310
It didn't turn critical overnight.

343
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,880
Why are they in a rush now?

344
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,640
It fell up there.

345
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,230
Let's look for it carefully.

346
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,240
Not again!

347
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
The poach thief?

348
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,710
What are you doing here?

349
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,470
What about you?

350
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,000
Give it back.

351
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,120
I found it.

352
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,960
How could a thief

353
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,070
be a Guardian?

354
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,750
How could

355
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,400
a shrew like you

356
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,030
work for Duke Huai's Mansion?

357
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,360
How did you know that?

358
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,310
- I was right.
- You tricked me.

359
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,310
Do I have to?

360
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,990
You didn't come with us Guardians.

361
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
Those of the tri-ministries

362
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,360
wouldn't dare

363
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,710
sneak in a woman.

364
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,030
So you must've come with Chu Xianglong.

365
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,200
A woman who he'd bring
from the capital to Chuzhou

366
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,680
must belong to Duke Huai's Mansion.

367
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,200
In this case,

368
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,310
are you

369
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,400
Duchess Zhenbei's maid?

370
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,470
I've long heard about her unmatched beauty.

371
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,260
She's said to be the fairest in the capital.

372
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:32,510
Is she also on board?

373
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,160
Could you introduce me to her?

374
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,400
A mere Silver Gong wants to see the Duchess?

375
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,360
How insolent.

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,840
I can report you to the Lead Investigator.

377
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,280
What are the odds?

378
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,840
I, Xu Qi'an,

379
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,880
am the Lead Investigator.

380
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,070
It's you?

381
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,270
Pay your respects

382
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,550
to me now.

383
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm furious!

384
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,550
One of the Guardians

385
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,960
got on my nerves.

386
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,480
Who was it?

387
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,230
I met him before.

388
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,120
He is the Lead Investigator.

389
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,920
Xu Qi'an?

390
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,030
Do you know him?

391
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,200
He solved the Tax Silver and Sangbo Cases

392
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,960
and broke the Tianyu Dharma.

393
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,230
His Majesty promoted him to viscount.

394
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,310
That's why

395
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,030
he's the Lead Investigator.

396
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,990
What did he do to you?

397
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,310
He bullied me!

398
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,390
He...

399
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,070
He asked me

400
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,360
to shout on the deck 100 times,

401
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,960
"I'm sorry, sir."

402
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,200
Is that funny?

403
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,310
Stop laughing.

404
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,790
Once we arrive in Chuzhou,

405
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,510
I'll teach that bully a lesson for sure.

406
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,270
I'm so pissed.

407
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,270
- Who is it?
- It's me.

408
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,960
We need to talk. Are you in bed?

409
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Yes.

410
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,360
You aren't. Good.

411
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,070
What's up?

412
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,270
Duchess Zhenbei is also on board.

413
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,070
Chu Xianglong hid her in the mission

414
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,990
to escort her to Chuzhou.

415
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,070
As the Lead Investigator,

416
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,510
why didn't I receive any news?

417
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,120
His Majesty told Lord Wei about it.

418
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,990
It was a verbal order,
not a written one.

419
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,990
It was too trivial

420
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,120
to mention it.

421
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,750
She hasn't left the capital for 20 years,

422
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,840
but here she is in the mission.

423
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,880
You call that trivial?

424
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,790
Given her noble status,

425
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,200
it's better to go northward unnoticed.

426
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
How is that strange?

427
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,360
Like you said, she's noble.

428
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,310
Why not send Imperial Guards to escort her?

429
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,880
To say the least,

430
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,710
even if she has to hide in the mission,

431
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,400
there are all kinds of people on board.

432
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,440
Why not let her take a separate boat?

433
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,880
Why hide her in the bottom cabin?

434
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,310
- Are you saying...?
- What's more,

435
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,600
Chu just ordered the sailors to speed up.

436
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,230
If that's not because of the war,

437
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,990
they must be running out of time.

438
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,880
They have to send her to Chuzhou quickly.

439
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,990
What are you implying?

440
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,360
Duchess Zhenbei

441
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,550
is in danger.

442
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,750
Our mission will get into trouble

443
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,790
such as an ambush

444
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,600
to kill Duchess Zhenbei.

445
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,730
Ambush!

446
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,960
It's Kui!

447
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,070
Protect the lords!

448
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,360
Row ashore now! Row ashore!

449
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,940
(Wharf in Huangyou County)
Go and help.

450
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,600
Be careful.

451
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
(Injury List)

452
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,120
Thanks to the Guardians' utmost protection,

453
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,990
our officials have survived.

454
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,680
But the troops

455
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,270
have suffered huge losses.

456
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,510
I'm afraid we can't go further.

457
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,480
Change the route.

458
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,040
Go by land.

459
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,230
Go to the nearest post house

460
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,750
so that the injured

461
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,750
can be treated.

462
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,400
Xu Qi'an had said

463
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,790
with the Duchess being hidden on board

464
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,230
in the mission,

465
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,750
it didn't seem right.

466
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,600
He had told us to take precautions,

467
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,440
but we were

468
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,880
still caught unprepared.

469
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,790
Enough.

470
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,070
I know you're blaming me!

471
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,510
I rejected

472
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,510
his advice of changing the route.

473
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,710
Otherwise, it wouldn't end up so badly.

474
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,920
It's too late to regret it.

475
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,920
When we were ambushed,

476
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,990
Chu Xianglong

477
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,450
abandoned the mission,

478
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,710
running away with the Duchess from Kui.

479
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,640
Xu Qi'an went to help them alone.

480
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,310
He isn't back yet.

481
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,120
We were wrong.

482
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,400
Kui is fully prepared and fierce.

483
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,880
I wonder if Silver Gong Xu can rescue her.

484
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,470
Split up!

485
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,420
(Tianlang, Qingyan Tribe of Kui)

486
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,400
Tianlang?

487
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,070
General Chu,

488
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,160
long time no see.

489
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,310
General Chu,

490
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,510
tell me which one the Duchess is

491
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,470
and you'll die a painless death.

492
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,990
Who told you she was here?

493
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,710
You were fooled.

494
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,120
If I made a mistake and killed the Duchess,

495
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
and Duke Zhenbei finds out,

496
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,750
I'll tell him you did nothing to help her.

497
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,600
If those maids

498
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,790
die for Her Grace,

499
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,030
they'll die a worthy death!

500
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,870
(Oh no.)

501
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,040
(He's using Kui to kill us.)

502
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,960
You deserve death.

503
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,790
The Duchess is

504
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,510
the fairest

505
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,030
and the noblest.

506
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,960
If she's hiding among you,

507
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,960
she must be carrying a weapon

508
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,600
to conceal her energy and change her looks.

509
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,310
Alright!

510
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,310
Strip them all!

511
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,710
There they are.

512
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,280
I came late.

513
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,550
Yunlu Academy?

514
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,320
Casting spells?

515
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,470
Too bad,

516
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,310
you can't hurt me.

517
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,160
It's not to hurt you.

518
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,230
It's

519
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,680
your

520
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,760
turn.

521
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,350
Charge!

522
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,600
♪Slaughter all confusions♪

523
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,750

Who exactly are you?

527
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,640
A Guardian.

528
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,680
Xu Qi'an!

529
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
Xu Qi'an?

530
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,680
You're up.

531
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,270
The water bag is next to you.

532
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,550
Drink from it if you're thirsty.

533
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,880
Mr. Xu,

534
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,680
did you save my life?

535
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,240
Yes.

536
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,400
Impossible!

537
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,880
Xu Qi'an isn't as skilled as you.

538
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,680
Who exactly are you?

539
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,680
Why are you playing him?

540
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,550
You should doubt me.

541
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,440
You aren't too simple.

542
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,310
But

543
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,680
your moves are too slow.

544
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,270
I have this!

545
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,680
It contains 20 gold sunflower seeds

546
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,920
and the Duchess's name.

547
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,710
Back in the capital,

548
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,470
I found such poaches over and over.

549
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,920
So far,

550
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,310
I've had 36 of them in my drawer.

551
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,550
Do you believe me now,

552
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,680
Duchess Zhenbei?

553
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,600
Uh... what?

554
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,470
Duchess?

555
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,920
We left the capital almost 10 days ago.

556
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,510
Acting as a maid was tough, wasn't it?

557
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,330
It wasn't easy to put up with you either.

558
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,030
Those beads you're wearing are special.

559
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,680
They can conceal your energy

560
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,790
and change your looks.

561
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,360
But do you remember

562
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,270
who won that prize for you?

563
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,720
600 liang.

564
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,680
Thanks.

565
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,710
Did you

566
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,360
throw in those arrows that day?

567
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,880
When we were in the capital,

568
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,880
I already noticed those bodhi beads.

569
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
But next time,

570
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,160
I'll make you pay!

571
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,160
At first, I thought

572
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,920
you were some official's concubine

573
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,270
until I saw you on board that day

574
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,840
as the Duchess's maid.

575
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,680
The Duchess might be too rich

576
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,120
to care about 600 liang,

577
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,640
but why would you, a maid,

578
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,310
need those bodhi beads

579
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,310
to conceal your energy

580
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,540
and change your looks?

581
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,880
That doesn't make sense.

582
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,750
The only possibility is

583
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,030
you're the real Duchess Zhenbei.

584
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,710
The one others saw is

585
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,070
a mere body double.

586
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,550
I'm not...

587
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,070
I'm saying this

588
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,470
to tell you

589
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,990
that we still have a long way to go.

590
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,680
I need you to work with me...

591
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,360
Xu Qi'an rescued the Duchess?

592
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,880
Why not come back to meet us?

593
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,160
He's full of wicked ideas.

594
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,160
He probably took her

595
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,640
to Chuzhou in secret to investigate the case.

596
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,990
We're out in the open

597
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
while he's in the dark.

598
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,030
In terms of his whereabouts,

599
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,920
if someone asks,

600
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,880
I hope the officials here will cover for him.

601
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,230
Xu Qi'an?

602
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,350
You're up.

603
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,960
The water bag is next to you.

604
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,270
Drink from it if you're thirsty.

605
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,200
Oh,

606
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,640
to prevent you from being violent again,

607
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,880
I tied you up last night.

608
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,000
Are you going to

609
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,960
run away again?

610
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,590
Scram.

611
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,680
Want some?

612
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,550
You...

613
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,790
What are you doing?

614
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,070
I should ask you that.

615
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,310
I'm washing my face.

616
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,550
I'll watch you in case you run away.

617
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,640
Where could I go?

618
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,880
Pack up everything...

619
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Already done?

620
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,710
Where's everything?

621
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
In here.

622
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,640
It's a long journey.

623
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,510
You're unruly.

624
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,470
Please bear with it.

625
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,200
Go in!

626
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,390
Go in!

627
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,390
Go in!

628
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,240
Go in!

629
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,200
- Wait.
- Are you out of your mind?

630
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,510
It didn't work.

631
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,710
It's fine.

632
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,640
Xu Qi'an,

633
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,920
are you in Chuzhou now?

634
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,840
Not yet.

635
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,710
Something happened on the way.

636
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,880
I'll be there soon.

637
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,170
How are things on your side?

638
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,470
I've checked three days and nights
at the border in Chuzhou

639
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,470
but found no trace of the bloodshed yet.

640
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,310
There was something strange, though.

641
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:49,750
I saw a unit of Kui cavalrymen here.

642
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,960
The Empathy Spell showed

643
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,790
they didn't seem to know about the bloodshed.

644
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,840
I know that.

645
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,120
This case isn't that simple.

646
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,310
How did you know?

647
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,980
I questioned a Kui chief on my way.

648
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,860
(Heart Spell)

649
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,880
Sages should be honest.

650
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,200
So should ordinary men.

651
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,990
Speak.

652
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,720
What's so special about the Duchess?

653
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,320
Why did Kui go after her?

654
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,470
I don't know.

655
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,070
I was sent by my master.

656
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,210
Who's your master?

657
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,190
The strongest of the Qingyan Tribe of Kui,

658
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,990
the Mighty Bone.

659
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,190
One last question.

660
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,150
Was Kui

661
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,920
behind that bloodshed?

662
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,360
It wasn't

663
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,110
Kui.

664
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,320
Kui wasn't behind

665
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,760
that bloodshed.

666
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,960
What?

667
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,960
If they didn't do it,

668
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,640
who else was capable of such an atrocity?

669
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,800
What else have you found?

670
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,360
There is one more thing.

671
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,990
Normally,

672
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,840
if a place was caught in war,

673
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,960
prices of things like grains
would soar up, right?

674
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,550
I checked grain prices in Chuzhou

675
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,990
and nearby provinces and counties.

676
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,070
The prices

677
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,240
did rise,

678
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,920
but not by too much.

679
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,190
I'm aware of that, too.

680
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,720
Well,

681
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,400
that's all I've found so far.

682
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,960
Xu Qi'an, I...

683
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,920
I've started

684
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,440
to doubt if that bloodshed is real.

685
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,150
I have no idea how to proceed.

686
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,720
Hey,

687
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,280
what about the other task I gave you?

688
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,320
You asked me to gather warriors everywhere.

689
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,760
So far...

690
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,240
I've got about 100 at least.

691
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,550
100?

692
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,320
That's easy.

693
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:52,110
I'm Li Miaozhen. You know what that means?

694
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,070
I kept a low profile

695
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,960
back in the capital of the Dafeng.

696
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,400
But here in Chuzhou,

697
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,470
one call from me

698
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,960
can rally the multitudes.

699
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,030
100 isn't enough.

700
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,440
Step up your game.

701
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,470
Have you been working hard?

702
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,670
Even 100 warriors aren't enough?

703
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,070
Xu Qi'an, what are you up to?

704
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:09,910
Xu Qi'an!

705
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,350
Xu Qi'an.

706
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,400
Xu Qi'an.

707
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,240
Master,

708
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,990
what should we do next?

709
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,190
He didn't say.

710
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,760
Never mind.

711
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,720
Keep building up the force.

712
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,630
Gather more warriors.

713
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,840
Warriors,

714
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,240
greedy officials are ruining Chuzhou

715
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,800
and exploiting the locals.

716
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,760
Please

717
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,590
join us to uphold justice,

718
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,590
eliminate corruption,

719
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,880
and help the innocent.

720
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:49,150
We'll follow Winged Woman to death!

721
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,070
General Li Yuanhua

722
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,920
of Duke Zhenbei's Assault Battalion
is ordered

723
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,150
(Li Yuanhua)
by Duke Huai

724
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,190
(General, Assault Battalion)
to welcome the mission.

725
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,840
Where's the Lead Investigator, Xu Qi'an?

726
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:23,190
We were ambushed in Huangyou by Kui.

727
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,030
Mr. Xu returned for his injuries.

728
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,880
Where's the Duchess?

729
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,110
During the ambush,

730
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,720
she was attacked by Kui

731
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,560
and went missing.

732
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,470
Why didn't you go to look for her?

733
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,990
The mission came

734
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,990
to investigate the bloodshed,

735
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,840
not to protect the Duchess.

736
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,560
Where's Chu Xianglong?

737
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,220
I need to confirm it with him!

738
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,310
He died.

739
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,460
(Sanhuang County, Chuzhou)

740
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,480
Take a look.

741
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,760
Have a look.

742
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,990
Xu Qi'an,

743
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,070
how dare you knock me out!

744
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,670
You hit me!

745
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,070
I'll make you pay for your action!

746
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,030
Please spare me.

747
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,070
I... I'm just a local physician.

748
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,720
Mr. Xu said you were still in a coma

749
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,280
and asked me to examine you.

750
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,560
I'm off.

751
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,470
Are you hurt, Physician?

752
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,630
I'm really sorry.

753
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,840
Are you alright, Physician?

754
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,190
Do you need to see a physician?

755
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,470
I am a physician!

756
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,760
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

757
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,360
She's violent, indeed.

758
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,200
I'm sorry.

759
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,070
Xu Qi'an,

760
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,880
where are we?

761
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,630
A county in Chuzhou

762
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,840
called Sanhuang.

763
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,990
Why did you take me here?

764
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,360
To eat Sanhuang Chicken.

765
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,110
To investigate the case, of course.

766
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,110
That's your responsibility.

767
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,840
Why bring me along?

768
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,990
If I let you go,

769
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,630
what if Kui found you?

770
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,380
(Gazing Spell)

771
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,640
- Why is Kui after me?
- Why is Kui after you?

772
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,920
- How would I know?
- How would I know?

773
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,240
You don't know?

774
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,800
Then why did you hide in our mission

775
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,280
to come to Chuzhou in secret?

776
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,360
In secret?

777
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,320
I'm open and aboveboard.

778
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:42,960
Chu Xianglong said given my status,

779
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,630
I shouldn't be too close to you.

780
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,590
(Her energy remains calm.)

781
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,280
(Looks like she didn't lie.)

782
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,440
(She really doesn't know.)

783
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,240
Xu Qi'an,

784
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,590
what do you want?

785
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,760
You'd better let me go now.

786
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,240
When we arrive in the city,

787
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,990
I won't tell Duke Zhenbei.

788
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,150
I'll forgive

789
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,150
your rudeness.

790
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,230
(Now, that's a lie.)

791
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,030
Sorry.

792
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,550
I can't let you go now,

793
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,840
but I won't hurt you.

794
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,630
You're in great peril.

795
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,150
I don't know why,

796
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,720
but Kui is looking for you.

797
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,630
That's true.

798
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,320
I have a case to solve.

799
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,590
I can't spare time for you.

800
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,560
So,

801
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,400
here are two options.

802
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,390
One,

803
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,510
I'll have you tied

804
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,110
before I come back.

805
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,640
Two,

806
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,840
enjoy a big meal

807
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,280
and a nice bath

808
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,990
before I come back.

809
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,800
Jinlian,

810
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,840
are you there?

811
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:01,990
I have a question.

812
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,940
(Binyue Inn)

813
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,190
That's it.

814
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,670
Other than certain powerful weapons,

815
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,320
those with unique Qi forces

816
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,800
can't be sucked into the Jade Mirror either.

817
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,440
Alright. Got it.

818
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,280
Thanks. I'll treat you to tea someday.

819
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,800
Or drinks.

820
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,240
"Those with unique Qi forces"?

821
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,990
(She didn't try to escape again.)

822
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,760
I'm from the Yunlu Academy.

823
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,960
I'm Xu Xinnian.

824
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,550
Your music is divine, Miss.

825
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,760
It's impressive.

826
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,670
Thanks for your compliment.

827
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,030
Have some tea.

828
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,920
You're from the Yunlu Academy.

829
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,800
Interesting.

830
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,510
How so?

831
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,440
"One who's filled with knowledge

832
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,280
would rather enjoy beautiful plums."

833
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,400
How about I say

834
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,030
the first line of a couplet,

835
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,590
and you say the second line?

836
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,760
Attendants in blue.

837
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,320
Die without regrets.

838
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,900
(Silver Gong, Xu Qi'an)

839
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,960
Are you Xu Qi'an,

840
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,030
Silver Gong Xu?

841
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,240
You...

842
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,240
know me?

843
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,840
I do, of course!

844
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,320
You're the best investigator

845
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,550
and the Top Poet of the Dafeng.

846
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,630
Back in Yunzhou,

847
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,990
you were heroic,

848
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,670
battling thousands of rebels alone.

849
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,030
(Thousands of them?)

850
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,320
(Who said that to flatter me?)

851
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,720
Get back to business.

852
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,670
Get up.

853
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,440
How are things in Chuzhou?

854
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:12,240
Did any large-scale wars happen?

855
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
Not

856
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,670
that I know of.

857
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,110
But something did strike me

858
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,190
as unusual.

859
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,160
What was it?

860
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,440
A while ago,

861
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:24,800
I served a master of a trade caravan.

862
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,240
He had done business all over Chuzhou.

863
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,280
After drinking, he said

864
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,400
(Xikou Province)
the main roads to Xikou

865
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,960
and its three counties were blocked.

866
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,780
(Xikou Province)

867
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,590
(Did I come too late?)

868
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
Mr. Xu,

869
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,320
why are you staring at the outside?

870
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,630
Am I

871
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,190
not pretty?

872
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,760
Attendants in blue.

873
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:54,110
Die without regrets.

874
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,920
Let me ask you.

875
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,110
When was this place unsealed?

876
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,510
My Lord,

877
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,240
Xikou Province was never sealed.

878
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,760
