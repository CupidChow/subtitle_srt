Are you alright?

46
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,110
He deserves

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,390
to be my opponent.

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Master, why are you stopping me again?

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,080
Xu Qi'an is a mere Silver Gong.

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
He wouldn't last ten moves against me.

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,590
Only I am capable

52
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,320
of cleaving apart the Dharma.

53
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,430
You

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,760
are not worthy.

55
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,480
This is so unfair.

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,390
Supervisor, I warn you.

57
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,480
Do not let your old eyes fail you

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,870
and become an obstacle to my fame.

59
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,390
The Supervisor is holding me back.

60
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,080
I'll eventually reemerge in the world,

61
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,150
and no one can suppress me.

62
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,860
(Xu Mansion)

63
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,740
(Supervisor)

64
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,540
(Sangbo, Palace treasure, demonic hand,
Tianyu Dharma, Yunzhou, Elixir of Life)

65
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,100
(Supervisor)

66
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,780
(On the day of cleaving the Dharma)

67
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,960
This is even livelier
than the Spring Fete.

68
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,910
If not for your vindication

69
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,130
and regaining imperial favor,

70
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,570
we wouldn't have had the chance

71
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,520
to watch such a duel up close

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,590
and to see so many noble officials

73
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,030
and imperial family members.

74
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,790
Indeed.

75
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,680
It's wonderful.

76
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,640
Excuse me, where is the viewing area?

77
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,830
Why is she here?

78
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,630
Ru.

79
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,990
Ru.

80
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,150
Ru, you're here too.

81
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,760
Xiuhe.

82
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,200
This is a grand event for the nation.

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,640
Everyone in the capital
wants to join in the excitement.

84
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,590
So, my family came to take a look.

85
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,830
You may not know this.

86
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,000
Commoners must stand.

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
For officials and nobility,

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,910
their seats are prearranged.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,150
We have seats

90
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,390
with excellent views.

91
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,150
If you want a better view,

92
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,200
I can take you with us.

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,760
My husband

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
still holds some influence

95
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,710
and reserving a few seats is easy.

96
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,710
No need.

97
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,960
No need to trouble you.

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,710
But we're friends after all.

99
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,070
Besides,

100
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,150
with your modest family background,

101
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,320
you've probably never seen
such a grand occasion.

102
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,200
It's only right for me to help.

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Yes, indeed.

104
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,960
Dear,

105
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,680
I've found our seats.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,390
They're over here. Come on.

107
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,710
- Greetings, My Lord.
- Xiuhe.

108
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,440
I have to go now.

109
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,800
Honey.

110
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,320
Do you know

111
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,560
who's seated up front?

112
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,560
That's the resting platform
for imperial members.

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,960
Only imperial members

114
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,560
and 1st Rank officials sit there.

115
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,200
Xiuhe,

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
this...

117
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,790
This is spacious.

118
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,030
Honey,

119
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,120
this place is so spacious.

120
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,960
Should we

121
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
invite Xiuhe to join us?

122
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,710
It's a rare opportunity.

123
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
Let her broaden her horizons

124
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,640
and introduce us
to some prominent figures.

125
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,630
Alright.

126
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,280
Come on.

127
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,280
No need.

128
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,640
There are seats.

129
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Thank you.

130
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,760
I never imagined in my dreams

131
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,120
that we would sit among the capital's
distinguished officials.

132
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,760
Right, honey?

133
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,470
Where's your father?

134
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,590
If not for Lord Wei's guidance,

135
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,000
my nephew Ningyan
wouldn't have achieved today's success.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,960
I am deeply grateful

137
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,520
and have been meaning
to thank you in person.

138
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,200
You are too kind.

139
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,200
Then it's settled.

140
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,320
I'll visit you

141
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,830
with Ningyan another day.

142
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,960
Lord Wei,

143
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
I won't disturb you any further.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,470
I'll take my leave.

145
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,920
Wait.

146
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,310
What's wrong?

147
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,520
Lord Wei's purple clay teapot.

148
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,680
Look what I did.

149
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,550
My apologies.

150
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,520
I'll be going now.

151
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,590
He looks familiar.

152
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,270
Have I seen him somewhere before?

153
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,520
Not hiding below anymore?

154
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,520
Come on, sit on my lap.

155
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,720
Where did this kid come from?

156
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Uncle,

157
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,640
can I have some of your food?

158
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,480
Of course.

159
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,040
This girl

160
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,560
seems to be Xu Qi'an's younger sister.

161
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,870
She's quite bold.

162
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,590
Wait a minute.

163
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,710
How did you get up here?

164
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,320
- Come down.
- It's fine.

165
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,040
Lord Wei is just playing with her.

166
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,830
The longer you keep this in your mouth,

167
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,230
the longer its sweetness will last.

168
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
Alright.

169
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,550
- Understand?
- When the sweetness fades,

170
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,510
none of the candied treats will be left.

171
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,560
As long as I keep eating,

172
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,110
the sweetness will never disappear.

173
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,960
Can you eat all of it?

174
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Eat.

175
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,260
If you finish it,

176
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,320
I have more.

177
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
What a pity.

178
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,510
What's wrong, Father?

179
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,160
This kid has robust bones and qi

180
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,320
and a naturally deep foundation.

181
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Unfortunately,

182
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,680
her tendons and bones lack flexibility,

183
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,910
making her unsuitable for martial arts.

184
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,710
No wonder she has such a big appetite.

185
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,870
This little girl must be a glutton.

186
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,080
You're mean.

187
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,830
You called me a glutton.

188
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,440
Xu Qi'an is so clever.

189
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,750
Why does he have such a sister?

190
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,680
Be careful, or she might eat you up.

191
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,920
Have you seen Xu Ningyan?

192
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,980
I haven't.

193
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,160
Could it be

194
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,350
he's too scared to show up?

195
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,130
Xu Qi'an is just a Fighter.

196
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,830
How could he duel
against the Tianyu Sect?

197
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,800
Besides,

198
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,230
with his meager cultivation,

199
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,440
can he really handle it?

200
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,310
Unless

201
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,560
they compete in poetry.

202
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,800
Are you enjoying his failure?

203
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,710
Go then if you can.

204
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,880
Lin'an.

205
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,590
They're just talking.

206
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,430
Don't get angry.

207
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,320
In a duel of the Three Sects,

208
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,590
the stronger side

209
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,200
surely wins.

210
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,080
The same goes for other paths.

211
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,800
But the Tianyu Sect is different.

212
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,040
It values enlightenment of the heart

213
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,800
and clarity of the mind.

214
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,830
Countless people are stronger
than Xu Qi'an in cultivation,

215
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,320
but so what?

216
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,350
Are they stronger

217
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,680
than Tianyu monks?

218
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,160
Father, don't worry.

219
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,510
Lord Wei is a great figure.

220
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,160
He wouldn't quarrel
with a kid like Lingyin.

221
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,510
Besides, Lord Wei has always
taken care of our family.

222
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,350
It'll be fine.

223
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,870
That makes sense.

224
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,920
With so many
distinguished figures here today,

225
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,350
as the head of the Xu Family,

226
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,920
I must maintain my dignity.

227
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,630
- We'll go get some food.
- Go back.

228
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,470
Alright.

229
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,080
Isn't that my father
and Prime Minister Wang?

230
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,590
Who arranged for them to sit together?

231
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,680
This must be

232
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,920
fate.

233
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,560
(Who could it be?)

234
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,760
(Aside from me,)

235
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,320
(who else would care
about their relationship?)

236
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,990
Isn't this...

237
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,080
Isn't this inappropriate?

238
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,110
I heard Ningyan mention before

239
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,510
that he wanted to introduce
my father to your father.

240
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,440
Perhaps

241
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,710
this was his arrangement.

242
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,320
Thank him very much.

243
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,550
(Father,)

244
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,920
(I beg you.)

245
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,960
(Please don't talk
to Prime Minister Wang.)

246
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,000
(Don't say a word.)

247
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,190
Hello.

248
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,000
I am Xu Pingzhi,

249
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,510
Baihu of the Imperial Guards.

250
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,080
You must be

251
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,510
a high-ranking official in the court.

252
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,200
You must be wondering

253
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,350
why an obscure officer like me

254
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,990
is seated

255
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,470
alongside you.

256
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,320
To tell you the truth,

257
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,550
the one who'll cleave the Dharma

258
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,560
is my nephew.

259
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,400
Xu Qi'an?

260
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,750
Yes, yes.

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
The Silver Gong, Xu Qi'an.

262
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,560
He solved the Tax Silver Case,

263
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,630
uncovered the method
of forging fake silver,

264
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,230
and even revealed

265
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,560
the long-hidden truth

266
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,830
behind Princess Pingyang's murder.

267
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,960
And the Sangbo Case too.

268
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,560
Is Xu Xinnian

269
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,350
your son?

270
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,320
Yes, yes.

271
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,590
He's my son.

272
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,470
I didn't expect my son to be so famous.

273
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,320
I've just heard a little about him.

274
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,400
Where

275
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,750
did you hear about him?

276
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,630
From whom?

277
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,510
I only heard

278
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,110
he's well-read

279
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,870
and ambitious.

280
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,510
My family has two talents.

281
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,630
Ningyan is still young,

282
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,200
yet he's earned Lord Wei's recognition.

283
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,230
His future is boundless.

284
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,630
Xinnian also has

285
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,330
the bearing of a future Prime Minister.

286
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,400
When my time comes,

287
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,960
I'll have a worthy answer
to my family's ancestors.

288
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,710
My Lord,

289
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,590
may I ask you something?

290
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,830
Do you know

291
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,590
where the Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen

292
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,830
is seated?

293
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,440
Could you kindly

294
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,350
point him out to me?

295
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,110
Why are you asking about him?

296
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
To be honest,

297
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,230
Prime Minister Wang

298
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,920
is my future in-law.

299
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,760
What's wrong?

300
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,800
Drink slower, or you'll choke.

301
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,560
Look at those two,

302
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,710
getting along so well.

303
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,280
Really?

304
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,920
- Enough.
- Feeling better now?

305
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,280
Have some melon seeds
to soothe yourself.

306
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,800
The Prime Minister's daughter

307
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,510
and my son

308
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,510
are truly a match

309
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,920
made in heaven

310
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,320
and destined by the gods.

311
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,080
But the kids are grown now.

312
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,800
I can't interfere with their choices.

313
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,920
Wait a moment.

314
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,640
You brought this.

315
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,400
Come on.

316
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,640
Put this on for me.

317
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,820
(Xu Qi'an Will Win)

318
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,950
He'll win!

319
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,640
My Lord.

320
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,510
(Xu Qi'an Will Win)
With this on,

321
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,870
I look invincible now, right?

322
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,460
Yes, yes.

323
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,160
Supervisor.

324
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,230
The time has come.

325
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,640
A Buddhist phenomenon.

326
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,360
This Dharma is called Sumeru Seed.

327
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,160
As they say, Sumeru hides in a seed,

328
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,710
and a seed contains Sumeru.

329
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,990
It's amazing.

330
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,070
What's this Sumeru Seed?

331
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,790
Between heaven and earth lies a world;

332
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,790
beyond the world, one travels very fast.

333
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,960
Exactly.

334
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,230
The formation breaker

335
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,510
will enter their own independent world.

336
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
Only by breaking the formation

337
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,030
can they escape.

338
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,200
Failing to break it

339
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,680
will shatter their mind,

340
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,280
leaving them lost in illusions forever.

341
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,680
This formation...

342
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,030
It's extremely hard.

343
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,750
- Miss.
- Sir.

344
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,510
What a gimmick.

345
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,880
Reach the heavens.

346
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,600
Change everything.

347
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,230
Ascend

348
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,160
to the sky.

349
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:07,440
Dafeng will win!

350
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,550
Xu Qi'an will win!

351
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Dafeng will win!

352
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
Ningyan, you've got this!

353
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:27,600
Dafeng will win!

354
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,440
Dafeng...

355
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:45,790
Dafeng will win!

356
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,360
(Given how hyped the atmosphere is,)

357
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,960
(how can I end this)

358
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,030
(without cleaving the Dharma?)

359
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,590
Xu Qi'an,

360
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,640
here's some osmanthus cake.

361
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,320
You can eat it
while climbing the ladder.

362
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,480
I'm not hungry.

363
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,990
Just take it.

364
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,070
It's delicious.

365
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,310
And here's water too.

366
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,400
I wish you success.

367
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,680
I don't really understand
why the Supervisor chose you,

368
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,830
but since he did,

369
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,680
he must have his reasons.

370
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,360
Don't be nervous.

371
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,550
Me?

372
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,470
I'm not nervous.

373
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,070
Why would I be nervous?
I'm not nervous.

374
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,240
Then why are you shaking?

375
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:45,960
I'm just

376
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,310
warming up

377
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,550
to get my body ready.

378
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,510
Dafeng will win!

379
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,230
Mr. Xu, are you heading up now?

380
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,360
Mr. Xu, you must return victorious.

381
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,920
We'll celebrate your success

382
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,230
for three days at Star Tower.

383
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,880
Wait, don't talk yet.

384
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
Take a break.

385
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,280
Xu Qi'an,

386
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,680
I was looking for you.

387
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,830
What's this?

388
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,300
(Poems by Xu Qi'an)
They're poems you wrote for me.

389
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,990
When you're climbing the ladder,

390
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,270
you can recite them aloud.

391
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
That's so pretentious...

392
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
So precious.

393
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,990
This is a great chance to show off.

394
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,920
You are my guest adviser.

395
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,230
You can't lose in momentum.

396
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,200
Well...

397
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,360
I'm going.

398
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,350
Wait.

399
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,600
Are you going like this?

400
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,830
What's wrong?

401
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,310
Change your outfit.

402
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,710

What a great poem.

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,170
How shameless.

453
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,600
He plagiarized my poem.

454
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,440
And he's basking

455
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,790
in all this attention

456
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,680
and admiration.

457
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,640
It's fine.

458
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,550
You're so talented.

459
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,990
No need to be bothered by this.

460
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,470
- Well said.
- Great poem.

461
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,880
Did you hear that?

462
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,440
He's enjoying the attention.

463
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,640
Only by aiming high

464
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,840
can one rise again.

465
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,790
- That's true.
- Right?

466
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,160
I wasn't exaggerating, right?

467
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,200
Isn't my nephew amazing?

468
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,680
He's amazing.

469
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,790
He is my nephew too,

470
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,200
a Silver Gong of the Guardians.

471
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,840
He's still unmarried.

472
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes, yes.

473
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,940
He truly knows
how to attract the limelight.

474
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,360
It's unprecedented in history.

475
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,550
Even when I became a top scholar,

476
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,880
I couldn't compare
to half of his brilliance.

477
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,360
Such ideas

478
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,960
are beyond someone as mediocre as you.

479
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,840
Ningyan, go for it!

480
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm Xu Qi'an, a Fighter from the Dafeng.

481
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,920
I came to break the formation.

482
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,550
This duel

483
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,120
is called Illusory.

484
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,400
One day in the world

485
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,750
equals to a thousand years

486
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,200
in the formation.

487
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,710
I've heard of this formation.

488
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,800
Supervisor,

489
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,120
what kind of power

490
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,710
does the Illusory hold?

491
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,750
It's not about power.

492
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,400
It's a formation that grinds you down.

493
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,710
(No flow of Qi force.)

494
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,200
(No immediate danger.)

495
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,920
(This formation probably
won't attack me.)

496
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
The enlightened

497
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,920
gain clarity,

498
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
but the obsessed

499
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,640
cannot reincarnate.

500
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,640
The formation wears down
the entrant's mind

501
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,470
with the suffering
they've witnessed in life.

502
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,310
It's not only that.

503
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,030
It can also manifest an illusory future,

504
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,750
trapping one

505
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,640
in endless cycles of despair.

506
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,840
The more hardships someone has endured,

507
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,020
the heavier their karmic burden,

508
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,120
and the harder it is to break free.

509
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,940
Where is this?

510
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,640
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

511
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,960
overlooking the mountains with pride.

512
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,230
From now on,

513
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,680
your name is Yang Ling.

514
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,440
Mom?

515
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,070
Give it to me. Give it to me to play.

516
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Give it to me to play.

517
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,960
Give it to me.

518
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,540
(Little Yang Ling)

519
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,270
I bought a new car.

520
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,120
Everyone, come and see.

521
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,310
Come over.

522
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,070
Hurry.

523
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,230
You didn't come home all night.

524
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,070
Where were you?

525
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,640
It was just a work meeting,

526
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,840
drinking with the boss.

527
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,230
Why are you making such a fuss?

528
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,390
Drinking?

529
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,680
Then what's this?

530
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,680
And who's this in your phone?

531
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
I'm sorry. I...

532
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,550
Get out. Get out of my sight.

533
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:20,400
One, two, one.

534
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,790
You finally passed the exam.

535
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,920
Don't give up because of my illness.

536
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,270
Mom, it's okay.

537
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,710
(Admissions Pamphlet)
I can enter the workforce early.

538
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,900
(Sept. 1, 2024. We met that day.)
Custom-made.

539
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,360
Custom-made.

540
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:01,160
Custom-made.

Lighting.

542
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Lighting.

543
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,300
(Why didn't I notice before?
The scenery on the road is beautiful.)

544
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,860
(Sept. 8. I saw her again.)

545
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,340
(Next time, I need to be cooler.)

546
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,980
Patterns.

547
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,640
(Sept. 15. I'll take the initiative.)
Patterns.

548
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,510
Patterns.

549
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,990
(With all the courage I have,)

550
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,220
(I still missed by one second.
I'm such a fool.)

551
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,260
(The last day of September.
An unexpected encounter.)

552
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,640
Excuse me.

553
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,160
I dropped my bag.

554
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,480
Hi.

555
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,030

557
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,960
We've met.

558
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,910
Hi.

559
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm Ke Ke.

560
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,480
Hello.

561
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,990
Your coffee's here.

562
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,900
(Our second year together)
Where is she?

563
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,760
Dummy.

564
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,630

(I worked hard.)

579
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,550
Mr. Wang,

580
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,840
is that house still available?

581
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,360
Sure, let me show you around.

582
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,470
Step aside.

583
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,640
- That's my client.
- What are you saying?

584
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,710
Mr. Li, Mrs. Li, come on.

585
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:13,790
Sorry. This way.

586
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,790
Sis, it's the layout I like, right?

587
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,750
Yes, the same one you saw last time.

588
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,880
Only two left now.

589
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,070
They're selling fast. Look.

590
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,710
This one gets great natural light.

591
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,400
(I thought I could give her a home.)
Good.

592
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,990
Come here. I've found this.

593
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,650
It's the perfect place for you.

594
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,500
Come here. Look.

595
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,710
Let me point it out for you.

596
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,540
Do you like villas
or spacious apartments?

597
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,470
I'll make enough money
to buy you a house here.

598
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,360
Look. That's the one I want.

599
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,480
That one.

600
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,390
Wait here.

601
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,030
Hey, bro.

602
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,860
Can I borrow your laser pointer?

603
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:45,680
Thanks.

604
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,760
See?

605
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,360
This one's amazing.

606
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,710
It's right by the lake.

607
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
We'll have a home with a lake view.

608
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,310
Let's come back

609
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,400

00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,550
I got accepted

611
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,800
So?

612
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,630
Alright, both of you.

613
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,030
Smile. Perfect.

614
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,780

and Dad's medical expenses.

618
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,280
Check how much is left.

619
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,720
(Current Deposit)
It's here.

620
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,720
I...

621
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,320
I'll think of another way.

622
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,070
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

623
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,220
overlooking the mountains with pride.

624
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,440

625
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960

626
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,030
Do you like it?

627
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,320
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

628
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,470
overlooking the mountains with pride.

629

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,310

634
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,110
We've met.

635
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,240
Sorry, this way, please.

636
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,190
Yes, the same one you saw last time.

637
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,280
Only two left now.

638
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
They're selling fast.

639
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,240
This one's amazing.

640
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,720
Look, it's right by the lake.

641
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
We'll have a home with a lake view.

642
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,320
Let's come back when we can afford it.

643
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,160
Wait.

From now on,

650
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,360
your name is Yang Ling.

651
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
What's going on?

652
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,030
Yeah, why isn't he moving?

653
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,960
What's wrong with him?

654
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
- I don't know.
- Is he losing?

655
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,720
- Can he do this?
- Is he just a pretty boy?

656
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Uncle, why isn't my brother moving?

657
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,160
It's okay.

658
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,200
Just wait.

659
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,760
It's been more than an hour.

660
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,720
If we lose this battle,

661
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,150
the balance of power

662
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,150
between us and Tianyu will shift.

663
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,510
You'd better

664
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,990
have a backup plan.

665
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,550
- Otherwise...
- Your Majesty,

666
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,440
haven't you felt anything?

667
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:11,990
Ningyan,

668
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,880
draw your saber.

669
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,760
Why is he frozen?

670
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,720
Only by seeing through the illusion

671
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,320
can one break the formation.

672
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,960
If he fails to break it,

673
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,960
his mind will shatter.

674
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,510
Then he'll be ruined.

675
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,350
No.

676
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,440
What do we do now?

677
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,880
Mr. Xu is trapped in the formation,

678
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,440
unable to fight back.

679
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,400
This duel seems hopeless.

680
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,630
I must reach the top of Mount Tai,

681
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,030
overlooking the mountains with pride.

682
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,800
From now on,
your name is Yang Ling.

683
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,030
Your life

684
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,440
has truly broadened my horizons.

685
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
In the end,

686
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,840
you've accomplished nothing.

687
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,720
All is void.

688
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,880
You've been trapped

689
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,920
by life,

690
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,190
love,

691
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,550
and your own mind,

692
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,110
day after day.

693
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,840
So, tell me:

694
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,590
What's the meaning

695
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,470
of your life?

696
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,030
The meaning of life?

697
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,630
An ordinary background,

698
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,360
a childhood of scarcity,

699
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,550
failed love,

700
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,720
and hopeless dreams.

701
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,920
Day after day,

702
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,880
year after year,

703
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,110
until I die like an ant.

704
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,670
Right.

705
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,320
By your standards,

706
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:24,070
I'm a complete failure.

707
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
However,

708
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,590
does a failed life

709
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,440
have no meaning?

710
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,030
There are many meanings

711
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,280
in one's life.

712
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,670
Living itself is meaningful.

713
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,190
I've been here.

714
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,240
I've done it.

715
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,720
I once had it.

716
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,030
Whether I succeed or fail,

717
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,720
the experience itself

718
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,400
is meaningful enough.
