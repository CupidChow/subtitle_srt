40
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,440
Hurry up and think of a plan.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
What are you looking at?

42
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,240
Your Highness, I have an idea

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,520
to make him swear loyalty to you

44
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
and never betray you.

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,880
However, this idea...

46
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,470
Hurry up and say it. Don't mystify it.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,360
Take him as your kept man.

48
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,960
Take him as my kept man?

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,720
Exactly.

50
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,390
If you take him as your kept man,

51
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,590
Huaiqing will naturally stop
competing with you.

52
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,670
But you'll need

53
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,830
to sacrifice your reputation.

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
That doesn't matter.

55
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,800
My reputation is spread far and wide.

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
Losing a little is no big deal.

57
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,640
But

58
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,960
what does "kept man" mean?

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
You...

60
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,760
You don't know?

61
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,520
I've never heard of it.

62
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,990
Do you guys know?

63
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,520
What are you waiting for?

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,360
Start to eat.

65
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,810
I'll finish this dish and join you.

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
Is he

67
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,390
crazy?

68
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,590
Is he trying to poison me?

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
He won't poison you,

70
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,590
but surely he's gone crazy.

71
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,960
Coming.

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,920
Come on.

73
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,550
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

74
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,270
Let's see.

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,340
If there is any housework,

76
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,110
just let me know,
and I'll take care of it.

77
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,360
Otherwise, if I fall asleep,

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,590
all my efforts will be wasted.

79
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,800
The plaque at the entrance

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,320
needs polishing, coloring, and waxing.

81
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,590
Perfect, sis.

82
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,990
I'll do it now. You all eat.

83
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,430
Don't wait for me. I'll eat later.

84
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,270
Don't mind me.

85
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,320
Ningyan.

86
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,110
Are you about to break through?

87
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,360
How do you know, Uncle?

88
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,220
How wise of you.

89
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,240
So soon?

90
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,200
What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,390
Yes, I'm happy.

92
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm really happy.

93
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,960
I've been alive for decades,

94
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,760
waiting for this day
when I shouldn't sleep.

95
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,640
Ningyan, I'm truly happy for you.

96
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,640
How did you cultivate yourself?

97
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
Can you teach me?

98
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,670
It's actually quite simple...

99
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,520
Ningyan!

100
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,110
Xu Qi'an!

101
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,710
I'll explain later. Coming!

102
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,150
Ningyan, where were you yesterday?

103
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,270
The chief asked about you.

104
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,590
I had something to do and left.

105
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,420
Why are you here?
Isn't today a rest day?

106
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,830
We have good news. Come here.

107
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,430
What good news?

108
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,300
Well...

109
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,350
Don't say we don't look out for you.

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,680
Let's go confiscate property.

111
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
Confiscate property?

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,420
Listen, the Taikang County Governor
got imprisoned, right?

113
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,320
His house should've been
confiscated long ago.

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
Because of Sangbo,

115
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,770
it was postponed for a few days.

116
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,640
How is confiscation good news?

117
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,830
I still have work to do.

118
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,520
(Xu Residence)
You haven't done it.

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,660
You don't know the rules.

120
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,520
Explain it to him.

121
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,490
During the confiscation,

122
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,060
the Recorders will inventory
valuable items in the front hall,

123
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,700
and record them.

124
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,190
The items will then be taken back.

125
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,630
But

126
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,130
the Recorders won't be
the ones who take them.

127
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,080
If the chief finds out about this,

128
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
it won't be good.

129
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you thinking?

130
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,560
We're saying

131
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,760
we can take things

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
that no one wants, right?

133
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,830
The unrecorded scraps and junk.

134
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,880
There might be
something valuable among them.

135
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,520
What do you usually say?

136
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,200
Seeking...

137
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,960
Seeking

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,590
reasonable profit.

139
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,430
Exactly.

140
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,680
- Hurry up and change.
- Hurry.

141
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,810
Wait for me. I'll be quick.

142
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,880
Hurry up.

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
(Xu Residence)

144
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,560
Uncle, I won't be eating at home.

145
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,520
Hurry up.

146
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,000
- Hurry.
- It's here, right?

147
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Yes.

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,030
Let's go. Hurry up.

149
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,320
Zhu, hurry up.

150
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,160
Bro,

151
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,520
has the Silver Gong leader arrived?

152
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,070
Breeze Hall?

153
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,030
You three are late.

154
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,710
Late?

155
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,320
Weren't they also late?

156
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,680
Bro.

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Yes, we're late.

158
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,000
We're late.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,680
Bro, don't hold it against us.

160
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,470
Let's not delay important matters.

161
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,260
(Zhu Chengzhu, Guardian,
7th Rank Fighter)

162
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,000
Draw your saber.

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
Don't act rashly.

164
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,640
You're tough, huh?

165
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,320
Stand straight to take a beating.

166
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,160
Go back.

167
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
Yes.

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,880
Watch carefully.

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,790
Learn from him.

170
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,680
Understood?

171
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,630
Very good.

172
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,470
Everyone, learn from him. Understood?

173
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
Understood?

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,590
- Yes.
- Yes.

175
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,630
Good.

176
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,620
My Lord, thanks for your teachings.

177
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,640
Mr. Song, are you okay?

178
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,160
Luckily, you didn't
draw your saber earlier.

179
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,380
Otherwise, you'd be done for.

180
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,680
I know.

181
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,230
Defying a superior is a grave offense.

182
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,950
His surname is Zhu.

183
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,200
He's the youngest Silver Gong
in our yamen.

184
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,500
His father is also a Zhu.

185
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,830
So what?

186
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,870
Aren't you also a Zhu?

187
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,750
Are you his father?

188
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,440
Gold Gong Zhu?

189
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,470
Yes, exactly.

190
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,280
He's not only the youngest Silver Gong
in our yamen

191
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,920
but also the most promising young man

192
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,440
in the capital of the Dafeng

193
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,830
before you showed up.

194
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,140
A few days ago, I went drinking
with one of his Copper Gongs.

195
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,000
He mentioned

196
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,470
that Silver Gong Zhu
dislikes our Breeze Hall.

197
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,160
He dislikes Yuchun.

198
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,650
And he especially dislikes you.

199
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,110
He's said more than once

200
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,590
that you're just a Copper Gong...

201
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,470
(Giving me trouble, huh?)

202
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:54,060
(Liu Mansion)

203
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,990
Good! Good!

204
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,230
What a jerk.

205
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,060
(Clear Skies)

206
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,640
Take it.

207
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,080
It's okay.

208
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,520
Take some for them.

209
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,560
What is it?

210
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,920
Who else is hiding things?

211
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,700
They all are.

212
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,920
You three.

213
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,560
Haven't you had enough beatings?

214
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,680
Put those things down.

215
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,380
(Impartial and Upright)

216
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,280
Stay here, all of you.

217
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,200
Don't go anywhere.

218
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,830
Clean up all this trash

219
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,960
on the ground.

220
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,080
If it's not clean,

221
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,630
I'll kill you.

222
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:46,710
Do you hear me?

223
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,000
Do you hear me?

224
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,550
Yes.

225
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,040
I can't hear it.

226
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
Yes!

227
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,300
(Impartial and Upright)

228
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,230
We still got something.

229
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,040
Ningyan,

230
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,680
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,160
I thought it would be a good thing.

232
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,070
But...

233
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,880
No.

234
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,710
It's me who dragged you into this.

235
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,660
Ningyan,

236
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,110
you touched your arm
several times.

237
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,080
Is the injury serious?

238
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,560
That jerk used his Qi force?

239
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,350
Ningyan, listen to me.

240
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
You can file a complaint
about this.

241
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,920
Go and tell the chief.

242
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:02,880
He'll stand up for you.

243
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,740
Forget it.

244
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,440
No need to trouble the chief.

245
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
I'll go find Lord Wei.

246
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,400
Let me go!

247
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
Let me go!

248
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,190
What's going on?

249
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,680
- Don't act rashly.
- Let go!

250
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,750
The document states this.

251
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,040
His family shall not suffer.

252
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,710
Let's get to work.

253
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,470
I don't want to!

254
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,960
- Please spare me. I beg you.
- Don't.

255
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,280
Ningyan.

256
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,520
- Please.
- Louder.

257
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,320
- Please.
- Louder.

258
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
I beg you.

259
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,280
Here.

260
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,110
- Miss, go.
- Get lost.

261
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,800
Go.

262
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,960
Xu Qi'an.

263
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,710
- I...
- Come on.

264
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,550
Strike me.

265
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,040
I've remembered your name.

266
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,830
When I return,
I'll report you to Lord Wei.

267
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,550
Fine.

268
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,830
Just wait.

269
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,710
I'll go find the chief now.

270
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,680
I'll destroy you all.

271
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,630
Let me go.

272
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,070
Move aside.

273
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,560
Let me go.

274
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,470
You are really beasts.

275
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,210
One person per room. Rescue them.

276
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,800
Let go of me!

277
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,560
Zhu, let go!

278
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,350
If you dare touch her again,

279
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,170
I'll immediately report you to Lord Wei.

280
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,750
What an ignorant fool.

281
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,710
What's going on?

282
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,040
Let go of me!

283
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,510
Let go of me!

284
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,680
What will you do to me?

285
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,710
Ningyan!

286
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,240
Don't act rashly.

287
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Don't act rashly.

288
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,400
You know the consequences.

289
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,070
Let her go,

290
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,990
or I'll take your life.

291
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Did you hear that?

292
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,800
He said he'd take my life.

293
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Alright then.

294
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,800
Let's see

295
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,230
how you'll take my life.

296
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,560
Help me!

297
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,080
Let go!

298
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,590
Die!

299
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,510
(Focus on one thing)

300
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,080
(to achieve greatness.)

301
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
My Lord!

302
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,680
- Ningyan.
- My Lord.

303
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,750
- Ningyan.
- My Lord.

304
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,270
Ningyan, run.

305
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,170
You won't survive this. Just escape.

306
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,270
If I run,

307
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,120
what about my family?

308
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,640
What about you guys?

309
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,360
Is it worth it?

310
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
Is it worth risking your life
for a stranger?

311
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,510
It's not about worth.

312
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,640
Some things in life

313
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,680
are greater than life itself.

314
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Surround them!

315
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:25,670
♪Heaven and earth gave birth to me♪

316
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,640
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an
assaulted a superior,

317
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,120
defying the law.

318
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,640
He is to be escorted by Breeze Hall

319
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,960
to the yamen for trial.

320
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,070
Guangxiao, I'll go

321
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,600
and report this to the chief.

322
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,920
Remember. Do not let
Silver Gong Zhu's men escort him.

323
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,070
Take care of him.

324
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
Move aside!

325
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,040
Move aside!

326
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,280
Move aside!

327
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,280
Move aside!

328
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,340
(Xu Qi'an)
Chief!

329
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,200
Yuchun!

330
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,310
Something's wrong!

331
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,600
Something huge!

332
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,400
Why are you so panicky?

333
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,470
Xu Qi'an almost killed Silver Gong Zhu.

334
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,990
Hurry and save him.

335
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,600
Guangxiao is escorting him
back to the yamen now.

336
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,270
Gold Gong Zhu will soon hear of it.

337
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,710
I fear Xu Qi'an won't even make it
to the yamen alive.

338
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,360
Hurry, Yuchun!

339
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,040
Chengzhu!

340
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,640
Chengzhu!

341
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,710
Is there still hope?

342
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,750
(Zhu Yang, Guardian, 4th Rank Fighter)
His Silver Gong shielded him

343
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,310
and kept his life.

344
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,480
Chengzhu.

345
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,640
Father is here.

346
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,880
Wake up.

347
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,990
Chengzhu!

348
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,920
What happened?

349
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,170
The saber force
entered his organs.

350
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,120
We need a sorcerer
from the Astronomical Bureau

351
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,710
to save him.

352
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,990
Where is the sorcerer?

353
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,320
Someone has gone to fetch them.

354
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,240
They'll be here soon.

355
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,230
Call them over.

356
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,670
If they don't arrive in time,

357
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,880
I'll have you die with my son!

358
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,720
Yes.

359
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,350
Son.

360
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,280
Father.

361
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,350
Chengzhu.

362
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,790
Xu

363
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,470
Qi

364
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,230
An!

365
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,230
Hurry up.

366
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,750
You are only safe in the yamen.

367
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,600
Gold Gong Zhu.

368
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,270
You're Xu Qi'an?

369
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,040
My Lord,

370
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,030
Xu Qi'an belongs to Breeze Hall.

371
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,310
Please allow me to bring him back.

372
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,720
Guangxiao!

373
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,230
You're the one

374
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,510
who injured my son.

375
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,790
Any last words?

376
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,600
I regret

377
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,550
not killing that scum.

378
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,510
Die!

379
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,960
How dare you touch someone
from Breeze Hall?

380
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,590
Guangxiao,

381
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,840
are you alright?

382
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,840
Chief, I...

383
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,800
I know.

384
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,800
Don't speak.

385
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,710
Yang Yan,

386
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:47,120
he almost killed my only son!

387
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,750
So what?

388
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,840
Are you sure you want to protect him?

389
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,070
Yes.

390
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,760
Stop.

391
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,680
Lord Wei has ordered

392
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,570
that Xu Qi'an be brought
back to the yamen,

393
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,770
where he will decide this.

394
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
Lord Wei,

395
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,360
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an injured

396
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,990
my son Zhu Chengzhu severely.

397
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,990
He's still teetering

398
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,990
on the brink of life and death.

399
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,360
Lord Wei,

400
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,160
please seek justice for me

401
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
and punish Xu Qi'an harshly.

402
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,070
Lord Wei,

403
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,020
Zhu Chengzhu tried to assault
the convicted official's family.

404
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,650
Xu Qi'an tried to stop him but failed,

405
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,170
and only then did he act out of anger.

406
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,610
Nonsense!

407
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,120
It's clear Xu Qi'an held
a personal grudge.

408
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,470
You have a disagreement.

409
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,560
Let's hear the testimonies.

410
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,710
Greetings, Lord Wei.

411
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,840
Tell Lord Wei everything.

412
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,390
Lord Wei,

413
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,200
Xu Qi'an was late for the assembly.

414
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,920
Silver Gong Zhu disciplined him.

415
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,550
Unexpectedly, he held a grudge.

416
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,710
During the confiscation,

417
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,070
Xu Qi'an noticed Silver Gong Zhu
behaving inappropriately

418
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,700
towards the convicted official's family,

419
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,310
so he used this as an excuse,

420
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,560
drew his saber, and attacked.

421
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,990
Lord Wei.

422
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,610
- I need to report.
- I need to report.

423
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,680
During assembly,

424
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,400
we weren't late.

425
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,260
But Silver Gong Zhu
made things hard for us,

426
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,510
beating both Xu Qi'an and me.

427
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,640
During the confiscation,

428
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,290
he forced us to stay in the front hall,

429
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,770
forbidding us to enter
the courtyard.

430
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,090
We had no choice but to comply

431
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,400
until cries from the women
in the courtyard reached us.

432
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,920
Xu Qi'an, unable to endure it,

433
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,240
rushed to stop Silver Gong Zhu.

434
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,920
But instead of stopping, Silver Gong Zhu

435
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,550
dragged the woman into the courtyard,

436
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,000
intending to assault her in public.

437
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,750
It was to force Xu Qi'an to act.

438
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,390
Lord Wei,

439
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,410
these two have close personal ties
with Xu Qi'an,

440
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,160
so their testimonies
are inevitably biased

441
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,470
and unreliable.

442
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,630
Lord Wei,

443
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,880
there were other Copper Gongs present.

444
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,840
They can testify.

445
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,920
Speak truthfully,

446
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,120
and you will not be punished.

447
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,520
During assembly,

448
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,130
Xu Qi'an and the others were not late.

449
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,360
Silver Gong Zhu did drag the woman
into the courtyard,

450
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,840
intending to humiliate her before us.

451
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,530
His words were

452
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,160
full of provocation
towards Xu Qi'an.

453
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,310
Shut up!

454
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,230
Even so,

455
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,270
it should be handled by the yamen.

456
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,920
Since when can mere Copper Gongs

457
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
administer punishment?

458
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,800
Lord Wei,

459
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,360
Xu Qi'an defied his superior.

460
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,920
According to the Guardians' rules,

461
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
he should be cut in half.

462
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,840
Your son Zhu Chengzhu

463
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,310
ignored the law

464
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,400
and acted recklessly.

465
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,360
He is dismissed starting today

466
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,020
and will never be employed again.

467
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,790
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an,

468
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,990
for attacking a Silver Gong

469
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,810
and causing serious injury,

470
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
is guilty of a heinous crime.

471
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,230
He is to be imprisoned.

472
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,920
Seven days later,

473
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,360
he shall be cut in half
at the market gate.

474
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,680
- Lord Wei!
- Lord Wei!

475
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
You may all leave.

476
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,110
Lord Wei.

477
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,550
Dedicating oneself to the people

478
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,550
without seeking personal gain.

479
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,740
Do you mean it?

480
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,440

Mr. Xu,

508
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,310
Ningyan injured a Silver Gong.

509
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,680
Lord Wei has decreed

510
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
he be cut in half.

511
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,630
Take care.

512
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,310
Chief, we've told his family.

513
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,520
Apologies.

514
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,440
We did all we could.

515
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,840
Do we have any colleagues left
who can help?

516
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,330
We've contacted everyone we could.

517
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,040
Except for the Gold Gongs.

518
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,230
But we can't reach them.

519
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,260
(Upright and Incorruptible;
Just and Impartial)

520
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:50,620
(Breeze Hall)

521
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,070
You two,

522
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,230
drink with me for a while.

523
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,070
Chief.

524
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,960
I know you've been hiding wine

525
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
and sneaking drinks while on duty.

526
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,900
(Just and Impartial)

527
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,200
I understand

528
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,470
Lord Wei has his difficulties.

529
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:33,160
Xu Qi'an did make a mistake.

530
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,750
That idiot.

531
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,990
He nearly killed someone with his saber.

532
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,550
And the victim was a Silver Gong.

533
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,960
I thought I was foolish,

534
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,200
but he's even worse.

535
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,070
If I'd known,
I wouldn't have recruited him.

536
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,710
It's maddening.

537
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,990
He deserved it.

538
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,640
He's indeed more talented than others.

539
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,310
But with such a commotion,

540
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,230
the entire yamen was watching.

541
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
Could Lord Wei show blatant favoritism?

542
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:36,310
What would happen to his authority?

543
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,470
Building a reputation takes years,

544
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,680
but destroying it only takes a moment.

545
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,200
If he showed favoritism
toward Xu Qi'an,

546
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,880
who'd trust Lord Wei afterward?

547
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,960
Now, it's settled.

548
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,030
One is dismissed,

549
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,880
and the other will be executed.

550
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,270
Justice served!

Ningyan.

554
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,470
Look at your bowl.

555
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,400
(Xu)
Even the pattern is unsymmetrical.

556
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:35,470
In the long days to come,

557
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,120
everyone in the yamen

558
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,270
will keep to the rules.

559
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,600
Xu Qi'an,

560
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,790
your death will not be for nothing.

561
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,940
It'll be worth it.

562
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,580

563
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,510

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,340
(Wang Xiuhe,
wife of the Vice Minister of Rites)

566
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,880
Ms. Xiuhe.

567
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,960
Ms. Ru.

568
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,800
It's been a long time.

569
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,440
I almost didn't recognize you.

570
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,670
There have been

571
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,400
many family matters.

572
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,920
I've been too busy to visit.

573
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,630
Please forgive me.

574
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,440
Here are some pastries.

575
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,240
Please accept them.

576
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
(Moon Resto)

577
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,190
This is from Moon Resto.

578
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,150
It must've cost you a lot.

579
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,470
You never gift me anything.

580
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,840
What's the occasion today?

581
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:59,320
Why are you so generous?

582
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,030
It's because my nephew, Xu Qi'an,

583
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,150
accidentally injured a Silver Gong

584
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,590
and was sentenced to death

585
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,070
by Lord Wei.

586
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,990
So, I was hoping

587
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,630
to ask the Vice Minister

588
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,470
to intercede

589
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,280
and save

590
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,880
my nephew's life.

591
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,030
My husband
is the Vice Minister of Rites.

592
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,960
He does have

593
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,440
- influence in the court.
- Yes.

594
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,030
However, with his high position,

595
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,920
he can't help a condemned criminal
for no reason.

596
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,590
If political rivals get hold of this,

597
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,550
he'd suffer because of me.

598
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,400
You'd better take these back.

599
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,470
Let's go home.

600
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:06,380
(Xu Residence)

601
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
Dear.

602
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,280
Dear.

603
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,510
What did Wang Xiuhe say?

604
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,960
She agreed to help.

605
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:32,960
Where's your bracelet?

606
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,920
I exchanged it for favors.

607
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,400
That was part of your dowry.

608
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,070
It's just a possession.

609
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,630
When Ningyan returns,

610
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:45,240
I'll deduct it
from his next month's salary.

611
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,670
How did the Bureau respond?

612
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,840
I met Song Qing.

613
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,560
He said

614
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,360
the Bureau couldn't interfere

615
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,840
in Guardians' matters.

616
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,960
The Imperial Guards also...

617
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,630
As his uncle, I've failed.

618
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,800
Now is not the time to despair.

619
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,670
Let's wait for Xinnian's return.

620
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,360
Perhaps...

621
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,990
Perhaps he has a solution.

622
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,590
I'm just a small Copper Gong.

623
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,990
My words are insignificant.

624
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,590
I don't have the right to choose.

625
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,650
You're paid as a court official.

626
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,030
You live off the people's resources.

627
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,490
You can easily oppress
the common people,

628
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,130
but you can't fool the heavens.

629
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,440
I meant it too.

630
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,360
The human minds are hard to read.

631
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,150
Judging hearts is like solving cases.

632
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,510
One must not

633
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,070
make hasty conclusions

634
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,720
based on temporary biases.

635
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,460
(Steadfast Enforcement)

636
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,320
Do you think I judged wrongly?

637
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,740
(Long and Arduous)
I dare not.

638
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,440
However, Xu Qi'an only acted
out of righteousness

639
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,990
because the Silver Gong

640
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,470
humiliated a woman.

641
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,550
I believe

642
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,390
this act

643
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,110
serves to deter immorality
within the yamen.

644
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,240
Lord Wei, please have mercy

645
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,150
and spare Copper Gong Xu's life.

646
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,440
(Devotion to Duty)
Lord Wei, please have mercy

647
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,150
and spare Copper Gong Xu's life.

648
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,510
Father,

649
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,510
please have mercy.

650
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
Xu Qi'an has quite the support.

651
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,580
It's only early morning,
but many have come for him.

652
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,720
All the Gold Gongs

653
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,990
have shown up,

654
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,590
except for Zhu.

655
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,640
Father,

656
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,650
one more won't make a difference.

657
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,400
Father,

658
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,840
please have mercy.

659
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,280
Do you think I judged wrongly as well?

660
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,630
Father, you're not wrong.

661
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,190
But neither

662
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,830
is Xu Qi'an.

663
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,840
Chief, don't be impulsive.

664
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,550
There must be another way, Chief.

665
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,710
Don't go there.

666
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,920
- Yuchun.
- There must be another way.

667
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,400
- Yuchun.
- Don't go there.

668
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,240
Chief.

669
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,550
Chief, think it through.

670
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,390
Chief.

671
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,630
Wei Yuan!

672
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,360
Get out!

673
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
Chief.

674
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,990
Everyone, rise.

675
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,990
Li Yuchun, how dare you!

676
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,320
Chief.

677
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,610
You...

678
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,510
(Rule With Virtue)
Subordinate Li Yuchun.

679
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,440
Chief!

680
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,030
Calm down.

681
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,030
He's drunk.

682
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,960
He's not thinking straight,

683
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,240
so he's speaking nonsense.

684
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,840
- He's a lousy drinker.
- Get out.

685
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,760
Yuchun.

686
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:49,990
Get lost!

687
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,440
Subordinate Li Yuchun.

688
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,590
I joined the yamen in Yuanjing Year 20.

689
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,670
Since then, I have remained loyal

690
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,400
to my duties.

691
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,880
I swore to root out corrupt officials

692
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,510
and pledged allegiance to my country.

693
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,320
For 17 years,

694
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,280
I have worked tirelessly,

695
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,630
never derelict in duty,

696
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,630
never accepting bribes,

697
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,550
and never oppressing the innocent.

698
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,150
I believed

699
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,990
that my fervent dedication

700
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,240
would bring about a world of justice.

701
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,910
Yet,

702
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,920
in these 17 years,

703
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:37,510
I've witnessed countless colleagues
oppressing civilians and merchants.

704
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,840
During confiscations,
they always embezzle money

705
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,760
and defile the families
of convicted officials.

706
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,400
The line

707
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,280
