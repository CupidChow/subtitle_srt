So is that man in black

41
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,960
coveting my fortune?

42
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,190
Here's a friendly reminder.

43
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,910
Before Shen Shu reemerges,

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,110
do not set foot outside the Dafeng.

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,520
Let me tell you.

46
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,710
Prime Minister Wang

47
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,760
seems like a reasonable person.

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,110
- Really.
- Really?

49
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,080
Of course.

50
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,540
What are you doing with the saber?

51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,200
To practice it.

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,200
Did we really talk for that long?

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,110
It's already mealtime.

54
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,200
Let's go to eat.

55
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,390
Why do I feel sore in my arm
after talking to you?

56
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,880
You have shoulder inflammation.

57
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,390
Senior,

58
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,270
are we really leaving like this?

59
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,760
The Supervisor is right.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,800
Staying by his side

61
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,760
is the best for Shen Shu.

62
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,320
Father,

63
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,000
the wind is strong at night.

64
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,270
Get some rest early.

65
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,870
It's getting late.

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,360
You should rest now.

67
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,580
(Noble Ambitions)

68
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,270
There's something

69
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,430
on Xu Qi'an's body that belongs to me.

70
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,390
You can have Shen Shu,

71
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,520
but I must have

72
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,270
Xu Qi'an.

73
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,470
(He's been eyeing me for a long time.)

74
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,960
(When did this start?)

75
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,240
(I'm just a small Guardian.)

76
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,870
(If he wants to take me away,)

77
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,390
(he must have many ways.)

78
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,740
(Tax Silver Case Closing File)

79
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,540
(Xu Qi'an was sentenced
to exile in Yunzhou.)

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,520
(During the Tax Silver Case,)

81
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,590
(I was going to be exiled to Yunzhou.)

82
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,220
(Zhou Li Kidnapping Zhang Yunying)

83
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,920
Do you want to be tortured
before signing it

84
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
or sign it before being tortured?

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,900
(Confession)

86
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,560
(From the Tax Silver Case)

87
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,000
(to Zhou Li's case,)

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,120
(were they all to convict me)

89
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,760
(and exile me to Yunzhou?)

90
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,660
(Yunzhou)

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,280
My Lord,

92
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,570
sorry for my incompetence.

93
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,710
I didn't bring Xu Qi'an
out of the Dafeng.

94
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,270
Please punish me.

95
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,110
It's okay.

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,350
With the Supervisor protecting him
in the capital,

97
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,880
even the two Prophets
of Tianyu are helpless.

98
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,520
Why should you belittle yourself?

99
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,430
My Lord,

100
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,790
what about our plan?

101
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,390
When the time comes,

102
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,440
he will naturally come.

103
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,670
Yes.

104
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,680
(But I've been to Yunzhou.)

105
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,760
(I even retrieved the tax silver.)

106
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,030
(The man in black didn't take me away.)

107
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,590
(He only placed Shen Shu inside me.)

108
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,440
(Why is that?)

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,520
He's formidable.

110
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,710
What we know for sure is that

111
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
he's a Hypnotizer of The Witcher's Sect.

112
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,120
He told us about Shen Shu

113
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,790
to force us into a conflict
with the Supervisor,

114
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,960
so he could take you out of the Dafeng.

115
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,560
(The Supervisor.)

116
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,270
(The man in black fears the Supervisor.)

117
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,540
(The only explanation is
that after the Zhou Li Case,)

118
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,590
(the man in black knew
the Supervisor had noticed me.)

119
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,590
(He couldn't take me away
under the Supervisor's nose.)

120
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,940
(So,)

121
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,960
(he placed Shen Shu inside me,)

122
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,320
(using him as a tool.)

123
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,710
(With this,)

124
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,440
(everything makes sense.)

125
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,830
(The man in black wants to take me,)

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,370
(while the Supervisor has been
secretly protecting me.)

127
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,200
(They've been plotting in the shadows,)

128
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,760
(like a hidden line in the grass.)

129
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,790
(Countless subtle battles
have taken place.)

130
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,200
(And all of this)

131
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,080
(is for the strange fortune inside me.)

132
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,000
(And this fortune)

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,710
(is the Palace's secret treasure.)

134
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,790
I don't even know

135
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,350
where those little thieves

136
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
from 19 years ago went.

137
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,760
Xu Qi'an,

138
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,520
what are you doing

139
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,790
in the Manual Archive so late?

140
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,760
Are you on a great mission
from Lord Wei?

141
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
No.

142
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,270
Then what's behind you?

143
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,110
The Tax Silver Case, right?

144
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,990
Yes.

145
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,830
These cases were closed long ago.

146
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,640
What's the hidden secret?

147
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,560
Why has Father also been
reading them these days?

148
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,070
Lord Wei

149
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,270
has also been reviewing these old cases?

150
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,350
Not only that,

151
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,520
he also asked me to bring
everything related to these files

152
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,000
from the Municipal Office.

153
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,230
He said someone would review it.

154
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,910
I didn't expect it to be you.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,910
Come out.

156
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,850
Do you have something to say?

157
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,750
Yes.

158
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,560
Wine.

159
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,670
Tell me.

160
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,800
Lord Wei,

161
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,350
when I was back home...

162
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,190
No.

163
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,350
When I was in Changle County as a Speed,

164
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,040
I learned a drinking game
from a commoner.

165
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,220
It's based on the points of the dice.

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,470
The one with the smaller points

167
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,960
either answers a question

168
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,200
or drinks a cup of wine.

169
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,200
I'd like to play this game with you.

170
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,960
If you don't want to drink,

171
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,960
then speak your true thoughts.

172
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,080
If you're not interested,

173
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,750
I'll leave now.

174
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,030
Do you really want to play?

175
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,630
(Point: 4, 5, 9)

176
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,560
(Point: 9, 9, 9)

177
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,750
Then I'll ask first.

178
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,160
Lord Wei,

179
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,310
what is

180
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,920
your relationship with the Empress?

181
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,040
You seem to know quite a lot.

182
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,870
I might tell you

183
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,160
about this later,

184
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
but right now,

185
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
it has nothing to do with your concern.

186
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,320
(Point: 5, 6, 11)

187
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,630
(Point: 9, 9, 9)

188
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,230
Lord Wei, do you remember

189
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,470
what happened in the Palace

190
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,230
during the Battle of Linyuan Pass?

191
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,200
If you're asking about the theft

192
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,510
of the Palace's secret treasure,

193
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,510
I know about that.

194
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,700
The thief waited for the right moment

195
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,680
and stole the treasure.

196
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,990
By the time we noticed,

197
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
he had already

198
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,320
fled the Dafeng.

199
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,350
What was that treasure?

200
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,920
I think

201
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,590
it was the national fortune

202
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,680
of the Dafeng that was stolen.

203
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,680
Still want to play?

204
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,590
Sure.

205
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,920
(Point: 9, 9, 9)

206
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,800
(Point: 9, 9, 9)

207
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,990
How rare.

208
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,080
We can each ask one question.

209
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,920
Alright.

210
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,160
What is

211
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,440
the national fortune?

212
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,560
Among the various systems,

213
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,960
the ones most closely related to fortune
are the Bureau and the Academy.

214
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,040
The Men Sect

215
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,320
is only half of it.

216
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,350
And independent of them,

217
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,960
the foundation of the nation

218
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,230
is represented
by the Dafeng's national fortune.

219
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,620
(Rule With Virtue)

220
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,470
Whenever war begins,

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,020
it marks the start
of the shaking of the national fortune.

222
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,040
Victory

223
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,510
will increase the national fortune.

224
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,590
Defeat

225
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,990
will decrease it.

226
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,440
The larger the scale of the battle,

227
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,560
the more violently
the national fortune shakes.

228
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,470
In the Battle of Linyuan Pass
in Yuanjing Year 17,

229
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,870
the nations were in chaos,

230
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,440
and the total number of troops involved
exceeded a million.

231
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,990
The scale was so massive

232
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,040
that it's rare in history.

233
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,830
The shaking of the national fortune

234
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,110
was also unprecedented.

235
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,040
The thief,

236
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,990
taking advantage of its shaking,

237
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,400
stole the national fortune.

238
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,320
For the following 20 years,

239
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,320
the Dafeng

240
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,960
has been on edge

241
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,200
with constant war and natural disasters.

242
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,230
His Majesty sent people several times

243
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,590
to investigate,

244
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,590
but the thief's tracks were elusive,

245
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,990
and the matter remains unsolved.

246
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,830
What would happen if it's recovered?

247
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,200
We'll have good harvests

248
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,960
and a prosperous nation

249
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,590
that is unparalleled

250
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,040
in the world.

251
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,710
What if it can't be recovered?

252
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,230
Surrounded by wolves and tigers,

253
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,750
the Dafeng

254
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,400
will be in danger.

255
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,830
Now, it's my turn to ask.

256
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,350
The national fortune of the Dafeng

257
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,110
is inside you, isn't it?

258
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,830
Not only that,

259
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,920
the sealed object under Sangbo Lake

260
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,870
is also within you.

261
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,960
In that case,

262
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,110
proceed with Xu Qi'an's matter

263
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,870
as you all said.

264
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,280
Your Majesty, how wise of you.

265
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,200
Continue.

266
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,110
There's no need
to keep rolling the dice.

267
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,590
Lord Wei,

268
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,400
when I was in Yunzhou,

269
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,230
the evil object entered my body.

270
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,510
This person is from Tianyu

271
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,750
and is named Shen Shu.

272
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,200
But he has no memory of the past

273
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,960
and knows nothing about it.

274
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,910
I only discovered

275
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,320
through the remaining fragments

276
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,470
that it was a man in black

277
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,800
who intentionally
placed him inside me...

278
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,280
Afterward, you began
investigating his identity,

279
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,710
came to ask me

280
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,470
about the Battle of Linyuan Pass,

281
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,920
and went to the Ministry of Personnel
using Li Miaozhen's case.

282
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,160
There, you found out

283
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,280
that a treasure was stolen
from the Palace

284
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,800
and guessed

285
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,470
that the stolen treasure

286
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,160
was related to the evil object
inside you, right?

287
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,990
And then,

288
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,440
the Prophets of Tianyu
told you something.

289
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,440
You were afraid that the man in black

290
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,920
might come after you,

291
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,280
so you hurried to the Manual Archive

292
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,830
to trace the source

293
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,040
and reviewed the files

294
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,560
on the Tax Silver Case and Zhou Li Case.

295
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,960
Then you realized

296
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,680
it seemed

297
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,080
I already knew everything.

298
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,510
What should you do now?

299
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,440
You couldn't hide

300
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,800
or run.

301
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,990
So, you decided not to hesitate,

302
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,960
and under the pretext of a game,

303
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,470
you came here

304
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,750
to test my intentions.

305
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,110
Xu Qi'an,

306
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,350
you've done well.

307
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,630
Lord Wei,

308
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,960
you know everything.

309
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,800
You are someone I value.

310
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,110
I always thoroughly investigate

311
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,630
anyone I plan to cultivate.

312
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,400
Your extraordinary cultivation speed,

313
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,200
the Supervisor's favor towards you,

314
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,560
the attitude of the Loong towards you,

315
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,710
the appearance

316
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,920
of the Second Sage's Knife
during the duel,

317
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,990
and today's constant rolling
of full points.

318
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,510
With all of these things,

319
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,110
combined

320
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,110
with some secrets I know,

321
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,710
I can guess most of it
with a simple review.

322
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,280
Before the duel, you came to ask me

323
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,680
why the Supervisor sent you into battle.

324
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,920
I remember I once asked you

325
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,080
if you had anything to say.

326
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
I hoped you would be honest with me,

327
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,560
but you chose to hide the truth.

328
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Xu Qi'an,

329
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,440
do you really believe
the Supervisor won't harm you

330
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,280
and the evil object won't kill you?

331
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,630
You trust everyone,

332
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,200
but the only one you don't trust

333
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,830
is me.

334
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,830
What are you doing?

335
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,560
- Get up.
- How could I not trust you?

336
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,750
Please allow me to hold onto your thigh.

337
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,710
Come out.

338
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,310
The Supervisor is a god-like figure.

339
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,550
I don't trust him.

340
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,230
I'm simply afraid of provoking him.

341
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,840
And that Shen Shu.

342
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,270
He told me to keep his secret.

343
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,880
Lord Wei, you don't know
how powerful he is.

344
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
I simply don't dare make a move.

345
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,840
Why didn't you tell me?

346
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,510
I've told you before.

347
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,030
As a Guardian,

348
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,500
as long as you don't commit any crime,

349
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,880
I will protect you

350
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,160
even if the sky falls.

351
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,310
Lord Wei, I was wrong.

352
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,070
Please don't be angry.

353
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,400
Calm down.

354
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,960
Anger isn't good for your health.

355
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,840
Lord Wei.

356
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,510
Lord Wei.

357
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,960
Lord Wei.

358
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,910
Lord Wei.

359
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,070
I...

360
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,440
I still have one last question.

361
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,230
The name in the blank

362
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,230
was erased by someone using a spell,

363
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,920
so no one could remember him.

364
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
I've investigated his identity,

365
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,780
but there's no conclusion yet.

366
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,440
However,

367
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,470
the spell is called Mystify.

368
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,550
Only a 2nd Rank sorcerer can cast it.

369
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,680
This spell is extremely dangerous.

370
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,710
If it's used,

371
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,640
it'll result in the devastation
of all life.

372
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,440
The caster must refine boundless malice

373
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,400
to condense a Soul Pill,

374
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,790
which serves as a formation guide.

375
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,960
Only then is it possible.

376
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,790
A 2nd Rank sorcerer.

377
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,840
The Bureau.

378
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,150
Lord Wei,

379
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,360
would the Supervisor be behind it?

380
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,440
Are you scared?

381
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:00,920
Lord Wei.

382
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,310
No need to doubt the Supervisor.

383
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,270
He's laid deep plans for you,

384
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,680
so he won't harm you for now.

385
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,120
Besides, he's been in a long game
with the man in black,

386
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,990
attacking and countering.

387
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,440
None of this concerns you.

388
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,600
Then what if

389
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,640
His Majesty notices

390
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,750
the national fortune is with me?

391
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,070
What will he do?

392
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,070
Caught between the three players,

393
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,680
you don't know what to do, right?

394
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,680
So you asked me

395
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,710
what my relationship
with the Empress is.

396
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,880
It was just to see

397
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,750
if I'd abandon the Empress

398
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,550
and fall out with His Majesty for you,

399
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,480
right?

400
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,070
So,

401
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,960
Lord Wei, will you?

402
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,120
So if there's a chance,

403
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,790
I will kill you.

404
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,920
Lord Wei, please drink some tea.

405
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,790
Calm down.

406
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,360
No more drinking with me?

407
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,800
Of course not.

408
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,510
Don't overthink it.

409
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,550
Keep walking the path
the Supervisor has paved for you.

410
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,270
During this time,

411
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,920
accumulate your power,

412
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,440
and promote your rank,

413
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,750
so one day,

414
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,750
you will no longer be a pawn.

415
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,440
Understand?

416
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,160
Rest assured.

417
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,160
I will help you.

418
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,160
I knew you were the best.

419
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,750
Don't be mad.

420
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,750
I know I was wrong.

421
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,910
Father.

422
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,200
Here's an edict.

423
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,640
Greetings, Lord Wei.

424
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,400
Greetings, Eunuch.

425
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,880
Mr. Xu is here as well.

426
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,470
It's perfect.

427
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,680
You can receive the edict together.

428
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,160
Xu Qi'an, Silver Gong of the Guardians,

429
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,640
cleaved the Dharma,

430
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,270
protected the nation,

431
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,310
and promoted the Dafeng's prestige.

432
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,270
He shall be

433
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,790
granted a viscount title.

434
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,520
Furthermore,

435
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,510
after the tri-ministries'
recommendation,

436
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,960
Xu Qi'an, Silver Gong of the Guardians,

437
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,270
talented and decisive,

438
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,990
with great virtue,

439
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,680
is hereby appointed

440
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,920
as the Lead Investigator,

441
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,070
leading the tri-ministries' officials

442
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,840
to Chuzhou to investigate

443
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,920
the Bloodshed Case

444
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,790
and departing in seven days.

445
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,920
The end.

446
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

447
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,680
Lord Wei,

448
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,550
goodbye.

449
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
Eunuch, take care.

450
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,880
His Majesty has ordered

451
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,990
that in seven days,

452
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,710
you'd join the investigation team
to Chuzhou.

453
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,000
My Lady,

454
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,470
please prepare in advance.

455
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,500
(Duchess Zhenbei)

456
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Is there anything else?

457
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,230
If not, get lost.

458
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,840
We've finally reached this point.

459
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,590
My Lord,

460
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,060
news from the capital.

461
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,470
Emperor Yuanjing sent a delegation

462
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,400
to thoroughly investigate
the Bloodshed Case.

463
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,710
The Lead Investigator is

464
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,550
Xu Qi'an.

465
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,550
Are you sure it's Xu Qi'an?

466
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,120
Absolutely certain.

467
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
I believe

468
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,610
Emperor Yuanjing has sensed
where the national fortune lies,

469
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,230
but he is wary of protection
from various factions,

470
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,360
so he's using others
to do the dirty work.

471
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,600
What should we do next?

472
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,790
My Lord, please guide us.

473
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,300
(Three days later)

474
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,640
The river flows east,

475
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,750
washing away heroes of history.

476
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,550
I walk more briskly than a horse
with a bamboo staff.

477
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,400
Who is afraid?

478
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,790
I face the rain and fog,
unfazed by life.

479
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,120
I wrote these lines out of sincerity.

480
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,640
If you two like them,

481
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,680
you'd make my day.

482
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,260
I've practiced

483
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,880
the wild cursive style for several days.

484
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,710
I wonder if you two like it.

485
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,120
Of course, we like it.

486
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,680
But a few months ago,

487
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
I used

488
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,600
this line

489
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,260
during the opening lecture.

490
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,880
You exchanged this line

491
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,960
for several pages of my spell book.

492
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,120
Don't you remember?

493
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,810
Lately, my thoughts have been stagnant,

494
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,680
and my health is poor,

495
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,220
so I haven't had any inspiration.

496
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,270
But don't worry.

497
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,440
Once the Chuzhou Case is over,

498
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,880
on the return journey,

499
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,470
I'll work hard

500
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,600
to compose new pieces for you two.

501
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,750
What are you waiting for?

502
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,710
Go ahead.

503
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,960
Right, we need to spar in chess.

504
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,960
I won't see you off.

505
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,150
Go ahead.

506
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:46,350
Come on.

507
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,520
Master Li,

508
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,840
Master Zhang,

509
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,440
the spell books from you

510
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,960
are running out.

511
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,160
So...

512
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,960
My thoughts are stagnant.

513
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,550
- So...
- My health is poor.

514
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,360
I have no inspiration.

515
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,070
Just go. Don't worry.

516
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,960
When you return from Chuzhou,

517
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,470
we'll give you
the remaining spell books.

518
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,520
Don't say that.

519
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,470
You're here.

520
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,160
Greetings, Mr. Zhao.

521
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,440
Greetings, Mr. Zhao.

522
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,030
Follow me.

523
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,790
I've heard

524
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,470
you're going to Chuzhou.

525
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
To investigate a case.

526
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,360
Aren't you afraid
of offending Duke Zhenbei?

527
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,680
I am.

528
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,710
It seems you have no choice.

529
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,310
Mr. Zhao, as you know,

530
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,750
after I was ordered
to cleave the Dharma,

531
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,470
(Edict)
His Majesty granted me a title.

532
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,600
But why am I the one going to Chuzhou?

533
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,840
The title of viscount
was given for a reason.

534
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,030
You were just a Silver Gong,

535
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,360
unqualified to be the Lead Investigator.

536
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,440
But with this title,

537
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,160
you're qualified.

538
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,700
The imperial command can't be disobeyed.

539
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,230
However, this journey is perilous.

540
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,920
A slight mistake

541
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,200
can be fatal.

542
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,070
Lord Wei has told me.

543
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,250
The reason why it used to be suspended

544
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,790
is that His Majesty doesn't want
to send a real Grand Coordinator

545
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,030
to tie down Duke Zhenbei.

546
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,790
But now, appointing a Silver Gong
as the Lead Investigator

547
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,710
avoids those problems.

548
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,400
Duke Zhenbei holds troops in Chuzhou.

549
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,510
As the Lead Investigator,

550
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,840
if you truly uncover something,

551
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,640
it would be like

552
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,270
a sheep entering a tiger's den.

553
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,550
It'll be extremely dangerous.

554
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,600
But if I can't find anything,

555
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,640
it'll be like the Guardians
are slandering Duke Huai,

556
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,160
disrupting military morale,

557
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,600
and shaking the nation's foundation.

558
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,990
This will be the excuse

559
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,440
for everyone

560
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,510
to attack me.

561
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
The arrow is on the string.

562
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,710
What is

563
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,920
Lord Wei's strategy?

564
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,710
Just play along.

565
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,880
Investigate in secret.

566
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,960
Once you reach Chuzhou,

567
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,960
don't conflict
with Duke Zhenbei's subordinates.

568
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,990
Present yourself as weak.

569
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,640
This will protect you

570
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,920
and make the enemy relax.

571
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,600
Once you have the evidence,

572
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,750
quietly bring it back to the capital.

573
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,790
Lord Wei's plans for you

574
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,310
are indeed profound.

575
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,840
He's thought of everything.

576
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,920
You came here today

577
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,310
on Lord Wei's orders, didn't you?

578
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Lord Wei said

579
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,160
you have something

580
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,790
I really need.

581
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,360
What is it?

582
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,840
Lord Wei didn't say,

583
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,230
but he did say

584
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,400
you'd definitely help me.

585
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,860
(Second Sage's Hall)

586
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,510
This is

587
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,470
the image of the Second Sage.

588
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,960
When one dies
for righteousness patriotically,

589
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,030
one's name will always be remembered.

590
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,030
Cheng Hui.

591
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,270
Two hundred years ago,

592
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,200
Cheng left the Academy

593
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,070
and joined the Directorate.

594
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,200
He recruited students
from outside the Academy

595
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,030
and set up this inscription.

596
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,750
I'm ashamed to say

597
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,640
that until now,

598
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,680
no one has been able to break it.

599
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,270
(The Second Sage's Knife.)

600
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,230
When you return safely

601
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,680
from Chuzhou,

602
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,200
return this book to me personally.

603
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,750
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

604
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,060
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

605
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,200
These books

606
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,880
were all from the Dean?

607
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,910
Yes.

608
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,200
Why did he give you so many books?

609
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,230
Alright, stop being jealous.

610
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,470
Take a look at this book for me.

611
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,400
Have you heard of it?

612
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,840
What's so mysterious about it?

613
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,310
The Lost in the Wilderness.

614
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,630
I don't know.

615
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,470
I don't have the qualifications

616
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,640
or the opportunity

617
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,980
to enter Second Sage's Hall
and study the books.

618
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,280
But

619
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,120
I've read the history of the Academy,

620
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,230
so I know its origin.

621
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,460
What's so mysterious about it?

622
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,160
This book was sent by the Bureau

623
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,440
twenty years ago.

624
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
Since it was delivered,

625
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,030
it's been placed in the Hall

626
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,640
and hasn't been returned.

627
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,400
(The Bureau.)

628
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,790
(The Bureau again.)

629
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,270
What's wrong?

630
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,590
Nothing.

631
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,960
I still don't understand

632
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,600
why the Dean gave you
so many books.

633
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,400
Are you planning
to read all of them here?

634
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,550
Aren't you hungry?

635
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,520
Don't disturb me.

636
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:11,870
Cijiu.

637
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,310
Shall we go home?

638
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,640
What's this character?

639
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,540
I don't know.

640
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,880
Aren't you a scholar?

641
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,070
I don't know.

642
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,800
Let's go.

643
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,640
Let's kill a sheep and eat it.

644
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,180
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

645
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,060
(Gazing Spell)

646
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,420
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

647
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,390
Catch it.

648
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,640
Pass it to me.

649
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,230
- Give it to me.
- Hurry up.

650
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,240
Hurry up.

651
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,550
You serve.

652
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,670
Your Highness, catch it.

653
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,160
Your Highness,

654
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,840
look at the clear sky today.

655
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,800
It's a perfect time to play woven ball.

656
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,360
We've played for seven days.

657
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,640
Indeed.

658
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,160
Well,

659
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,110
let me push you on the swing.

660
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,720
I can push you very high.

661
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,110
You can't push me out of the Palace.

662
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,190
Of course,

663
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,990
I can't.

664
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,760
Your Highness,

665
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,360
just endure for two more days.

666
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,720
When your mother sees
how well-behaved you are,

667
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,590
she will naturally
lift your restrictions.

668
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,240
How annoying.

669
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,630
Where's Xu Qi'an?

670
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,770
Why hasn't he come to see me?

671
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,630
Mr. Xu

672
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,470
might be busy

673
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,590
with official matters,

674
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,800
or maybe he has

675
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,470
a case to investigate

676
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,720
and is unable to come.

677
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,720
Xuan,

678
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,150
didn't I tell you to investigate?

679
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,990
What did you find?

680
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,550
Your Highness.

681
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,670
Mr. Xu goes to the yamen every day
for roll call.

682
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,190
But a few days ago,
he went to Yunlu Academy,

683
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,840
and yesterday he went to the Bureau.

684
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,360
Why did he go to those places?

685
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,800
What about today?

686
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,760
Today...

687
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,360
Today...

688
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,600
He's just

689
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,510
listening to music at the brothel.

690
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,350
What?

691
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,320
He has time to go to the brothel

692
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,400
but no time to come see me?

693
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,760
How can this be?

694
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,870
Your Highness,

695
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,840
maybe listening to music

696
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,990
is part of Mr. Xu's investigation.

697
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,670
Let's not overthink it.

698
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,360
Let's continue to play.

699
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:54,990
Gang.

700
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,240
You've been here since you were five.

701
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,470
It's been

702
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,110
over eleven years now.

703
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,070
In these eleven years,

704
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,600
you and I have spent every day together,

705
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,360
with one heart and mind.

706
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,510
I know you very well.

707
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,840
When you're nervous, you sweat.

708
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,320
Maybe

709
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,760
it's because it's too hot.

710
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,670
When you lie, your hands shake.

711
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,590
Tell me the truth.

712
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,800
Where did Xu Qi'an go?

713
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,840
You guys hurry up.

714
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,920
Sure, Mr. Xu.

715
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,940
Hurry and check.

716
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,190
Make sure everything's packed.

717
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,030
Yes.

718
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,920
Remember what I said.

719
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,510
Once we get to Chuzhou, follow the plan.

720
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,550
With your name as the Winged Woman,

721
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,760
I'm sure it won't be hard.

722
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,470
Got it.

723
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,150
It was my decision to go,

724
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,190
but why does it sound
like you're sending me?

725
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,630
If this trip goes smoothly,

726
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,240
you will help me a lot.

727
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,360
Consider me owing you one.

728
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,720
How do I contact you in Chuzhou?

729
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,630
Xinnian gave me this.

730
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,910
Bye.

731
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,550
Mr. Xu, please hurry up.

732
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,670
I'm waiting for you.

733
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,800
Safe travels.

734
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,030
This journey

735
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,320
concerns the greater good,

736
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
so you don't owe me.

737
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,760
See you in Chuzhou.

738
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,470
By the way,

739
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,440
don't call me Winged Woman.

740
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,550
It's so stupid.

741
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
Are you going or not?

742
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,950
Let's go.

743
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,920
Drink less on the way,

744
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,840
or you'll ruin things.

745
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,550
You're really noisy.

746
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,800
Everyone, go back.

747
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,320
The boat's about to leave.

748
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,800
I have to get on.

749
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,620
Aunt,

750
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,990
I won't bring pickled vegetables.

751
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,130
My stomach's been bad lately.

752
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,460
I won't be able to eat them.

753
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,110
Uncle,

754
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,110
I have my own saber.

755
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,030
The boat is also equipped with armor.

756
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,990
Put it away. It's dangerous.

757
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,720
Sis,

758
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
what's this?

759
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,820
(Qi'an)

760
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,360
An amulet.

761
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,200
Alright.

762
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,400
I'll take it.

763
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,310
By the way,

764
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:57,360
I'll buy you Butter Jade from Chuzhou.

765
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,200
It's their specialty.

766
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,760
Little one,

767
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm leaving.

768
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,030
Will you miss me?

769
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,990
Ningyan, when will you come back?

770
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,720
I'll come back
when you memorize the Disciple Rules.

771
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,400
Ningyan won't be coming back.

772
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,600
Stop talking nonsense. Take it back.

773
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,280
Ningyan,

774
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,840
be careful.

775
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,190
Don't repeat the last time.

776
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,110
Last time your aunt

777
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,360
didn't eat or drink, cried nonstop,

778
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,960
and almost passed out.

779
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
Who passed out?

780
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,030
That didn't happen. Impossible.

781
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,800
It's a long journey.

782
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,510
You must be careful.

783
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,840
Write to tell us you're safe
when you get there. Got it?

784
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,800
Don't worry, Aunt.

785
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,320
And you.

786
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,630
I won't waste words on you.

787
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,800
Enjoy your life with Simu.

788
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,880
Hurry. I'm waiting for the wedding wine.

789
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,200
Ningyan,

790
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,360
that's inappropriate.

791
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,760
How can you just...

792
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,460
Thank you for your kind words, Ningyan.

793
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,800
I wish you

794
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,670
a smooth journey.

795
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,920
May this trip not be in vain.

796
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,310
We'll be waiting
for your return.

797
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,440
Look at her.

798
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,670
You're a grown man,

799
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,150
but you aren't as good as a girl.

800
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,070
Exactly.

801
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,280
How can you say that about me?

802
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,550
Princess Lin'an is still grounded
in the Palace.

803
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,110
Before you go,

804
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,990
did you say goodbye to her?

805
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,440
You talk too much.

806
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,390
Alright.

807
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,600
