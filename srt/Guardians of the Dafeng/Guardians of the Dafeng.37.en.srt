The mission to investigate
the case in Chuzhou

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,910
is back in the capital.

(Shiqian Gate)

44
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,040
Your Majesty.

45
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,960
Your Majesty.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,520
The mission from Chuzhou has returned.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,550
My Lords.

48
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,710
Greetings...

49
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,510
Look.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,870
Your Majesty, you've caught
such a big fish.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,360
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,430
Slow down.

53
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,150
Come on, step aside.

54
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,200
Step aside.

55
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,240
I've inquired with the Cabinet.

56
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,040
We've never received
any documents from you.

57
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,430
Don't you know the rules?

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,870
the current situation in Chuzhou
makes it impossible to send documents.

60
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,110
Why are you here?

61
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,320
As the Commissioner of Chuzhou,

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,590
how dare you enter the capital

63
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,800
without permission from the court?

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,350
Chuzhou City has gone.

65
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,390
The Commissioner of Chuzhou

66
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,440
has become a mere title.

67
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,150
Duke Zhenbei,
General Commander of Chuzhou,

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,270
collaborated with the Witcher's Sect
to advance his rank

69
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,910
and slaughtered 380,000 commoners
of Chuzhou.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,190
I petition

71
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,880
to impeach Duke Zhenbei.

72
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,200
Your Majesty, please bring justice
to the innocent people who died

73
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,320
and punish Duke Zhenbei severely.

74
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,230
I petition

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,080
to impeach Duke Zhenbei.

76
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
- Seconded.
- Seconded.

77
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
Where is

78
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,560
Duke Zhenbei now?

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,910
Duke Zhenbei

80
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,470
has been executed.

81
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,590
Let me ask again.

82
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,270
Where is Duke Zhenbei?

83
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,390
Duke Zhenbei

84
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,880
is dead.

85
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,960
Impossible.

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,590
You're lying to me.

87
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,120
This cannot be.

88
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,830
You are all deceiving me.

89
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,880
Where is he?

90
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,150
Where is he?

91
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,480
Your Majesty,

92
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,000
please take care of your health.

93
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,120
Guards, protect His Majesty!

94
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Your Majesty,

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,640
please take care of your health.

96
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,270
Your Majesty,

97
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,350
please take care of your health.

98
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,830
What's wrong?

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,790
Zhenbei!

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
Zhenbei!

101
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Your Majesty,
please take care of yourself.

102
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,560
Don't grieve too much.

103
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,230
You must know

104
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,740
that deep love leads to an early death.

105
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,030
If the people of Chuzhou knew
how sad you are for them,

106
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,390
they would find comfort

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,270
even in the afterlife.

108
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,910
Duke Zhenbei slaughtered
380,000 commoners

109
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,320
of Chuzhou.

110
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,200
He deserved to die!

111
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,320
But now that he's dead,

112
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,000
his crime has not been fully proven.

113
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,350
How we should deal with it

114
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,350
is for Your Majesty to decide.

115
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,110
I have no objections.

116
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,310
Get lost.

117
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,470
I told you to get lost.

118
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,510
When do you plan to announce this
to the world?

119
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,680
Do you truly think

120
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,080
I wouldn't dare kill you?

121
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,310
Is that so?

122
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,680
- I'll kill you now.
- Your Majesty.

123
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,110
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

124
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,630
Do you believe

125
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,470
I'll kill you too?

126
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,160
My family has already been killed.

127
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,040
Everyone, get lost!

128
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,640
Your Majesty,
please take care of yourself.

129
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,110
I will take my leave first.

130
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
Mr. Zheng.

131
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,630
Xu Qi'an,

132
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,750
don't you know the rules?

133
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,400
I didn't report back to the yamen first.

134
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,990
Lord Wei, please punish me.

135
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,230
Serve the tea.

136
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes.

137
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,230
About Chuzhou,

138
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,870
is there anything else you want to add?

139
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,670
Yes.

140
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,830
When I was in Sanhuang County,

141
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,400
there was a scout named Cai,

142
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,750
who gave me incorrect information.

143
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,990
It was an excuse to send you away.

144
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,680
Chuzhou was too dangerous.

145
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,620
If you had gone,

146
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,740
it would've been like a lamb
entering a tiger's den.

147
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,230
I once asked Li Miaozhen

148
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,680
to spread the news
of the city's massacre to the Kui,

149
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,680
but later she told me

150
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,080
before she could spread the word,

151
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,400
the Kui was already at Chuzhou's gates.

152
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,710
The timing was right,

153
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,930
and there was no time for her.

154
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,470
Lord Wei,

155
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,990
you knew all along

156
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,590
that Duke Zhenbei massacred Chuzhou.

157
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
Lord Wei, how did you know?

158
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,760
I guessed.

159
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,630
You guessed?

160
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,110
Before the mission set off,

161
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Duke Zhenbei had borrowed
the Supreme Sword from the court.

162
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
Why did he borrow it?

163
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,560
To resist the northern wars?

164
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,800
There have always been wars
in the North.

165
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,110
He was worried
that the core might emerge,

166
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,590
and the Kui army would press down.

167
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,710
If he couldn't control the situation,

168
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,630
he planned to use the Supreme Sword

169
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,400
to suppress the Kui.

170
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
Duke Zhenbei

171
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,560
was really scheming.

172
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,750
But no matter how he planned,

173
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,800
he didn't expect
that a mysterious man would come

174
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,630
and easily turn the tide,

175
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,630
causing him to lose everything.

176
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,350
When I had you go get
The Lost in the Wilderness,

177
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
it was also to give you the power
to protect yourself.

178
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,200
But Lord Wei,

179
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,800
given the situation, I had no choice.

180
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,960
You did nothing wrong.

181
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,710
But

182
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:28,470
Duke Zhenbei did not have to die
in Chuzhou.

183
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,200
Duke Zhenbei aimed
to reach the 2nd rank.

184
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,350
If that had happened,

185
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,920
who would've been able to deal with him?

186
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,800
He couldn't reach the 2nd rank.

187
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,830
You intercepted the Duchess in advance.

188
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,310
You...

189
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,350
You knew everything.

190
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,870
If Duke Zhenbei had won,

191
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,320
devoured the core,

192
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,400
and reached the 3rd Rank Perfection,

193
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,440
his next move would've been
to attack the Kui

194
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
or even the Witcher's Sect.

195
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,280
We could've made them

196
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,960
enemies of Duke Zhenbei.

197
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,590
We could've driven the tiger
to swallow the wolves

198
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,680
and also turned the wolves
against the tiger.

199
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,960
On the battlefield,

200
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,400
there would've been countless ways
to punish them.

201
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,590
Once we'd used them enough,

202
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,540
it would've been easy to eliminate them.

203
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,320
But Lord Wei,

204
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,510
if we waited until afterward

205
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,590
to pursue Duke Zhenbei's crimes,

206
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,590
does it still hold any meaning?

207
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,040
The meaning is different,

208
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,160
but the risk is much smaller.

209
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,560
The outcome

210
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,630
is still the same.

211
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,830
We'll still bring justice
to the people of Chuzhou.

212
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,510
Xu Qi'an,

213
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,920
you must remember this:

214
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,990
A wise strategist

215
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,200
must know patience.

216
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,230
You were lucky
not to get exposed this time.

217
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
If you keep

218
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,920
acting with reckless bravery,

219
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,110
though it's satisfying for a moment,

220
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,040
you will lose

221
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,680
much more.

222
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,110
I understand.

223
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,990
You brought Duke Zhenbei's remains

224
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,750
back to the capital.

225
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,990
What are your plans for the future?

226
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,400
Convict Duke Zhenbei

227
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,110
and bring justice
to the people of Chuzhou.

228
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Court affairs are not your area
of expertise.

229
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,470
You should

230
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,920
stop right here.

231
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,620
Lord Wei, what do you mean by this?

232
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,660
(Warmth)

233
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,080
The unparalleled genius Xu Qi'an,

234
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,560
with a face like jade,

235
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,870
floats like an immortal

236
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,920
and stands eight chi tall.

237
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,160
Nine chi.

238
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,170
Yes.

239
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,040
Yes.

240
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
With sharp insight,

241
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
solving cases like a god,

242
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,110
he's often able to strategize,

243
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,560
winning from miles away.

244
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,080
When the Yunzhou rebels
surged toward him,

245
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,750
Mr. Xu alone stood
against hundreds of thousands of them

246
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,470
and almost died in a foreign land.

247
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,310
Wait a minute.

248
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,560
It's millions.

249
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,520
Yes.

250
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,040
Your Highness,

251
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,350
isn't this a bit too exaggerated?

252
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,750
Before, he was fighting a thousand,

253
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,650
then ten thousand,

254
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,200
and even hundreds of thousands.

255
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,440
But now,

256
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,830
he's fighting millions?

257
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,960
I'm afraid the entire Yunzhou

258
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,350
doesn't have that many people.

259
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,610
What's the problem with that?

260
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,870
I'm just helping Xu Qi'an

261
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,130
promote his achievements
and establish his reputation.

262
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,750
The larger the number, the better.

263
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,830
But

264
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,800
it should still be realistic, right?

265
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,470
This is truly too exaggerated.

266
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,440
If not, how else can we help him?

267
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,240
Think about it.

268
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,230
This time he went to Chuzhou
for the case.

269
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,000
He'll surely be caught in a dilemma.

270
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,280
Moreover,

271
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,990
he is just a viscount.

272
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,230
With us backing him,

273
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,790
first,

274
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,990
it will reduce potential obstacles.

275
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,360
Second,

276
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,200
even if he doesn't uncover anything,

277
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,680
and if Father blames him,

278
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,680
the whole world will defend him.

279
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,720
Your Highness,

280
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,400
you really care

281
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,550
about Mr. Xu.

282
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,200
Because he's my good guest adviser.

283
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,710
Besides,

284
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,440
he sent me a gift

285
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,750
despite our distance.

286
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,880
Of course, I have to return the favor.

287
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,750
It's just a piece of Butter Jade.

288
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,120
How many gifts
have you given his family?

289
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,750
But I can feel his sincerity.

290
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,400
What do you know?

291
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,110
By the way,

292
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
remember to attach Xu Qi'an's poem
at the end

293
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,210
and have someone polish

294
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,250
and make a thousand copies

295
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,640
to distribute at all the inns
inside and outside the city.

296
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

297
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,990
Your Highness.

298
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,070
Your Highness.

299
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,070
Your Highness.

300
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,400
Why are you running in panic?

301
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,270
The mission has returned.

302
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,550
Really?

303
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,310
Why didn't you get the news in advance?

304
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
I...

305
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,510
This can't be.

306
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,160
I've made arrangements everywhere.

307
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,990
I should've received the news
the moment they returned.

308
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,710
Xuan, what's going on?

309
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,070
When did they return?

310
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,550
I don't know.

311
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,440
I only know that they met His Majesty
as soon as they returned.

312
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,400
His Majesty was furious

313
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,130
and locked himself
in the Imperial Study.

314
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,970
Just now, the Noble Consort
and the Crown Prince went to visit him.

315
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,300
What happened?

316
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,540
Touring the Five Mountains,

317
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,280
I met the host.

318
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,440
He is Mr. Wang, possessing books

319
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,940
from countless cities.

320
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,960
Among a crowd of thousands,

321
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,440
a handshake with him

322
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,120
leaves my sleeve scented

323
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,160
for three years.

324
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,440
How's this poem?

325
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,510
Prime Minister, don't hesitate
to give your advice.

326
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,360
It's not good.

327
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,710
The long wind will surely

328
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,360
break the waves,

329
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,200
hoisting the sails,

330
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,920
to cross the vast sea.

331
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
How about this line?

332
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,550
Prime Minister, please guide me.

333
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,640
The Prime Minister is here.

334
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,510
Greetings, Prime Minister.

335
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,510
No need to bow.

336
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,510
The Prime Minister didn't come.

337
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,740
(Xiaoxiang Poetry)

338
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,600
It seems like the Prime Minister

339
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,310
still holds deep prejudice against me,

340
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,230
refusing to meet until now.

341
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,310
Father originally wanted to attend

342
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,880
today's poetry gathering.

343
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
He was already outside,

344
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,680
but he met the mission from Chuzhou.

345
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,750
The mission?

346
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,030
The mission is back?

347
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,200
But why didn't Ningyan

348
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,960
send someone to notify us?

349
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,640
Something happened.

350
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
What happened?

351
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,270
- Get lost.
- Open the door.

352
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,920
We must meet with His Majesty.

353
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:43,710
We must meet with His Majesty.

354
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,550
How dare you!

355
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,760
Xinnian,

356
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,840
you may speak freely.

357
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Though this act
might offend His Majesty,

358
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,990
it is your chance
to make a name for yourself.

359
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,550
Simu,

360
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,510
I did not come

361
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,200
to make a name for myself.

362
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,790
Open the door! We must meet His Majesty.

363
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,160
How dare you!

364
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,470
His Majesty has ordered:

365
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,750
If you dare to barge into the Palace,

366
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,160
you will be executed!

367
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,120
Duke Huai should be demoted
to a commoner

368
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,130
to give the world an explanation

369
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,750
for slaughtering the commoners
as a duke!

370
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,590
Exactly.

371
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,070
Give the world an explanation!

372
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,070
Duke Zhenbei

373
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,880
deserved to die
for slaughtering the people.

374
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,200
We must seek justice
for the people of Chuzhou!

375
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,640
Get up!

376
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,880
Let us in!

377
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,960
Move aside!

378
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,200
The rat bears teeth, yet men lack shame.

379
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,920
Without shame, how can men live?

380
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,400
Unlike locusts,
kings can have no courtesy.

381
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,070
When kings forsake their courtesy,
the nation's ruin is but a day.

382
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,560
Now we hear of Duke Huai's deed:

383
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,550
He slaughtered a city
to serve his greed.

384
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,830
Alas!

385
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,160
How grievous the heavens cry!

386
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,270
Thus, I came here.

387
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,400
(Four hours later)
Scholars are called of no worth,

388
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,330
but they never wield a blade
against commoners.

389
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,840
You, clad in gold,

390
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,570
how dare you hold a spear
against the dead?

391
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960
Alas, as vast as Chuzhou is,

392
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,880
there is no one alive left.

393
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,710
If only the white bones
could return to life,

394
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,790
wouldn't they cry blood for justice?

395
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:38,990
Bravo!

396
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,840
Well said!

397
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,040
Mr. Xu, clear your throat.

398
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,270
No more cursing.

399
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,310
No more cursing.

400
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,990
This is outrageous.

401
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,030
The Dafeng has stood for 600 years,

402
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,680
and never has there been
someone like you,

403
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,980
blocking the door,
cursing for four hours straight.

404
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,510
Eunuch, please don't talk with me.

405
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,200
I cannot bear

406
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,510
this nonsense.

407
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,550
You...

408
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,200
You...

409
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,750
Guards, arrest him!

410
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,840
- Wait!
- Don't!

411
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,710
Don't!

412
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,830
What?

413
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,710
Do you also want to arrest me?

414
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,710
Greetings, Prime Minister.

415
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,750
- Yang Youde.
- Yes.

416
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,270
Does His Majesty want to see me?

417
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,710
His Majesty said

418
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,120
only you may enter.

419
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,840
The rest, leave now.

420
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,200
Don't stay before the Palace gate.

421
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,510
We'll leave this to you, Mr. Wang.

422
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,400
We'll leave this to you, Mr. Wang.

423
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,750
This way, Prime Minister.

424
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,870
Let's go back.

425
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,420
(Self-disciplined and Pure)

426
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,960
Prime Minister,

427
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,360
please wait a moment.

428
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,360
Prime Minister, thank you for waiting.

429
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,200
Eunuch.

430
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,810
- His Majesty...
- Prime Minister.

431
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,750
His Majesty is deeply saddened

432
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,730
and in poor spirits,

433
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,910
so he won't meet with you.

434
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,230
Prime Minister,

435
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,640
His Majesty needs time to calm down.

436
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,030
As you know,

437
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
Duke Huai is his younger brother.

438
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,400
They'd had a deep bond
since childhood.

439
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,400
Now that Duke Huai
has unexpectedly passed,

440
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,960
His Majesty...

441
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,800
Eunuch,

442
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,510
I understand.

443
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,200
Prime Minister,

444
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,440
please help me clear

445
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,960
the officials at the door.

446
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,400
Your Majesty,

447
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,630
I will

448
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,680
take my leave.

449
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,870
Your Majesty,

450
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,230
the Prime Minister has returned.

451
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,160
Who is gathering

452
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,920
before the Palace gate?

453
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,510
Your Majesty,

454
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,090
everyone who should've come

455
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,160
has come.

456
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,200
These scoundrels.

457
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,960
They usually bite each other,

458
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,470
but it's all just an act.

459
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,030
How hateful!

460
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,070
How detestable!

461
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,880
They deserve to die.

462
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,910
Your Majesty,

463
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,920
your health comes first.

464
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,070
Did Wei Yuan show up?

465
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,360
Your Majesty,

466
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
I didn't see him.

467
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,030
Write down the names

468
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,160
of those who haven't come.

469
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,510
For the next few days,

470
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,440
do the same.

471
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,000
Yes.

472
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,870
Mr. Zheng,

473
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,230
are you really staying at the inn?

474
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,470
Ningyan, don't worry.

475
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,400
Duke Zhenbei's massacre has

476
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,360
put Mr. Zheng
at the center of attention.

477
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,790
Even His Majesty

478
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,160
wouldn't make a rash move now.

479
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,540
It'd provoke public outrage.

480
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,910
As we know,

481
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,160
the great tide

482
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,270
cannot be resisted head-on.

483
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,160
Mr. Xu,

484
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,550
your cousin really has sharp insight.

485
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,840
He's absolutely right.

486
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,600
With such composure,

487
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,230
you'll certainly have a bright future.

488
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,640
He reminds me of the grandeur
of Lord Wei back in the day.

489
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,710
Don't worry.

490
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,550
A group of Guardians
is staying at the inn.

491
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,790
You understand.

492
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,070
Goodbye.

493
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,790
Mr. Zheng is a pitiful man.

494
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,540
He's a Presented Scholar
in Yuanjing Year 19.

495
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,160
I've heard the masters say

496
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,990
his father passed away early,

497
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,010
and his widowed mother
raised him with great hardship.

498
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,160
It wasn't easy for him
to enter the Directorate

499
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,360
and become a Presented Scholar.

500
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,710
But his mother died

501
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,470
due to years of suffering

502
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,600
and poor health

503
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,840
before he could return in glory.

504
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,460
Later, because of his compassion
for the people

505
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,070
and the desire to seek justice,

506
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,990
he volunteered to serve in Chuzhou.

507
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,840
He spent

508
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,310
20 years there.

509
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,470
Almost half his life.

510
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,990
But in one night,

511
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
it all turned to dust.

512
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,640
20 years of hardship

513
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,200
and half a lifetime of ambition

514
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,710
has become a tale for the bones.

515
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,740
Let's not talk about that.

516
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,230
How are things

517
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,710
going with Miss Wang?

518
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,330
Ningyan, behave yourself.

519
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,360
It's inappropriate.

520
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,030
Under these circumstances,

521
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,260
I don't want to talk about it.

522
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,030
Come on, let's talk.

523
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,990
I miss you.

524
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,070
How long has it been?

525
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,120
I don't miss you.

526
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,510
Did you hold hands?

527
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,500
- Did you hug?
- I won't tell you.

528
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,960
Did you upset your mother
while I was away?

529
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,920
I've never upset her.

530
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,120
You're the one who upsets her.

531
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,600
You little brat!

532
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,410
Why didn't you let me know
when you returned?

533
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,120
I was so busy.

534
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,220
There are barely any dishes.

535
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,510
It's so hot.

536
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,750
Ningyan, you're back!

537
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,310
- Hurry. I'm hungry.
- Sis.

538
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,030
Lingyue, come here.

539
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,990
There are a few dishes left.
I'll go grab them.

540
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,070
Sis, don't bother.

541
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,310
Ningyan,

542
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,640
why does it feel like you've changed

543
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,440
- since you returned?
- Let's eat.

544
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,550
What's changed?

545
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,600
The coordination of your limbs

546
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,200
and how you exert force have improved.

547
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,360
Did someone give you pointers?

548
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,030
Honey, stop talking.

549
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,160
Let Ningyan eat in peace.

550
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,030
Okay, okay.

551
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
Aunt,

552
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,270
while I was away,

553
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,640
Uncle must've treated you well.

554
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,510
This bracelet is dazzling.

555
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,880
How can you laugh, Xu Pingzhi?

556
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,470
Have you ever thought about that?

557
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,270
Let's eat.

558
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,640
It wasn't from Uncle?

559
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,120
Oh no, Uncle.

560
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,880
Look, there's a rival.

561
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,470
You brat, stop making nonsense.

562
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,990
This was a gift from my future

563
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,160
niece-in-law.

564
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,550
Niece-in-law.

565
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,960
What? Wait.

566
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,200
Niece-in-law?

567
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,750
How come I didn't know?

568
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,880
It was from Lin'an.

569
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,750
Lin'an is the best.

570
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,440
She buys me different yogurts
every day.

571
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,750
It's so delicious!

572
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,600
Oh, it's Lin'an.

573
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,470
While you were away,

574
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,550
Princess Lin'an would send gifts to us
from time to time.

575
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,230
Princess Lin'an gave Father

576
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,600
the golden saber on him yesterday.

577
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,840
He loves it.

578
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,160
Last night, he was holding it
while sleeping.

579
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,840
He didn't even hold me.

580
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,470
Speaking of Princess Lin'an,
she'd send people every day

581
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,160
to ask when you'd return.

582
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,330
Why hasn't anyone come today?

583
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,200
Yes.

584
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,640
Lin'an must be hiding.

585
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,630
Come out.

586
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,930
She's not here, right?

587
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,360
Sir, your dish is ready.

588
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,200
Enjoy.

589
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,120
Plain noodles again.

590
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,070
Can't you give me something else?

591
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,990
I pay for your food and drinks.

592
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,400
How can you still complain?

593
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,200
It's not good.

594
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,680
Let me tell you.

595
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,880
If it weren't for Xu Qi'an
repeatedly telling me

596
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,310
to safely bring you back to the capital,

597
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,200
I'd throw you into the bandit's den
and let you fend for yourself.

598
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,710
Anyway, we're entering the city.

599
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,680
After that,

600
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,270
I'll make sure to repay you.

601
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,640
Your Highness,

602
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,070
His Majesty won't meet with you.

603
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,540
If Father won't meet with me,

604
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,440
I'll kneel here until dawn.

605
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,150
Lin'an.

606
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:17,990
The ground is cold.

607
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Come back with me.

608
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,240
Be good.

609
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,310
Mother,

610
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,550
you've taught me since I was little

611
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,330
that a gentleman doesn't harm others

612
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,230
or deceive himself.

613
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,680
Although I am not talented,

614
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,070
I always remember this.

615
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,790
Uncle's massacre has caused uproar

616
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,790
in the city today.

617
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,710
The officials tried to advise,

618
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,710
yet Father avoided them.

619
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,990
As his daughter,

620
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,550
I cannot sit idly by.

621
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,400
Shut up.

622
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,150
Lin'an,

623
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,470
go back to your Shaoyin Palace

624
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:59,120
or return to your residence outside.

625
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,400
Just don't ask about this

626
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,790
or intervene in this.

627
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,630
Be good.

628
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,400
Take the princess away.

629
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,870
Mother.

630
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,920
The princess...

631
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,720
The princess is concerned
about His Majesty's health,

632
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,670
- so she knelt here to pray.
- Let's go.

633
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,220
Now, her knees hurt too much to stand.

634
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,830
Hurry.

635
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,320
Help her back to the Palace to rest.

636
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,960
Something serious happened in Chuzhou.

637
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,880
Today, the officials caused uproar.

638
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,720
Everyone's talking about it.

639
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
What happened?

640
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,590
What's so serious?

641
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,510
You're a woman.

642
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,110
Why are you asking so many questions?

643
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,670
The Dafeng actually has such a beast.

644
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,240
Let's go inside to play.

645
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,880
No wonder.

646
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,990
No wonder you returned
to the capital so suddenly.

647
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,150
Mr. Zheng definitely won't allow

648
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,400
Duke Zhenbei to be buried as a duke.

649
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,590
Nor will he let him

650
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,550
be remembered

651
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,650
as the Dafeng's Protector.

652
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,200
Ningyan,

653
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,840
something seems off.

654
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,670
His Majesty's been cultivating
for years.

655
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,880
His emotions have become more stable,

656
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,590
but today, he lost
his temper and composure

657
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,630
in front of you all.

658
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,150
Is this really our Emperor?

659
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,440
- Your Majesty.
- I'll kill you now.

660
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,760
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

661
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,720
Indeed.

662
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,150
Don't forget.

663
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,320
Que Yongxiu escaped,

664
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,190
and so did Duke Zhenbei's spies.

665
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,800
Could these people

666
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,630
have brought back
the news of Duke Zhenbei's fall?

667
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,320
While you were full of confidence,

668
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,030
His Majesty might've secretly planned

669
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,470
how to handle this.

670
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,720
Could the loss of composure

671
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,120
be just a way

672
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,720
of showing weakness?

673
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,960
If so,

674
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,360
the mission's plan
to catch him off guard

675
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,510
would have failed from the start.

676
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,070
Even if this is just my guess,

677
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,150
I still need to remind you

678
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,800
that His Majesty

679
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,750
has played political games
for so many years.

680
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,190
If he gets serious,

681
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,920
there might be no one in the court
who can rival him.

682
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,590
Cijiu, how do you think

683
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,320
we should fight this battle?

684
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,070
Since I can think of it,

685
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,990
those big figures

686
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,670
should've noticed it as well.

687
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,080
Tomorrow,

688
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,800
I'll continue to shout
at the Palace gate

689
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,070
to test His Majesty's intentions.

690
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,440
If our guess is right,

691
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,840
within three days,

692
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,920
he'll definitely move.

693
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,760
But for now, I'm in a lowly position,

694
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,240
unable to attend court.

695
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,990
Though I can help from the outside,

696
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,510
the real battlefield

697
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,320
should still be left to Lord Wei,

698
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Mr. Zheng,

699
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,160
and those officials
who care for their name,

700
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,200
and perhaps,

701
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,760
still harbor some sense of justice.

702
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,360
I heard Duke Zhenbei
died in the North.

703
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,320
This is a godsend opportunity,

704
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,190
yet you lock me away underground.

705
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,360
It should have been me
avenging the people,

706
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,240
pursuing the culprit,

707
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,840
and killing the Mighty Bone.

708
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,030
The thought of this

709
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,160
has made my hair

710
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:27,140
stand on end.

711
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,320
Why?

712
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,840
Why was it that mysterious man?

713
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,150
Why?

714
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,030
The Supervisor held me back!

715
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,670
However,

716
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,590
it wasn't Xu Ningyan

717
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,360
who did those heroic acts after all.

718
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,030
I feel much better.

719
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,070
That kid

720
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,110
took my chance away.

721
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:52,960
How hateful.

722
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,760
He must've watched

723
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,920
that mysterious man
strategize in Chuzhou.

724
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,670
He must've been very envious.

725
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,510
Master, are you ashamed?

726
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,230
Aren't you supposed to use magic?

727
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,590
Activate the portal.

728
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,990
Deactivate.

729
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,470
Activate again.

730
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,640
It's too late.

731
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,670
Master, I feel incredibly lucky

732
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,240
to see you get upset.

733
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,470
My disciple is rude.

734
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,960
Sorry, Your Highness.

735
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,800
The mission's arrival in the capital

736
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,920
has enraged Father.

737
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,280
The current situation

738
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,090
will definitely lead
to bloodshed and chaos.

739
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,920
I don't know

740
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,190
how it will all end.

741
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,800
Everything is decided by fate.

742
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,360
Your Highness, do not worry.

743
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
However,

744
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,590
things are getting interesting.

745
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,070
The Duke Zhenbei is dead.

746
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,720
The world is about
to descend into chaos.

747
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,990
Some people

748
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,880
must be laughing even in their dreams.

749
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,190
Congrats, My Lord.

750
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,360
Your great achievement is near.

751
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,280
The time has not come yet.

752
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,550
At the end of Yin hour,

753
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,440
the sun will rise.

754
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,510
Reports say

755
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,340
there are assassins in the Palace.

756
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,360
Imperial Guards are ordered
to enter the Palace,

757
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,630
seal off the inner Palace,

758
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,990
and protect the Empress.

759
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,990
Yes.

760
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,720
(Dew)
His Majesty has ordered

761
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,320
to send these
to the officials' mansions

762
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,150
and carefully record

763
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,150
their reactions and words.

764
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,160
Yes.

765
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,390
As the saying goes,

766
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,400
positions bring responsibilities.

767
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,440
Mr. Xu is just a student
from Yunlu Academy.

768
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,390
How could he understand
His Majesty's thoughts?

769
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,400
This is absurd.

770
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,620
(South Gate)

771
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,300
(Calligraphy Studio)

772
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,220
(Charity Hall)

773
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,380
(Dafeng Capital Map)

774
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,960
What do the officials think

775
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,920
of Duke Zhenbei's massacre?

776
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,470
Your Majesty,

777
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,320
except for the few at the Palace gates

778
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,240
and a few senior officials,

779
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,360
the others

780
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,960
have made their stances clear.

781
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,550
What about Zheng Xinghuai?

782
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,240
I've heard that he speaks openly
on the streets every day

783
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,110
and connects with many officials.

784
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,960
However,

785
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,360
only a few

786
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,720
agreed to meet him.

787
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,840
On the court,

788
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,990
only Wei Yuan and Wang Zhenwen
seem to care.

789
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,840
The others seem indifferent.

790
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,510
Summon the Cabinet

791
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,840
to the court immediately

792
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,760
for Duke Huai's Bloodshed Case.

793
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,800
