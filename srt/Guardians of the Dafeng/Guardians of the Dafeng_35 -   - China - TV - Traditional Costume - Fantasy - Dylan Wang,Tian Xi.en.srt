Let me ask you.

When was this place unsealed?

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,440
My Lord,

45
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,160
Xikou Province was never sealed.

46
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,670
Why did you ask about unsealing?

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,220
(Chuzhou)

48
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,240
Good.

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,920
The Chuzhou Records

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,470
of the Dafeng Geography Records state:

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,270
The city walls of Chuzhou

52
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,870
are inscribed with formations,

53
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,110
making them sturdy enough

54
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,710
to withstand attacks
from 3rd Rank masters.

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,320
Well.

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,110
Seeing is believing.

57
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,970
With Duke Zhenbei overseeing the region,

58
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,150
Chuzhou

59
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,740
is as secure as an iron fortress.

60
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,990
(Chuzhou City)
It seems

61
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,040
the Chuzhou people have been spared
much of the suffering from wars.

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,820
(Zheng Xinghuai,
Commissioner of Chuzhou)

63
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,920
Mr. Zheng,

64
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,800
it's been three years

65
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,590
since we parted in the capital.

66
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,600
General Li,

67
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,550
the Kui intruded the northern Jiangzhou.

68
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Please rest for a while

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,650
and march with the army tomorrow.

70
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,390
No need. I will depart at once.

71
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,950
Go.

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
Frequent warfare in Chuzhou

73
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,760
has become normal.

74
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,870
My Lords,

75
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,110
how can I assist you?

76
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,480
I need the Chuzhou border army's
dispatch records

77
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,000
and correspondence
among the local yamens.

78
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,030
Who is this?

79
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,910
This is a Gold Gong of the Guardians,

80
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,910
Mr. Nangong.

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
His Majesty and the ministers

82
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
heard of the bloodshed in Chuzhou.

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,790
They sent us to investigate this.

84
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,150
Mr. Zheng, please cooperate.

85
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,000
It's said that the Lead Investigator
is missing.

86
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,350
We were ambushed on the way.

87
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,120
Without the Lead Investigator,

88
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,760
the authority to act...

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,560
Of course.

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,120
The correspondence between local yamens

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,760
is available for your review.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,830
However, the dispatch records

93
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,910
are only accessible
to the Lead Investigator.

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,400
However,

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,350
I can report this to Duke Zhenbei,

96
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,910
though I cannot guarantee

97
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,080
he will allow it.

98
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,910
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

99
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,760
In that case,

100
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,320
I'll take my leave.

101
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,120
How is Mr. Zheng

102
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,270
as the Commissioner?

103
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,000
Rest assured, Mr. Nangong.

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,350
He has served as Commissioner
here for years.

105
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,560
He's a clean official

106
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,830
with an excellent reputation.

107
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,620
With such a person in charge,

108
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,200
if something had truly happened here,

109
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,330
how could it go unreported?

110
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,740
Is it

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
the bloodshed real?

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,230
The bloodshed is real.

113
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,320
Just now, Zheng Xinghuai

114
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,200
wanted to kill us.

115
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,580
(Has she run again?)

116
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,180
(Tracing Spell)

117
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,710
Here, have some buns first.

118
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,270
I can't move around freely right now.

119
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,640
Once my friend returns,

120
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,000
he can help me retrieve my pouch,

121
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,150
and I'll give you some money.

122
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,800
Come on.

123
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,320
Have some snacks.

124
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,680
Take one.

125
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,160
Eat.

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
Xu Qi'an.

127
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,230
You're back.

128
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,520
Where's my pouch?

129
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,470
How are you so sure
your pouch is with me?

130
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,440
It's definitely with you.

131
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,280
Give it to me.

132
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,590
Don't flaunt your wealth.
Don't give away too much.

133
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,470
I know.

134
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,670
Here.

135
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,800
Take it.

136
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,030
One gold sunflower seed is worth
two liang of silver.

137
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,910
One liang of silver equals

138
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,590
200 wen?

139
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,150
20,000 wen.

140
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,350
20,000 wen?

141
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,150
I just gave him
a handful of gold sunflower seeds.

142
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,590
Is it enough?

143
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,440
For his family of three generations,

144
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,230
and all his relatives and friends,

145
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,910
it's enough to eat
dragon meat every day.

146
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,830
They have no relatives
or friends anymore.

147
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,230
They fled all the way here
from the North.

148
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,440
The Kui slaughtered their village,

149
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,880
killing all their friends and family.

150
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,150
That old beggar, with the young one,

151
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,780
that is, his grandson,

152
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,320
fled here together.

153
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,640
Xu Qi'an,

154
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,440
when will you take me to Chuzhou?

155
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,470
You've seen the journey.

156
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,830
It's peaceful,

157
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,110
with no sign of bloodshed.

158
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
The Kui.

159
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,110
Do you want to see
something fun?

160
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,160
No, no.

161
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,470
Then I'm leaving. Take care of yourself.

162
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,400
Don't leave me here alone!

163
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,350
Xu Qi'an!

164
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,400
What a jerk. How dare you abandon me?

165
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,990
Be quiet. Look over there.

166
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,560
That's Duke Huai's spy.

167
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,750
Obviously,

168
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,680
this was a targeted ambush.

169
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,830
The Kui attacked Duke Zhenbei's spy.

170
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,240
So,

171
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,920
why aren't we leaving?

172
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,510
Why should we leave?

173
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,830
It's you.

174
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,440
Return to Xikou immediately for help.

175
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
At your speed,

176
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,500
you'll be back
in half an incense stick of time.

177
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,160
You go deal with those two.

178
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,350
Let's go.

179
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,280
Stay here.

180
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,680
(Gazing Spell)
Thank you for your help.

181
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,960
The situation was urgent,

182
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,800
and I had no choice.

183
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,990
I hope you can forgive me.

184
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,470
No choice?

185
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,510
I am Xu Qi'an,

186
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,320
appointed to investigate

187

the Bloodshed Case in Chuzhou.

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,710
Xu Qi'an?

189
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,350
Weren't you injured

190
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,160
and sent back to the capital?

191
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,160
(Who could have injured him?)

192
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,680
(He's indeed going north alone
to investigate.)

193
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,960
(But why is there a woman with him?)

194
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,830
(Could it be the Duchess?)

195
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,000
She

196
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,320
is your Duchess.

197
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,700
Thank you for retrieving the Duchess.

198
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,590
Duke Huai will surely
reward you generously.

199
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,520
How about this?

200
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,080
I'll ask you a few questions.

201
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,280
Answer truthfully,

202
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,800
and I'll the Duchess hand over.

203
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,990
Please go ahead, Mr. Xu.

204
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,710
What is the truth

205
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,110
behind the Bloodshed Case?

206
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,960
The bloodshed?

207
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,800
I know nothing about it.

208
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,190
Why don't you

209
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,660
come back with me to the military camp?

210
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,090
We'll settle the Duchess there.

211
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,950
After that,

212
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,590
whatever help you need,

213
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,510
just tell me.

214
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,630
I will fully cooperate.

215
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,870
Once I'm in the camp,

216
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,200
I'll be like fish
on your chopping block,

217
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,110
won't I?

218
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,200
Why say that, Mr. Xu?

219
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,230
You are the imperial appointee.

220
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,200
I can only treat you
with my utmost respect.

221
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,200
But you keep lying to me.

222
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,830
My Gazing Spell has seen through you.

223
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,350
Gazing Spell?

224
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,140
Mr. Xu, I advise you
not to act impulsively.

225
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,040
You're investigating the bloodshed,

226
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,800
yet you're afraid
of offending Duke Huai.

227
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,560
I understand that.

228
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,990
But there are things

229
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,230
you should know.

230
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
Let me hear it.

231
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,880
First,

232
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,110
the Duchess wasn't kidnapped by the Kui.

233
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,280
This can't be hidden.

234
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,160
A simple investigation afterward

235
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,200
will show that your separation
from the mission

236
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,190
coincides with the Duchess's kidnapping.

237
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,110
Duke Huai doesn't need evidence

238
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,230
to act against someone.

239
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,400
He only needs to see them as an enemy.

240
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,950
Second,

241
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,590
rescuing the Duchess is of great merit.

242
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,040
Having commanded troops for years,

243
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,750
Duke Huai values fairness
in rewards and punishments.

244
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,960
Handing over the Duchess voluntarily

245
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,710
will ensure your bright future.

246
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,440
Wei Yuan can only promote
your official rank,

247
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,200
but Duke Huai is a duke.

248
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,110
He can grant you a nobler title.

249
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,710
Go on.

250
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
Third,

251
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,280
this is just an investigation.

252
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,320
Failing this case

253
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,470
won't diminish your reputation
as a case-solver.

254
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,040
Why risk everything

255
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,440
for a case unrelated to you

256
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,630
or a woman unrelated to you?

257
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,560
Your future is what matters most,

258
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,760
isn't it?

259
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,400
According to you,

260
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,960
if I stop investigating

261
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,200
and hand over the Duchess,

262
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,680
Duke Huai will pardon everything

263
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,230
and guarantee my future?

264
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,920
Of course.

265
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,350
But Duke Huai has never met her,

266
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,280
yet she's so important to him?

267
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,350
It doesn't make any sense.

268
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,900
I might as well tell you the truth.

269
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,830
Duke Huai doesn't value her.

270
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,200
He values the spiritual essence
within her.

271
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,920
Spiritual essence?

272
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,880
Exactly.

273
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,580
Duke Huai needs her spiritual essence

274
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,320
to advance to 2nd Rank.

275
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,870
So the Kui was also after the Duchess

276
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,440
because of this spiritual essence?

277
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Correct.

278
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,230
If the spiritual essence is taken,

279
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,080
what will happen to me?

280
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,680
You're merely a vessel.

281
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
Once it's extracted,

282
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,440
you will lose all value.

283
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,040
Hello?

284
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Xu Qi'an.

285
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,440
I've discovered something.

286
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,810
Aside from the spiritual essence,

287
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,920
there's another way
to quickly increase power.

288
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,200
It's refining Qi energy.

289
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:40,080
Qi energy?

290
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,870
The Witcher's Sect has a secret method

291
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,230
to extract a person's soul and breath

292
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,680
and refine them into a pill.

293
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,200
Consuming it can break
through to a higher rank.

294
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,280
The Witcher's Sect?

295
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,070
Did you just say the Witcher's Sect?

296
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,950
Yes.

297
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,630
Except for them,

298
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,400
who else could be so malicious?

299
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,680
But it's too early to draw conclusions.

300
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,920
To refine enough Qi energy

301
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,870
and to help a 3rd Rank Fighter
advance,

302
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,280
the lives slaughtered

303
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,830
would be immeasurable.

304
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,040
Can the spiritual essence in me

305
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,400
help you advance?

306
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
Then why haven't you taken it yet?

307
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,990
How long was I

308
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,320
by the river just now?

309
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,960
A few hours, perhaps.

310
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,710
So,

311
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,110
why didn't you run this time?

312
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,590
You left Qi force on me.

313
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,160
I couldn't escape.

314
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,510
I've taken it back

315
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,560
after questioning the spy.

316
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,350
Taking you north

317
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,200
was originally to use you

318
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,750
to hold Duke Zhenbei at bay

319
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,870
to buy time for investigation.

320
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,960
Now that the case is clear,

321
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
you're free to go.

322
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,070
Actually,

323
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,440
I don't know where to go.

324
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,880
This orange is so sour.

325
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,200
I only had one like it
when I was a child.

326
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,600
I was born in the streets.

327
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,640
As a child, I was strikingly pretty.

328
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,840
When I was nine,

329
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,230
I went with my parents
to Jade Buddha Temple.

330
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,990
The abbot saw me

331
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,600
and wrote a poem about me.

332
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,440
That's how I became famous.

333
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,510
I've heard about that.

334
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,120
But my parents and elders
protected me very well.

335
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,230
It wasn't until I grew up

336
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,510
that I realized
they didn't truly love me.

337
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,330
They were just afraid
that their precious commodity

338
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,710
might get flawed.

339
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,200
Finally,

340
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,270
when I was thirteen,

341
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,200
the Emperor sent people to our house

342
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,360
to bring me to the Palace.

343
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,120
After entering the Palace,

344
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,310
I only met the Emperor once.

345
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Afterward, I was neglected.

346
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,360
Later, for an unknown reason,

347
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,400
I was gifted to Duke Huai

348
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,550
and became his Duchess.

349
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,120
I've always been a commodity,

350
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,790
passed around by others.

351
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,960
If one day I lose my value,

352
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,960
I will be discarded

353
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,840
without hesitation.

354
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,310
So, I don't blame you at all

355
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,640
for using me as a bargaining chip

356
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,640
to restrain Duke Zhenbei.

357
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,440
What do you plan to do
with Duke Zhenbei?

358
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,960
If he's truly behind this,

359
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
the nature of his crime

360
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,680
is far worse
than falsifying military reports.

361
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,600
I'll find the site of the bloodshed,

362
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,710
stop him,

363
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,550
and punish him.

364
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,030
If possible,

365
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,600
I'll kill him.

366
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,590
Hello?

367
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,450
Xu Qi'an.

368
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,230
I've made a major discovery.

369
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,160
You won't believe it.

370
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,030
Do you know who the real culprit
behind the bloodshed is?

371
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,790
It's Duke Zhenbei.

372
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,030
How do you know?

373
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,680
How are you always a step ahead?

374
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,310
How exactly do you investigate cases?

375
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,960
Master.

376
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,200
That's not the point.

377
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Xu Qi'an,

378
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,360
there's a warrior here.

379
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,550
He says his lord knows

380
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,360
the true location of the bloodshed.

381
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,560
Tell me.

382
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,880
Tell you about what?

383
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,120
That man is highly vigilant.

384
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,790
I couldn't even use
my Empathy Spell on him.

385
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,550
In fact,

386
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,030
the moment I approached him,
he threatened suicide,

387
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,470
refusing to take me to his lord.

388
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,070
Did he state any conditions?

389
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,460
Yes. It's you.

390
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,210
- Me?
- Yes.

391
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,550
He said he must meet
the case's Lead Investigator.

392
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,840
Until then, he won't say a word.

393
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:55,960
Alright, I understand.

394
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,740
What's wrong?

395
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,480
I have to go.

396
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,680
Where are you going?

397
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,660
To meet your husband.

398
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,630
By the way,

399
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,640
go to Zuihong House in Xikou Province.

400
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,920
Find a girl named Xing.

401
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,840
She'll protect you.

402
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,510
Can you defeat Duke Zhenbei?

403
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,450
If not,

404
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,220
I'll wish you two a happy marriage.

405
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,230
I'm off.

406
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Even if you can't defeat him,

407
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,360
make sure to survive.

408
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,470
Ningyan.

409
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
My Lord.

410
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,440
He seems to be nearing the truth.

411
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,510
Should I intervene?

412
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,750
No need.

413
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,880
Let him proceed.

414
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,360
Ningyan.

415
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,820
(Three days later, Shankou Province)

416
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,420
(Beishan Inn)

417
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,440
Xu Qi'an.

418
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,640
What happened to you?

419
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,320
I ran too fast and twisted on my neck.

420
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,310
Where is he?

421
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,990
To avoid suspicion,

422
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,200
I told him to come after dark.

423
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,040
Smart.

424
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,120
Let's save time

425
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,230
and figure it out now.

426
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,070
Alright.

427
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,310
So, the current problem is...

428
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,400
Go on.

429
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,310
The current problem is...

430
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,200
What are you doing?

431
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,740
I'm too tired.

432
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,990
I haven't slept for three days.

433
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,070
I'll lie down for this.

434
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,960
Fine.

435
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,640
The problem now is

436
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,470
whether we should meet that lord.

437
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,310
Of course.

438
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,340
If we go,

439
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,440
aren't you afraid it's a trap?

440
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,790
It's unlikely.

441
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,910
How so?

442
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,270
Xu Qi'an!

443
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,710
I can't hold on anymore.

444
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,640
How about we wait until he arrives?

445
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,280
By the way,

446
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,600
send someone to Chuzhou

447
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,920
to bring Nangong Qianrou here.

448
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,200
Good night.

449
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,150
You...

450
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,360
Get up!

451
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,400
(Beishan Inn)
He's here.

452
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,970
Why did I get a stiff neck?

453
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,830
Bro,

454
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,230
are you Zhao Jin?

455
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,680
Yes, I am.

456
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,750
Who is your lord?

457
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,360
Who are you?

458
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,550
You're Xu Qi'an?

459
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,070
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

460
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,230
You know the mission's arrival
in Chuzhou, right?

461
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,680
Mr. Xu secretly left the mission

462
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,070
and infiltrated Chuzhou
to investigate the case.

463
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,550
I see.

464
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,110
Mr. Xu,

465
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,920
I admire you the most.

466
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,360
You defeated Tianyu

467
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,840
and restored the court's dignity,

468
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,800
which is widely praised
in the martial world.

469
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,170
But what I respect most

470
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,200
about you is your feat in Yunzhou,

471
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,160
holding off 100,000 rebels by yourself.

472
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,370
Every time I think of it,

473
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,990
it stirs up my blood.

474
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,470
A man should be like this.

475
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,680
(Why did it turn into 100,000?)

476
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,030
(Who is spreading these rumors?)

477
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,270
Bro,

478
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,440
get up.

479
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,840
Let's cut the small talk.

480
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,510
A true hero doesn't boast of past glory.

481
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,550
Who is your lord?

482
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,710
My lord

483
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,160
is the Commissioner of Chuzhou,

484
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,550
Zheng Xinghuai.

485
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,500
(Clean and Diligent)

486
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,000
My Lord,

487
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,510
the Winged Woman acted.

488
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,780
Impossible.

489
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,510
Zheng Xinghuai is in Chuzhou City.

490
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,160
How could he be your lord?

491
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
Impossible.

492
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,360
After we rescued him,

493
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,580
we tried to leave Chuzhou,

494
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,670
but Duke Zhenbei's spies
were secretly hunting us.

495
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,840
We had no choice but to hide
in the wild mountains.

496
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,830
Since then,

497
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,750
we've never returned to Chuzhou City.

498
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,120
Could it be that there are

499
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,120
two Zheng Xinghuai in Chuzhou?

500
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,120
The Witcher's Sect's Hypnotizer

501
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,470
is skilled in illusion spells.

502
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,120
The Witcher's Sect is involved as well?

503
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,440
Zhao Jin,

504
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,880
please take us to meet
the real Mr. Zheng.

505
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,120
Yes, Mr. Xu.

506
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,280
Let's go.

507
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,350
Wait a moment.

508
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,310
Su Su, come in.

509
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,440
Leave it to me.

510
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,550
You go first.

511
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,630
Mr. Zhao, follow me.

512
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,550
Yes.

513
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,030
Rou,

514
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,680
during my absence,

515
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,310
your martial arts have regressed.

516
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,680
So have yours.

517
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,030
Didn't you poke it wrong earlier?

518
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,160
Then let's try again.

519
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,840
Let's give it a try.

520
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,550
It's right here.

521
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,240
Mr. Zhao,

522
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,150
you're finally back.

523
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,070
Yes.

524
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,510
That is the Winged Woman, Li Miaozhen.

525
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,870
And this is

526
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,270
the famous Silver Gong Xu Qi'an.

527
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,000
Mr. Xu.

528
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,750
Give this to Zheng Xinghuai,

529
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,510
and he will know my identity.

530
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,680
Please wait a moment.

531
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,470
You are Silver Gong Xu?

532
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,350
Yes.

533
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,600
I am

534
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,360
Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner of Chuzhou.

535
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,640
This is not a place to talk.

536
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,750
Please come inside.

537
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,920
They are all my guest advisers.

538
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,310
When we escaped,

539
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,440
there were over 20 people,

540
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,120
but now only these few are left.

541
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,310
If not for some heroes who saved us,

542
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,550
I'd be dead by now.

543
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,510
After escaping Chuzhou,

544
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,960
we asked several heroes
to send messages

545
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,990
to reveal Duke Zhenbei's atrocities

546
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,470
to my old friends in the capital.

547
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,960
I once met a man.

548
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,070
Before he died,

549
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,470
he told me about the bloodshed.

550
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,550
He...

551
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,200
He had a birthmark on his face.

552
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,070
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

553
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,120
His name was Qian Youyi.

554
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,160
Why not directly expose Duke Zhenbei

555
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,230
in the Chuzhou officialdom?

556
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,270
It wouldn't have worked.

557
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,310
That would only harm them.

558
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,070
Once the news spread,

559
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,360
they'd be killed
by Duke Zhenbei's spies.

560
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,400
And as you've seen,

561
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,230
Chuzhou City is still fine.

562
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,880
Who would believe it?

563
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,160
But you should know

564
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,400
that the court sent a mission
to investigate it.

565
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,520
Mr. Xu,

566
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,510
we've heard this from Mr. Zhao.

567
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,600
He regularly sends letters back.

568
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,510
But we dare not seek out the mission.

569
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,470
With just a few of us,

570
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,360
we fear being silenced.

571
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,270
Please, Mr. Xu,

572
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,160
stand up for the Chuzhou people.

573
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,630
Mr. Zheng.

574
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,190
Mr. Zheng, please don't do this.

575
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,160
Since I'm here,

576
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,990
I'll surely give you

577
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,120
and those who died an explanation.

578
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,360
But before that,

579
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,510
I need to know the details
of the Bloodshed Case.

580
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,230
Miaozhen, the Empathy Spell.

581
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,540
Understood.

582
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,200
Mr. Zheng,

583
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
close your eyes

584
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,360
and recall the details
of the bloodshed that day.

585
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,160
(They are Zheng Xinghuai's family.)

586
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,470
(I am now viewing Zheng Xinghuai's
memories from his perspective.)

587
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,680
Father,

588
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,120
I'm hungry too.

589
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,400
Honey, calm down.

590
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,710
(Mrs. Zheng)
He knows he's wrong.

591
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,230
(Zheng Xinghuai's wife)
Let him eat.

592
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,480
Son,

593
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,200
you're over 20 now.
You're a husband and a father.

594
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,230
Grandpa.

595
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,470
Why are you still idling away?

596
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,750
Why can't you learn from your brother?

597
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,820
(Zheng's second son)

598
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,110
Father,

599
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,310
I just went to drink.

600
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,990
That man started the trouble,

601
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,070
not me.

602
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,070
Why is it my fault?

603
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,030
Why are you fanning the flames?

604
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,510
(Zheng's daughter-in-law)
Father.

605
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,920
He knows he was wrong.

606
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,230
Next month,

607
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,680
my father's 60th birthday will come.

608
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,510
I want to go home and see him.

609
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,000
Are you crazy?

610
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,030
The Kui is causing trouble outside.

611
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,030
Chuzhou City is so close to the border.

612
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,160
If you leave the city,

613
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,260
what if you encounter
the Kui Cavalry on the way?

614
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,880
You cowardly fool.

615
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,600
How did I end up
with such a useless son like you?

616
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,120
- Father, I was wrong.
- My Lord.

617
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,850
My Lord,

618
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,310
the Garrison troop entered the city.

619
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,470
They're gathering the people.

620
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,400
Gathering the people?

621
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,630
Where?

622
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,580
Who is leading them?

623
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,160
The people are being gathered
in all four directions.

624
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,840
The leader is Que Yongxiu,

625
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,360
State Duke of Protection and Commander.

626
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,600
He should be at the South City now.

627
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,590
(Gathering the people? Could it be...)

628
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,470
Prepare the horses.

629
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,840
I must go check.

630
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,630
You two, come with me.

631
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,790
Father, the chicken leg
is really delicious.

632
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,590
Hurry inside.

633
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,430
Move faster.

634
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,170
Hurry, hurry.

635
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,200
Go.

636
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,760
Move over there.

637
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,460
(Que Yongxiu, State Duke of Protection,
Duke Zhenbei's subordinates)

638
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,110
What is this?

639
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,390
Move.

640
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,430
Mr. Zheng.

641
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,030
Get out of the way.

642
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:09,250
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

643
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,170
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

644
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,290
Save us.

645
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,470
- Mr. Zheng.
- Mr. Zheng.

646
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,600
Mr. Que,

647
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,240
what do you want to do?

648
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,550
Mr. Zheng,

649
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,440
you came at the right time.

650
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,670
Let me ask you.

651
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,110
The Kui has repeatedly invaded

652
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,320
the borders,

653
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,650
burning, killing, and pillaging.

654
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,400
Do you know

655
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,070
the reason?

656
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,720
What does this have to do
with your gathering of the people?

657
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,280
Of course, it does.

658
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,550
As a subject of the Dafeng,

659
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,590
for the peace of the Dafeng's borders,

660
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,800
I will serve until death.

661
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,360
Mr. Zheng,

662
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,510
do you think what I'm saying

663
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,800
makes sense?

664
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,150
Ridiculous.

665
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,960
Everyone, follow me. Let's go home.

666
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,360
Alright.

667
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,030
Someone got killed!

668
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,360
Que Yongxiu,

669
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,550
how dare you slaughter the people?

670
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,720
Are you rebelling?

671
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,880
Calm down, Mr. Zheng.

672
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,440
Your turn

673
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,280
is coming soon.

674
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,070
Shoot!

675
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,200
Li Han,

676
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,400
take Mr. Zheng out first.

677
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,990
Kill them all.

678
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,150
Leave no one alive.

679
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,990
Yes.

680
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
My Lord.

681
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,600
My Lord.

682
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,920
My Lord, you're up.

683
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,280
My Lord, you've woken up.

684
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,190
Don't worry. We can break out.

685
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,560
Father.

686
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,150
Did the Kui break in, Father?

687
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,760
The soldiers have rebelled,

688
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,030
massacring the people.

689
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,070
We need to leave the city quickly.

690
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,350
Alright.

691
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,440
They're catching up.

692
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,510
You go!

693
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,870
Li Han!

694
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,190
Li Han!

695
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,990
- Mother!
- Mother!

696
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,920
- Mother!
- Mother!

697
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,070
Dear!

698
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,560
Dear!

699
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,840
Mr. Zheng,

700
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,170
where are you going?

701
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,720
Que Yongxiu,

702
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,280
what exactly are you doing?

703
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,670
Are you planning to rebel?

704
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,670
A few ants like you
don't need me to rebel.

705
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:33,320
Que Yongxiu.

706
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,720
Mr. Zheng,

707
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,840
don't you boast about being upright
and intolerant of corruption?

708
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,150
You humiliated Duke Zhenbei
for the Military Land Case

709
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,740
and used the excuse
of military land occupation

710
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,880
to kill three of my subordinates.

711
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,670
Did you know

712
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,150
you'd end up here today?

713
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,030
This is all a matter of reciprocity.

714
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,590
Catch this.

715
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,960
Son!

716
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,510
Son!

717
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,120
Father,

718
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm scared.

719
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,280
You won't die.

720
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,720
Que Yongxiu!

721
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,660
Son!

722
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,090
My Lord.

723
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,190
He's broken down.

724
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,840
The empathy has ended early.

725
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,150
Son.

726
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,470
Sorry.

727
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Excuse me.

728
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,960
My son.

729
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,960
Is Chuzhou City

730
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,400
where the bloodshed happened?

731
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,160
Yes.

732
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,280
Sorry.

733
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,640
I lost composure.

734
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,400
We need to go to Chuzhou City.

735
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,920
But before that,

736
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,150
we need to organize our thoughts

737
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,630
and review the Bloodshed Case again.

738
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,160
Duke Zhenbei's massacre of the city

739
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,720
was to refine a core,

740
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
to reach the 2nd Rank.

741
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,800
But refining Qi energy takes time,

742
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:38,510
so he chose to slaughter Chuzhou City

743
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,070
and hide it from everyone

744
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,400
with a habitual mindset.

745
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,190
But I met several soldiers
from Chuzhou City before,

746
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,240
and I asked them.

747
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:49,720
None of them knew
about Duke Zhenbei's massacre.

748
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:52,320
Their memories might've been altered,

749
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,730
or they might not even know

750
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,070
