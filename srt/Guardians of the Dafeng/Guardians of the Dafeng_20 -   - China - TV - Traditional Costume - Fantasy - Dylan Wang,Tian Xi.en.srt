Thank you, Your Majesty.

Your Majesty,

47
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,520
be appeased.

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,960
Don't be mad at an animal.

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,480
When I asked why it lost control just now,

50
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,080
it ignored me!

51
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,640
The Loong

52
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,270
wouldn't go wild for no reason.

53
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,640
Why did it

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,990
quiet down all of a sudden?

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,150
Maybe it vented out its anger,

56
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,520
or it didn't

57
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,760
want Princess Lin'an to get hurt.

58
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,590
About

59
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,480
that Copper Gong Xu,

60
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,320
I'm curious.

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,990
Do you really favor him?

62
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,240
He's capable enough

63
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,110
to serve the court.

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,670
Pass my order.

65
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,270
Step up security in the Imperial City.

66
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,360
No one

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,670
gets in or out

68
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,760
before the curfew's lifted.

69
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,510
Yes.

70
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,150
Did you just say Duke Zhenbei

71
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,320
hadn't returned to the capital for years?

72
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,990
Yes.

73
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,640
Call him back

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,270
next spring.

75
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,500
(Haoqi Tower)

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,110
I still can't reach Heng Yuan.

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,870
Neither can Mr. Jinlian or No. 4.

78
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,680
He killed Earl Pingyuan
to find his junior

79
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,150
and disappeared after the Sangbo Explosion.

80
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
I believe

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,030
he was involved in that case, too.

82
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,270
I have a guess.

83
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,640
When his junior, Heng Hui,

84
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,910
eloped with Commandery Princess Pingyang,

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,390
it's highly likely that he used
an energy-concealing weapon

86
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,270
that came from the Azure Hall.

87
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
I'd like to go there to confirm it.

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,000
That hall is the Tianyu Sect's base
in the Dafeng.

89
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,390
It's too far away.

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
Rou.

91
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,190
Lord Wei.

92
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,790
Go to the Azure Hall

93
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,000
to check

94
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,230
if they have any energy-concealing weapons,

95
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,310
and

96
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,710
if Heng Hui and Heng Yuan went there.

97
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,070
Yes.

98
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,080
Thank you, Mr. Nangong.

99
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,600
Lord Wei,

100
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,230
I'll meet with Jinlian later

101
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,830
to locate Heng Yuan as soon as possible.

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Who knows

103
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,590
Princesses Huaiqing and Lin'an

104
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,080
both favor you?

105
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,520
Princess Lin'an

106
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,440
even put on a show to recruit him.

107
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
Never would I

108
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,640
see that coming.

109
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,200
Knock it off, Uncle.

110
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,080
Do you think that's good?

111
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,440
I had an adventurous day,

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
full of twists and turns.

113
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,150
Hadn't I played by ear,

114
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,000
now, I might be in the Municipal Jail again.

115
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,320
Ningyan,

116
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,640
you're a catch.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,320
There were two sisters marrying one husband.

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,710
Now, you're serving two sisters.

119
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,790
Who will you choose?

120
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,470
Princess Lin'an

121
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,790
is spoiled,

122
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,270
and she tricked me,

123
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,440
but she saved my life, too.

124
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,270
Does she want you to be her kept man?

125
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,470
If so, you'll rise high.

126
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,790
Do you think a kept man is an honor, Father?

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,830
She meant to help me.

128
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,760
I've known her for a while.

129
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,080
She might be simple

130
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,390
and willful,

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
but

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,880
she's pure,

133
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
kind,

134
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,390
loyal,

135
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
and protective, too.

136
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,440
She treats me well.

137
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,910
Do you like her?

138
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,960
Uncle,

139
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,120
being an Imperial Guard is
a waste of your talent.

140
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,590
Had you written novels
for that bookstore in the alley,

141
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,000
you would've long been successful.

142
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,030
Don't tease me.

143
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,470
You're old enough to marry.

144
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,830
I care about your happiness.

145
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,200
Our family is humble.

146
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,270
A princess is so out of his reach.

147
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,230
What about Princess Huaiqing?

148
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,710
She is

149
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,230
calm

150
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,790
and collected,

151
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
deep, and intelligent.

152
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,910
If I choose her,

153
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,590
few in the state will dare bully us again.

154
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,030
The future of the Xu Clan

155
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,830
will also be guaranteed.

156
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,790
Whoever you choose,

157
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,590
you're still two-faced, aren't you?

158
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,470
I prefer the word "capable"!

159
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,680
Ningyan,

160
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,960
serving those two together

161
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,200
must be exhausting.

162
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,120
I'm worried about you.

163
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,470
Why don't you

164
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,830
introduce me

165
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,830
to Princess Huaiqing?

166
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll be her slave

167
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,470
for the future of our family!

168
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,590
Mother,

169
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,150
Father wants to be Princess Huaiqing's slave!

170
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,710
- Shut up!
- Mother!

171
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,710
Shut it.

172
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,630
There you are.

173
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,000
Here I am.

174
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,520
Have you recovered since we met days ago?

175
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,640
You must be No. 3.

176
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,830
Nice to meet you.

177
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,320
I am No. 3...

178
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,870
No. 3's brother,

179
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,990
Guardian, Xu Qi'an.

180
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,630
You must be No. 4.

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,870
No. 4 of the Realm Sect, Chu Yuanzhen.

182
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,680
You're No. 3's brother?

183
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,950
Where's he?

184
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,320
He can't show his face?

185
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,350
As you probably know,

186
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,200
my brother studies at the Yunlu Academy.

187
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,870
The Spring Exam is approaching.

188
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,510
He's studying at school all day,

189
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,710
so he can't be here.

190
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,800
But don't worry.

191
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,830
He's told me to take care of this matter.

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,110
Right, Jinlian?

193
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,160
No. 4,

194
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,320
message No. 6 and see if he's there.

195
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,830
No. 6, are you there?

196
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,950
No.

197
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,520
Wait,

198
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,680
what was that?

199
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,520
Messaging.

200
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,870
That can only be done in the mirror, right?

201
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,110
How did you know?

202
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
My brother told me.

203
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,240
Hey,

204
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,040
when was that new function available?

205
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,830
Why didn't you tell my brother?

206
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,630
The Jade Mirror

207
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,710
allows private chat.

208
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,590
Back then, I was severely injured and weak,

209
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,280
so that function was temporarily deactivated.

210
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,350
It's been

211
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,800
reactivated only recently.

212
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,590
Reactivated.

213
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,950
Deactivated.

214
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,830
Private chat.

215
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,590
Yes.

216
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,040
Look.

217
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,750
No. 2, wake up to practice.

218
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,510
Or I'll kill you.

219
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,880
Not if

220
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,230
I kill you first.

221
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,200
Alright, alright.

222
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,830
Get back to business.

223
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,680
No. 4 and I have been locating Heng Yuan,

224
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,350
but as of now,

225
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,400
we only know

226
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,800
he's still in the city.

227
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,510
His exact location remains unknown.

228
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,320
Couldn't you locate him with the mirror?

229
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,200
Theoretically, yes,

230
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,350
but he,

231
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,040
or No. 6's Jade Mirror

232
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,880
seems to

233
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,590
be shielded.

234
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,630
It can be shielded, too?

235
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,830
No. 3's brother,

236
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,230
did you call us

237
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,590
because you found something?

238
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,320
Do you still remember

239
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,440
Heng Yuan said he killed Earl Pingyuan

240
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,080
to find his junior?

241
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,080
So what?

242
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,960
I came across the news

243
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
that his junior, Heng Hui,

244
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,230
carried an energy-concealing weapon

245
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,040
when eloping with Princess Pingyang.

246
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,510
Then that weapon to conceal energy

247
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,230
was very likely to be

248
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,560
used by Zhou Chixiong.

249
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,160
Really?

250
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,750
If so, was Heng Yuan's disappearance

251
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,920
related to the Sangbo Case?

252
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,800
We aren't sure yet.

253
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,230
That's why we have to find him quickly

254
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,710
to put together the truth.

255
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,430
So

256
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,510
what's your plan?

257
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,710
I don't have one,

258
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,440
but we can go to this place

259
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,800
to try our luck.

260
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,380
(Earl Pingyuan's Mansion.)

261
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
Earl Pingyuan's Mansion?

262
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,310
Yes.

263
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,800
Heng Yuan came here once
to look for Heng Hui.

264
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,230
Maybe he'll come again.

265
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,200
Let's go and check.

266
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,040
Maybe...

267
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,110
Maybe we'll find leads to his whereabouts.

268
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
Let's go.

269
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,740
(Earl Pingyuan's Lineal Son)

270
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,120
Young Master!

271
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,280
Young Master,

272
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,350
all the trading in town has been suspended.

273
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,110
The women and children sent over

274
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,470
are staying where they are.

275
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,400
I suggest

276
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
we wait until things blow over

277
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,830
and then send them away.

278
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,200
Stay put for now.

279
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,470
Don't draw the Guardians' attention.

280
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,680
What about the authorities in town?

281
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,630
Any actions so far?

282
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,630
Not yet.

283
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,000
You may leave.

284
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,440
Stay alert.

285
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,280
Yes.

286
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,040
Liven it up.

287
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,320
No sooner is Earl Pingyuan buried

288
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,160
than his son is indulging in decadent music.

289
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,510
What a dandy.

290
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,990
His lineal son seems to
have taken over that group of traffickers.

291
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,080
Lord Wei has already known that.

292
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,560
I'm sure things are under his control.

293
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,510
Those people are in his hand.

294
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,280
Lower your voice.

295
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,280
- Be quiet.
- What are you doing?

296
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,120
No. 4,

297
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,320
no, Mr. Chu,

298
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,350
watch your sword case, please.

299
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,400
What's wrong with it?

300
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,710
It's fine. It's my fault.

301
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,880
Look,

302
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,560
this is a covert operation.

303
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,750
Your huge case might give us away.

304
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,960
Let me put it on the side.

305
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,920
Sorry, you can't.

306
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:20,920
Enough.

307
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,280
Can you two be quiet?

308
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,680
He's carried that case for 10 years.

309
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,320
You want to take it off him?

310
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,040
In your dreams!

311
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,590
10 years?

312
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,520
Yes.

313
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,080
Over the years,

314
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,710
my sword's been in its scabbard

315
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,280
in its case on my back,

316
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,960
nourished by Qi force day and night.

317
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
Once it's powerful enough,

318
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,470
I'll battle No. 2.

319
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,830
I see. "Ten years it takes to grind a sword.

320
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,320
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested."

321
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,280
Exactly.

322
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,800
"Ten years it takes to grind a sword.

323
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,510
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested."

324
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,990
"Ten years it takes to grind a sword.

325
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,870
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested."

326
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
Brilliant!

327
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,440
Spot on! It speaks to me.

328
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,630
What's the next line?

329
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,930
Xu...

330
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Qi'an.

331
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,280
Xu Qi'an,

332
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,190
Mr. Xu,

333
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,710
what's the next line?

334
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,680
Could you tell me?

335
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,870
Next line?

336
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,870
Yes, there's one,

337
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,110
but I forgot.

338
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,400
Please think again.

339
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,350
I don't remember it.

340
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,510
- If I knew, I'd tell you.
- Stop it.

341
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,590
We got company.

342
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,350
Who is this?

343
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,190
Go away!

344
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,160
Who are you?

345
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,470
A debt collector.

346
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,030
It's you.

347
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,760
No way!

348
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,990
I saw you die with my own eyes!

349
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,160
I crawled back from hell

350
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,270
to take revenge on you!

351
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,440
I'll track down all of you

352
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,070
and...

353
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,070
A mummy?

354
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,920
This hand was the evil object in Sangbo.

355
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,640
One Chop to Kill All!

356
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,750
(If one chop fails to kill it,)

357
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,750
(then...)

358
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,870
Run!

359
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,440
Are you safe? Have you got out?

360
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,510
Look up.

361
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,120
Jinlian?

362
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,440
Look down.

363
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,200
Wow!

364
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,750
They're amazing!

365
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,990
That thing is too powerful.

366
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,840
It's formidable.

367
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,070
We aren't its match.

368
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,230
I've talked to No. 4.

369
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,230
We'll go back to the sect for safety.

370
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,750
Wait. You aren't one of the sect members.

371
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,160
Why do you have the Jade Mirror?

372
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,990
(Oh no! I was careless.)

373
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,070
(I forgot that.)

374
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,360
My brother has to focus on

375
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,750
the upcoming Spring Exam.

376
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,230
He let me keep the mirror for now.

377
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,030
- Stop!
- Who are you?

378
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,310
It's me!

379
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
Mr. Xu.

380
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,440
An assassin broke
into Earl Pingyuan's Mansion

381
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,400
and killed everyone.

382
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,750
I ran into him while investigating

383
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,310
by His Majesty's order.

384
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,990
He's formidable. Don't act rashly.

385
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,920
Alert others now.

386
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,760
Yes.

387
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,330
Chief,

388
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,790
we looked everywhere

389
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,790
but didn't find
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son's body.

390
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,920
Tell them to stop.

391
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,880
I think

392
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,230
other than the killer, someone else was here.

393
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,230
Who discovered the massacre first?

394
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,470
They did.

395
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,820
- Gold Gong Jin.
- Gold Gong Jin.

396
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,840
When you came,

397
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
did you see anyone suspicious in this area?

398
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,230
No, sir.

399
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,510
Actually, we didn't discover the massacre.

400
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,710
It wasn't you?

401
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,020
Who was it?

402
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,200
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an.

403
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,750
Xu Qi'an?

404
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,720
Where is he?

405
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,260
(Heng Hui)

406
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,640
Lord Wei,

407
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,470
everyone in Earl Pingyuan's Mansion

408
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
was killed. No one survived.

409
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,600
When were they killed?

410
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,840
Who killed them?

411
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,310
Just now,

412
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,510
when I went there for investigation,

413
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,470
I witnessed everything.

414
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
The killer is a man in a gray robe.

415
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,550
He's above the 4th Rank.

416
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,790
I'm no match for him.

417
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,920
I believe he's carrying

418
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,550
the thing once sealed in Sangbo.

419
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,840
What makes you say that?

420
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,920
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son

421
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,230
died in the same way
as those Imperial Guards.

422
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,400
Take a look.

423
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Is he that killer?

424
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,580
(Heng Hui)

425
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Yes.

426
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,750
He's Heng Hui?

427
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,880
The Azure Hall had
an energy-concealing weapon

428
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,550
that went missing a year ago.

429
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,440
Abbot Panshu of Tianyu

430
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,680
kept that secret
to not cause himself trouble.

431
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,310
Heng Hui left the Azure Hall

432
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,070
almost at the same time.

433
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,680
In that case,

434
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,750
Zhou Chixiong did use that weapon

435
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,960
to get away.

436
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,680
How did Zhou get Heng Hui's weapon?

437
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,640
Heng Hui came back and killed so many people.

438
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,230
I'll track down all of you

439
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,710
and...

440
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,750
He's back for revenge.

441
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,310
He said he'd continue to kill.

442
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,480
Revenge?

443
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,480
Lord Wei,

444
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
there might be more

445
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,960
to Princess Pingyang's elopement.

446
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,480
Go on.

447
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,400
I found that a year ago,

448
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,230
His Majesty meant to
let Duke Yu in the Cabinet.

449
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,510
Meanwhile,

450
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,790
His Majesty fumed.

451
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,960
Officials attacked Duke Yu.

452
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,680
Then he passed away in distress.

453
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,750
A year later,

454
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,960
Heng Hui came back

455
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,070
and killed Earl Pingyuan's lineal son.

456
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,440
The Earl had a group of traffickers,

457
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,550
able to send people out of town in secret.

458
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,400
Do you mean

459
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,990
it's actually a power struggle

460
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,120
between civil officials and the nobility?

461
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,310
Do you know

462
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,200
after Pingyang ran away

463
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,750
and Duke Yu died,

464
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,230
who benefited the most under the table?

465
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,680
You're right.

466
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,880
It concerns tons of officials' transfers.

467
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,230
Lord Wei,

468
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,680
Earl Pingyuan's Mansion...

469
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:25,870
Jiang Lyuzhong,

470
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,070
come closer.

471
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,750
Any update on the group of traffickers

472
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,840
you're investigating?

473
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,840
I've been digging into them

474
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,120
without alerting any forces or authorities.

475
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,920
Since Earl Pingyuan died,

476
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,270
they've been lying low.

477
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,160
No one is going after them,

478
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,200
so they remain in the capital.

479
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,400
I see.

480
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,070
Looks like

481
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,960
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son

482
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,200
did take over that group.

483
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,960
It's time to crack it.

484
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,960
Yes.

485
00:25:59,030 --> 00:25:59,960
You may leave.

486
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,270
I have other things to attend to.

487
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,840
Good night, Lord Wei.

488
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,640
How dare you steal my case!

489
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,790
Don't be mad, Gold Gong Jiang.

490
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,710
I know you're investigating the Earl's case.

491
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,360
It's closely linked to the Sangbo Case.

492
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,360
If we work together

493
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,230
to solve them,

494
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,310
you'll gain merits, too, right?

495
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,760
Hey,

496
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,030
do whatever you see fit.

497
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
If you need my help,

498
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,440
just let me know.

499
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,710
Thanks a lot.

500
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,200
You're welcome.

501
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,550
Were you injured?

502
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,070
Heng Hui hit me.

503
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,470
Sorry about that.

504
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,580
(Duke Yu's Mansion)

505
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,860
(Duke Yu's Mansion)

506
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,020
Princess Pingyang might be
involved in the Sangbo Case.

507
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,990
That's only my speculation so far.

508
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,280
Lin'an.

509
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
(Endless Fortune)

510
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,750
Ever since the Sangbo Ceremony,

511
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,510
Her Ladyship has been bringing you up.

512
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,840
You've finally come.

513
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,040
Lin'an.

514
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,920
Aunt.

515
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,400
When was the last time

516
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,750
you came here after Pingyang left?

517
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,510
No one eats the pomegranates

518
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,200
on the tree.

519
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,960
A while ago,

520
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,600
the heavy rain

521
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,920
knocked off many of them.

522
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,710
Come in.

523
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,680
Aunt,

524
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,640
this is...

525
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,680
I have nothing to do.

526
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,030
I copy Buddhist sutras

527
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,600
to kill time

528
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,070
and pray for my husband and daughter.

529
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,750
It's been a while since your last visit.

530
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,400
Her Ladyship misses you
and Princess Pingyang every day.

531
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,070
Here.

532
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,920
Try the newly picked pomegranate.

533
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,550
Is it sweet?

534
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,880
When Pingyang

535
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,270
was 10,

536
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,840
her father had the tree

537
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,120
delivered from the South.

538
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,750
She's always been a picky eater.

539
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,960
She said other pomegranates were sour.

540
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,440
Only those

541
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,710
from that tree were her favorites.

542
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,680
Are pomegranates on that tree

543
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,120
from the South really that sweet?

544
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,390
I think

545
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,120
she liked them

546
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,440
simply because she planted

547
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,360
that tree herself.

548
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,550
She loved the tree

549
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,920
but wouldn't come back to see it.

550
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,710
Does she

551
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,270
still hate me and her father?

552
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,720
Aunt,

553
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,990
even if parents and children fought,

554
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,640
they'd make up overnight.

555
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,030
She doesn't hate you anymore.

556
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,900
Then

557
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,500
when you hear from her again,

558
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,540
please tell her

559
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,340
this year's pomegranates are sweet and juicy,

560
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,820
and let her know...

561
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,860
I'm no longer mad at her.

562
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,500
Were her father alive,

563
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,100
he'd forgive her, too.

564
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
I just

565
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,860
want her to come back

566
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,420
to visit me.

567
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,820
Uh,

568
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,660
actually, a while ago,

569
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,660
I received her letter.

570
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,100
She said she went to...

571
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,500
Zhongzhou.

572
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,660
The scenery there was beautiful.

573
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,980
She didn't want to leave.

574
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,980
She...

575
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,500
She was afraid His Majesty was still mad.

576
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,860
That's why

577
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,980
she didn't come back.

578
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,380
In that case,

579
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,980
I can go there to visit her.

580
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm free anyway.

581
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,580
Aunt...

♪Brings whom to my side♪

583
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,340
Zhongzhou is far.

584
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:00,500
It'll take over a month to get there.

585
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,420
When you arrive, she's probably left.

586
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,350

590
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,300
When I

591
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,700
write to her next time,

592
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,500
I'll persuade her.

593
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,380
♪I only wish for Xu's safety♪

594
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,060

Alright.

596
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,220
I...

597
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,300
I'll ask Butler Li

598
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,860
to prepare

599
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,710
new clothes and jewelry

600
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,660
for her to wear when she

601
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,790
- Aunt,
- comes back...

602
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,860
I have to go back to the Palace

603
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,660
to attend to a few things.

604
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,580
Lin'an,

605
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,140
please help me

606
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,980
bring Pingyang back.

607
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,940
You have three days

608
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,580
to solve this case,

609
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,500
or you'll be dismissed!

610
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,380
(Report)

611
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,500
Please be appeased, Your Majesty.

612
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,620
Cultivators

613
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,020
cultivate their minds, too.

614
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,180
Don't ruin your state of mind.

615
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,340
Your Majesty,

616
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,700
the Guardians have let go
of the culprits twice.

617
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,180
That's malpractice.

618
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,780
I suspect

619
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,860
Wei Yuan is colluding with the enemies.

620
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,340
He's a traitor.

621
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,380
He must be dealt with seriously.

622
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,340
Magistrate Chen,

623
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,940
what do you think?

624
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,860
While the Sangbo Case's under investigation,

625
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,660
a massacre happened
at Earl Pingyuan's Mansion.

626
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,160
Your Majesty, please don't be mad.

627
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,500
You should stay calm.

628
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,740
Let's hear

629
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,820
what Lord Wei

630
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,700
has to say first.

631
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,700
Your Majesty,

632
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,180
I believe

633
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,340
those two cases are

634
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,260
part of a bigger case.

635
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,380
I've found out

636
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,060
who killed Earl Pingyuan.

637
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:54,500
(Zhang Feng, Minister of War)

638
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,460
Who was it?

639
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,260
The case also involved Princess Pingyang
who went missing a year ago.

640
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,060
The tip-off the Guardians received

641
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,060
shows that her disappearance

642
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,900
might've been planned by court officials

643
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,220
in order to

644
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,820
bring down Duke Yu.

645
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,060
What exactly happened?

646
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,140
Your Majesty,

647
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,740
please

648
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,260
make others leave.

649
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,340
That eunuch

650
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,900
dared to ask us to leave.

651
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,820
He's up to no good!

652
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Minister,

653
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,140
if what Lord Wei has to say is classified,

654
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,100
it's understandable

655
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,860
to clear the room.

656
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,780
We're high-ranking officials.

657
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,340
How classified is it
that even we can't hear it?

658
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,700
I bet

659
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,580
he's showing off to us

660
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,900
how much His Majesty favors him!

661
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,020
Lord Wei,

662
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,060
good day.

663
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,940
Lord Wei.

664
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,180
Lord Wei,

665
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,820
who is that cold-blooded killer that massacred

666
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,660
all those in Earl Pingyuan's Mansion?

667
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,580
Mr. Zhang,

668
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,460
it's confidential as it's linked

669
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,700
to the Sangbo Case.

670
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,500
However,

671
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,700
the Guardians

672
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,900
have been tipped off.

673
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,940
The truth will soon come out.

674
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,180
You'll know it then,

675
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,020
Minister.

676
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,820
I see.

677
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,060
Eunuch Yang,

678
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,820
what did Wei Yuan say

679
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,260
to His Majesty just now?

680
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,740
This case

681
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:28,220
is being handled
by Copper Gong Guardian, Xu Qi'an.

682
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,540
Lord Wei simply said

683
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,900
what Xu Qi'an had told him.

684
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,220
Xu Qi'an?

685
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,780
What's taking you so long to pack up?

686
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,100
Can you hurry up?

687
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,700
Hurry! Box it!

688
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
Master,

689
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,340
don't be too mad.

690
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,100
We're doing it as fast as we can.

691
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,220
Where is our son?

692
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,220
It's been a while.

693
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,300
Why hasn't he come out?

694
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,740
I've rushed him a few times.

695
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,020
He'll be out soon.

696
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,420
Calm down.

697
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,500
Hurry up! Come on!

698
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,260
- Son.
- Did you ask for me?

699
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,580
Pack up your valuables.

700
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,300
We need to get out of town now.

701
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,460
(Zhang Yi, Zhang Feng's son)

702
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,980
Go now!

703
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,180
Hurry!

704
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,020
- Yes, Father.
- Go.

705
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,660
Stop.

706
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,180
The Guardians are working on a case. No exit.

707
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,380
Officer, we're going out for business.

708
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,220
Please let us go.

709
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
Here's something for you.

710
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,060
The suspect is on the run.

711
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,300
No one is allowed in or out.

712
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,460
I'm the Minister of War, Zhang Feng.

713
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,020
I have state affairs to attend to.

714
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,220
No delay is allowed!

715
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,220
Let us through now!

716
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,140
It's His Majesty's order.

717
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,780
Please think twice, Minister Zhang.

718
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,060
Have some tea.

719
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,340
Thanks, Lord Wei.

720
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,980
Lord Wei,

721
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,540
the Minister of War, Zhang Feng,
meant to leave with his family.

722
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,820
Our people stopped them just now.

723
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,820
I see. You may leave.

724
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,580
The fish took the bait?

725
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,860
Your plan was brilliant.

726
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,980
We simply baited...

727
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,940
We simply baited the trap.

728
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,660
The suspect fell right into it.

729
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,660
Hadn't you, a little Copper Gong,

730
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,820
figured out the power struggle
behind this case,

731
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,340
Zhang Feng wouldn't have fled in haste
after hearing the news.

732
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,540
Yes.

733
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,900
But

734
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,700
did the mastermind go to such great lengths

735
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,060
to release that thing from the lake

736
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,380
only to help Heng Hui take revenge?

737
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,420
Given his ability and rank,

738
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,900
he wasn't qualified to join the Sangbo Case.

739
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,560
My original theory was

740
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,260
court officials were behind the Sangbo Case.

741
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,540
Releasing that thing

742
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,900
was to stage a revolt.

743
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,100
Besides,

744
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,060
I even thought

745
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,540
that thing was...

746
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,420
What was it?

747
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,780
Tell me.

748
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,620
The former Supervisor.

749
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,580
What do you think now?

750
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,820
Heng Hui's appearance proved me wrong.

751
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,260
What baffles me is

752
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,940
if other forces are behind Heng Hui,

753
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,260
they released that thing for what?

754
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,540
Speculation is of no use.

755
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,180
Once we seize him,

756
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,020
