Fame and wealth mean nothing to me.

42
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
I've made it clear.

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
I'll only serve Grand Princess Huaiqing.

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,520
Heaven and earth can be my witnesses.

45
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,830
You underestimated me.

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,360
You sound firm.

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,830
Firm as a rock.

48
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,670
Very well.

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,390
Grand Prin...

50
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,870
He's Huaiqing's lackey.

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,830
What now, Princess?

52
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,080
We've tried the carrot.

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,990
Use the stick now.

54
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,710
Guards!

55
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,080
Drag him out.

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,710
Princess Huaiqing...

57
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,590
Kill him!

58
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,340
(Lake Villa)

59
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,040
Orchids...

60
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,360
Beautiful.

61
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
Elegant.

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,080
Writing poems is so hard!

63
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,710
I wouldn't recruit talents

64
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,710
if I had help.

65
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,510
Princess.

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,480
How did it go?

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,430
Did Yang Ling yield?

68
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,800
He'd rather die.

69
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,150
You threatened him,

70
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,590
- didn't you?
- I did.

71
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,960
I threatened to use Guardians' 18 Skills

72
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,240
all on him the whole night,

73
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,520
but he was

74
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,830
as stubborn as a mule.

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,110
If all else failed,

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,320
whip him.

77
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,230
We did.

78
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,830
We whipped him hard over and over!

79
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,200
Was he not scared?

80
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,110
He was. He was terrified!

81
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,950
He even

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,390
passed out twice.

83
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,870
But when he woke up,

84
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,430
he wouldn't yield.

85
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,520
He kept saying the same thing.

86
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,270
What was it?

87
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,270
He'd serve Huaiqing

88
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,920
to the end.

89
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,550
Scratch me

90
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,320
with the whip. It's fine.

91
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,320
I've reached the Qi Stage.

92
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,910
The Guardians own

93
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,560
much worse tools of torture.

94
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,270
This is one of them.

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
Untie him.

96
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,760
What else can you do?

97
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,710
Bring it on!

98
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,590
Don't move!

99
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,550
Hey...

100
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,230
This is your last chance.

101
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,080
Who will you serve?

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,200
I'll serve Huaiqing

103
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,520
to the end!

104
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,880
You've left me no choice.

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,920
Take him away!

106
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
Where to?

107
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,120
I'll serve Huaiqing

108
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,150
to the end!

109
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,060
(Lake Villa)

110
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,200
What now?

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,080
You let me go?

112
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,320
Master said

113
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,470
if you refuse to join us,

114
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,680
we won't force you.

115
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,880
Wait, I meant...

116
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Goodbye.

117
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,720
What?

118
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,180
(Lake Villa)

119
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,320
You've given up so easily?

120
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,820
Princess.

121
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,980
(Lucid Waters and Lush Mountains)

122
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,820
You let him go?

123
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
Yes.

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
Good.

125
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,270
He'd better not report us.

126
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,520
It'd be terrible if Mother found out.

127
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,230
Princess.

128
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,750
Princess.

129
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,630
What's up?

130
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
Yang Ling,

131
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,560
- he...
- He reported us?

132
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
No, he didn't.

133
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,850
He sticks around outside,

134
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,170
saying we tortured him all night,

135
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,290
but he didn't get to see you.

136
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,910
He demands a face-to-face talk

137
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,880
and an explanation.

138
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,000
(Come on!)

139
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,520
(If I left,)

140
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,120
(I'd be a big fool!)

141
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,640
12 whips!

142
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,590
One night's torture!

143
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,350
I, Yang Ling, demand an explanation!

144
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,000
(Lake Villa)
Let your master come out!

145
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,230
I can't go.

146
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Drive him away.

147
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
Yes.

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,960
Is he gone?

149
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,440
He's still outside.

150
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,000
He's pigheaded

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,320
and persistent.

152
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,350
He's ready to sleep there.

153
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,910
He said

154
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,560
he'd keep waiting

155
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
as long as he could breathe.

156
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,270
Wow!

157
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,030
I've never seen anyone as unyielding

158
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,710
as him before.

159
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,710
He's different from the losers in my palace.

160
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,280
What a shame.

161
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,350
He isn't on my side.

162
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,470
Princess,

163
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
what should we do?

164
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,330
With him outside,

165
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,710
are we going back to the Palace?

166
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,760
We are.

167
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:35,750
Alright.

168
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,960
I don't want him to make a scene.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,880
Let's see

170
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,320
what he's up to.

171
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,900
(Lake Villa)

172
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,760
This is unnecessary, sir.

173
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,200
You tortured me all night.

174
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,680
Don't I at least deserve an explanation?

175
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,000
I apologize for that.

176
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,790
I meant to win you over.

177
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,830
You refused

178
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,440
for your integrity

179
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,390
and loyalty.

180
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
In that case,

181
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,760
may you have

182
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,230
a promising future.

183
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,160
Rise.

184
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,630
Hold it.

185
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,470
Do you always apologize

186
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:28,150
to others without showing your face?

187
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,830
I understand you're mad.

188
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
I'm sorry

189
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,350
for my rudeness.

190
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,440
Sorry.

191
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,560
I crossed the line.

192
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,470
Greeting, Grand Princess.

193
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,230
Grand Princess?

194
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,160
It's my honor to have finally met you.

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,830
I was so blind that I almost

196
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,470
missed a wise master like you.

197
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,710
Let me introduce myself.

198
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,400
I'm Xu Qi'an.

199
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,920
Yang Ling is my pen name.

200
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,340
Xu Qi'an?

201
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,660
Was it really Grand Princess's maid?

202
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,260
Of course.

203
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,420
Her visit to our house

204
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,620
showed a gesture of good faith.

205
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,140
Cijiu,

206
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,780
you'll become

207
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,060
as successful as Ningyan.

208
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,140
Don't be upset.

209
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,020
Ningyan.

210
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,980
Did it go well?

211
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,300
I made it.

212
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,500
I acted like

213
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,860
I didn't know she was Grand Princess

214
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,220
and that her bribery and coercion

215
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,700
made me

216
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,460
pledge allegiance to her.

217
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,820
That was how I passed her test

218
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,380
and gained her trust.

219
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,300
Did she

220
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,380
not know you?

221
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,340
She did, of course.

222
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,780
I was like a pawn
she casually placed on the board.

223
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,340
But I will show her

224
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,460
that a pawn

225
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,420
can decide the game.

226
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,380
Great wits have short memories.

227
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,580
It was you

228
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,620
who recommended me to the Guardians.

229
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,340
The Guardians?

230
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,100
(Xu Qi'an's Result, A+)
She's indeed sharp.

231
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,860
She chose a rare talent.

232
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,940
You're the one Huaiqing,

233
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,660
the one I

234
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,140
recommended to the Guardians, Xu Qi'an?

235
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,500
Yes, that's me.

236
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,860
Xu

237
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,180
Qi.

238
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,300
An.

239
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,460
And?

240
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,140
And it went smoothly.

241
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,980
She lauded my poems to the skies

242
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,180
and recruited me

243
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,580
to write more for her.

244
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,140
She invited me

245
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,380
to her place to talk tomorrow.

246
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,780
You may rise.

247
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,100
(Lake Villa)

248
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,060
I read your previous works.

249
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,380
They were excellent.

250
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,550
That's why I introduced you to Lord Wei.

251
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,500
What happened earlier is a test.

252
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,380
You proved yourself

253
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,420
worthy of trust.

254
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,460
I'm pleased.

255
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,540
Did you say

256
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,540
you want to thank me?

257
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,740
That'd be my pleasure.

258
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,260
I'll serve you for as long as I can.

259
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,100
Good. I'll ask you again.

260
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,900
Will you be my aide

261
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,820
in writing poems

262
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,020
and joining the Poetry Contest with me?

263
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,820
I'll serve Huaiqing

264
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,400
to the end!

265
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,980
Grand Princess is known for her talent.

266
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,300
She has a great name.

267
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,140
Why need ghostwriters?

268
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,300
That's her public persona.

269
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,860
Persona?

270
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,540
Humans are complicated.

271
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,820
The one you see

272
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,900
is the one she plays in public.

273
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,100
When you become an official,

274
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,340
keep that in mind.

275
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,500
It'll be of great help.

276
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,460
I need a persona, too.

277
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,020
You know,

278
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,420
she offered a fortune

279
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,620
to recruit me

280
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,380
for my poetic prowess.

281
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,700
But this can be a chance for us.

282
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,260
Where's the money?

283
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,420
I turned it down.

284
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,580
Compared with her favoritism,

285
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,820
money is nothing,

286
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,020
however much it is.

287
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,060
Don't lose the greater for the less.

288
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,180
Right.

289
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,740
If you can please her,

290
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,820
your chief won't bully you again,

291
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,780
and our family will be backed,

292
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,620
right?

293
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,580
Ningyan,

294
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,340
don't forget me when you rise to the top.

295
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,820
I won't, Uncle.

296
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,540
Her success

297
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,580
is my success.

298
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,580
My success

299
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,820
is the Xu Clan's success.

300
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,620
Let's drink.

301
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,380
Refill his cup.

302
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
Cijiu,

303
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,460
I need your help tonight

304
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,820
for the future of our family.

305
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,740
What is it?

306
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,980
Grind some ink.

307
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,420
Sure.

308
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,100
We had a close call earlier.

309
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,940
Luckily, you acted cleverly

310
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,900
by playing Grand Princess,

311
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,380
making him dead set on serving

312
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,820
and following you.

313
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,580
Who knows

314
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,220
Yang Ling is Xu Qi'an?

315
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,260
But impersonating Huaiqing

316
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,740
is risky.

317
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,660
They say success comes from risks.

318
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,820
You don't

319
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,100
need to worry too much.

320
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,700
As long as he doesn't see Grand Princess,

321
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,540
we'll be safe.

322
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,980
Easier said than done.

323
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,020
She introduced him to the Guardians.

324
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,780
Keeping them apart is

325
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,620
hard.

326
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,580
You're right.

327
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,500
The Contest is near.

328
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,620
Without him,

329
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,780
I stand no chance of defeating

330
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Huaiqing.

331
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,740
So

332
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,100
are you saying...?

333
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,940
Stall

334
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,420
until we get his poems.

335
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,140
Once he

336
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,140
brings them to me tomorrow,

337
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,580
we'll find a way

338
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,380
to get rid of him.

339
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,100
Who knows

340
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,460
Xu Ningyan is that poet, Yang Ling?

341
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,900
Does that mean

342
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,180
we can see Miss Fuxiang

343
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,380
at the Imperial Office of Music?

344
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
And for free.

345
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,740
He's here.

346
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,860
Yang Ling!

347
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,740
Shhh!

348
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
Keep it down.

349
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
You're late.

350
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,940
I stayed up late last night

351
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,140
for family business.

352
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,500
Good. Chief isn't here.

353
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,580
He was here.

354
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,620
He came early and went to look for you.

355
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,780
What did he need me for?

356
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,660
Not sure.

357
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,340
When you missed the roll call,

358
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,620
his face darkened.

359
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,020
What will happen

360
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,220
if one misses it?

361
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,780
If he's lenient, he'll

362
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,700
criticize you

363
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,580
and demand a fine.

364
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,380
And if he's not?

365
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,540
He'll torture you

366
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,620
and grill you.

367
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,820
Chief!

368
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,180
Chief.

369
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,060
Where are you on the files?

370
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
All is well.

371
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,780
I'm screening them carefully.

372
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,340
Why don't you go back
to the Breeze Hall for tea?

373
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,180
I'll report the case to you later.

374
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,980
I heard

375
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,260
you were mad about this assignment,

376
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,420
thinking I treated you unfairly.

377
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,260
No.

378
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,830
Not at all.

379
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,340
Which rascal

380
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,940
spread such rumors?

381
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,060
Could be Zhao Jia of the Hall of Might.

382
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,300
If you don't want to do it,

383
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,540
just drop the act.

384
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,540
Go to the streets.

385
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,660
What?

386
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,020
Are you punishing me?

387
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,860
Chief, I'll read the files now.

388
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,300
I really enjoy reading them.

389
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,220
- Let's go.
- Come on.

390
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,140
Come on!

391
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,530
Wait. Hold on...

392
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,500
Chief, I love reading files in the Archive!

393
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,660
I don't like going to the streets!

394
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,620
Chief!

395
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,980
- You...
- Let's go.

396
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,100
Why go to the streets?

397
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,980
What are you going to do to me?

398
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,500
Will I be tied up?

399
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,620
Why drag me out all of a sudden?

400
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,980
8 Circles!

401
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,820
(8 Circles)
I won!

402
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,180
You got away.

403
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,020
Pay up.

404
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,420
You'll lose the next round.

405
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,820
Come on. Another round.

406
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,750
Catch him.

407
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,240
My tile.

408
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,860
Is this called "going to the streets"?

409
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,540
To go to the streets is

410
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,260
to go to play and patrol the streets.

411
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,060
The weather is dry.

412
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,780
Watch out for fire.

413
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,060
Patrols are done. Let's play.

414
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,860
Just now, you two dragged me out.

415
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,860
I thought you'd strip and parade me

416
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,300
through the streets as a criminal.

417
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,140
Turns out, we can have fun.

418
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,460
Going out is way better

419
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,980
than staying at the Breeze Hall.

420
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,100
We're on duty here.

421
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:44,940
Yes.

422
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,780
- Stack the tiles.
- Hurry!

423
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,380
I'm done. I quit.

424
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,620
I lost all my money.

425
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,580
Play again

426
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,500
another day.

427
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,820
- Play with us.
- Next time.

428
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,340
You can't quit.

429
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,060
Short of one player.

430
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,020
- Let's play.
- No, thanks.

431
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,980
Hey, come on.

432
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,820
Join us!

433
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,540
Wen Yang.

434
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,460
Wen Yang!

435
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,540
Join us!

436
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,420
Can't.

437
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm busy.

438
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,700
Yuan?

439
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,820
My wife keeps the money.

440
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,980
Can't play with you.

441
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,780
So hen-pecked!

442
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,060
Goodness.

443
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,820
What to do?

444
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,540
Ju.

445
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,620
Ju!

446
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,860
Hey, come and play with us.

447
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,980
No, thanks.

448
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,140
I haven't made a penny yet.

449
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,980
Just use your fingers.

450
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,660
Quit it, you dirty dog!

451
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,220
Lan!

452
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,700
(Sweet and Tasty)
Yes?

453
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,620
Play with us.

454
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,060
Sure, I'm coming.

455
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,660
Lan is the best!

456
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,740
Hey,

457
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,380
Chief is tough.

458
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,500
If someone provokes him,

459
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,940
he won't let him go.

460
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,820
He yelled at you yesterday.

461
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,500
Why is he so nice to you now?

462
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,220
We're friends. Be honest with us.

463
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,740
Did you pull some strings?

464
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,140
The Bureau?

465
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,900
Yunlu Academy!

466
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,380
Or...

467
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,900
It is me.

468
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,900
You're on my side.

469
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,380
I'll protect you.

470
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,300
I've asked the Guardians.

471
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,300
You're

472
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,180
on bad terms with the Silver Gong.

473
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,020
I told Wei Yuan

474
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,540
to look after you.

475
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
What's wrong?

476
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,860
Are you troubled?

477
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,220
No, Your Highness.

478
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,580
You spared time for me

479
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,100
from your tight schedule.

480
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,700
I can't thank you enough

481
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,660
or pay you back.

482
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,020
You can.

483
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,740
Yes, you can.

484
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,300
The poem.

485
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,060
Where is it?

486
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,060
Here you are.

487
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,500
"Fine wine in golden cups, 10,000 a pot.

488
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,660
Delicacies in jade plates,

489
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,340
the same a dish.

490
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,820
I couldn't go on eating or drinking.

491
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,780
Drawing the sword, looking around,

492
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,060
I felt lost."

493
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,950
Terrific!

494
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,060
"Ice blocked my way through the Yellow River.

495
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,940
Snow filled the paths
up the Taihang Mountains.

496
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,700
Going fishing in a boat in greenish water,

497
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,620
suddenly..."

498
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,060
What's next?

499
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,140
Say it!

500
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
It's hard.

501
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,580
I racked my brain all night

502
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,940
last night.

503
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
I'm still working on it.

504
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,900
Do you like that half?

505
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,660
I love it.

506
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,180
When can you

507
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,380
finish the rest?

508
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,180
In a few days

509
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,100
or a few months, perhaps.

510
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,580
Poems

511
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,140
rely on inspiration.

512
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,060
It's as fickle as sudden gusts

513
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,700
of rain,

514
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,220
so it's hard to say.

515
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,660
Are you saying

516
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,940
I'll have to pray to the heavens

517
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,900
for you to finish the poem?

518
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,740
No.

519
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,460
If I can stay by your side,

520
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,780
maybe I'll be

521
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,180
enlightened

522
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,580
like the sky's brightened.

523
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,420
That makes sense.

524
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,980
Gang,

525
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,100
give her an entry badge.

526
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,140
You may come here anytime

527
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,500
if you ever need my help.

528
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,060
We'll meet every three days,

529
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,380
rain or shine.

530
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,780
(Badge)

531
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,740
Yes.

532
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,940
Your plan is working.

533
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,340
Everything is under control.

534
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,380
When did you go to see Lord Wei?

535
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,900
Why didn't I know that?

536
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,380
He wouldn't have time for me.

537
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,820
That man is so intimidating.

538
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,500
Xu Qi'an said it himself.

539
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,040
He didn't get along well with his chief.

540
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,620
I played along

541
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,700
so that he'd be grateful

542
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,180
and write poems for me.

543
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,540
You're indeed wise.

544
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,500
Still, I think

545
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,740
he's hiding things from you

546
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,420
in order to

547
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,620
bargain with you.

548
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,900
I know.

549
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,500
He's

550
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
not stupid.

551
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,780
His poems are one of a kind.

552
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,980
That half alone

553
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,260
has proved his talent.

554
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,420
Looks like

555
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,060
we need to alter our plan.

556
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,460
To get

557
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,020
more poems in the future,

558
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,980
we have to be patient.

559
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,700
Do you mean...?

560
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,740
Pass my order.

561
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,740
No one under my roof

562
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,500
shall slack off again.

563
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,300
They shall be elegant

564
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,940
and more cultured.

565
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,220
From now on, this is Huaiqing's place.

566
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,460
I'm

567
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,540
the Grand Princess.

568
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,260
Yes.

569
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,220
What?

570
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,660
He left his post without permission!

571
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,840
How audacious!

572
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,420
Bring Xu Qi'an back by the end of the day.

573
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,500
He's guilty of misconduct.

574
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,550
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,860
Xu Qi'an!

576
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Yes, sir.

577
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,500
Where were you?

578
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,820
I...

579
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,260
Look at you!

580
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,100
No uniform.

581
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,340
No Copper Gong Badge.

582
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,420
You're wild and undisciplined!

583
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,380
Take him to the Punishment Hall.

584
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,580
Be harsh on him!

585
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,580
Don't provoke him.

586
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,060
Bear with it. Go.

587
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,940
Hold on!

588
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,060
You're on my side.

589
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,060
I'll protect you.

590
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,620
I've asked the Guardians.

591
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,940
You're

592
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,820
on bad terms with the Silver Gong.

593
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,700
I told Wei Yuan

594
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,890

I was patrolling the streets.

633
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,660
You wronged me.

634
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,940
I didn't do anything against the law.

635
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,700
Leaving without permission

636
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,140
is against the law.

637
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,780
To patrol

638
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,660
is to walk around to check.

639
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Taking the same old routes every day

640
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,220
only to finish

641
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,860
the task

642
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,860
isn't proper patrolling.

643
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,060
It's like walking the dog.

644
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,730
You...!

645
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,380
No uniform. No...

646
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,980
No uniform. No Copper Gong Badge.

647
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,980
Not buttoned up.

648
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,900
I ruined the Guardians' image.

649
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
I'm a laughing stock.

650
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,900
Is that all?

651
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,060
Come on.

652
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,620
Same old, same old.

653
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,260
Can't you say anything new?

654
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,780
You...

655
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,620
I... I'm warning you!

656
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,020
Stop imitating me!

657
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,380
You're

658
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,980
incorrigible!

659
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,660
Me?

660
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,780
What have I done wrong?

661
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,020
I meant to ask you before.

662
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,980
Wearing such scary costumes is one thing.

663
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,300
Which idiot came up with this idea

664
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,220
of banging the gong?

665
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,540
Take a few steps and bang!

666
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,100
Everyone can hear it.

667
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
Everyone knows the Guardians are here.

668
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,940
Won't that alert the bad guys?

669
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,260
I'm here!

670
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,860
Run away, thieves!

671
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,580
Is that some kind of silly movie?

672
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,220
They're bad, not dumb.

673
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,340
How can you catch them?

674
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,820
You are a real laughingstock!

675
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,660
What is a movie?

676
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,780
It's a new metaphor.

677
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,860
Enough

678
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,740
of your mockery.

679
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,500

Look, guys,

680
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,220
I'm not yapping.

681
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,100
It's only been a month,

682
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,940
but I've discovered tons of issues among us,

683
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,060
not just among the Copper Gongs.

684
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,020
Guangxiao.

685
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,980
Yes, sir!

686
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,380
Yes.

687
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,580
Fetch the white book

688
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,060
from the Archive.

689
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,060
Sure.

690
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,620
Run!

691
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,300
He...

692
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,460
This office

693
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,820
hasn't been so lively for a long time.

(I'll use it to knock you down.)

697
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,220
If you had discovered

698
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,180
those issues,

699
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,740
why didn't you tell me earlier?

700
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,620
What if someone abused his power

701
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,380
for revenge?

702
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,580
(10 Ways to Improve the Guardians)

703
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,580
I'll discuss everything

704
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,500
in the book with the Silver Gongs.

705
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,340
If there are issues among us,

706
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,460
I'll deal with them.

707
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,260
Yuchun,

708
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,900
it's good to admit your faults.

709
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,980
Alright.

710
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,340
I'll go back to work.

711
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,460
Have some tea.

712
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,580
Don't be mad.

713
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,500
A white book?

714
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,860
Li Yuchun accused Xu Qi'an of misconduct,

715
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,660
causing them to fight.

716
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,660
Then Xu showed him a white book,

717
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,660
listing out all the issues
among the Guardians.

718
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,860
(10 Ways to Improve the Guardians)
Look.

719
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,100
As unruly and rebellious

720
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,620
as that boy seems,

721
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,460
he acts with integrity.

722
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,580
He knows

723
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,860
what to do.

724
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,620
"The uniform's color

725
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,900

726
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,940
of the gong."

727
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,980
Yes.

728
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,860
He lists the flaws in the current uniform

729
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,300
and in banging before making arrests.

730
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,300
If we could catch bad guys

731
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,340
in uniform while banging the gong,

732
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,980
they must be stupid.

733
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,300
He asked who came up with that idea.

734
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,660
I did.

735
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,620
You're wise, Father.

736
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,780
(Li Yuchun is a paper tiger.)

737
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,300
(Now that I'm backed by Grand Princess,)

738
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,340
(all the Guardians)

739
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,420

Today is my 31st day as a Guardian.

743
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,620
I'm still a Copper Gong,

744
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,580
but I'm freed from the files

745
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,940
because

746
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,900
I'm under Grand Princess's wing now.

747
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,540

00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,380
(A few days ago,)

749
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,460
(I met a talent,)

(Xu Qi'an.)

751
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,740
(He mistook me for Huaiqing,)

752
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,580
(agreeing to write poems for me.)

753
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,860
(I'll become her confidant by copying)

754
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,820
(poems from the great ones.)

(A promotion and raise)

756
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,320
(Xu Qi'an's Promotion)
(will come in no time.)

757
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,180
(As long as he doesn't know,)

758
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,820
(I'm sure)

00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,460
Thanks, Yuchun.

762
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,580
Go.

763
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,780
(The first of May,)

764
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,180
(in our society,)

765
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,580
(is Labor Day.)

766
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,540
(We have three days off.)

767
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,420
(I asked Li Yuchun)

768
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,980
(for a three-day leave.)

769
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,860
(He granted it instantly.)

770
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,260
See you, Wang.

771
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,180
Bye.

772
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,500
(I know that's all)

773
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,900
(thanks to Grand Princess.)

774
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,980
(Cijiu said)

775
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,940
(she's talented)

776
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,140
(and proficient in poetry.)

777
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,020
(When she sees a good poem,)

778
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,420
(she'll comment on it as if she knows.)

779
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,420
(I have to act like her)

780
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,940
(to not raise any suspicion.)

781
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,020
(So)

782
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,860
(I have to study as hard as I can.)

783
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,020
(I have to write as many poems as I can.)

784
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,100
(There's...)
(Quality is the key.)

785
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,300
(From now on, I have to make full use)

786
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,940
(of every second)

787
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,580
(to hold on to a rare talent like Xu Qi'an.)

788
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,140
(No shortcut to the mastery)

789
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,860
(of any art.)
(To hold on to)

790
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,540
(the powerful Grand Princess.)

791
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,700
(Today is my second day to be Huaiqing.)

792
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,980
Princess,

793
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,140
it's already noon!

794
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,780
You have to wake up!

795
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,380
Wait until the You hour.

796
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,860
(I'm drained.)

797
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,580
(If only I memorized more poems before.)

798
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,860
Come on.

799
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,380
Let's eat lamb skewers.

800
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,100
- (There are two days left.)
- Let's go.

801
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,180
(I could use a day off.)

802
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,260
(Work hard, play hard.)

803
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,900
(It's the sunset again.)

804
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,420
(There are)

805
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,500
(still two days left.)

806
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,020
(I could)

807
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,900
(use a day off.)

808
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,660
Gang!

809
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,090
Good!

810
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,560
Nice!

811
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,700
Give me that!

812
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,700
Over here.

813
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,860
(I did nothing yesterday.)

814
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,140
(Today,)

815
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,660
(I have to work hard.)

816
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,540
(I even woke up early.)

817
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,420
"To appreciate poetry..."

818
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,060
(I'm too sleepy.)

819
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,820
Come.

820
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,140
Carry her to her room.

821
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,340
(Yesterday, at the Imperial Office of Music,)

822
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,740
(I ran into Constable Wang and those going)

823
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,580
(to Mount Dahuang with me.)

824
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,220
(We drank together all night.)

825
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,340
(That's why)

826
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,820
(I got stoned.)

827
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
(That's why)

828
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,940
(I just woke up.)

829
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,140
(The early bird is sleepy.)

830
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,100
(I literally passed out.)

831
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,300
(The herbs prescribed by Imperial Physicians)

832
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,660
(woke me up just now.)

833
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,220
(Good heavens!)

834
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,420
(What should I do?)

835
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,980
(We'll meet tomorrow,)

836
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,180
(but I haven't written a word.)

837
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,460
(What will Grand Princess comment on?)

838
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,060
(I haven't read any books.)

839
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,780
(How will I comment on Xu Qi'an's poems?)

840
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,980
(What to do?)

841
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:54,980
(Can we postpone it?)

842
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,900
(It's the fourth of May,)

843
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,660
(the day we scheduled to meet.)

844
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,540
(Well,)

845
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,380
(I have to go for it!)

846
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,460
Cijiu!

847
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,980
What does Princess Huaiqing usually say?

848
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,260
Write down every word.

849
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,220
- Yes.
- Yes.

850
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,660
Cijiu!

851
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,540
Tell your teachers

852
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,460
I need to use the poems for them.

853
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,260
Cijiu!

854
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,580
Cijiu!

855
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,540
My dear cousin!

856
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,020
(Knowledge from books)
(So many poems!)

857
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,460
(is shallow.)
(What should I say?)

858
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,260
(They only wrote down a few lines just now.)

859
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
Your poems

860
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,540
are brilliant.

861
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,780
(Clearly, she's impressed by my efficiency.)

862
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,740
(She spoke highly of my works.)

863
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,860
Xu Qi'an!

864
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,060
- Get back the poems!
- Relax.

865
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
Or I'll kill you with this hammer!

866
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,260
Let me go!

867
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,740
I'll kill you!

868
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,260
I'll kill you! I'll...!

869
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,460
I...!

870
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,820
Bring them back.

871
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,640
Do it.

872
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,100
Come on. You stepped hard on me.

873
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,660
Bring them back, you hear me?

874
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,060
- Or I'll kill you!
- Sure.

875
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,900
Fine.

876
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,300
You stepped on me again!

877
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,780
(Counting the days,)

878
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,440
(only three are left again.)

879
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,540
(From now on,)

880
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,340
(I must work hard!)

881
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,380
(I am)

882
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,900
(the master of my life!)

883
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,660
Princess,

884
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,900
let's kick the shuttlecock.

885
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,620
Take a break.

886
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,580
Go for a drink?

887
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,500
No!

888
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,820
(There are three days left.)

889
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,380
(Yes!)

890
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,140
(There's enough time.)

891
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,220
(Why not...?)

892
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,420
(Do it tomorrow?)

893
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,220
Wait for me!

894
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,980
Wait!

895
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,180
Let's go!

896
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,660
One, two, three,

897
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,220
Rock Paper Scissors!

898
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,860
Rock breaks scissors!

899
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,260
Scissors cut the paper!

900
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,710
Paper covers the rock!

901
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,340
(Qi'an, A+; Tingfeng, B+)
I lost!

902
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,860
Rock!

903
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,820
Hold on.

904
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,940
- Brothel?
- Yes!

905
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,620
We should've gone there earlier.

906
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,770
(Breeze Hall)

907
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,620
Silver Gong Li.

908
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,660
(Li Yuchun, Song Tingfeng, Zhu Guangxiao)

909
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,700
Chief.

910
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,980
I only gave him three days off.

911
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,340
It's been almost ten days. Where is he?

912
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,460
That rascal!

913
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,460
He...

914
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,980
He said he'd make our office better.

915
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,460
He's working on it at home.

916
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,420
It's been so long!

917
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,380
What's he working on?

918
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,540
Making pigs fly?

919
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,460
I'm ordering you

920
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,660
to go to his place now

921
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,620
and bring him here!

922
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,020
Yes, sir.

923
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,740
Mr. Li!

924
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,620
(Tao Man, Guardian, 7th Rank Fighter)

925
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,020
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

926
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,220
Thanks to your man,

927
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,460
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an,

928
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,500
we've improved our ways

929
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,020
of handling cases based on his white book.

930
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,500
You know what?

931
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,900
We're unstoppable!

932
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,140
Over the last ten days,

933
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,860
we've solved more cases than I can count.

934
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,340
Look.

935
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,460
(Speed)
The Guardians' Speed Flag.

936
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,500
It's in my hand.

937
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,260
Hey,

938
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,620
I did tell my chief

939
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,460
we did so well

940
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,580
partly because of you guys.

941
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,460
Take a look.

942
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,580
(Guardians' Solved Cases, Hall of Might)

943
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,500
(Solved the Well Case, Serial Murder,
Zhang's Bones)

944
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,420
That's so nice of you, Mr. Tao.

945
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,860
Mr. Li,

946
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,740
I heard Xu Qi'an

947
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,780
was unruly

948
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,180
and ill-willed to you.

949
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,340
How about this?

950
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,540
Transfer him to our hall.

951
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,220
I'll discipline him for you.

952
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,580
How's that?

953
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,620
No need.

954
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,460
All our members are of one heart.

955
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,580
There's no ill will among us.

956
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,940
(Breeze Hall)

957
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,420
But I heard he was

958
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,340
absent for days.

959
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,340
I told him to work from home.

960
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,620
Yes.

961
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,500
It's noisy in the office.

962
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:04,660
Some will do anything to gain merits.

963
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,340
He's still young

964
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,980
and inexperienced.

965
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,060
I don't want him

966
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,420
to be fooled by others

967
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,300
or hold back his work.

968
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,380
You're

969
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,540
so thoughtful.

970
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,630
Go.

971
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,300
What are you looking at?

972
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,420
How dare he poach people from me!

973
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,060
Chief,

974
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,940
do I still need to bring Xu Qi'an over?

975
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,300
Go back to work.

976
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,580
Got it!

977
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,740
Cijiu!

978
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,220
"There's no royal road to learning;

979
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,020
no shortcut to the mastery of any art."

980
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:04,860
Write.

981
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,340
Used it.

982
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,020
On your right cheek.

983
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,300
This one?

984
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,060
"Studying can lead to success."

985
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,140
"And happiness will follow."

986
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,420
Used it, too.

987
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,140
It's been four hours.

988
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,540
You said three lines,

989
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,060
including two used ones.

990
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,940
When will you finish the poems
for my academy?

991
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,340
Both sides want them.

992
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,260
I'm too exhausted

993
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,740
to think.

994
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,420
I need a snack break.

995
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,860
At this rate,

996
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,180
when can I go back to the Academy

997
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,060
and see my teachers?

998
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,500
The yogurt tastes good.

999
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,340
Have a spoon.

1000
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,220
Pass.

1001
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,900
Cijiu,

1002
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,620
calm down. Don't be mad.

1003
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,380
I have an idea.

1004
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,580
Ningyan,

1005
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,500
bring me to meet Grand Princess.

1006
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,420
I can be her slave.

1007
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,620
If I can make her happy,

1008
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,420
she won't ask you for poems.

1009
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,660
Then you can focus on

1010
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,020
the ones Cijiu needs for the Academy.

1011
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,940
Right?

1012
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,260
Let's continue, Cijiu.

1013
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,260
Let me think.

1014
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,620
"Read books or you'll regret it someday."

1015
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,460
Write.

1016
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,940
Used it.

1017
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,260
Ningyan!

1018
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,780
Miss Pretty came to see you?

1019
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,540
What Miss Pretty?

1020
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,300
Leave me alone. I'm busy.

1021
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,420
She's here. Look!

1022
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,500
Caiwei?

1023
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,060
Do you need me?

1024
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,900
Not me,

1025
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,260
it's Senior Song.

1026
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,900
He said he made progress

1027
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,860
on your mirror.

1028
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,140
Really?

1029
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,820
Let's go.

1030
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,940
Sure, let's go! Come on!

1031
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,900
Hey, wait! What about the poems I need?

1032
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,940
- Come back!
- Did you ride or use footwork?

1033
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,180
What do you think, Mother?

1034
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,300
Perfect!

1035
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,180
This half shows

1036
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,780
high literary attainments.

1037
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,300
Lin'an,

1038
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,540
where did you get such beautiful lines?

1039
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,460
Well, Mother,

1040
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,300
I found an aide earlier,

1041
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300
who's a great poet.

1042
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,820
I've got plenty of such masterpieces.

1043
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,740
Compared with Huaiqing's men,

1044
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,340
he's way much better.

1045
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,100
This poem is great.

1046
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,340
Lin'an,

1047
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,660
you must wow everyone at the Poetry Contest

1048
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,180
to make your brother proud.

1049
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,580
Look at you.

1050
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,020
You've lost tons of weight.

1051
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,060
My kitchen

1052
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,340
happened to make your favorite Milk Cakes.

1053
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,740
Have some.

1054
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:11,620
It's good.

1055
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:13,940
Chuntao,

1056
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,260
fetch more later

1057
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,380
for Lin'an.

1058
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,380
Yes.

1059
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,700
Thanks, Mother.

1060
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,580
Mother hasn't given me gifts for a while.

1061
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,580
She doesn't know

1062
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,380
you no longer like desserts.

1063
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,140
Still, she cares about me.

1064
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,740
Or she wouldn't give me these cakes.

1065
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,060
I should thank Xu Qi'an.

1066
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,460
He deserves rewards.

1067
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,940
Where did he go today?

1068
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,500
He stayed at home all day

1069
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,100
without going to work.

1070
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,580
According to his routine,

1071
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,860
he'd get liquor from the tavern at dusk.

1072
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,460
And Huaiqing?

1073
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:01,580
What did she do today?

1074
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,140
Today?

1075
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,740
The 25th...

1076
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,940
She'd go to the Astronomical Bureau to study.

1077
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,300
With Xu Qi'an here,

1078
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,500
I don't need to go there again.

1079
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,340
Princess!

1080
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,340
- Princess!
- Here. I'm here.

1081
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,260
Princess! Princess!

1082
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,140
What's up?

1083
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,580
Breathe before you speak.

1084
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,900
Xu Qi'an...

1085
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,500
went to the Bureau!

1086
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,500
