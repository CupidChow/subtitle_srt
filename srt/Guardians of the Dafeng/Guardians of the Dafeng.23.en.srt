40
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,030
Your Majesty,

41
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,240
he is the wanted criminal
by the court.

42
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,980
The former Baihu of the Insignia Guards,

43
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,160
Zhou Chixiong.

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,880
You rogue.

45
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,320
You've returned in glory.

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,110
I'm guilty and deserve to die.

47
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm guilty and deserve to die.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Zhou Chixiong,

49
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,390
who instructed you to collude

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,670
with the Kui to smuggle gunpowder?

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
I...

52
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,550
I...

53
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,760
I deserve to die.

54
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,880
I deserve to die.

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,990
I deserve to die.

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,680
I'll leave it to you, Master.

57
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,390
A gentleman must be sincere,

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,930
and so must an ordinary person.

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,920
Speak.

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
Who instructed you

61
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,390
to collude with the Kui

62
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,710
and smuggle gunpowder?

63
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
It was

64
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,800
the Minister...

65
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,270
The Minister of Rites,

66
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,710
Li Yulang.

67
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,710
It was Li Yulang.

68
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,670
It's him.

69
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,710
Execute him.

70
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,880
Your Majesty.

71
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,950
Your Majesty.

72
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,390
Your Majesty, this is absurd.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,640
Zhou Chixiong

74
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,040
is slandering me.

75
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Baihu Zhou

76
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,200
didn't lie.

77
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,920
He didn't lie.

78
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,320
Li Yulang,

79
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,080
what else do you have to say?

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,200
I am innocent.

81
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,550
Your Majesty.

82
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,550
This official must have

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,040
accomplices behind him.

84
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,520
Please let me interrogate him.

85
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,360
Your Majesty,

86
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,450
according to the law, this case should
be handled by the Ministry of Justice.

87
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,880
This case

88
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,400
will be investigated
by the Ministry of Justice.

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

90
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,870
Wei Yuan,

91
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,200
I will thoroughly investigate

92
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,710
Li Yulang's crimes,

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,520
but if you try to smear others,

94
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,640
that'll be a wild fantasy.

95
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,040
Hold on.

96
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,790
I've heard about the events

97
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,150
in the court recently.

98
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,000
I want to offer
a piece of advice to you:

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,390
if the Wang Faction continues
to push us,

100
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,200
next time you'll be

101
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,080
stepping on your own feet.

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,590
You little brat.

103
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,590
How dare you spout such nonsense!

104
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,320
I don't dare spout nonsense.

105
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,790
Perhaps you don't know
I'm quite skilled in poetry.

106
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,910
I'd like

107
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
to offer you a poem.

108
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,520
The title is

109
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
To Mr. Sun on the Sangbo Case.

110
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,080
A gift of poetry?

111
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,000
You don't know?

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,200
He is Yang Ling.

113
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,440
How rare to meet him.

114
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,630
Yes.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,880
Everyone raises sons

116
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,960
and wants them to be wise.

117
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,880
I was ruined by my wisdom.

118
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,320
I only wish my child

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,030
to be foolish and simple,

120
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,710
without disaster or hardship,

121
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,000
to become a public official.

122
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,390
How can you say this?

123
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,760
How rude!

124
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,590
Take him down now!

125
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,680
Take him down!

126
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,830
Mr. Sun, please calm down.

127
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,310
Wei Yuan,

128
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,640
he slandered me.

129
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,500
According to the law, he should be
exiled for cursing a minister.

130
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,630
Today,

131
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,680
even if you want to protect him,

132
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,710
you can't.

133
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,230
Slandering a minister

134
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,960
is indeed a serious crime,

135
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,590
but

136
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,320
if what he said is true,

137
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,390
then it's not slander.

138
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,230
Wei Yuan.

139
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,550
You...

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,600
Let's go now.

141
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,160
Yes.

142
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,830
Mr. Sun, congrats on your fame

143
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,760
in the world of scholars.

144
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,030
This little brat.

145
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,270
You brat...

146
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,120
- Mr. Sun.
- Mr. Sun.

147
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,590
My Lord.

148
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,580
(Rule With Virtue)

149
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,430
Lord Wei.

150
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,630
Lord Wei,

151
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,440
there is something I don't understand.

152
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,880
Is it the reason
why His Majesty

153
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,080
assigned this case
to the Ministry of Justice

154
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,870
for trial?

155
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,590
Do you know

156
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,150
that Li Yulang is a Wang member?

157
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,320
If this case is handled by us,

158
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:17,790
it'll implicate many Wang members.

159
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,550
I understand.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
At that time,
the court will be unbalanced.

161
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,640
Having one faction dominate
or two factions joining hands

162
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,440
isn't something
His Majesty wants to see.

163
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,230
They moved so soon?

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,400
Lord Wei,

165
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,710
has something happened?

166
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,170
It has nothing to do with you.

167
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,350
The Sangbo Case is over.

168
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,800
His Majesty didn't mention you,

169
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,590
which means it's been settled.

170
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
You may leave.

171
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,120
Yes.

172
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,120
Father,

173
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,470
Zhu Yang may have ill intentions
to meet His Majesty.

174
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,540
Should we be prepared
for possible trouble?

175
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,920
No need.

176
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,520
Yes.

177
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,900
(Lake Villa)

178
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,110
Mr. Xu,

179
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,230
what brings you here?

180
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,870
I saw the princess
was in low spirits last time,

181
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,970
so I thought I'd visit her.

182
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,230
The princess is in the pavilion.

183
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,590
Would you like to go and talk to her?

184
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,550
Alright.

185
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,220
(Lake Villa)

186
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,070
Your Highness,

187
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,160
it's me.

188
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
Come in.

189
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Xu Qi'an, look.

190
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,320
In the capital of the Dafeng,

191
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,440
even the sun is restrained.

192
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,800
I remember Pingyang once said

193
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
in the South, the sunset

194
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,750
could turn the whole sky red.

195
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,750
In the boundless desert,

196
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,990
one could chase the sun freely.

197
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,550
The South was

198
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,830
Princess Pingyang's destination, right?

199
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Yes.

200
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,920
These past few days,
I was wondering

201
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,830
whether it was worth it for Pingyang

202
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,110
to die for freedom.

203
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,960
Have you found an answer?

204
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,510
Not a clue.

205
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,630
It only adds to my worries.

206
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,470
Please sit.

207
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,280
I'd like to hear your opinion.

208
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,960
I dare not comment
on Princess Pingyang rashly,

209
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,350
but if I consider the situation
at that time,

210
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,830
perhaps leaving

211
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,110
was her only choice.

212
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,560
I never met her,

213
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,800
but from your description,

214
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,590
I know she was someone carefree,

215
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,870
not willing to be bound by etiquette.

216
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,230
For her,

217
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,960
marrying into the royal family
might be scarier than death.

218
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,380
What's wrong with marrying a prince?

219
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,680
You'll lead a wealthy,
luxurious, and noble life.

220
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,160
This is what many ladies dream of.

221
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,680
Then they can go and be one.

222
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,710
Anyway, I don't want to.

223
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,070
Listen.

224
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,080
Compared with marrying
a man without love

225
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,630
and being trapped in a life of pretense,

226
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,280
I'd rather die.

227
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,230
I'll help you escape the Palace.

228
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,750
You're flying!

229
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,470
- Higher!
- You're flying!

230
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
I misspoke.

231
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,750
Please forgive me.

232
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
You're right.

233
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,470
That was Pingyang's only choice.

234
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,590
It's also mine now.

235
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,710
My mother once told me

236
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,780
that to marry into the noble families,

237
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
to stabilize the court,

238
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,300
and to ease my father's worries,

239
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,800
is the destiny of a princess.

240
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm not far from that day.

241
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,830
Your Highness.

242
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,280
Now that you're here,

243
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,630
have a drink with me.

244
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,110
Your wish is my command.

245
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,630
There will be fireworks later.

246
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,400
Your Highness,

247
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,080
your fireworks are different
from the ones I've seen.

248
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,400
They're quite beautiful.

249
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,710
Xu Qi'an,

250
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,750
do you think Princess Pingyang
might not have died,

251
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,920
but instead went to another world,

252
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,510
watching fireworks with us?

253
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,190
Yes.

254
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,310
In that world,

255
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,370
there is no concept of ruler and subject

256
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,590
and of high and low.

257
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,400
Everyone is born equal.

258
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,320
There's no such thing
as parental commands

259
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,960
or arranged marriages.

260
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,990
In the sea of people,

261
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,400
if two people meet

262
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:38,870
and fall in love,

263
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,030
they can walk hand in hand for life.

264
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,990
Even if they don't meet a good match,

265
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,540
there's no need to settle
due to outside pressure.

266
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,230
Living alone is just as good.

267
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,870
You can go anywhere you want

268
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,590
and do whatever you want to do.

269
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,750
Is there really such a world?

270
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,640
Of course.

271
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,750
Not only can women live
without marrying,

272
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,110
in that world,

273
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,800
women, like men,

274
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,750
can go out, struggle,
and pursue their dreams,

275
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,110
to realize their own worth.

276
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,630
When they grow old,
they can buy a house with friends

277
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,800
and live a simple, happy life.

278
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,110
If such a world exists,

279
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,750
I really want to see it.

280
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,080
But...

281
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,590
But what?

282
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,800
But I'm not as beautiful as Pingyang.

283
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,680
I'm not as smart

284
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,350
as she is.

285
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,280
I'm not as brave as she is.

286
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,110
I can't do anything.

287
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,110
On the contrary,

288
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,630
Your Highness have many advantages.

289
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,630
You're carefree,

290
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,110
genuine,

291
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,870
and sincere toward others.

292
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
Even so,

293
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,750
I wouldn't want to leave the people
in this world.

294
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,830
I can't leave my mother,

295
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:42,230
even though she always complains
that I'm useless.

296
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,710
And my brother.

297
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,990
Every time Mother scolds me,

298
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,320
he's always the first to protect me.

299
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,040
And Father.

300
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,710
Even though I'm a useless person,

301
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,710
he still favors me.

302
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,590
And Gang.

303
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,920
And you.

304
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,990
Me too?

305
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,960
Though we haven't known each other

306
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,160
for long,

307
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,230
I really admire your nature.

308
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,990
Sometimes you're as timid as a mouse,

309
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,440
but sometimes

310
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,130
you're bold enough to defy the heavens.

311
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,360
You can write poems

312
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,160
and solve cases,

313
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,960
and you know many interesting things.

314
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,790
You also know

315
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,200
that I love the egg-yolk puff
from Shop of Delicacies.

316
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,710
Mother says they're too greasy
and doesn't let me eat them.

317
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,790
I have to sneak out of the Palace

318
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,990
to buy them myself every time.

319
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,790
How do you know?

320
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
She'll understand after seeing it.

321
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,660
(Shop of Delicacies)

322
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,960
Someone who secretly cares about you

323
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,360
told me.

324
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,790
Impossible.

325
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,310
Pingyang is dead.

326
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,510
I have no friends left.

327
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,470
Your Highness, you're drunk.

328
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,840
Your Highness, if you don't mind,

329
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,160
from now on,

330
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,920
I can be your friend.

331
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,230
I don't want to be your friend.

Your Highness, you're awake.

359
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,310
Take it slow.

360
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,360
Take it slow. How do you feel?

361
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,400
I've been sleeping here all night?

362
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
Yes.

363
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,910
Where is Xu Qi'an?

364
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,550
Xu Qi'an left before dawn.

365
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,640
He stayed with you all night yesterday

366
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,720
and

367
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,640
held your hand the whole time.

368
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,720
He...

369
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,680
He...

370
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,680
Did he take advantage of me
while I was asleep?

371
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
No, no.

372
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,120
He was keeping you warm,

373
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
driving away the cold.

374
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,440
Before he left, he specifically told me

375
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,960
that once you woke up,
you should drink this congee.

376
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,010
It helps sober you up
and warm your stomach.

377
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,550
Try it.

378
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,310
He also said

379
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,960
that he made it himself

380
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
and added some special ingredients

381
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,350
called

382
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,230
something like chicken powder.

383
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,440
It's quite tasty.

384
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,240
This little brat.

385
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,750
He always has something new.

386
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,620
(Act if you want it.)

387
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,150
Senior Yang,

388
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,510
(Guardians' Notice)
these are copied from the city gates.

389
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,120
It indeed details

390
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,680
the heroic actions of Yang Qianhuan

391
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,640
from the Astronomical Bureau
in this case.

392
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,430
It says you made a great contribution.

393
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:11,840
I suppose my fame has spread
throughout the capital.

394
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,990
Thanks to the Supervisor
for calling me back

395
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,300
(Guardians' Notice)
to make contributions.

396
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,150
My Master

397
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,160
truly didn't deceive me.

398
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,990
But

399
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,030
I'll have to be more careful

400
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,750
when I go out

401
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,470
to avoid being recognized

402
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,200
and causing unnecessary trouble.

403
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,710
There's no need for that.

404
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,070
After all,

405
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,400
no one is talking about this.

406
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,070
Why?

407
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,120
Senior Yang,

408
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,070
this is the poem.

409
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,310
Since it was spread from the court,

410
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,060
it's caused a huge stir
in the Directorate of Education

411
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,920
and Yunlu Academy.

412
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,160
It's been hailed

413
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,200
as the greatest satire poem ever.

414
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,680
Now it's spread everywhere.

415
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,550
Everyone praises Mr. Xu
as the Dafeng's conscience.

416
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,600
I only wish my child
to be foolish and simple,

417
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,750
without disaster or hardship,

418
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,230
to become a public official.

419
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,120
Why?

420
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,790
Why is it that Xu Ningyan

421
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,600
can always do things

422
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,440
that everyone envies?

423
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,470
He single-handedly solved
the Sangbo Case

424
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,790
and scolded the powerful

425
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,920
when he was beneath everyone.

426
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,270
It's not fair.

427
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,440
It's not fair.

428
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,260
It's so unfair.

429
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,520
Senior Yang,

430
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,310
are you alright?

431
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,640
I have

432
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,960
realized it.

433
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,270
I'm going to stand before the court

434
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,600
and scold the officials.

435
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,790
If Xu Ningyan is
the Dafeng's conscience,

436
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,990
then I want to be the Dafeng's light,

437
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,200
shining before the court.

438
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,440
Senior Yang, don't.

439
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,840
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

440
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,920
There is no one like me in this world.

441
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,230
Who brought me here?

442
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,170
Master, are you going to stop me?

443
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,880
You're being too impatient.

444
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,790
You said I'd be famous once I go back.

445
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,770
Why are you stopping me now?

446
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,310
The capital is full of hidden talents.

447
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,120
There's always someone better.

448
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,390
Master,

449
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,310
explain clearly.

450
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,070
I mean

451
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,990
you should hide your weaknesses.

452
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,150
I have

453
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,200
realized it.

454
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,600
What have you realized?

455
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,990
Master, are you stopping me

456
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,310
because you're afraid I'll outshine you?

457
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,600
Old man,

458
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,470
let me out!

459
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,640
Old man!

460
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,160
It's my turn.

461
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:12,960
I've just finished

462
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,920
handling a small matter.

463
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,460
Your Highness, please forgive me.

464
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,790
Supervisor, your chess skills

465
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,120
aren't as good as before.

466
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,280
But

467
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,360
your ability to judge people

468
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,510
is still as sharp as ever.

469
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,990
Xu Qi'an

470
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,880
did solve the case.

471
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,790
He didn't fail you.

472
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,270
First, you let me introduce him
to the Guardians,

473
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,710
and you guided him step by step

474
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,710
to solve the Sangbo Case.

475
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,070
But

476
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,440
isn't that a bit too early?

477
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,790
I have no other choice.

478
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,120
The Nine Pass is full of villains.

479
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,960
Only in this way

480
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,680
can he fight

481
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,070
with them.

482
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,640
As you say, Supervisor.

483
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,600
But there is one thing.

484
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,070
Unless absolutely necessary,

485
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,510
don't involve Lin'an.

486
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,200
You're right, Your Highness.

487
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,600
I'll remember that.

488
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,830
Good move.

489
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:36,900
(Xu Mansion)

490
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,870
Honey,

491
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,030
have you told Cijiu that we've moved?

492
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,870
Don't worry.

493
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,600
Ningyan is reliable.

494
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,920
He must've written to the Academy.

495
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,920
Welcome.

496
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,310
Congratulations.

497
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,310
You're here.

498
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,200
Yes, now your family

499
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,440
has two talents.

500
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,470
From now on,

501
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,880
you'll live a life
of endless wealth and honor.

502
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,540
- No.
- This is a perfect gift

503
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,710
(Nourishing Cream)
for you.

504
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,500
Try this cream.
It's perfect for your skin.

505
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,130
Your skin will be as smooth and bright

506
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,870
as white jade.

507
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,270
Thanks. This is really good.

508
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,510
Wealth and honor are beyond our reach.

509
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,230
We're just getting by.

510
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,160
Getting by?

511
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,550
You call this getting by?

512
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,160
Look at the house you chose.

513
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,230
It's quiet yet convenient,

514
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,510
a perfect retreat.

515
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,230
Living here must be comfortable.

516
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,270
Come on.

517
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,840
It's quite secluded.

518
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,400
From East City to West City,

519
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,920
the coachman took an hour to find here.

520
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,790
I got dizzy

521
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,030
from all the turning.

522
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,600
If you don't feel well,

523
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,790
you should go rest

524
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,920
and eat something.

525
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,680
Never mind. I'm not hungry.

526
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,120
I had a bird's nest and snow frog stew
for breakfast.

527
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,310
It hasn't been digested yet.

528
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,030
Don't let her get to you.

529
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,790
Her husband used to work
in the Ministry of Rites.

530
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,160
Because of the Sangbo Case,

531
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,330
he's still detained
in the Ministry of Justice.

532
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,310
How could she be in the mood
to eat anything?

533
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,120
It's just a routine inquiry.

534
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,880
He'll be back in a few days.

535
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,550
Didn't you just tell me

536
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,260
that this time he's in trouble,

537
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,790
and you were trying to ask Xu Ningyan

538
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,200
to intercede for him?

539
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,920
Ridiculous.

540
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:09,120
Xu Ningyan is just a Copper Gong.

541
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,680
He can't possibly

542
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,550
have a say in such a matter.

543
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,920
The Guardians are here.

544
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,820
(Xu Mansion)

545
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,750
Mr. Yang, Mr. Nangong.

546
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,990
Sorry for the improper welcome.

547
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Mr. Xu,

548
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,610
on behalf of the Guardians,

549
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,880
we're here to congratulate you
on moving to a new house.

550
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,470
Thank you.

551
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,440
It's truly an honor

552
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,790
for our family to have you here.

553
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,470
We're truly honored.

554
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,840
Where is Lord Wei?

555
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,470
Lord Wei said he'd come.

556
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,710
Lord Wei is busy,

557
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,680
so he asked us to come

558
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,510
and congratulate you on his behalf.

559
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,750
We understand.

560
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,710
Everyone,

561
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,920
please, come inside.

562
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,400
We still have matters to attend to,

563
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,160
so we won't trouble you further.

564
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,440
- Goodbye.
- Safe travels.

565
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,160
- Congrats, Mr. Xu.
- Thank you.

566
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
Congratulations, Mrs. Xu.

567
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,030
Thank you.

568
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,510
You don't have

569
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,750
to bring so many things.

570
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,020
It's a bit embarrassing.

571
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,130
We've delivered the gifts,

572
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,880
so we'll take our leave now.

573
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,600
- Why not stay for a meal?
- No, no.

574
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
We've prepared everything.

575
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,940
Why not eat here?

576
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,840
You...

577
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
Let's go back.

578
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,800
Thank you.

579
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,240
Take care.

580
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,280
Ru.

581
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,910
Ru.

582
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,230
- Take care.
- You...

583
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,200
Come and visit often.

584
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,160
I didn't expect Ningyan to have
such great influence.

585
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,720
Why not

586
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:16,120
ask Ningyan to intercede for my husband?

587
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,070
To be honest,

588
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,070
that's the very reason I'm here today.

589
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,600
There are too many to count.

590
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,310
Note everything.

591
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,440
Don't make a mistake.

592
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,270
Yes. Note everything.

593
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,640
Write Lord Wei's name down.

594
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,960
I'll show you around.

595
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,040
Ru,

596
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,880
we're friends after all.

597
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,880
Ru, can you talk to him for me?

598
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,840
Let me introduce you.

599
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,660
(Lake Villa)

600
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,540
Wait, what?

601
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,230
The princess went on a long journey?

602
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,120
It's been days now.

603
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,900
The Noble Consort approved it?

604
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,990
No.

605
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,840
The princess sneaked away at night,

606
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,160
only leaving a letter behind.

607
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,970
The Palace is in chaos right now.

608
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,710
Noble Consort Chen said

609
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,710
if they found out who instigated
the princess,

610
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,360
they wouldn't spare them.

611
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,920
Gang, remember this.

612
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,440
If anyone asks about that night,

613
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,840
tell them we were just
having a casual chat

614
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,880
about poetry.

615
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,470
- There was nothing else.
- Understood.

616
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,880
The princess's departure
has nothing to do with me.

617
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,270
Understood.

618
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:31,640
Did the princess leave any words behind?

619
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,200
The princess said thank you.

620
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,750
It was thanks to your encouragement

621
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,920
that she decided to go

622
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,880
in search of what her heart desires.

623
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,510
(Xu Qi'an,)

624
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,600
(you're right.)

625
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,790
(I should act if I want to.)

626
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,640
(Rather than pitying myself)

627
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,750
(and hesitating,)

628
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,460
(it's better to act with determination.)

629
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,030
(I will go in place of Pingyang)

630
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,710
(to see this vast world,)

631
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,160
(fulfill her long-cherished dream,)

632
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,120
(and also find)

633
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,640
(my freedom in this world.)

634
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,140
(Dear Master,)

635
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,310
(the Sangbo Case is settled,)

636
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,070
(causing a huge stir in the court.)

637
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,640
(The officials are in a state of panic.)

638
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,630
(Everything)

639
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,270
(has gone as our Kui hoped.)

640
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,880
(After this battle,)

641
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,840
(Wei Yuan has been staying indoors.)

642
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,230
(Recently,)

643
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,030
(he hasn't even attended
court meetings.)

644
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,120
(In reality,)

645
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,200
(he's been sending his Gold Gongs)

646
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,160
(to search along Mount Dahuang.)

647
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,510
(Several of our Kui's outposts)

648
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,340
(were raided by the Guardians,)

649
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,510
(and the damage was severe.)

650
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,070
(You were right.)

651
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,600
(To deal with the Dafeng,)

652
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,310
(we must first remove Wei Yuan.)

653
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,550
(Otherwise,)

654
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,070
(our Kui will never rise.)

655
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,400
(As for the Supervisor,)

656
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,600
(he still claims to be bedridden
and stays indoors.)

657
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,990
(He's a 1st Rank powerhouse
in the world.)

658
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:16,230
(He just wanted to sit on the fence
on the Sangbo matter.)

659
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,990
(You were right.)

660
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,270
(The Supervisor must've seen
through our plan long ago,)

661
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,160
(but he has kept silent
about the whereabouts)

662
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,780
(of the demonic hand)

663
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,850
(as if he's waiting for something.)

664
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,050
(As for the controller
of the demonic hand,)

665
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,000
(according to your orders,)

666
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,480
(we have temporarily formed
an alliance with him.)

667
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,750
(Now,)

668
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,120
(the demonic hand has been
taken away as planned)

669
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,160
(and has gone along
with the tax silver to Yunzhou.)

670
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,390
(He insisted on not acting
in the capital,)

671
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:46,580
(seemingly waiting
for something as well.)

672
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,960
(By the way, Master,)

673
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,960
(Xu Qi'an has now been promoted
to a Silver Gong of the Guardians.)

674
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,190
(The court sent him to Yunzhou
to trace the tax silver.)

675
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,990
(This is no coincidence.)

676
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,400
(Perhaps, as you predicted,)

677
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,840
(Xu Qi'an is the key
to that person's plan.)

678
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,270
(Settled)
(I'll continue investigating Xu Qi'an.)

679
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,240
(In three months,)

680
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,470
(everything)

681
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,590
(will be settled.)

682
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,180
(Three months later)

683
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,820
(Yunzhou)

684
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,630
Enemy attack!

685
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:34,920
Brothers,

686
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,110
let's kill our way out!

687
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,770
- Kill!
- Kill!

688
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,190
I'm Guardian Silver Gong Xu Qi'an,

689
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,960
ordered to investigate the tax silver.

690
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,110
Anyone who obstructs shall be killed.

691
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,070
Kill them!

Remember, tie them up tightly.

714
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,840
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

715
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,470
My Lord, the rebel leader
has been executed,

716
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,230
and the remaining rebels
have been captured.

717
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,390
My Lord,

718
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,280
we got 134,500 liang,

719
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,720
plus the rebels' ordnance and the loss.

720
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,840
They're all here

721
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
for you to review.

722
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,360
Here is the confiscated tax silver.

723
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,510
Please inspect it.

724
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,800
Warehouse the tax silver now,

725
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,800
and imprison the rebels.

726
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,760
Make sure it's done.

727
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,470
- Yes!
- Yes!

728
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,880
Mr. Xu's orders:

729
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,280
Warehouse the tax silver,

730
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,440
and imprison the rebels.

731
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,670
Make sure it's done.

732
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,650
- Yes!
- Yes!

733
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,320
Move faster.

734
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,760
Watch out. The ropes.

735
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,160
Move!

736
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,310
Hurry up!

737
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,670
I'm drenched in sweat.

738
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,960
Come on, bro.

739
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,920
We must have drinks tonight.

740
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,030
Bro, to help you
establish your prestige,

741
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,920
I haven't drunk for three months.

742
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,320
I couldn't help it. We were on duty.

743
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
I've been suffering too.

744
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,240
I understand.

745
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,920
I've booked a private room.

746
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,150
I'll treat you tonight.

747
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,960
We'll drink the best and enjoy tonight.

748
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,440
Guangxiao,
let's go check the tax silver.

749
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,280
Okay.

750
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,430
Let's go.

751
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,880
(The talisman isn't working.)

752
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,240
(It seems the Qi force...)

753
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,670
Xu Qi'an.

754
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,400
(Where am I?)

755
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,360
Zhou Li?

756
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,990
Xu Qi'an.

757
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,880
Do you admit your crimes?

758
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,990
Xu Qi'an.

759
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,720
Prepare to die.

760
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,960
Xu Qi'an.

761
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,760
Xu Qi'an,

762
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,960
