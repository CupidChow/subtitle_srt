00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,520
The meaning of life is

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,750
a broad concept.

42
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,160
Life is meaningful per se.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,670
I came.

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,720
I did.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,190
I had.

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,520
Whether you succeed or fail,

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,190
isn't your life

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,870
meaningful per se?

49
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,110
Also...

50
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,710
Who are you?

51
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,390
This is my life.

52
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,760
Who are you to interfere?

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,240
Who are you to judge it?

54
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,360
People's lives are different.

55
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,760
We live in our own ways.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,270
If everyone copies yours,

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
all living in the same way,

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,590
that kind of life is meaningless.

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,870
We define our own lives.

60
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,230
Listen,

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,830
don't think you're so good by asking me

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,800
pretentious questions with a long face.

63
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,430
If you really are good,

64
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,270
then tell me,

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,150
what's the meaning of your life?

66
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,360
You don't know, do you?

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,590
So shut up and listen.

68
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,670
I'm so sick of your...

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,320
Hold on.

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640

71
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,550

Don't leave.

75
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,550
We'll continue

76
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,760
in my next life.

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
- Director!
- Do CPR!

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,390
- Got it.
- Yes.

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,430
- Mr. Yang, stay put.
- Don't go!

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,550
- Sir, lie down.
- Carry on in my next life!

81
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,590
Hey, Ku,

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,520
where was I?

83
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,800
The meaning of life.

84
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Yes, right.

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,320
I've figured it out.

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
The meaning of my life is to come here

87
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,990
to scold you!

88
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,430
Did you have nothing to do in Tianyu
that you came

89
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,150
to the Dafeng to find the meaning of life?

90
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,960
Go back to find it in Tianyu.

91
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,670
You asked me about the meaning of life.

92
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,910
I want to ask you something.

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,870
What's the meaning of work?

94
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,710
What's the meaning of eating?

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,520
What's the meaning of love?

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,480
Think it over.

97
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm dying again.

98
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Nurse!

99
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,560

100
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,200
- Mr. Yang,
- Don't go.

101
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,000
- stay put.
- Carry on in my next life.

103
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,350
have you figured it out?

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,270
What's the meaning of love?

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Answer me.

106
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,350
Wait. Have you never been in love?

107
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, Ku,

108
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,830
you really are a poor boy!

109
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,230
Du'e.

111
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,560

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,200
Also no?

113
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,000
I feel bad for you two.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,960
You have a nice mustache.

115
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,320
Girls don't like you?

116
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,910
You don't even know love.

117
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,200
Forget about life!

118
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,830
You know nothing!

119
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,520
I'm dying again.

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,270
We'll continue in my next life.

don't use your rules

deal with our own sorrow and regrets.

186

Just take things as they come.

Whether we smile or cry,

188
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,350
we'll have to face it.

189
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,030
Aren't we all having regrets

190
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,350
while striding forward in life?

191
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,400
I can tell you the meaning of my life.

192
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,510
Now,

193
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,110
that

194
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,870
is to

195
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,070
have

196
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,710
you...

197
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
broken...

198
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,070
apart!

199
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,060
Apart!

200
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,630
It's broken!

201
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,160
Tianyu

202
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,630
lost.

203
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
We won.

204
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,830
We won, Father!

205
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,830
We won!

206
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,990
Top Poet Xu's skills are divine.

207
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,110
He's the best in the world!

208
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,080
The Dafeng is the only legitimate polity.

209
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,830
We're the greatest power in the world!

210
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,630
Ningyan!

211
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,560
Ningyan won!

212
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,200
I knew it. That's my nephew,

213
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
right?

214
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,200
I... 200 liang of silver!

215
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,680
200 liang of silver a year,

216
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,750
Pingzhi!

217
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,200
Ningyan is an extraordinary talent.

218
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,960
My nephew is the best!

219
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,080
When can I be as great as him?

220
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,230
Calm down.

221
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,800
My nephew is brilliant.

222
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,160
Wei Yuan has gained another warrior.

223
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
He was always mediocre,

224
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,830
but he made it this time.

225
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,320
I knew Ningyan was able to win.

226
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,830
Still, he's slightly

227
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,440
inferior to you.

228
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,040
Simu.

229
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
Xinnian.

230
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,960
Xu Qi'an

231
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,350
defeated Tianyu with a saber alone.

232
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,200
Did he win with Supervisor's help in secret?

233
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,960
This duel wasn't about cultivation.

234
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,560
An ordinary man's bravery

235
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,510
could take the enemy unawares.

236
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,110
Am I right?

237
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,400
Supervisor, you made the right choice.

238
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,680
Xu Qi'an!

239
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
Lin'an...

240
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,750
Help him, Loong!

241
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,160
You're awake.

242
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,800
Dean Zhao,

243
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,110
why am I...

244
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,640
Here?

245
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
The knife in your hand

246
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,560
is most cherished by the Academy.

247
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,200
You've been holding it.

248
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,110
No one could draw it out.

249
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,560
That's why you were

250
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,710
brought back here.

251
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,320
Thank you, Dean.

252
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,060
(Second Sage's Hall)

253
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,510
Did it belong to the Second Sage?

254
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
That's right.

255
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,750
Ever since he passed away,

256
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,230
his knife

257
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,990
has been quiet for over 1,000 years.

258
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,710
Is Mr. Xu awake?

259
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,470
His Majesty sent me to check on him.

260
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,200
Greetings, Dean Zhao.

261
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,830
Mr. Xu,

262
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,470
it's great to see you awake.

263
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,040
His Majesty needs to ask you something.

264
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,110
Zhao Shou?

265
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,560
Your Majesty,

266
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
Dean Zhao said

267
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,710
if the Yunlu Academy could

268
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,280
resist Tianyu 400 years ago,

269
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,960
so can it now.

270
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,990
Did he activate the Second Sage's Knife?

271
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
He said the masters joined hands

272
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,510
and activated it together.

273
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,870
As for the Loong,

274
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,470
the activated knife

275
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,680
brought back the Second Sage's energy,

276
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,920
so...

277
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,800
What did Supervisor say?

278
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,830
Your Majesty,

279
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
Supervisor

280
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,110
agreed with their sayings.

281
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,320
What about Xu Qi'an?

282
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,350
Did he say anything?

283
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,440
Mr. Xu said,

284
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,470
"I wouldn't dare take credit

285
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,830
for breaking the Dharma.

286
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,280
I'd appreciate it

287
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,230
if His Majesty

288
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,510
could grant me a reward."

289
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,680
I didn't know you helped me.

290
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,470
Tianyu was provoking our state.

291
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,750
The Academy couldn't sit and do nothing.

292
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,920
While the energy lingers,

293
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,710
I'm going to meditate
at the Second Sage's Hall.

294
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,080
Mr. Xu,

295
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,560
make yourself at home.

296
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,160
Dean,

297
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,680
I have one more question.

298
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,510
The Dafeng holds a galaxy of talents.

299
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,440
Wouldn't it be better if the Academy
and the Bureau fought together?

300
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,920
Why choose me of all people?

301
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,920
There are many talents,

302
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,470
but as for those

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,470
who're close to the two sides,

304
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,230
other than you,

305
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,070
is there anyone else?

306
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,440
Thanks for your appreciation.

307
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,880
How long did I sleep?

308
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,620
(Second Sage's Hall)

309
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,960
I see that you chose him.

310
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,230
So did the Second Sage, right?

311
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,470
He could awaken the knife

312
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,600
and command the Power of All.

313
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,840
Clearly, he owns the great fortune of humans.

314
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,200
No one would be better than him.

315
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,840
I chose him not for his great fortune.

316
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,360
The real reason that Xu Qi'an won

317
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
was because of his personality.

318
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
He's extraordinarily persistent,

319
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,440
but he's also an ordinary man.

320
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,200
This mission is vital.

321
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,160
However talented he is,

322
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,470
he remains inexperienced.

323
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,710
He doesn't know what lies ahead of him.

324
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
Can he take

325
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,710
this huge responsibility?

326
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,790
One lapse can

327
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,300
plunge the Yunlu Academy

328
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,980
and even the world

329
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,900
into dire straits.

330
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,780
When a storm comes,

331
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,380
heroes will rise from chaos.

332
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,260
That's the universal law.

333
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,060
Now that he's emerged,

334
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,180
I believe that day will come soon.

335
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,340
What we old geezers can do

336
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,660
is be his shield for now.

337
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,380
I'm concerned about his great fortune.

338
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
After all,

339
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,540
it belongs to the Dafeng royalty.

340
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,540
Now,

341
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,260
he's in the capital

342
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,500
and right under His Majesty's nose.

343
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,140
Are you sure he won't find out?

344
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,460
As you said,

345
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,140
we old geezers will be his shield.

346
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,780
If Yuanjing means to touch him,

347
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,180
he'll have to think it through.

348
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Master said

349
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,250
you were thinking too much.

350
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,540
If Xu Qi'an carried royalty's fortune,

351
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,780
she'd know instantly

352
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,620
and tell you about it.

353
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,140
What if someone

354
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,380
helped him conceal it?

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,660
Conceal fortune?

356
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,620
As far as I know,

357
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,340
those who can achieve that

358
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,620
are less than three in the Dafeng.

359
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,980
None of them

360
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,540
would dare defy you, Your Majesty.

361
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,820
You're supported by everyone.

362
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,100
You were chosen by heaven.

363
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,700
Why not

364
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,580
stop troubling yourself,

365
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,300
Your Majesty?

366
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,620
Maybe I was thinking too much.

367
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,540
Alright.

368
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,660
Enough of that.

369
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,940
The State Preceptor is watching

370
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,300
the Dafeng for me

371
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,660
even in closed cultivation.

372
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm pleased and grateful.

373
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,220
I'll relay your gratitude

374
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,660
to my master.

375
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,980
Am I thinking too much,

376
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,620
or is the State Preceptor

377
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,940
lying to me as well?

378
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,620
Your Majesty,

379
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,580
you've had a long day.

380
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,140
Don't exhaust yourself.

381
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,460
Why not take a break?

382
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,540
What reward did Xu Qi'an want?

383
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,700
He wanted

384
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,300
the rank of viscount.

385
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,500
Although he won the duel,

386
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,340
he wouldn't have had this chance

387
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,980
without your appreciation.

388
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,940
Rewarding him with some valuables

389
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,460
is already

390
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,820
too great an honor to him.

391
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,380
The rank of nobility

392
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,820
can't be granted easily.

393
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,420
He did

394
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,500
overreach himself.

395
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,060
Grant his wish.

396
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,180
Yes.

397
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,780
Summon

398
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
the tri-ministries to the Palace.

399
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,900
Tell them

400
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,980
I've selected

401
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,340
the Lead Investigator

402
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,700
of the bloodshed.

403
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,140
Yes.

404
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,300
(Even if I'm paranoid,)

405
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,380
(I can't keep you alive,)

406
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,340
(Xu Qi'an.)

407
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,660
Lord Wei,

408
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
Dean Zhao said

409
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,220
I was chosen

410
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,060
because

411
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,620
I was the only one close to the Yunlu Academy

412
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,660
and the Bureau.

413
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,180
There was no one else.

414
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,300
What do you think?

415
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,460
If you ask me,

416
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,780
Supervisor was sure

417
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,460
that we'd win the duel.

418
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,580
Whoever was there to fight

419
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,820
would gain merits.

420
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,500
I serve under you.

421
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,900
He recommended me

422
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,180
to do you a favor as a friendly gesture.

423
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,380
Serve tea.

424
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,180
(Shaoyin Palace)

425
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,340
How did it go?

426
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,940
Your Highness, your mother said your action

427
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,340
of breaking into the Academy

428
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,850
provoked much discussion in the Palace.

429
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,340
To prevent more rumors, you're grounded.

430
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,180
No negotiation.

431
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,580
Not even a walk outside?

432
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,340
Everyone knows that's not what you'd do.

433
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,260
You want to see Mr. Xu.

434
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,100
I...

435
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Yes, so what?

436
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,060
My guest adviser won honor for the state,

437
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,180
but I'm not sure if he's still alive.

438
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,860
Can't I be worried?

439
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,980
Come.

440
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,660
The guards are watching me closely.

441
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,620
I can't get out,

442
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,700
but you're free.

443
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,180
From now on,

444
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,540
you're Princess Lin'an

445
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,620
while I'm Gang.

446
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,220
Let's swap our clothes
and disguise ourselves.

447
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,660
When the guards change shifts,

448
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,020
I can sneak out from the back door.

449
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,620
No, Your Highness.

450
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,380
It's too risky.

451
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,180
I'll only take a quick peek from afar.

452
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,860
Just one peek!

453
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,340
Once I'm sure he's fine,

454
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,210
I'll come back.

455
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,180
No one will find out.

456
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,860
But if someone finds out

457
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,220
and reports it to your mother,

458
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,060
I'll be severely punished.

459
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,940
You say no to everything.

460
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,380
What else can I do?

461
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,740
Am I nice to you?

462
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,220
Yes...

463
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,110
No...

464
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,580
- Yes!
- Good.

465
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,540
Play me for a few days.

466
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,020
No, just half a day.

467
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,580
A few hours are enough.

468
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,780
I'll be quick.

469
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,980
Your Highness! Your Highness!

470
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,140
News came in from the outside.

471
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,620
Mr. Xu has woken up!

472
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,660
Really?

473
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,300
A fine Tianyu saber

474
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,460
made by Zhu Maogong.

475
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,860
Worth at least 800 liang.

476
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,620
(Wang Simu)

477
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,380
From the new Minister of Rites.

478
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,580
An emerald hairpin.

479
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,300
Given its quality,

480
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,740
it's only worth...

481
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,860
about 200 liang.

482
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,740
But there are 12 of them,

483
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,900
worth at least 2,000 liang.

484
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,740
Let me see.

485
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,140
From the Minister of War's wife.

486
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,020
This drawing...

487
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,260
is a treasure.

488
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,780
It should be a real masterpiece
by the late artist Gu Yunzhi,

489
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,500
the top of the Four Dafeng Artists.

490
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,700
It must be priceless.

491
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,940
Easy. Simu gave it to me.

492
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,460
It's different from those gifts.

493
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,300
Good.

494
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,660
Very good.

495
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,260
Very well!

496
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,140
Excellent.

497
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,540
While I was away in the last few days,

498
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,300
our family

499
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,820
underwent great changes.

500
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,100
Who gave you that screen?

501
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,220
The Minister of Works had it made earlier.

502
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,020
Ever since I broke the Dharma,

503
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,020
you all have more or less benefited from it.

504
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,020
That's true.

505
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,820
Thanks to you, Ningyan,

506
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,380
the Xu Clan has gained great honor.

507
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,660
You're our hero!

508
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,220
Father, not just our hero.

509
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,140
He's also the hero of the Dafeng.

510
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
- Right.
- Of course.

511
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,020
Ningyan has made me proud, too.

512
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,500
I could sit with others.

513
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,780
Great job, Ningyan.

514
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,380
All of you took it for granted

515
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,900
that you deserved those gifts

516
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,420
and completely forgot about your "hero".

517
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
When I woke up,

518
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,900
none of you was there.

519
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,020
Lingyue,

520
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,620
is the chicken stew still on the stove?

521
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,380
Yes, to welcome Ningyan back home.

522
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,940
Hold on!

523
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,540
Aunt and Lingyue

524
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,660
couldn't visit

525
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,100
a man alone.

526
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,860
I forgive you two.

527
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,820
As for you guys...

528
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,940
Uncle,

529
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,540
I'm your nephew by blood!

530
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,980
And you, Cijiu.

531
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
You study at the Yunlu Academy.

532
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,660
I was there, unconscious, for days.

533
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,300
How could you leave me there alone?

534
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,700
Are we still family?

535
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,740
Ningyan,

536
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,980
you were wrong about us.

537
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,340
After you fainted, we were worried.

538
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,980
We followed Dean Zhao to the Academy

539
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,020
to look after you,

540
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,980
but someone else beat us to it.

541
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,980
When we arrived,

542
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,420
Princess Lin'an

543
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,420
was right behind us.

544
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,820
Dean Zhao, Dean Zhao,

545
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,100
you brought him back,

546
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,020
so you could save his life, right?

547
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

548
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,020
Mr. Xu fainted

549
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,380
simply because

550
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,740
he exhausted his energy.

551
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,980
He'll be fine

552
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,340
after a few days of rest.

553
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,700
Please follow me.

554
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,180
After you.

555
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,100
She couldn't stop worrying

556
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,420
until she heard you'd be fine.

557
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,380
Then we went to check on you.

558
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,460
Allow me.

559
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,570

Allow me.

569
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,860
Sure.

570
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,700
It was like that.

571
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,420
We meant to take care of you,

572
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,180
but with Princess Lin'an there,

573
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,820
there was nothing we could do.

574
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,580
Later,

575
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,500
she sent us away, saying she could

576
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,720
look after you alone.

577
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
So,

578
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
Lin'an was there.

579
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,980
How come I didn't see her?

580
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,300
She looked after you for two days and nights,

581
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,300
but that was

582
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,860
improper after all.

583
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,740
That's right.

584
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,660
Get out.

585
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,140
- Mother...
- Lin'an!

586
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,100
Ouch!

587
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,820
Lin'an,

588
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,780
you're a princess,

589
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,020
an unmarried princess.

590
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,260
Here you're looking after a single man,

591
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,100
and you...

592
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,300
were lying next to him.

593
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,460
That was indecent.

594
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,140
If words get out, who will marry you?

595
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,260
Mother,

596
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,180
he's my guest adviser

597
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,420
and a national hero.

598
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,340
As a princess,

599
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,500
I should wait for him

600
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
to wake up and make sure he's fine

601
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,500
for our relationship and his merits.

602
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,340
Mother,

603
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,580
Lin'an,

604
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,380
I'll have others stay with him.

605
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,420
Don't worry.

606
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,780
But you shouldn't be here.

607
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,380
Mother,

608
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,540
I'll take her back.

609
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,900
How is he?

610
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,460
Dean Zhao said

611
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,780
he'd be fine.

612
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,420
I see.

613
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,980
I heard she was brought back and rounded.

614
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,980
I wonder how she's doing.

615
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,060
Ningyan,

616
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,220
that was all because of you!

617
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,260
(Shaoyin Palace)

618
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,940
- Really?
- Absolutely.

619
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,460
Our men said Mr. Xu was in fine fig.

620
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,820
He went to the Guardian Yamen

621
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,980
and then headed home.

622
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,980
And

623
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,300
there's better news.

624
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,060
Better news?

625
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,940
On my way back just now,

626
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,300
I saw Eunuch Yang

627
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,740
rushing to the Hanlin Academy.

628
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,020
Turns out, he went there

629
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,780
to have them draft an edict to reward Mr. Xu.

630
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,940
It's

631
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,140
a big reward!

632
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,940
What is it? Say it!

633
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,380
You may take a guess.

634
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,340
Don't leave me hanging.

635
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,820
I heard he asked for it himself,

636
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,140
the rank of viscount.

637
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,780
The rank of viscount?

638
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,860
Yes.

639
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,340
His Majesty has granted it.

640
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,500
Good choice.

641
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,740
Smart choice.

642
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,580
I'm not blabbering.

643
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,980
Actually,

644
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,780
I asked for this rank for you, Cijiu.

645
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,860
For me?

646
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,900
At first,

647
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,220
I also didn't understand

648
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,180
until Princess Lin'an enlightened me.

649
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,060
If our family wants to keep a foothold,

650
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,180
my relationship with the two princesses

651
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,820
is not enough.

652
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,580
The rank of viscount

653
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,900
isn't about power.

654
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,740
Do you know what it's about?

655
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,060
It's about...

656
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,740
honor and social status.

657
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,860
Wrong.

658
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,660
You silly boy.

659
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,260
With that rank, you and Simu

660
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,700
will be matched in terms of status.

661
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,260
Ningyan...

662
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,420
That's the best I can do for you.

663
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,100
But you guys

664
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,100
are a disappointment,

665
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,540
taking so many gifts from others.

666
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,860
Give me that.

667
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,660
The saber.

668
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,620
You were happy,

669
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,020
but you forgot I'm a Guardian.

670
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,380
These gifts are too expensive.

671
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,940
What should I tell Lord Wei?

672
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,700
Did you consider I'd be impeached?

673
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Now, I have to go to the Haoqi Tower

674
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,220
to register all of them.

675
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,580
Forget about the rank

676
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,900
or the impeachment.

677
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,660
It doesn't matter.

678
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,420
Father embarrassed

679
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,980
our entire family at the Star Tower.

680
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,980
What's that supposed to mean?

681
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,660
How did I embarrass our family?

682
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,700
Other than greeting Lord Wei briefly,

683
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,580
I was watching you battling the Dharma.

684
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,180
What did I do wrong?

685
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,140
Do you know who sat next to you?

686
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,100
Who was it?

687
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,180
I saw an old man.

688
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,460
An old man?

689
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,180
That was Simu's father,

690
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,740
Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen!

691
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,780
You know what?

692
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,820
Prime Minister Wang is

693
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,620
my future in-law.

694
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,500
Are you alright?

695
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,420
Slow down. Don't choke on it.

696
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,500
Can you hear

697
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,980
what they're saying?

698
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,140
Sounds like a girl took good care

699
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,620
of Ningyan at the Academy.

700
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,900
A girl?

701
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,260
The one who brought him herbs
before the duel?

702
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,420
What a shame.

703
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,540
We missed her.

704
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,980
She must be from a prominent family, too.

705
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,700
Otherwise, she couldn't have

706
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,420
been so generous.

707
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,380
You're so sharp, Mother.

708
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,140
Her family is indeed prominent.

709
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,820
What does her father do?

710
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,380
Is he also an official?

711
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,180
Yes.

712
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,340
His rank must also

713
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,580
be high.

714
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,140
Quite high.

715
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
How high is quite high?

716
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,060
Let me put it this way.

717
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,740
Father is an Imperial Guard

718
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,900
of the 7th Rank.

719
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,860
You know that, right?

720
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,860
Of course.

721
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,780
Her father is above him

722
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,860
by seven ranks.

723
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,220
By seven ranks?

724
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
By seven ranks?

725
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,220
By seven ranks!

726
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,060
A princess!

727
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,900
Well...

728
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,100
I... I didn't know who he was.

729
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,460
You can't punish me for ignorance.

730
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,580
That old man didn't seem to be petty, anyway.

731
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,700
How about this?

732
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,820
I'll explain it to him.

733
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,020
No, Father.

734
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,260
You cannot go.

735
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,380
You'll be helping me if you don't do worse.

736
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,180
I won't do worse!

737
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,380
Maybe we'll have a good chat.

738
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,740
No discord, no concord.

739
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
Do you know what you are?

740
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,140
You're old and ignorant.

741
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,780
Old and ignorant, you say?

742
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
Is that how you should talk to your father?

743
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,060
- Come here!
- No.

744
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,700
We need to talk. Come here!

745
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,570
- Wait...
- Let's go!

746
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,140
How does it make a different?

747
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,620
One Chop to Kill...

748
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,700
All!

749
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,740
Hey...

750
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,500
I find you quite familiar.

751
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,500
Can you tell me

752
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
who I am?

753
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,820
It's as it should be.

754
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,340
What...

755
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,180
what was...

756
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
what was that?

757
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,460
It was what you went through.

758
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,100
What I went through...

759
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,300
What I went through...

760
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,420
I seemed...

761
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,460
I seemed...

762
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,780
I seemed...

763
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,540
to be divided into many parts.

764
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,660
That girl...

765
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,740
Who was that girl?

766
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,500
The Sovereign.

767
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,700
The Sovereign, right?

768
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,580
She seemed so familiar.

769
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,820
Can you tell me

770
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,660
who I am?

771
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,500
Not now.

772
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,020
Your primordial spirit is incomplete.

773
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,060
Once it's fully recovered,

774
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,540
you'll remember everything.

775
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,820
Recover...

776
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Incomplete...

777
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,260
Where am I?

778
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Did I make myself clear?

779
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,100
Yes.

780
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,620
How did you know

781
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,060
Shen Shu was inside me?

782
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,140
Do you mean

783
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,700
Shen Shu is

784
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,620
living in a man called Xu Qi'an?

785
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,340
But even so,

786
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,100
why did you come to tell us?

787
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,140
There's something else in him

788
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,860
that belongs to me.

789
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,140
A trade?

790
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,860
Yes.

791
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,260
Shen Shu is yours.

792
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,460
Xu Qi'an

793
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,140
is mine.

794
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,340
Master,

795
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,780
who was that man in black?

796
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,220
He's formidable.

797
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,500
What we know for sure is that

798
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,500
he's a Hypnotizer of The Witcher's Sect.

799
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,780
He told us about Shen Shu

800
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
to

801
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,420
force us to battle Supervisor

802
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,660
so that he could take you away.

803
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,940
We'll entrust

804
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,140
Shen Shu to you.

805
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
To me?

806
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,940
He's well recovered,

807
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,500
and he'll reappear soon.

808
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,860
He'll

809
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,260
fulfill his duty.

810
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,180
That's all

811
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
thanks to your fortune.

812
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,420
It nourished him.

813
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,020
So is that man in black

814
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,060
coveting my fortune?

815
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,300
Here's a friendly reminder.

816
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,020
Before Shen Shu reemerges,

817
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,220
do not set foot outside the Dafeng.
