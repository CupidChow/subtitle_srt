bear witness.

42
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,960
This blood letter is for justice,

43
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,550
waiting for an execution.

44
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,830
Lord Wei,

45
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,040
how did it go?

46
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,080
The situation escalated.

47
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,080
His Majesty had the Bureau
question the suspect,

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
summoning Song Qing and Chu Caiwei
to the Palace.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,360
With three ministries hearing this case,

50
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,150
the result will come out soon.

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,700
Did the ministers have objections?

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,920
With Zhang Feng gone,
we need a new Minister of War.

53
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,830
They all

54
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,240
had their candidates.

55
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,870
Princess Pingyang's elopement

56
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,520
could impair the imperial image.

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,390
His Majesty hesitated,

58
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,590
but Princess Lin'an's blood letter

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,960
shut the ministers up.

60
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,230
His Majesty

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,480
had to allow it.

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,990
How's

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,600
Princess Lin'an?

64
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,240
She's loyal and persistent.

65
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,590
She knelt before the hall

66
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,640
and refused to leave

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,590
even when His Majesty ordered her to go.

68
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,670
Why did she

69
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,600
muddle things up in court all of a sudden?

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,620
Why involve the Guardians,

71
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,870
raising His Majesty's suspicion?

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
She and Pingyang were always close.

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,040
She was worried
about Pingyang and her family.

74
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,670
But she made a wrong move.

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,920
Why did His Majesty favor her?

76
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,920
Because she was naive and simple.

77
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,520
She never interfered in state affairs.

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,640
But now, she got

79
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,980
involved in the power struggle,

80
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,110
bringing down the Minister of War
with a blood letter.

81
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,520
His Majesty didn't say anything,

82
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,200
but he felt offended deep down inside.

83
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,360
He never fully trusts you
and might reconsider his decision.

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
After this incident,

85
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,390
you'll have to tread even more carefully.

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,200
Lin'an is so unruly.

87
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Mother,

88
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,670
Father's paranoid.

89
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,800
As the Crown Prince,

90
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,270
I have to learn

91
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,080
to gain his trust.

92
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,240
Is it worth it to lose His Majesty's favor

93
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,760
for that unchaste girl

94
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,800
who eloped with a man?

95
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,320
It is.

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,960
She is not unchaste.

97
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,990
She just wanted freedom.

98
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,710
Was that wrong?

99
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,520
Look at her!

100
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,880
What's that attitude?

101
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,880
What's done is done.

102
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,960
She might've been rash to help Pingyang,

103
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,630
but that showed she was caring and loyal.

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,160
If you keep blaming her for me,
and such words

105
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,390
reach Father and others' ears,

106
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,960
won't I look greedy for power

107
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,200
and heartless?

108
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
Pingyang,

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,560
are you free now?

110
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,140
(Three Days Later)

111
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,560
Heng Yuan, you're free to go.

112
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,720
Let's go.

113
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,320
No. 3

114
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,150
told me everything.

115
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,560
What are you

116
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,470
going to do next?

117
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,430
By the way,

118
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,270
His Majesty has given his verdict.

119
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,530
Zhang Feng and his son

120
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,760
will be executed

121
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
at Jieshikou

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,400
in three days.

123
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,780
(Moon Resto)

124
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,200
Greetings, Grand Princess.

125
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,390
You may rise.

126
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,630
Sit.

127
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,880
That case is over.

128
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,470
With Zhang Feng gone,

129
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,270
the Minister of War falls vacant.

130
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,560
It is a key post.

131
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,830
The ministers will fight fiercely over it.

132
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,390
They're having a meeting now.

133
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,350
Let's wait for the news.

134
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,870
Yes.

135
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,150
Your Highness.

136
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,070
Go ahead.

137
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,310
During the meeting,

138
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,030
the ministers nominated their men

139
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,880
for the Minister of War.

140
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,880
They had a heated debate.

141
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,560
What about Lord Wei?

142
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,030
He didn't nominate anyone.

143
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,560
You can't think of anyone for that post?

144
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry,

145
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,710
but no, Your Majesty.

146
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,120
In this case,

147
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,320
Mr. Cao,

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,710
your candidate will be

149
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,440
the new Minister of War.

150
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

151
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,720
Alright.

152
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,760
If that's all, you may leave.

153
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,720
Your Majesty,

154
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,320
there is something else.

155
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Speak.

156
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,350
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an

157
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,270
made great contributions
to Princess Pingyang's case.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,030
Please

159
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,520
spare him the death penalty.

160
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,350
I sent the report

161
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,230
to the Cabinet yesterday.

162
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,920
Your Majesty,

163
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,790
the Sangbo Case

164
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,270
hasn't been solved.

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,880
It might be

166
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,200
too soon

167
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
to spare him.

168
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,590
You polluted my chamber

169
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,110
- with such filth.
- I...

170
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,590
How dare you!

171
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,590
Please be appeased.

172
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,830
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

173
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,760
Look.

174
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,630
- Look at it!
- Yes.

175
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,040
- Look over there.
- Where?

176
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
It's everywhere!

177
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,710
You brought in so much filth!

178
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,040
Didn't I say

179
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,470
- to clean yourself before coming here?
- Yes.

180
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,750
Why didn't you remember it?

181
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,990
I'll remember it.

182
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,080
Wipe it! Wipe it clean!

183
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,040
It's dirty here.

184
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,920
I'll wipe it.

185
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,070
Over there!

186
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,400
Wipe it!

187
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,240
Here.

188
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,330
Yes.

189
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,710
Do it!

190
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,750
Yes, yes.

191
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,880
Your Majesty!

192
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,680
Lord Wei took a step back

193
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,400
probably to save your life.

194
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,800
I can never repay you and him

195
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,590
for your great kindness.

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,630
But others won't let you go easily.

197
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,510
Do you mean Minister Sun?

198
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,630
I retorted upon him a few times
for the Sangbo Case

199
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
and broke into the Ministry of Justice.

200
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
He's long seen me as an eyesore.

201
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,350
But don't worry.

202
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,920
I'm not a doormat

203
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,200
that he can walk over.

204
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,230
Any news from the East Palace?

205
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,870
Crown Prince didn't attend today's meeting.

206
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,040
Lin'an's blood letter

207
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,800
stirred up a huge storm.

208
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,750
He's keeping a low profile

209
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,750
to bide his time to act.

210
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,160
I heard His Majesty was

211
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,990
mad at Princess Lin'an after what she did.

212
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,470
A princess interfering in state affairs

213
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,230
is the last thing he wants to see.

214
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,590
She meant to uphold justice for her cousin.

215
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,080
Who could've seen that coming?

216
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,350
She should have.

217
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,870
Well,

218
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,440
it's said that when people feel the saddest,

219
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,750
they'll bottle up their feelings,

220
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,960
unable to let them out.

221
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,470
I heard

222
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,990
after that day,

223
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,040
she didn't set foot outside her palace once.

224
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,760
She won't

225
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,350
see you today.

226
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,180
(Shaoyin Palace)

227
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,040
Mr. Xu,

228
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,470
Her Highness won't see you.

229
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,550
Please leave.

230
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,440
I know she's depressed,

231
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,560
but she needs to eat, or she'll collapse.

232
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,590
Please give her this

233
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,510
and tell her

234
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,440
to eat up

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,470
and take care.

236
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,560
Have a try.

237
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,400
Give it a go.

238
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,040
And bring this to her, too.

239
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,280
Your Highness,

240
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,320
you haven't eaten anything for days.

241
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,960
It'll impair your health.

242
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,960
Xu Qi'an came all the way to bring you this.

243
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,920
He said

244
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,710
to eat up and take care.

245
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,540
(Shop of Delicacies)

246
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,920
Egg-yolk puffs?

247
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,040
How did he know your favorite food?

248
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,590
He's sweet.

249
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,760
Your Highness,

250
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,630
so many people care about you.

251
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,590
Please have a bite.

252
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,110
I'll leave them here.

253
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,180
(Shop of Delicacies)

254
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,710
Gang,

255
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,320
how has Lin'an been lately?

256
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,640
Your Highness,

257
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,110
she's the same as before,

258
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,960
not eating anything.

259
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,350
Your Highness,

260
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,750
I fear

261
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,200
her pent-up sorrow and depression might

262
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,350
affect her liver and spleen,

263
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,870
causing serious damage.

264
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,540
Instead of taking herbs or medicinal food,

265
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,590
she needs to vent her frustration

266
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,080
and sorrow.

267
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,630

271
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,800
(I was overjoyed.)

272
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
(May we have a wonderful night
like tonight every year.)

273
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,920
(From Pingyang.)

274
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,040
May we always be this happy.

275
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,510

How about we indulge for once?

280
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,960
Time awaits no one.

281
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,750
Why waste it?

282
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,590
Let's treat it as a dream,

where we can sing and drink freely.

284
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160

Your Highness, that drawing...

295
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,800
Pingyang used to have it

296
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,470
until it changed hands among others.

297
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
When my guest advisor found it,

298
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,750
I bought that drawing.

299
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,560
They all say

300
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,870
you and Princess Lin'an are never close,

301
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,400
but you know she likes savory snacks

302
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,420
such as egg-yolk puffs
from the Shop of Delicacies.

303
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,280
You even bought back this drawing

304
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,110
without telling her.

305
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,870
You're smart.

306
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,990
What do you think?

307
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,320
You two are of the same root

308
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,800
growing in separate directions.

309
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,630
The Sangbo Case isn't over yet.

310
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,870
Take care of yourself.

311
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,710
Mother,

312
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,280
I want red bean buns from the Moon Resto!

313
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,920
Forget it.

314
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,830
You're like a red bean bun.

315
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,560
Lingyin,

316
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,440
recite the Three Character Classic.

317
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,470
I've already memorized it.

318
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,710
"People at birth

319
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,560
are naturally good.

320
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,040
Their natures are similar.

321
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,280
- I'm home!
- Their habits become different."

322
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,040
- Little one.
- Ningyan!

323
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,280
I bought you tasty yogurt.

324
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,120
- Here.
- Why not give me more

325
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,560
- housekeeping money?
- You're back.

326
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,630
Thanks, Ningyan!

327
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
Where's Cijiu?

328
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,350
He's preparing

329
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,750
for the Spring Exam at school.

330
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Lingyue,

331
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,560
what's going on?

332
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,080
Is that all? No meat?

333
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,960
There's no meat because

334
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,440
we've run out of money.

335
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,960
Ningyan, Father, please.

336
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,470
Wait, hold on.

337
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,800
Wait a minute.

338
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,960
Aunt,

339
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,680
I remember we just gave you our salaries.

340
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,040
We need to buy everything for the New Year.

341
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,080
The money from you is

342
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,440
too little to buy anything.

343
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,830
The New Year is still months away.

344
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,320
What's the rush?

345
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,320
I'll give you more money next month.

346
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,160
Alright?

347
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,760
You promised

348
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,920
me and Mother new clothes by next month.

349
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,760
What now?

350
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,750
You don't remember?

351
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,200
I don't.

352
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,640
When did I say that?

353
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,270
I want money.

354
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,510
- Give it to me...
- My legs hurt.

355
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,030
I stood all day on duty.

356
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,640
Give me your salaries!

357
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,480
Where is it?

358
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,110
Fine.

359
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,790
You two can only

360
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,230
eat greens in the future!

361
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,840
They're healthy.

362
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,640
I love eating greens.

363
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,960
They're good, right?

364
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
Of course!

365
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360
You know, Uncle,

366
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,600
they're the best.

367
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,030
They're perfect for Fighters like us.

368
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,840
They can nourish and strengthen our bodies.

369
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,310
Besides, green vegetables are

370
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,790
full of dietary fiber.

371
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,510
They can make us stronger.

372
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,360
Yes! Greens are tasty.

373
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,510
I've never found them so delicious.

374
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,310
We'll eat greens for every meal.

375
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,310
Pay for the meat

376
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,400
if you want to eat it.

377
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Agreed?

378
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,160
It's really good!

379
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
Eat up.

380
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,020
(Xu Residence)

381
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,960
Eunuch Yang?

382
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,990
Good news, Mr. Xu.

383
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,750
Reward from His Majesty!

384
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,400
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an of the Guardians

385
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,880
solved Princess Pingyang's case

386
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,790
and saved Princess Lin'an's life.

387
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,120
Here's the reward.

388
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,600
1,000 liang of gold.

389
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,710
100 bolts

390
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,550
of silk and satin.

391
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,400
The end.

392
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,570
Thank you, Your Majesty!

393
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,070
Mr. Xu,

394
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
congratulations.

395
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,600
Let's go!

396
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
Good day, Eunuch Yang.

397
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,840
Come to try our home cooking next time.

398
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:03,830
I will.

399
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,070
Thanks, guys.

400
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,640
- Good day.
- Take care.

401
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,790
Close the gate.

402
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,900
Leave now! There's nothing else to see!

403
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,790
- Go home.
- Sorry.

404
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,160
It's real brocade!

405
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,920
(I'm rewarded)

406
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,700
(but not spared the death penalty.)

407
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,880
Father, Mother,

408
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,990
His Majesty rewarded those to Ningyan,

409
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,120
not you two.

410
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
Why are you so excited?

411
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,440
Ningyan, it's getting cold.

412
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,710
Have some hot tea

413
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,600
to nourish your body

414
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,990
and keep you warm.

415
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,550
You don't need tea.

416
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,510
You need to put on more layers

417
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,960
to keep the cold air out.

418
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,680
That's the wisest.

419
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,990
Sweetie,

420
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,990
I made this new outfit for you.

421
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,750
When it's cold,

422
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,840
one needs nourishment

423
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,790
more than clothes.

424
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,920
I've taken good care of Ningyan

425
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,470
over the past two decades.

426
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,680
He's grown from a little boy

427
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,790
to a tall, robust,

428
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,790
and outstanding talent

429
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,440
favored by His Majesty and princesses,

430
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,280
right?

431
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,990
Thanks for caring

432
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,470
so much about me.

433
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,030
You're my dearest family.

434
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,990
So?

435
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
So?

436
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,310
So?

437
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,360
So the reward

438
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,160
isn't your concern.

439
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,200
I know what to do with it.

440
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,510
Come to think of it,

441
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,600
Aunt's best at housekeeping.

442
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,990
You'll make the best use

443
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,360
of the gold.

444
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,990
Ningyan has a point.

445
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,960
He's right.

446
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,710
We've been living here
for over 20 years, right?

447
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,360
I'm sick of it.

448
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,270
Let's buy a new house

449
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,400
in the Inner City.

450
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,470
We'll move there!

451
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,550
Great!

452
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,230
Before that,

453
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,550
let's have a big meal!

454
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,510
I want meat!

455
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,830
I need more protein!

456
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,470
- What would you like?
- Two meat buns.

457
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,310
Alright.

458
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,270
One is enough.

459
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,160
Sure, one meat bun for you.

460
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,880
Make it two, please.

461
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,160
Your two meat buns.

462
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,150
Thanks.

463
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,200
What would you like?

464
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
Let me see.

465
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,200
You're Xu Xinnian.

466
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,120
Can't you afford a few meat buns?

467
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,790
(A House of Talents)
You know

468
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,680
since the Tax Silver Case,

469
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,120
our family has almost gone broke.

470
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,120
We've had so many troubles lately.

471
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,680
Our family probably needs

472
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,190
more money to go through this month.

473
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,200
It's been unsafe outside.

474
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,640
I can barely make any money

475
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,960
by writing or drawing.

476
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,410
A penny saved is a penny earned.

477
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,510
But you can't focus on studying

478
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,790
on an empty stomach.

479
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,640
I'll share my food with you.

480
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,040
No, thanks.

481
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,200
"Studying can lead to success."

482
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,600
I, Xu Xinnian,

483
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,470
will succeed even if I can
only eat simple food.

484
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,510
What's wrong, Cijiu?

485
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,040
It's strange.

486
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
The Academy doesn't allow strangers in.

487
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,200
But look at those two...

488
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,680
No one is there.

489
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,550
Are you seeing things in hunger, Cijiu?

490
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,440
You need to eat.

491
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,510
Have this sausage.

492
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,350
No, thanks.

493
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,990
They were there just now.

494
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,030
It's empty.

495
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
He's Xu Qi'an's brother, Xu Xinnian,

496
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,030
or No. 3.

497
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,840
Luckily, you knew

498
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,030
No. 3's brother, that Guardian,

499
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,070
so that we could find No. 3.

500
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,520
Back then,

501
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,200
without No. 3's help,

502
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,640
I couldn't have

503
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,230
taken revenge for my junior

504
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:23,960
or

505
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,710
got out of the dungeon so quickly.

506
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,200
This isn't the right time to thank him.

507
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,360
Just now, I sensed

508
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,070
a guest of Qi force lock on us.

509
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,360
It must be Zhao Shou's.

510
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,350
Yes.

511
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
Given our identities,

512
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,920
we shouldn't have come to the Yunlu Academy.

513
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,750
No. 3 might get in trouble because of us.

514
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,070
Choose another day then.

515
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,230
Once he leaves here,

516
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,070
we can thank him

517
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,640
from a distance.

518
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,710
You're right.

519
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,590
Real gold!

520
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,800
It's real!

521
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,120
Thank you all

522
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,120
for going here and there to help me.

523
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,990
You've

524
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,270
shared my woe.

525
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,880
Now, it's time

526
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,730
to share my weal,

527
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,770
right?

528
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,800
Ningyan,

529
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,920
you...

530
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,040
Hold on.

531
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,640
Here you go, Chief.

532
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,800
For your wife.

533
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,070
They're too many.

534
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,680
She doesn't need them all.

535
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,920
Grand the pearls
to use the powder on her face.

536
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,440
Take them.

537
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,790
It's over the top, really.

538
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,310
I thank you for her.

539
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,470
Thanks for speaking for me

540
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,600
at yesterday's meeting.

541
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,070
Too bad,

542
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,750
the Sangbo Case isn't over yet.

543
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,990
His Majesty hasn't spared your death penalty.

544
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,070
I know.

545
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,920
Someone is targeting me.

546
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,230
That doesn't matter.

547
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,470
What matters is

548
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,750
His Majesty dislikes you.

549
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,510
I'm a mere Copper Gong.

550
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,790
Why is he annoyed with me?

551
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,440
Because of

552
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,680
the Loong.

553
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,550
Calm down. It's fine.

554
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,550
Don't be scared.

555
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,160
The Loong is an Imperial Pet.

556
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,640
It only approaches royalty.

557
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,750
During the investigation

558
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,920
of the Sangbo Case, the Loong

559
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,710
approached you in public.

560
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,440
(Why did it approach me?)

561
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,510
That's not the point.

562
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,440
The point is

563
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,960
how to keep you alive.

564
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,790
What should I do next?

565
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,640
Please enlighten me.

566
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,400
You can only do one thing.

567
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,400
Wait.

568
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,680
At this point,

569
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,030
all the traces have been removed.

570
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,470
When the time is over,

571
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,400
if His Majesty insists on killing you,

572
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,120
I'll

573
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,920
swap you out with someone on death row.

574
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,600
No one will suspect it.

575
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,550
What if

576
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,680
I can seize Zhou Chixiong?

577
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,510
You'll be spared.

578
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,340
(Fort in Yunzhou)

579
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,440
Who's there?

580
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
No. 2,

581
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,840
did you catch Zhou Chixiong?

582
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,200
Stop rushing me.

583
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,360
I'm on it.

584
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,830
(Liuyi Fort)

585
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,970
Change shifts.

586
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,200
Go get drinks.

587
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,850
Let's go. Check around.

588
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,990
Drink, guys.

589
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,830
Yes!

590
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,840
Looks like those women

591
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,510
aren't to your taste, Mr. Zhou.

592
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,390
You're lucky.

593
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,470
I robbed a trade caravan earlier today.

594
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,920
They had

595
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,600
a beautiful young woman.

596
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,470
She can entertain you.

597
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,310
Are you

598
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,990
Zhou Chixiong?

599
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,750
Yes.

600
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,790
So you're Zhou Chixiong.

601
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,550
And you're...

602
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,360
Winged Woman?

603
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,790
Don't call me that.

604
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,960
It's cheesy.

605
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,910
Master,

606
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,600
I did well, didn't I?

607
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,230
You sent the message in time.

608
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Are we going to kill him now?

609
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,230
Spare me, please!

610
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,840
I won't kill you.

611
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,680
Someone's waiting for you.

612
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,310
Have a safe trip.

613
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,260
(Five Days Later)

614
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,230
Senior Song, is it me

615
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,470
or is he putting chicken in your censer?

616
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,470
And mushrooms

617
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,030
and various spices?

618
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,920
Be... be quiet.

619
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,030
Just keep watching.

620
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Carry on.

621
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,260
(Chicken Powder)

622
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,990
What's that?

623
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,960
It's extracted from various ingredients.

624
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,680
I call it

625
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,110
chicken powder!

626
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,270
Chicken powder?

627
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
It's edible!

628
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,550
Noodles!

629
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,800
Mix them?

630
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,870
Taste it.

631
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,040
Good.

632
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
So flavorful!

633
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,600
I used to think

634
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,920
alchemy could only be

635
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,550
used to make tools

636
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,760
and utensils.

637
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,120
Unexpectedly,

638
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,270
it can be used to cook, too.

639
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,360
I'm enlightened!

640
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,750
I was too narrow-minded.

641
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Alchemy can be widely used in life!

642
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,960
Ningyan,

643
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,510
can you teach us this technique?

644
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,470
Of course.

645
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,470
I know plenty of such alchemy skills.

646
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,160
If you want to learn,

647
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,230
I'll teach you all of them.

648
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,230
But...

649
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,600
Equivalent exchange. I know.

650
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,070
I'll do you this favor.

651
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,310
Caiwei, let's go!

652
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,240
Caiwei?

653
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,840
There you are.

654
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,030
Here I am.

655
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,920
We haven't met for days.

656
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,550
You still like turning your back to others.

657
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,550
I'm still attracted to you

658
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,510
even like this.

659
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,440
I'll help you

660
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,150
with what you're going to do later.

661
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,800
I've asked Senior Song to assist me.

662
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,640
Vanish!

663
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:31,990
And Caiwei.

664
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,830
Vanish!

665
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,840
Now,

666
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,320
only I'm left.

667
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,870
There it is.

668
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,720
No. 3,

669
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,990
I've sent that man to you.

670
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,840
If I need your help in the future,

671
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,630
don't forget to return the favor.

672
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,880
Thank you!

673
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Who are you?

674
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,760
Where am I?

675
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,630
Riding a big bird can make a grand entrance.

676
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,990
Xu Qi'an,

677
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,800
do you also think

678
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,630
I need such a mount?

679
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,670
Senior Yang,

680
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,990
riding a bird is

681
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,150
so not your demeanor.

682
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,110
What should I ride then?

683
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,550
A loong!

684
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,990
It'll make you look stronger.

685
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,030
You'll be

686
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,800
a legend on a loong.

687
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,960
Where can I pick up a loong?

688
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,510
I need to go to the Palace.

689
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,470
Take me there.

690
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,760
You can ask His Majesty.

691
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,120
Knock it off!

692
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,470
Let's go.

693
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,320
That bag!

694
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,240
- Got it.
- Let's go!

695
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,860
(Shiqian Gate)

696
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,840
Ningyan,

697
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,400
I came as soon as I got your message.

698
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,070
I waited for hours. What took you so long?

699
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,440
Thanks for coming.

700
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,240
Sorry to trouble you again.

701
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,960
It's fine.

702
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,960
I wasn't able to help you last time.

703
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,920
I hope I can do something for you now.

704
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,320
Do you remember

705
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,670
you promised me a spell book?

706
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,670
Of course.

707
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,190
A promise is a promise.

708
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,360
Thank you, Master.

709
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,720
Oh, I see.

710
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,920
I have new poems at home.

711
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,590
You can comment on them next time.

712
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,840
Sure.

713
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,590
Thank you, Master.

714
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,220
Keep this in mind.

715
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,100
(Yunlu Spells)

716
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,470
With your current rank,

717
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,400
(Heart, Gaze)
you can only use simple spells.

718
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,800
To cast a spell, tear out its page

719
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,760
and burn it with your Qi force.

720
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,590
But remember,

721
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,190
you aren't our student.

722
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,030
Don't use this method too often,

723
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,400
or it'll mess up your Qi force

724
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,190
and drain your energy.

725
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,720
I understand.

726
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,720
Thanks, Master.

727
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,190
Put it away now.

728
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,510
What brings you here?

729
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,920
Why did she also come?

730
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,030
What are you doing here?

731
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,960
Where's Senior Yang?

732
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,070
Well, he...

733
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,470
He said if he turned his back to His Majesty,

734
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,630
he'd be beheaded.

735
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,470
He added that he sent us here,

736
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,840
which saved us a lot of time.

737
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,150
He's a mystery,

738
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,590
always turning his back to others

739
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,720
and saying strange things.

740
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,190
- I'm so sick of him!
- Me too.

741
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,280
It's even worse lately.

742
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,400
Heaven knows which idiot

743
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,510
told him this line

744
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,920
that he repeated every day.

745
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,800
I had to hold myself back not to kill him!

746
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,400
It wasn't me.

747
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,640
Let's go.

748
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,030
Don't keep His Majesty waiting.

749
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,760
Your Majesty,

750
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,830
the deadline for the Sangbo Case
has been reached.

751
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,360
Wei Yuan accused the Ministry of Justice
of collusion,

752
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,760
but he hasn't provided any proof yet.

753
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,190
Your Majesty,

754
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,550
he shall be punished.

755
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,670
Seconded.

756
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,990
Please uphold justice

757
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,440
(Li Yulang)
and punish him

758
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,190
(Minister of Rites)
to clear the innocent's names.

759
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,390
