Are you saying...?

41
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,600
I dare not speak recklessly,

42
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,030
but this involves the Kui.

43
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,030
They want to release the seal
from the lakebed.

44
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,800
That is definitely as simple

45
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,270
as power and profit struggles.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,830
Someone in the court with power

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,110
who can secretly ally with the Kui.

48
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,230
Xu Qi'an,

49
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
how dare you

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,830
suspect Duke Zhenbei?

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Duke Zhenbei?

52
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,110
Yes.

53
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,430
Your Majesty.

54
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,760
It's been some years

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,020
since he returned to the capital, right?

56
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,520
Your Majesty,

57
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,640
are you planning

58
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,150
to recall Duke Zhenbei to the capital?

59
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,480
I've never won

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,670
in these past years.

61
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,990
It's rather dull.

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,320
Your Majesty,

63
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,590
playing chess is
like cultivating the heart.

64
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,520
I'll be honored

65
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,990
to play with you again.

66
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,510
You have a try.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,670
Cultivate your heart.

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,200
Yes, Father.

69
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,520
I dare not.

70
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,800
I know nothing
of the powerful officials.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,090
I focus only on handling cases.

72
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,560
How could I suspect anyone?

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,390
Lord Wei is right.

74
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,360
You are indeed clever.

75
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,080
Are you willing

76
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,710
to serve me?

77
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,590
Of course, I long for it,

78
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,800
but I'm now
Princess Lin'an's guest adviser.

79
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
Though I was deceived into this,

80
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
it is still a fact.

81
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,670
If I were to pledge allegiance
to you now,

82
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,520
it might cause gossip.

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,430
I am not afraid of that,

84
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,080
but I fear it will harm your reputation.

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
I am not afraid either.

86
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,580
(For Huaiqing Mansion)

87
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,000
Your Highness, I'm willing
to dedicate my life to you.

88
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,750
Rise.

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,600
Yes.

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,230
I'll take you to the Imperial Library.

91
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
Yes.

92
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,250
Come here and take a look.

93
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,030
In the capital,

94
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,790
apart from the Palace,
Yunlu Academy,

95
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,150
and the Astronomical Bureau,

96
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,000
this is

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,200
(Bodhi Beads)
the only weapon

98
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,680
that can block the Gazing Spell.

99
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,710
Which treasure would you like?

100
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,040
The string

101
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,120
of Bodhi beads.

102
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,760
Sir, it's 600 liang.

103
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,670
Thank you.

104
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,390
(What?)

105
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,710
(Was Zhou Chixiong
in the carriage back then?)

106
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,520
(No.)

107
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,520
(Jinlian said it was a woman.)

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
What's wrong?

109
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,870
Nothing.

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,830
I've gone through all the files here

111
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,880
but still couldn't find
any related weapons.

112
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,270
There are too many types of weapons.

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,520
It's impossible to record them all here.

114
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,560
It seems we'll have
to return empty-handed today.

115
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,800
However,

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,350
I've just thought of something.

117
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,350
I'm not sure if it's related to weapons.

118
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,030
A year ago,

119
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,150
Princess Pingyang, daughter of Duke Yu,

120
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,960
fled because of her marriage.

121
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,150
Father was furious

122
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,120
and ordered the sorcerers of the Bureau

123
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,680
to use the Gazing Spell to track her.

124
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,880
In the end, they found nothing.

125
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,000
Does Princess Pingyang also possess

126
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,320
a weapon?

127
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm not sure.

128
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,830
But there is one person

129
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,960
who is very close to Pingyang.

130
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,440
You know her well too.

131
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,000
Could it be...?

132
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
Lin'an.

133
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,040
Your Highness.

134
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,390
A warm and sunny day

135
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,390
is the perfect time to play woven ball.

136
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,190
Your Highness,

137
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,080
I just went to Moon Resto
and bought your favorite snacks,

138
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,200
as well as some iced yogurt.

139
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,440
They're all very delicious.

140
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,000
You haven't eaten yet.

141
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,310
Would you like

142
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,590
to try a bite?

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,640
Xu Qi'an

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,560
is a crappy servant.

145
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,520
He's a jerk.

146
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,080
Your Highness,

147
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,590
you're a princess

148
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,910
favored by His Majesty.

149
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,680
You have as many talents

150
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,080
and artisans as you need.

151
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,880
Why cling to a mere Xu Qi'an?

152
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,560
He can write poems.

153
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,230
What's the big deal about that?

154
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,910
Without the poetry contest,

155
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,390
you can still overshadow

156
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,710
Princess Huaiqing
with your intelligence.

157
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,160
Really?

158
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,560
Of course.

159
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,590
Then tell me.
What intelligence do I have?

160
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,230
Tell me.

161
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,430
You have big eyes.

162
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
You're very nice.

163
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,520
You play jianzi well.

164
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,000
You know how to raise cats.

165
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,000
Your Highness,

166
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,120
they just easily came up

167
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,910
with four good qualities.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,080
Your Highness.

169
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,320
I'm a noble princess of the Dafeng.

170
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,230
I'm deeply favored by His Majesty.

171
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,040
Though I may lack any talent...

172
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,710
No.

173
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,350
Though I may lack any talent,

174
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,320
I can certainly find
the most talented person in the world

175
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,500
to serve as my guest adviser.

176
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,960
You were right just now.

177
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,750
There are so many talents
and artisans in the world.

178
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,990
A mere Xu Qi'an

179
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,830
can be my gift to Huaiqing.

180
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,440
That's great, Your Highness.

181
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,800
You've finally cheered up.

182
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I've cheered up.

183
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,230
I thought that Xu Qi'an would be torn
between me and Huaiqing

184
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,680
because of our past,

185
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,470
but to my surprise,

186
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,400
he didn't hesitate for even a moment.

187
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,830
Who am I?

188
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,830
I am the No. 1 Princess of the Dafeng.

189
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,710
I also have my temper.

190
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,110
I swear

191
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,440
that from now on,
I'll never see him again.

192
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,200
We are sworn enemies.

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,710
- Yes, sworn enemies.
- Sworn enemies.

194
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,520
Your Highness,

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,590
I'll go find you
a new guest adviser now.

196
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,750
I don't believe it.

197
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,510
Among the scholars of the Dafeng,

198
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,300
there must be someone better
than Xu Qi'an.

199
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,870
Yes, let's go now.

200
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,710
Let's go.

201
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,960
Your Highness.

202
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,020
Mr. Xu is outside, asking to see you.

203
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,560
Xu Qi'an.

204
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,590
(Shaoyin Palace)

205
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,560
Why are you here?

206
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,590
Miss Gang,

207
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,990
I'm here to see Huaiqing...

208
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,110
I'm here to see Princess Lin'an.

209
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,230
Please pass on my message.

210
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,680
The princess is angry.

211
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
She won't see you.

212
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,710
Go back.

213
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,200
The princess is angry?

214
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,160
Which blind fool upset the princess?

215
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,040
Tell me, and I'll deal with him.

216
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,110
Did he really say that?

217
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,190
Your Highness,

218
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,960
how can you still smile?

219
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,680
He's so shameless.

220
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,400
It's clear that he's opposing you,

221
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,590
yet he acts
like it's none of his business.

222
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,240
But

223
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,960
I did deceive him first.

224
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,750
He upset me this time.

225
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,400
We're even.

226
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,870
Wait, Your Highness.

227
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,630
Didn't you just say

228
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,230
you'd be sworn enemies with him?

229
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,920
Yes.

230
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,750
Don't I often say

231
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,160
I'll send you out of the Palace?

232
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
That's just anger talking.

233
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,080
It doesn't count.

234
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,110
No, Your Highness.

235
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,680
If you let him off so easily,

236
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,920
he'll think you're easy to deal with.

237
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,710
How will he ever

238
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,350
take you seriously again?

239
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,440
That's a good point.

240
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,920
We must make him remember this.

241
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,020
(Shaoyin Palace)

242
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,280
It's been two hours now.

243
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,930
She hasn't asked me to leave,

244
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,960
and she hasn't come out to see me.

245
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,590
Could it be

246
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,560
that she wants me to remember this?

247
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,750
Staying here like this won't do.

248
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,200
(I've got an idea.)

249
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,080
He's still out there?

250
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:54,950
Who?

251
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
He's still out there.

252
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,440
He really is sincere.

253
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Let him in.

254
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,880
Your Highness,

255
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,400
you can't.

256
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,640
Why?

257
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,200
If he can't even withstand

258
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
such a small test,

259
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,490
how could he ever

260
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,800
be devoted to you in the future?

261
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,040
Though that's true, still...

262
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,990
Your Highness.

263
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,830
Mr. Xu just fainted at the door.

264
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,800
Fainted?

265
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,090
Mr. Xu said

266
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,650
he'd stood at the door for too long,

267
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,800
and with the scorching sun,

268
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
he became overheated.

269
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,560
The old wound from the fight
against the Silver Gong flared up.

270
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,750
I didn't let him stand
under the hot sun.

271
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,710
He said

272
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,400
this was his sincerity.

273
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,350
Sincerity?

274
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,830
Mr. Xu also said

275
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,920
if he couldn't withstand this test,

276
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,470
how could he be devoted to you
in the future?

277
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,830
That's my line.

278
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,680
Your line?

279
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,990
He also said

280
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,380
that we shouldn't worry about him,

281
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,330
and he'd wait
until you changed your mind.

282
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,000
He'd wait through the scorching sun,

283
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,710
until the end of time,
and until the seas dry up.

284
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,680
Using this trick, huh?

285
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,110
Trying to use sweet words

286
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,630
to make Her Highness soften.

287
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,680
Dream on.

288
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,830
Let him in.

289
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,520
What?

290
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,590
Your Highness,

291
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,710
are you really letting him off?

292
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,350
It's enough, right?

293
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,110
But he's doing this on purpose.

294
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,080
I know,

295
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,230
but the sun is so strong outside.

296
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,990
Even if he's not injured,

297
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,400
he'll still suffer from the heat.

298
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,080
Your Highness,

299
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,350
don't go soft.

300
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,750
Gang, just let it go.

301
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,040
Your Highness.

302
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,590
- Gang.
- Your Highness.

303
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,630
Gang.

304
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,470
No.

305
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,590
With me here today,

306
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,960
you can't go to see him.

307
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,900
Which one of us is the princess?

308
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,830
Who has the final say in Shaoyin Palace?

309
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,200
Of course, it's you.

310
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,590
Let him in.

311
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
Yes.

312
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,680
Thank you, Lord Wei.

313
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,350
The moon sets, rooks caw,
frost fills the sky.

314
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,320
Maples and fishing boat lights

315
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,630
make me too sad to sleep.

316
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,320
The spring's charm disrupts my sleep.

317
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,750
Did Lin'an really write this?

318
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,830
Yes.

319
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,950
Your Majesty,

320
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,800
the Masters of the Directorate
of Education praise Princess Lin'an

321
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,040
for making great progress.

322
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,120
They also say

323
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,160
that in time, Princess Lin'an

324
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,750
will certainly become
a rising star in poetry,

325
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,510
able to rival Princess Huaiqing.

326
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,470
As expected of my daughter.

327
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,310
Yes.

328
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,470
Once she starts to learn,

329
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,110
she really is a talent with potential.

330
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes.

331
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,870
Wei Yuan, look.

332
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,400
Lin'an wrote this.

333
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,500
Congratulations, Father.

334
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,970
It seems that Lin'an will shine
at the poetry contest.

335
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,830
What do you think?

336
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,710
Keep it with care.

337
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:11,670
Yes.

338
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,400
Your Majesty,

339
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,780
the Loong just emerged from the water.

340
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,760
The Loong?

341
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,160
I haven't seen it for a while.

342
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,280
But

343
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,560
the Loong seems rather excited today,

344
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,110
or perhaps a bit agitated.

345
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,850
Several princes wanted to ride it,

346
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,160
but they were all thrown off.

347
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,920
How strange.

348
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,440
The Loong is usually gentle

349
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,210
and always obedient to the royal family.

350
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,060
How could it suddenly go wild
for no reason?

351
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,470
- Let's check it out.
- Yes.

352
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,710
Eunuch, please wait.

353
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,710
Is there a Guardian

354
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,630
at the lake today?

355
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,880
Yes.

356
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,230
He's a Xu.

357
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,630
He even wrote a poem,

358
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,230
which received great applause.

359
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
What's wrong, Lord Wei?

360
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,520
It's nothing.

361
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,790
What's wrong with you?

362
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,120
The princes have long
been playing with you.

363
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,710
Why did you suddenly
throw them into the water?

364
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,120
I haven't been close to you for years.

365
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,600
You must feel quite lonely.

366
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:39,130
Your Majesty's grace
lasts through the ages.

367
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,250
As soon as you arrived,

368
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,680
the Loong became so joyful.

369
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,020
It must have been missing you,

370
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,600
and that's why it acted so strangely.

371
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,100
(Shaoyin Palace)

372
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,480
Your Highness.

373
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,440
He's awake.

374
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,130
Subordinate Xu Qi'an
greets Princess Lin'an.

375
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,760
Subordinate?

376
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,390
Subordinate.

377
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,160
Didn't you leave with Huaiqing?

378
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,640
Why are you back?

379
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,960
By Lord Wei's order,

380
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,270
I had no choice for the case's sake.

381
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,600
Once that was over,

382
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,230
I came immediately
to apologize to you for my crimes.

383
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,130
What crimes did you commit?

384
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,030
The crimes I committed

385
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,000
are three.

386
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,200
First,

387
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,880
I failed to congratulate you

388
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
on winning the poetry contest.

389
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,800
Second,

390
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,960
as your guest adviser,

391
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,440
I didn't notice you were in a bad mood.

392
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
- Third...
- Enough.

393
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,030
Cut the crap.

394
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,470
What do you want?

395
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,310
What do I want?

396
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,230
I only came to apologize.

397
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,470
Haven't you

398
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,920
sworn to follow

399
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,600
Huaiqing

400
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,760
resolutely?

401
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,270
What happened? Didn't she recruit you?

402
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,230
She did recruit me,

403
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,640
but I turned her down.

404
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,030
You treated me with sincerity.

405
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,780
How could I be like those
who change their loyalties at will?

406
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,500
(For Huaiqing Mansion)

407
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,550
Huaiqing Token.

408
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,790
She forced me.

409
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,470
What a two-faced, shameless man.

410
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,030
It seems

411
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,880
you still don't understand me.

412
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,240
Understand you?

413
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,880
You don't understand
that a commoner like me

414
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,840
is helpless.

415
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,750
During the inspection,

416
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,600
everything can change,

417
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,470
and everyone is on edge.

418
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,640
My family was burdened
with the Tax Silver Case

419
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,440
and offended Mr. Zhou.

420
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,070
I was even imprisoned three times,

421
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,510
but Princess Huaiqing
recommended me to be a Guardian,

422
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,160
saving my family from ruin.

423
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,790
How could I

424
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,750
refuse her?

425
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm also a criminal
about to be waist-chopped.

426
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,160
If it wasn't the Grand Princess today,

427
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,990
I still couldn't refuse

428
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,680
an offer

429
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,200
from a prince,

430
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,070
a lowly official,

431
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,790
or even a eunuch.

432
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:59,680
Don't you agree,

433
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,070
Princess Lin'an?

434
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,230
Forget it.

435
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,800
Get up.

436
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,750
Though I accepted
Princess Huaiqing's token,

437
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,840
my loyalty

438
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,070
still belongs to you.

439
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,680
Stop with these sweet words.

440
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,920
I'm not buying it.

441
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,880
You embarrassed me in front of everyone.

442
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:44,690
Well.

443
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,470
That's because I deceived you first.

444
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,120
Also,

445
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,960
I'm not familiar with Wei Yuan,

446
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,220
and I didn't ask the Supervisor
to give you the Black Gold Saber.

447
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,990
I said those things deliberately,

448
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
trying to make you

449
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,440
swear loyalty to me.

450
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,920
Since that's the case,

451
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,310
let's call it even.

452
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,030
Your Highness,

453
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,920
you truly are sensible.

454
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,360
From now on,

455
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,360
just stay as my guest adviser.

456
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,120
As for Huaiqing,

457
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,680
if you have concerns

458
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,790
and can't refuse her,

459
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,960
I'll find another way

460
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,470
to relieve you of this burden.

461
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,920
That's great.

462
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,960
Your Highness.

463
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,030
I just want to buy a land now.

464
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,840
Buy a land?

465
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,360
A land of my unwavering loyalty.

466
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,270
Are you out of your mind?

467
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,990
What do you mean?

468
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,440
This is my true loyalty to you.

469
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,960
I told you.

470
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,510
This won't work on me.

471
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,030
Leave if everything's done.

472
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,580
Is there anything else?

473
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,960
No, no more.

474
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,910
Then go.

475
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,720
Well.

476
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,470
Then

477
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,760
I'll take my leave.

478
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,120
Don't beat around the bush.

479
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,220
Tell me what you want to say.

480
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,960
There is one thing.

481
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,550
Do you know

482
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,470
Princess Pingyang?

483
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,070
Your Highness,

484
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
as expected,

485
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,360
Mr. Xu managed to see Princess Lin'an.

486
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,310
Now,

487
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,310
they're heading to the Imperial Garden.

488
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,360
What did you find out?

489
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,550
Princess Pingyang may be related
to the Sangbo Case,

490
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,640
but this is just my speculation.

491
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,550
Right now, the case is unclear,

492
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,160
and we still need to investigate
where the princess is.

493
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,680
So,

494
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,600
about Princess Pingyang's disappearance,

495
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,750
Your Highness,

496
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,090
please tell me everything.

497
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,360
Then keep it between us.

498
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,790
I won't

499
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,070
tell anyone else.

500
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,960
I don't know where to start.

501
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,120
Pingyang is my best friend
in the Palace,

502
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,960
and she's the best person

503
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,750
in the world.

504
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,550
Lin'an, come here.

505
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,680
I'm coming.

506
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,680
Take this.

507
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,740
(Princess Pingyang, daughter of Duke Yu)

508
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,200
Lin'an, give me the scissors.

509
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,780
- Take it, Lin'an.
- Alright.

510
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,270
We mustn't let anyone see us.

511
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,160
Hurry.

512
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,710
We grew up together.

513
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,400
In all of the Dafeng,

514
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,200
she and I are the closest in spirit.

515
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,920
Though we are both born nobles,

516
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,600
being from the royal family,

517
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,750
we were taught from a young age

518
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,470
to be calm and graceful.

519
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,680
We weren't as carefree as others.

520
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,350
Lin'an,

521
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,070
as a princess and a commandery princess,

522
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,400
how can you two climb trees

523
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,510
to pick pomegranates?

524
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,710
Forget it. Calm down.

525
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,200
Sit down.

526
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,400
But we were lucky

527
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,960
to have each other as close friends.

528
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,920
She's like

529
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,310
another version of me in the mirror.

530
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,400
Do you still dare to pick pomegranates?

531
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Of course.

532
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,160
I used to think

533
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,880
that life would pass by peacefully
like this.

534
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,790
We'd grow up,

535
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,880
get married,

536
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,600
and grow old.

537
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,480
But...

538
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,470
But I didn't expect

539
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,030
that she'd be more proud

540
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,920
and braver than I am.

541
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,160
Are you referring

542
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,790
to her running away from her marriage?

543
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,400
I didn't realize it before,

544
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,790
but now I think

545
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,440
perhaps

546
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,160
ever since we met that man
at Azure Hall,

547
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,360
Pingyang had been

548
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,960
brewing a plan to escape.

549
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,400
Azure Hall?

550
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,520
That man

551
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,750
was a Wanderer from Azure Hall.

552
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,400
His name is Heng Hui.

553
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,650
- Take this.
- Thank you.

554
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,550
Also this.

555
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,400
Thank you.

556
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,440
During that time...

557
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,280
Take this.

558
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,880
We often went to Azure Hall

559
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,230
- to help those poor children.
- Come on.

560
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,480
Lin'an.

561
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,870
How are you doing?

562
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,400
Don't cry.

563
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,510
It's okay.

564
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,770
Here.

565
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,360
With the medicine, it won't hurt soon.

566
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,500
(Heng Hui, Wanderer)

567
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,470
Heng Hui appeared around us

568
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,230
at that time.

569
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,990
We gradually became familiar

570
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,840
with each other.

571
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,040
Jianzhou is located in the northwest
of the Dafeng's capital.

572
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,990
A water route links Jiangzhou
and Jianzhou.

573
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,010
It is said

574
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,550
that the mountains there are steep,

575
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,750
and the waters flow rapidly,

576
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,020
hence it is also known
as the Land of Perils.

577
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,670
Legend has it that there is
a fierce dragon in the waterway,

578
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,990
which stirs up storms

579
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,440
whenever travelers pass by.

580
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,470
Heng Hui is a Wanderer,

581
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,070
having seen the various landscapes
and local customs

582
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,550
of the Dafeng.

583
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,960
I envy him a lot,

584
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,750
and I'm sure Pingyang does too.

Until that day

605
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,230
when Father granted Pingyang a marriage.

606
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,310
After that,

607
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,360
she asked me:

608
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,600
If people could grow wings,

609
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,550
(Dafeng Geography Records)
would they be free?

610
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,790
(Jianzhou)

611
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,070
I had an inkling

612
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,470
that one day

613
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,070
she would defy convention.

614
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,940
(Dafeng Geography Records)
But I didn't expect...

615
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,280
Lin'an,

616
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,270
I'm leaving.

617
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,590
You can't.

618
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,360
How will you escape
the royal inspection?

619
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,080
The Bureau will use the Gazing Spell.

620
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,880
If they catch you,

621
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,070
you'll be doomed.

622
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,630
Lin'an,

623
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,440
don't worry.

624
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,840
We've arranged everything.

625
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,800
I came here

626
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
just to see you before I leave.

627
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,880
- But...
- The world is vast

628
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,440
and full of wonders.

629
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,840
I don't want to be trapped here,
wasting my life.

630

Heng Hui's geography records

631
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,200
only mention the Dafeng,

632
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,270
but I want my footprints

633
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,710
to be all over the world.

634
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,200
Lin'an,

635
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,990
can you keep this secret for me?

636
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,990
I can.

637
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,510
Once I reach the South,

638
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,880
I'll write to you.

639
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,350
Wait for me.

640
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,310
I'll definitely come back to see you.

641
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,750
Pingyang

642
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,710
left just like that.

643
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,550
What Princess Pingyang did

644
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,270
would damage the reputation

645
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,360
of Duke Yu and even the royal family.

646
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,200
It must've caused turmoil in the court.

647
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,110
That's right.

648
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,600
It stirred up a great uproar
in the capital.

649
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,440
Even her original future in-laws
were implicated.

650
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,040
Uncle Yu

651
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,960
has also withdrawn from the court.

652
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,710
I heard

653
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Duke Yu got sick and died
because Princess Pingyang

654
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,510
went missing.

655
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,870
That's not true.

656
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,230
Though Uncle was angry that Pingyang
left without saying goodbye,

657
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,400
he died of fury because...

658
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,500
Because...

659
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,560
Because of the attacks
from political enemies.

660
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,600
Political enemies?

661
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,920
Do you know who did it?

662
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,520
No.

663
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,990
Now in the mansion,

664
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,120
only my aunt remains.

665
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,070
She is deeply affected,

666
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,030
bedridden,

667
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,070
and nearly blinded from crying.

668
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,810
Your Highness, don't blame yourself.

669
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,310
This isn't your fault.

670
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,630
There are many regrets
and misunderstandings

671
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,960
in the world.

672
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,670
You're right.

673
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,990
What's important now

674
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,030
is to find out where Pingyang is.

675
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,240
Has Princess Pingyang

676
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,720
appeared anywhere since?

677
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,760
No.

678
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,240
Even after the death of Uncle,

679
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,840
she hasn't returned.

680
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,400
What if Heng Hui isn't a good person?

681
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,800
Or if they encountered danger
on the way?

682
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,160
Your Highness, you needn't worry.

683
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,440
When they escaped,

684
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,630
they took a weapon
that could conceal their aura.

685
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,070
If they wanted to hide their trail,

686
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,470
it wouldn't be difficult.

687
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,640
Maybe.

688
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,630
But Pingyang didn't want to hide it
from me.

689
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,070
She told me all the places
she planned to visit.

690
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,960
After the storm settled,

691
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,470
I even sent people to search for her,

692
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,630
but it was as if she disappeared
into thin air.

693
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,670
Disappeared?

694
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,990
Have you gone to Azure Hall

695
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,550
to ask about Heng Hui's whereabouts?

696
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,470
Yes.

697
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,080
But he was nowhere to be found.

698
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:22,950
Even...

699
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,960
Even his only close senior
has disappeared.

700
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,880
Is he Heng Yuan?

701
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,680
Yes.

702
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,480
He is not someone easy to deal with.

703
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:36,990
As expected.

704
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,670
Thank you, Your Highness.

705
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,550
The info you provided
is extremely helpful.

706
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,510
You've really helped me a lot this time.

707
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,370
Your Majesty, be careful.

708
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,470
- Your Majesty.
- Father.

709
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,310
Be careful.

710
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
Don't hurt it.

711
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,350
Father.

712
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,090
What's wrong with the Loong?

713
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,360
It wants to escape.

714
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,840
Stop it.

715
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,110
If you get any news about Pingyang,

716
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,990
remember to tell me.

717
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,080
Okay.

718
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,800
(One)

719
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,990
(Chop)

720
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,240
(to)

721
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,550
(Kill)

722
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,600
(All.)

723
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,470
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

724
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,070
(Is it afraid?)

725
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,590
Don't provoke it.

726
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:19,830
Stop.

727
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,360
Protect Lin'an.

728
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,960
Don't be afraid.

729
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,320
Protect His Majesty.

730
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
Don't come near. It won't hurt anyone.

731
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,640
Don't be afraid.

732
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,990
It's fine now.

733
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,840
Don't be afraid.

734
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:33,960
Come on.

735
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,560
Right, right.

736
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,070
It's fine.

737
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,080
Don't be afraid.

738
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,240
Don't be afraid.

739
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,990
Good.

740
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,870
Father.

741
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,310
Brothers,

742
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,440
you're responsible
for taking care of it, right?

743
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,920
Does it eat a lot usually?

744
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:19,320
- Father.
- Are you injured?

745
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,240
It's alright.

746
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,590
Don't be scared. It's fine now.

747
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,990
Greetings, Your Majesty.

748
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,880
You did well.

749
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,630
What's your name?

750
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,760
Your Majesty,

751
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,360
I am Xu Qi'an.

752
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,720
You are Xu Qi'an?

753
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,430
Your Majesty,

754
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,240
this is Xu Qi'an who's been
investigating the Sangbo Case.

755
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,470
He's the one who solved

756
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,090
the Tax Silver Case earlier.

757
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,550
A Guardian.

758
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,280
Lin'an has mentioned you to me.

759
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,840
You're indeed a young talent.

760
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,470
Father,

761
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,800
Xu Qi'an saved me.

762
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,190
Should he be rewarded?

763
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,670
Of course.

764
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,120
The Guardian, Xu Qi'an,

765
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,920
shall be awarded 1,000 liang of gold

766
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,250
and 500 bolts of fine silk and satin

767
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,280
for protecting the princess.

768
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,590
It's not enough.

769
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,720
He saved my life.

770
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,720
I owe him one.

771
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,590
Father, please pardon

772
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,240
his death penalty.

773
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,720
I've already granted him

774
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,630
a chance to redeem himself.

775
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,960
Once spoken,

776
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,670
it cannot be changed midway.

777
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,630
The deadline

778
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,760
is still half a month.

779
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,590
If you can solve the Sangbo Case,

780
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:00,030
I will naturally pardon
your death sentence.

781
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

782
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,630
