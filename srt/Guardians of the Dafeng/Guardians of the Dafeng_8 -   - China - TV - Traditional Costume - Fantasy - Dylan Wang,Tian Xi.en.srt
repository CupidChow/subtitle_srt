00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,040
I told you

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
to practice hard.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,710
Sorry, sir. My bad!

43
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,080
Sorry, I lost control in excitement.

44
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,960
I didn't mean to hit you.

45
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,550
My apologies.

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,870
Xu Qi'an?

47
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,670
Mr. Yang.

48
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,920
He's your direct supervisor,

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Li Yuchun,

50
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,040
Silver Gong Li.

51
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,670
Greetings,

52
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,830
Silver Gong Li.

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,080
Dafeng Special Unit.

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,430
What unit?

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,510
Good job.

56
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't do it again.

57
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,200
We met once earlier.

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,430
Do you remember?

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,830
You know each other?

60
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,640
Great.

61
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,870
Silver Gong Li,

62
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,950
he's

63
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,590
all yours.

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,870
Take good care of him.

65
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,830
Good day, Mr. Yang.

66
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
Mr. Li,

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,800
you were on duty that day.

68
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,480
I was conquered

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,640
by your charisma

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,830
at first sight.

71
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Being able to serve under you

72
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,520
is sheer bliss.

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
I don't remember seeing you.

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,240
Great wits have short memories.

75
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,430
It's understandable.

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,560
But back then, I did...

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
Enough of your flattery!

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,350
My people must have

79
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,960
a clear conscience.

80
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,560
If I find out

81
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,960
you crossed the line,

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
whoever you are,

83
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,390
whoever you know,

84
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,350
I'll deal with you lawfully

85
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,470
with no mercy!

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
Yes.

87
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,070
Chief.

88
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,600
Yes!

89
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,640
(Haoqi Tower)
I'm officially a Guardian!

90
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,020
(Moon Palace)
Your Highness.

91
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,680
Here's Xu Qi'an's aptitude test result
from Lord Wei.

92
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,830
Please take a look.

93
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,960
You're paid as a court official.

94
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,760
You live off the people's resources.

95
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,700
You can easily oppress
the common people,

96
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,560
but you can't fool the heavens.

97
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,470
(A+)
There hasn't been an A+ for years.

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,760
It's sharp of you

99
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,230
to select such a talent, Your Highness.

100
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,230
Princess has arrived!

101
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,630
Huaiqing,

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,830
did you recommend men to the Guardians?

103
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,110
Yes.

104
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,560
They're the emperor's eyes and ears.

105
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,560
I recommend people to them

106
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,760
to expand their talent pool

107
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,880
for the sake of the Dafeng.

108
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,830
Same here.

109
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,200
To make our state better,

110
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
I'm doing my utmost

111
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,080
and working day and night.

112
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,030
I have work to do.

113
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,080
Suit yourself.

114
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,760
Hold on.

115
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,390
I'm not done yet.

116
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,550
Gang,

117
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,680
show Grand Princess

118
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,120
the level of the man we recommended.

119
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,980
Zhao Jia,

120
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,390
B+!

121
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,030
B+?

122
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,000
What does it mean?

123
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,520
The Guardians have strict entry standards.

124
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,200
Getting a B+ means Zhao Jia is

125
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,520
one of the best.

126
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,120
As his name suggests,

127
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,270
he'll rise to the "Jia" Level

128
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,560
or A Level.

129
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,880
A Level?

130
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,230
What does that mean?

131
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,470
A Level is

132
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,030
awarded to Gold Gongs.

133
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,560
They're said to be rising stars
in the Guardians.

134
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,230
It seems that the best ones recommended

135
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,230
by Grand Princess

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,830
only got Bs.

137
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,960
I see.

138
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,080
Who knows

139
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,200
a random one I chose

140
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,790
would be a perfect Guardian?

141
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,710
Did anyone get a B

142
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,830
among the ones you recommended?

143
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,060
(For Grand Princess)
Let me see!

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can't I?

145
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,960
I want to know.

146
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,040
You're scared?

147
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,880
I have work

148
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,720
to do.

149
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,790
So do I.

150
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,350
Let me see. I'll be quick.

151
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,230
- Hey...
- You...

152
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,120
Crown Prince has arrived!

153
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,590
Brother!

154
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,000
(Crown Prince)
Why were you so loud?

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,200
Go back to your palace.

156
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,790
Huaiqing

157
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,230
recommended someone to the Guardians.

158
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,710
I want to see

159
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,710
what kind of talent he is.

160
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,430
Huaiqing,

161
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,910
how good is he?

162
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,120
May I take a look?

163
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,910
If there's nothing else,

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,320
I'll take my leave.

165
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Open it!

166
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,780
(New Copper Gong, Xu Qi'an's Result, A+)

167
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,320
She's indeed sharp.

168
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
She chose

169
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,640
a rare talent.

170
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,960
Xu Qi'an?

171
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,020
(A+)

172
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,830
A+...

173
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,750
- Lin'an! Are you ill?
- Unfair!

174
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,920
6 Bamboos.

175
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,160
Play it.

176
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,160
Not that one.

177
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,800
Gentlemen should be quiet.

178
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,230
Mahjong is a game of tactics.

179
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,200
Every tile has its...

180
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,110
Go back to study.

181
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,680
You'll lose, Mrs. Ma.

182
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,590
Ningyan?

183
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,200
Why are you back?

184
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,630
I miss you.

185
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
But I haven't achieved anything.

186
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,760
Don't worry. I'll help you.

187
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,470
The capital is too dangerous.

188
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,870
All the more reason

189
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,350
for us to stick together as a family

190
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,350
(Xu)
to forge ahead

191
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,510
and help each other.

192
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,470
Take my bag.

193
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,320
Here.

194
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,280
Some attitude!

195
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
Hey, I have a gift for you.

196
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,190
Second...

197
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,470
Sage's Knife!

198
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,310
Ningyan,

199
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,990
how dare you steal it?

200
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,800
If others find out,

201
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,320
our whole clan will be killed!

202
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,870
I didn't touch it.

203
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,120
It's fake.

204
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,400
It's to encourage you

205
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,560
to study hard.

206
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,870
I almost died of fright!

207
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,750
Let me see.

208
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,470
It looks so real.

209
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,960
Where are your parents?

210
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Are they home?

211
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,750
I miss them, too, after so long.

212
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,470
They're back.

213
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,500
Knowing that you had left,

214
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
they...

215
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,830
Did they go to find me?

216
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,710
You shouldn't have told them.

217
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,800
What if they left unprepared in a rush?

218
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,590
You're right about that.

219
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,510
They are in a rush.

220
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,510
Silly boy.

221
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,920
100 liang, furniture included?

222
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,510
I can help you move right now!

223
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,590
We'll turn the soil here.

224
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,200
You can grow plants.

225
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,080
Yes. Although this is the wing,

226
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,440
it's in the city center.

227
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,140
(Peace and Prosperity)
Near the East Market

228
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,560
and the Moon Resto!

229
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,160
You'll have everything you need.

230
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
The school is on the left.

231
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,400
I know the teacher there well.

232
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,350
I can talk to him

233
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,710
to look after your children.

234
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,590
That's right.

235
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,800
80 liang?

236
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,800
How about 50?

237
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,990
Name your price.

238
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,040
- This dump isn't worth that much.
- Free.

239
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,110
- We'll pay you.
- Enough.

240
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,470
- A waste of time!
- Come back.

241
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,630
No one's interested. Now what?

242
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,160
All for nothing.

243
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,920
Alright. Keep trying tomorrow.

244
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Fine. That boy won't be back anyway.

245
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,630
We have plenty of time.

246
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,470
Not anymore.

247
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,110
It's not what it looks like.

248
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,200
We aren't selling your house.

249
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,200
It's for rent.

250
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,630
When you're away,

251
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,350
it's a waste to leave it empty, right?

252
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,710
We can get some rent money.

253
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,710
No, wait!

254
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,830
Uncle, Aunt,

255
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,960
you two are

256
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,470
so

257
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,990
clever

258
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,800
money-wise!

259
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,160
Don't mistake it.

260
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,640
- Let's talk it out.
- Yes, right.

261
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,470
Stop! Calm down!

262
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,400
Family, huh?

263
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
My house was up for sale as soon as I left.

264
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,230
- No.
- Am I not your family?

265
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,320
- You are.
- Of course!

266
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,750
- Will you sell it again?
- No, no!

267
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,400
It's not for sale but for rent.

268
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,710
Rent...

269
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,350
Alright.

270
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,110
You know what? I'm hungry.

271
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,760
You are?

272
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll go to the kitchen to cook a meal

273
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,200
to welcome you back!

274
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,560
Yes, I'll go get you drinks.

275
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,440
Good ones!

276
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,560
Is that it?

277
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,760
What?

278
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Stay out of it. Let's go!

279
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,630
- Help me cook!
- I...

280
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,630
I can't cook.

281
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,710
Let go of me!

282
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,990
You've seen enough.

283
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,110
Mind your own business.

284
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,510
Go play mahjong.

285
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,430
What?

286
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,830
You've reached the Qi Stage?

287
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,470
Did someone of the Spirit Stage help you?

288
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,310
No.

289
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,830
I did marrow cleansing

290
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,510
with the liquid in my office.

291
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,110
- Then I had an herbal bath.
- Liquid?

292
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,350
It took a long while.

293
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,400
When I finished,

294
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,430
the Inner City had closed.

295
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,710
I couldn't come back.

296
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
And, Uncle,

297
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,750
I've been enlightened.

298
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,040
That liquid?

299
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,120
Let me smell it.

300
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,350
What are you doing?

301
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,230
That's not cheap.

302
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,280
Did your office give it to you for free?

303
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,430
No.

304
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,630
"Guardian"?

305
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,990
You're a Guardian now?

306
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,990
What happened?

307
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,040
Well,

308
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,510
thanks to Grand Princess.

309
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,280
Grand Princess?

310
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,230
I was as clueless as you.

311
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,920
We had met once at the Bureau.

312
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,440
Was it because I let her go first,

313
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,200
or because

314
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,960
I'm charming,

315
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,040
irresistible,

316
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,630
and lovable?

317
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,080
When you wrote poems at the Academy,

318
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,280
she was also there.

319
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,160
She was impressed

320
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,960
by them.

321
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,560
You made her remember you

322
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,470
and want to recruit you.

323
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,310
What a shame.

324
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,350
She only likes my poems.

325
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,710
But be careful.

326
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
Ningyan,

327
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
be cautious.

328
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,990
Grand Princess is deep.

329
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,200
She studied at the Academy for years.

330
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,560
Wei Yuan is

331
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,200
sort of her master.

332
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,590
She's a top Go player.

333
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,160
She recommended you

334
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,630
to the Guardians for a reason.

335
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,920
Cijiu,

336
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:30,750
you seem to know the powerful well.

337
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,400
All students

338
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,080
see Lord Wei and her as role models.

339
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,510
It's natural

340
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,710
that I know them.

341
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,680
Tell me

342
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,280
what Lord Wei is like.

343
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,440
What are his hobbies?

344
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,470
What food does he like?

345
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,320
When is his birthday?

346
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,230
Does he have any quirks?

347
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,280
Ningyan,

348
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,350
don't try to take a shortcut.

349
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,830
What's that supposed to mean?

350
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,350
I'm catering to his pleasure.

351
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,190
Think about it.

352
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,830
If I make Lord Wei happy,

353
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,080
the Xu Clan will rise to the top, right?

354
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,750
Or you'll be digging your own grave.

355
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,830
Father, knock some sense into him.

356
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,800
Where did he learn to play tricks?

357
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,350
Cijiu,

358
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,040
he's being thorough.

359
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,280
Tell him everything you know.

360
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,350
But, Ningyan,

361
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,560
the Guardian Yamen

362
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,350
isn't like your office.

363
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,640
You must

364
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,630
tread carefully there.

365
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,320
Do not annoy the Grand Princess.

366
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,160
I know.

367
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,990
How about

368
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,440
you recommend me to them, too?

369
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,870
Once I join the Guardians,

370
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,230
I'll be able to help you,

371
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,070
right?

372
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,280
You also

373
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,870
want to be a Guardian?

374
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,630
We can have each other's backs.

375
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,080
You'll have to

376
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,560
pass the intelligence test.

377
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,350
That's right up my alley!

378
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,280
Uncle,

379
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
listen,

380
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,470
there's something

381
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,560
in one of my hands.

382
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,750
You may ask us questions.

383
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,510
One of us will tell the truth.

384
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,920
The other will lie.

385
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
Begin.

386
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,870
What lie?

387
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,110
He's speaking metaphorically.

388
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,950
Yes.

389
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,470
What metaphor?

390
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,920
Let's go back to talk about Lord Wei.

391
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,950
Let's go.

392
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,920
It hasn't begun!

393
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
Where are you going?

394
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,540
(Copper Gong Xu Qi'an's Result)

395
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,550
Lin'an.

396
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Brother,

397
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,710
Huaiqing

398
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,470
walked all over me!

399
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,750
You provoked her first,

400
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,800
while she remained lenient.

401
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,990
Whatever.

402
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,400
Please enjoy.

403
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,640
Forget it.

404
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,070
I'm mad. Take them away.

405
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,240
Princess,

406
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,710
Crown Prince brought them for you.

407
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,200
Hold on!

408
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,200
It's good.

409
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,400
Better than Imperial Chefs'.

410
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,990
Eat with me, Brother.

411
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,710
Look at you!

412
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,920
You're more like

413
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,920
a child than a princess.

414
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,760
You know,

415
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,310
Grandmother will turn 80 next year.

416
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,510
Father has always been filial.

417
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,790
Her birthday is important.

418
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
There'll be a general amnesty

419
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,510
and a Poetry Contest at the Taixing Palace

420
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,750
to celebrate it.

421
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,840
Don't you worry.

422
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,960
I've gathered tons of talents

423
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,070
for the Poetry Contest.

424
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,160
I...

425
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,070
I don't want you to join it.

426
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,310
Mother is strict.

427
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,440
She doesn't accept failure.

428
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,960
As a princess,

429
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,880
you'll be compared

430
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,960
with Huaiqing in everything

431
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,030
by Mother

432
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,440
and everyone else.

433
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,070
Your Highness,

434
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,230
did it go well?

435
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,840
Lin'an is spoiled

436
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,310
and acts on impulse.

437
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,920
If she insists on joining the Contest,

438
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,070
who knows what trouble she'll cause?

439
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,990
If you talk to her nicely,

440
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,680
she'll change her mind.

441
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,230
What she did at the Bureau is terrible.

442
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,550
One more accident

443
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,440
and we'll be a laughingstock.

444
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,590
Gang,

445
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,710
pack things up.

446
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,760
Starting tomorrow,

447
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,070
we'll be living outside the Palace.

448
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,550
We're living comfortably here.

449
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,750
Why move out?

450
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,270
It's for the Poetry Contest.

451
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,350
It's easier

452
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,030
to recruit talents outside.

453
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,790
No, Princess.

454
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,600
Noble Consort scolded you not long ago.

455
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,920
She won't let you go.

456
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,070
Relax.

457
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,640
As long as I can help Brother,

458
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,230
she won't blame me.

459
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,750
But

460
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,640
didn't Crown Prince

461
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,070
tell you to stay out of the Contest?

462
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,310
He lied.

463
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,030
He only

464
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,310
said so to comfort me.

465
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,470
The truth is

466
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,030
he hopes I can help him as his sister.

467
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,880
Are you sure?

468
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,710
Of course. We're siblings.

469
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,440
I know what's on his mind.

470
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,960
Besides,

471
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,600
he's done so much for me.

472
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,680
Can't I do something in return?

473
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,990
It's settled.

474
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,120
Starting tomorrow,

475
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,070
we'll recruit as many talents as possible

476
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,990
for the Contest.

477
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,630
But

478
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,920
your other siblings

479
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
have started since the New Year.

480
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,400
At this point,

481
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,600
all the good ones must've been taken.

482
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,440
Don't worry.

483
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,030
We'll see.

484
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,520
Oh,

485
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,160
give out

486
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,400
the Milk Cakes.

487
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,060
(Copper Gong Xu Qi'an's Result)

488
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,380
(Imperial Pet, Loong)

489
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,040
How long has he

490
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,400
been like that?

491
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,590
Don't know.

492
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,070
When I started cooking at dawn,

493
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,470
he was already there.

494
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,680
Xu Ningyan.

495
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,030
Look. Does this suit fit me?

496
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,270
Why do I feel the cuffs are tight?

497
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,510
What are you doing?

498
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,920
Aren't you going to eat breakfast?

499
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,110
I know it.

500
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,840
Due to my martial arts training lately,

501
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,070
I've become

502
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,440
more muscular.

503
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,160
No wonder the pants are tight, too.

504
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,990
I was too excited

505
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,070
to measure myself yesterday.

506
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,990
I'll go get a new suit.

507
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,070
A brand-new suit!

508
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,120
Is he insane?

509
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,160
He doesn't look like himself.

510
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,360
A few days ago,

511
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,200
he refused to go to work.

512
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,710
Now, he's all worked up.

513
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,990
Things have changed.

514
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,200
He's become a Guardian.

515
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Even constables are afraid of him.

516
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,270
They might bribe him in the future.

517
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:29,920
Don't say that.

518
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,470
He'd never take bribes.

519
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,030
I think he really wants to help the people.

520
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,790
That's why he cherishes this job.

521
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,710
He's back!

522
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,920
Take a look.

523
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,120
I think this saber

524
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,070
and my suit

525
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,120
don't match.

526
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,070
They do.

527
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,310
Good.

528
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,230
Guardian, Copper Gong Xu Qi'an,

529
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,720
is going to work.

530
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,070
Show-off!

531
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,880
I wasn't like him, right?

532
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
You were hotter.

533
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,830
Let's go!

534
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,400
Guardians' Routine: One,

535
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,790
confiscate.

536
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,550
In the Dafeng,

537
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,790
Guardians can arrest

538
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,750
any law-breakers

539
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,160
no matter who they are

540
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,070
without a warrant.

541
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,710
Hence the saying,

542
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,270
"Do no wrong,

543
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,640
and fear no Guardians."

544
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,600
Guardians' Routine: Two,

545
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,680
interrogate.

546
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,510
Guardians use tactics

547
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,710
to investigate cases,

548
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,920
gather evidence,

549
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,120
and make arrests.

550
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,120
We have the right

551
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,400
to interrogate arrested officials.

552
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,510
Others can't interfere.

553
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,510
One more rule.

554
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,200
No one can visit prisoners

555
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,400
without Mr. Nangong's permission.

556
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,360
One more pot.

557
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,440
Guardians' Routine: Three,

558
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,750
watch officials

559
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,840
and gather intel.

560
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,440
In the Dafeng,

561
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,310
anyone can be

562
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,070
the Guardians' eyes and ears

563
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,680
and help.

564
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,790
(Virtue)
Tianji Tower is off-limits.

565
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,600
It gathers intel from everywhere.

566
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,790
No one can go near it

567
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,120
except the Guardians.

568
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,750
We can investigate

569
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,440
every ministry in the state.

570
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,260
(Rites, Gui Zi)

571
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,310
The best intel network is here!

572
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,440
It's constantly collecting, analyzing,

573
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,990
and summarizing intel.

574
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,270
All those,

575
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,550
plus handling cases

576
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,160
and patrols,

577
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,600
are the Guardian's Routine.

578
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,590
Xu Qi'an,

579
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,030
are you ready?

580
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,990
Yes, sir.

581
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,470
I'm born ready!

582
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:12,550
So,

583
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,990
are we going to confiscate,

584
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,960
interrogate,

585
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,680
or deliver intel?

586
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,630
Song...

587
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,510
You're new here.

588
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,750
Sort all these old files.

589
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,520
But

590
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,470
what about the Routine?

591
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,120
This is part of it.

592
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,960
Guardians' Routine: Four,

593
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,920
sort files.

594
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,540
(Sort Files)

595
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,110
Song,

596
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,680
I'm not done yet!

597
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,550
It's locked!

598
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
Song!

599
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,840
Guys! Wait!

600
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,750
Come on. Let's talk.

601
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,310
I just came. Don't lock me here.

602
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,510
Don't do this to me.

603
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,640
No negotiation.

604
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,840
It's Chief's order.

605
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,230
Let him sort files.

606
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,470
He can't go anywhere.

607
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,360
Chief, I think

608
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,470
it's a bit mean.

609
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,270
What's wrong?

610
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
He doesn't belong to us!

611
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,640
He can quit anytime.

612
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,120
I understand.

613
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,920
I get it.

614
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,200
Chief mistook it.

615
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,600
Wait. Let me out. I'll explain it to him.

616
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,990
You mistook it, not him.

617
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,840
He doesn't like you.

618
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,710
Trust me. I can explain...

619
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,880
Watch your fingers,

620
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,200
arms, and elbows.

621
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,990
Guards!

622
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,160
Seal all the windows!

623
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,680
So not worth it.

624
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,940
(Three Days Later)

625
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,150
Father,

626
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,550
it's late. Why hasn't Ningyan come back?

627
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,200
I'll go to his office to check later.

628
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,920
They can't wear him out like this.

629
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,510
He's not a child.

630
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,070
He has to be toughened.

631
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,400
Don't worry too much.

632
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,270
He's fine.

633
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,680
Your words sound familiar.

634
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,120
Did you say them earlier?

635
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,070
He's back!

636
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,510
What did I tell you?

637
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,570
Ningyan.

638
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,070
Does

639
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,440
Xu Qi'an live here?

640
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,840
Yes, that's right.

641
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,160
By Chief's order,

642
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,070
send Xu Qi'an and...

643
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,070
Files, right?

644
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,550
That way.

645
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,470
- Come in.
- Come on in.

646
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,600
Go, go, go.

647
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,960
It's already late.

648
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,230
- Here.
- Turn over there.

649
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,880
- Hurry up!
- Have some water.

650
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,030
- Thanks.
- This way.

651
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,360
I'll serve you tea.

652
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,880
- It's late.
- There's something else.

653
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,550
Close it!

654
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,600
Careful.

655
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,600
Almost forgot this.

656
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,200
Our doors and windows have been nailed.

657
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,120
But lately,

658
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,550
he's become more skilled.

659
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,440
Take a look.

660
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,230
Feel free to nail any of them again.

661
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,510
Go ahead.

662
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
Are you really his uncle?

663
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,310
Yes, by blood!

664
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,600
Of course.

665
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,750
You should do it. It's your house after all.

666
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,590
Fine.

667
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,520
I'll go.

668
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,230
You can do it if you want.

669
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,590
No, thanks.

670
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Fine.

671
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,440
I'll do it.

672
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,800
Xu Qi'an,

673
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,550
your family is...

674
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,400
- great!
- Great!

675
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,510
So not worth it.

676
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,860
(Lake Villa)

677
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,720
What?

678
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,840
The 10th Prince is gathering talents, too?

679
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,200
He's only nine.

680
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,070
What about the...

681
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,120
Directorate of Education?

682
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,400
Too late.

683
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,070
The 7th Prince has

684
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,600
recruited their talents.

685
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,160
Those of the Zhiya School

686
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,550
have gone to the 4th Prince.

687
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,120
On my way to the Mingde School,

688
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,070
I saw the 8th Prince's eunuch

689
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,710
recruiting talents, too.

690
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,230
What to do?

691
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,720
Yunlu Academy!

692
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,710
Steal their students from Huaiqing!

693
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,550
I've tried.

694
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,790
They rejected you?

695
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,600
They said yes.

696
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
Where are they?

697
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,750
I didn't bring them over

698
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,120
after reading their poems.

699
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,840
Right.

700
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,270
They're good at

701
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,840
military tactics,

702
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,750
not poems.

703
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,510
I know, right?

704
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,880
They have so many students,

705
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,600
but none of them can write poems.

706
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,550
The one about seeing a friend off

707
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,440
at the Mianyang Pavilion

708
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,160
was taken from a constable.

709
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Really?

710
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,750
Take a look.

711
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,680
(Yang Ling)
"Shadows slant across shallow water.

712
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,120
Faint scent floats

713
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,160
in dim moonlight."

714
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,640
What do you think?

715
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,550
It...

716
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,600
It seems...

717
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,030
It came

718
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,880
from the Imperial Office of Music.

719
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,270
This unfinished masterpiece

720
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,440
has shaken the poetry circles.

721
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,200
Really?

722
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,750
I also heard

723
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,600
the 4th, 7th, 8th, and 10th Princes' men

724
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,030
waited for days

725
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,200
outside that place

726
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
to look for that poet

727
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,440
in order to

728
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,440
recruit him.

729
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,640
What a poem!

730
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,390
I want him.

731
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,880
Find that poet

732
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,600
at all costs.

733
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,870
Yes.

734
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Go now.

735
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,960
Sure.

736
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,550
"Yang Ling"?

737
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,180
(Unreasonable)

738
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,880
All done?

739
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,510
What are these?

740
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,470
They're

741
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,680
stickers.

742
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,920
I've put everything suspicious

743
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,120
and my thoughts of the cases

744
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,750
all on the stickers.

745
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,870
(Guardian)
That way,

746
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,200
(Zhaoyan)
the files remain clean,

747
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,550
and it's easier for you

748
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,710
to look for information.

749
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,230
Clever.

750
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,520
Song,

751
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,680
I've sorted all the files

752
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:08,310
and read the rules over and over.

753
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,640
Can we

754
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,510
start doing some real work?

755
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,240
Sure, sure.

756
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,350
Guangxiao,

757
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,990
is there work to do?

758
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,310
Yes.

759
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,510
- Of course.
- My man!

760
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,800
My man!

761
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,630
You tricked me!

762
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,550
Don't put it like that.

763
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,880
My man.

764
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,840
What are those?

765
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
Serve them.

766
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,790
Round 2.

767
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,880
Round 3.

768
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,920
Round 4.

769
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,590
One after another.

770
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,200
Watch your step, guys.

771
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,440
Guys,

772
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,480
thanks.

773
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,920
Close the door

774
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,550
tightly.

775
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Leave no cracks.

776
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,310
Got it.

777
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,310
Look,

778
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,360
these files might not

779
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,680
be confidential,

780
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,120
but keep them safe.

781
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,710
If they're leaked or damaged,

782
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,030
you'll be held accountable.

783
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,800
I...

784
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,040
Song!

785
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,040
Song!

786
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,070
Song!

787
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,790
Please talk to Chief for me.

788
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,120
Or at least ask him

789
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,880
when I can stop sorting those files.

790
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,790
I can't help you with that.

791
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,840
Let go of my leg.

792
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,990
No, unless you help me!

793
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,310
I'm getting depressed in this locked room!

794
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,640
Do you know this serious disease,

795
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,710
myopic eye?

796
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,470
I've become nearsighted.

797
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,920
So will I if you don't let me go!

798
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,270
- Let go!
- Help me, please!

799
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,380
Song!

800
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,270
Aren't we good, Song?

801
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,400
Please. Do me a favor.

802
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,510
Have some mercy.

803
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,360
I won't let you go!

804
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,470
I want real work!

805
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,030
- Xu Qi'an!
- Take me to work with you!

806
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,920
I'll fight back!

807
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,960
I want to work!

808
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,030
Watch your behind!

809
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,190
Stairs!

810
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,030
Copper Gong Song.

811
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,550
Silver Gong Li asked for you.

812
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,760
See? Chief asked for me!

813
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,470
Go back.

814
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,070
Go on sorting the files.

815
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,110
Chief asked to

816
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,190
see him, too.

817
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,510
A demon has been spotted in Mount Dahuang.

818
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,720
Many have been eaten.

819
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,880
Go to Taikang County to check.

820
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,320
If it's low-ranking,

821
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,030
kill it there.

822
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,400
The Municipal Office will join you.

823
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,510
Their people are right outside.

824
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,600
Yes, sir.

825
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,880
Xu Qi'an.

826
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,880
Go with them.

827
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,310
Yes, sir!

828
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,760
That mountain is steep.

829
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,470
You must work as a team.

830
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,310
Yes.

831
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,640
Also...

832
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,760
Saber, up by two inches.

833
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,150
Gong, one inch to the left.

834
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,950
Go now.

835
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,760
They asked for him by name.

836
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,470
What exactly is his background?

837
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,470
Xu Qi'an,

838
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,150
what's your background?

839
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,840
Why did Chief change his attitude to you?

840
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,910
Not sure.

841
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,240
Was it because I worked hard

842
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,360
on those files?

843
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,390
No way.

844
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,070
Everyone knows he's stubborn.

845
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
He'd never

846
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,280
change his mind easily.

847
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,550
I know it.

848
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,670
He's putting you in harm's way.

849
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,590
Right!

850
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,670
Last year, that guy, what was his name again?

851
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,760
He died in a task.

852
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,550
(Guardian)
You're so mean.

853
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,880
Say something, Guangxiao!

854
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,150
Help me finish my story.

855
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,630
Greetings, Guardians.

856
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,440
Guardians always travel by horse.

857
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,720
A carriage is unnecessary.

858
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,590
To catch the demon,

859
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,630
Mr. Chen asked the Astronomical Bureau

860
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,720
to assist us

861
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
with this case.

862
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,150
The Bureau?

863
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,240
Yes.

864
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,320
Guardian, Copper Gong Song Tingfeng,

865
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,110
greets those of the Bureau!

866
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,110
I've long heard

867
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,240
of your ethereal bearing.

868
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,960
Working with you is...

869
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,550
Stop dragging your feet.

870
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,030
Let's go!

871
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,030
Xu Qi'an,

872
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,470
stop dragging your feet! Let's go!

873
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,030
Yes.

874
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,190
Xu Qi'an.

875
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,070
Caiwei?

876
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,360
It really is you!

877
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,350
Forget that.

878
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Take the carriage.

879
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,390
Sure.

880
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,350
Eat this.

881
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,120
Thanks.

882
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,510
- He's in!
- I know!

883
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,960
What's going on?

884
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,400
So Chief chose me

885
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
for this task because of you.

886
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,400
Not exactly.

887
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,320
Yang Yan told me

888
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,030
you joined the Guardians.

889
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,920
It's better to bring you along

890
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,280
to work with them.

891
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,840
Gold Gong Yang?

892
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,280
I'm curious.

893
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,280
Why did you join the Guardians?

894
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,880
How did he know those of the Bureau?

895
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,200
Are you scared?

896
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,800
What? No.

897
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,880
He's well-connected.

898
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,510
You made him suffer. Aren't you afraid?

899
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,590
Not just me.

900
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,590
Weren't you there, too?

901
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,590
I treated him to dinner.

902
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,470
Let's talk about you.

903
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,400
The Tax Silver Case is over.

904
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,240
Why are you still with the Municipal Office?

905
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,240
Don't get me started!

906
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,360
Chen Hanguang

907
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,920
let me take all the credit for that case,

908
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,280
saying I found Zhou's embezzlement.

909
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,240
Wasn't it good?

910
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280
Not at all!

911
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,800
His Majesty said

912
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,150
I was born to solve cases

913
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,550
and had me follow up on the Tax Silver Case

914
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,670
until the silver

915
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,320
was fully recovered.

916
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,150
I'm mad!

917
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,110
Who asked you to stop?

918
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,390
Go!

919
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,470
What's their relationship?

920
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,110
They share a carriage. You tell me.

921
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:40,510
So have we with Gold Gongs Yang and Nangong.

922
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,920
You're good, Xu Qi'an!

923
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,200
You're doomed.

924
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,280
Xu Qi'an,

925
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,360
you are good.

926
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,550
This is beneath you, Mr. Xu!

927
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,390
I'll do it.

928
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,110
Sorry, I'm late.

929
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
So,

930
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,030
you must be hungry.

931
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,990
No, I'm not.

932
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,550
Yes, you are.

933
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,280
Take this.

934
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,310
Take it.

935
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,240
Song,

936
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,510
what's...?

937
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,670
I borrowed some money from you earlier.

938
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,960
Now, I'm no longer strapped.

939
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,400
I should pay you back.

940
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,400
When did I lend you money?

941
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,840
Think about it.

942
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,320
Oh, that day!

943
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,920
You remember it.

944
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,070
I sort files indoors.

945
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,440
There's nowhere I can spend it.

946
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,280
Feel free to go shopping.

947
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,120
I'll do your work.

948
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,280
It's a lot.

949
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,800
Can you handle the files?

950
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,990
Of course. I'll tell Chief myself.

951
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,830
Alright?

952
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,030
You'll help me?

953
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,400
Yes. Your business is also mine.

954
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Consider it done.

955
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,840
Where are you?

956
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,110
Answer me.

957
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,280
What's up?

958
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,870
Nothing.

959
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:01,760
Use this to buy drinks for the guys.

960
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,990
Thanks.

961
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,150
Mount Dahuang in northern Taikang

962
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,610
is over 1,000m high at the main peak.

963
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,400
It spreads over 10 kilometers.

964
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,150
It's rich in limestone,

965
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,280
supporting hundreds of families of miners.

966
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
Since the New Year,

967
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,190
a demon has been spotted in the waters there.

968
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,360
It goes ashore to eat humans.

969
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,550
Many miners have been killed.

970
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,630
The County Governor

971
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,800
kept that demon secret,

972
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,590
while they worked in the mountain as usual,

973
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,880
causing their tragic deaths.

974
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,670
Later, some merchants reported it

975
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:29,510
when they passed by this area.

976
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,240
Was this where miners dug limestone?

977
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,200
Yes.

978
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,150
Mount Dahuang owns fine limestone

979
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,320
and plenty of iron ore

980
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,400
to forge mining tools.

981
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,670
It's easier for miners

982
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,630
to build kilns here.

983
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,760
Digging limestone is low-cost

984
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,670
and highly profitable.

985
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,720
That's why the tax

986
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,840
is set a bit higher.

987
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,990
The ban on mining

988
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,400
left the locals no hope.

989
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,070
(High taxes make)

990
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,670
(people homeless.)

991
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,110
(Flesh and blood)

992
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,550
(of the people are exploited.)

993
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,070
It's odd.

994
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,030
What have you found?

995
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,880
Nothing. That's why it's odd.

996
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,880
I looked around on the way up here.

997
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,760
At first, I thought the layers of peaks

998
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,880
blocked my view.

999
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,190
But look at this place.

1000
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,840
Traces of fights are everywhere,

1001
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,400
but I sense no energy of the demon.

1002
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,240
Sir,

1003
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,670
there's more in the cave.

1004
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,630
Let's go inside to look.

1005
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,310
Come on.

1006
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,590
He's bold.

1007
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,600
Be careful.

1008
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:09,210
Be careful.

1009
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,030
Why dig such a deep cave?

1010
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,030
We've been going for minutes

1011
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,120
but haven't reached the end.

1012
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,670
Maybe this is part of something.

1013
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,950
Be careful.

1014
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,360
