Simu.

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,750
Xu.

42
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,480
I was just

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,480
passing by.

44
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,830
Well, you...

45
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,040
I have nothing important.

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Go ahead with your serious matters.

47
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,110
I'm not in a hurry.
I can wait here for a while.

48
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,710
Mother, why didn't you knock?

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,320
I did.

50
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,920
Mrs. Xu.

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,800
I just remembered I have to go.

52
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,550
- I'll take my leave.
- Simu.

53
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,870
I came to deliver this to you.

54
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,560
- You're too kind.
- This is an heirloom

55
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
from my grandmother.

56
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,590
It's meant for my future
daughter-in-law.

57
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,040
Thank you, Mrs. Xu.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,710
Cijiu,

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,710
put it on Miss Wang

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,920
and see if it fits.

61
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,390
It fits perfectly.

62
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,520
What a match.

63
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,760
Cijiu,

64
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,550
try harder when you need to.

65
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,080
This...

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,680
Just as Mrs. Xu said.

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,030
It fits perfectly.

68
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,080
It's a great match.

69
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,470
It fits perfectly.

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,830
What a match.

71
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,270
You two should

72
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,560
get back to your business.

73
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,270
I just remembered I have to go.

74
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,150
I'll leave now.

75
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,850
You focus on your work.

76
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,030
Focus on your work.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,200
So, since...

78
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,270
Since my senior had left the mountain,

79
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,440
I'd decided to leave too.

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,150
In the world below the mountain...

81
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,640
I thought there'd be justice
and righteousness.

82
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,640
Instead, it was full of absurdity
and brute power.

83
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,760
Many told me

84
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,680
this is just how the world is.

85
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,520
I refused to believe it.

86
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,710
I insisted on fixing
these wolves and tigers

87
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,590
and cleansing this filthy
and corrupt world.

88
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,440
The world laughs at my recklessness.

89
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,960
So what if I'm reckless?

90
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,470
So what if I'm bold?

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,400
Well said.

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
Life is but a few decades.

93
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,080
We should act freely

94
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,270
and enjoy the moment.

95
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
Miss,

96
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,230
you are truly a heroine in the world,

97
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,200
open-minded and carefree.

98
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,680
That is

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,560
very unpretentious of you.

100
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
You've made me feel ashamed of myself.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,390
Mr. Chu, what about you?

102
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,230
Why did you embark

103
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,000
on this worldly path?

104
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,710
Why did I?

105
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,440
At four, I read poetry.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,390
At 12, I became a Juren.

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,710
At 18, I became a top scholar,

108
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,030
taught by Dongling's

109
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,000
Grand Preceptor.

110
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,620
(Ministry of Personnel)

111
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,790
What's wrong with your master?

112
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,680
Where is she at such a critical moment?

113
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,880
My master always acts as she pleases.

114
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,270
Right now, she might be

115
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,760
drinking merrily.

116
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,440
If we keep waiting,
it'll be dark soon.

117
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
No,

118
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,160
let's go.

119
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,470
Hurry up.

120
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,880
How shameless!

121
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,520
How could they kill your master?

122
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,470
They're worse than animals.

123
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,640
My master was full of passion,

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,470
dedicated to serving the country

125
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,640
and eradicating evildoers.

126
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,590
But the officialdom of the Dafeng

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,350
has been riddled with corruption

128
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,120
for too long.

129
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,000
Before he passed, my master told me

130
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,470
to stay away from the officialdom

131
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,470
and not follow his path.

132
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,030
I thought I had no way
to serve the country

133
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,470
and considered resigning and leaving.

134
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,120
But unexpectedly,

135
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,470
she appeared.

136
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,960
It was she

137
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
who taught me skills,

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,880
rekindling my desire
to serve the country.

139
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,990
Great.

140
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,920
Meeting a benefactor

141
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,040
is your heavenly fortune.

142
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,470
To have

143
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,630
a like-minded friend like you

144
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,830
is also

145
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,750
my destiny.

146
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,960
Well said.

147
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,470
You and I

148
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,160
are truly like-minded.

149
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,430
Cheers.

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,880
Mr. Chu,

151
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,680
as we share the same aspirations,

152
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,960
I have a suggestion.

153
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,840
We'd like to be sworn siblings today.

154
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,240
I shouldn't have decided this,

155
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,400
but since I'm a few years older,

156
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,740
I'll take the liberty to be
your elder brother.

157
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,830
Brother.

158
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,520
Sister.

159
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,510
I am Chu Yuanzhen.

160
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,510
I am Li Miaozhen.

161
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,230
We'd like to be sworn siblings today.

162
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,590
We do not wish to be born
on the same day

163
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,630
but hope to die

164
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,080
on the same day.

165
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,950
Li

166
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,630
Miaozhen?

167
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,160
Chu

168
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,040
Yuanzhen?

169
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,870
Earth Book No. 2,

170
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,990
Saintess of Heaven?

171
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,200
Earth Book No. 4,

172
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,830
Saint of Men?

173
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,960
How unfortunate.

174
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,280
How laughable.

175
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,630
Thank you, sir.

176
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,710
It's nothing.

177
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,750
Miss Su looks so beautiful
even in men's clothes.

178
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,280
The files are all here.

179
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,610
Please take your time, Miss.

180
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,750
If you need anything,

181
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,230
feel free to ask me.

182
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,000
Thank you.

183
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,080
There are so many.

184
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,440
It seems all the official records

185
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,980
since the Dafeng's founding are here.

186
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,040
Let's get started.

187
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,230
(Once we find the entourage roster,)

188
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,620
(we can figure out who he is)

189
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,190
(through the process of elimination.)

190
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,570
(Among the entourages,)

191
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,230
(above the Gold Gong,)

192
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,590
(a War Supervisor was also sent there.)

193
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,990
A War Supervisor?

194
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,920
Follow up.

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
(As it turns out,)

196
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,800
(it's him.)

197
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,230
Where's his name?

198
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,020
(Well-Governed)

199
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,160
What's going on?

200
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,180
(Su Hang, Grand Scholar
of the East Cabinet,)

201
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,140
(was executed
after a thorough investigation.)

202
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,040
Miss Su.

203
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,830
My father...

204
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,830
My father is dead.

205
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,160
Now, in this world,

206
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,200
I am the only one left.

207
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,850
You've been parted for over ten years.

208
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,830
Miss Su,

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,630
you must've expected this.

210
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,470
I'm sorry for your loss.

211
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,870
But you still have your master

212
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,040
and Miss Li.

213
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,400
They deeply care for you.

214
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,710
But I don't understand.

215
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,590
Though years have passed

216
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,470
and memories have faded,

217
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,990
I vaguely remember

218
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,920
how loving my parents were.

219
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,190
They treated each other with respect.

220
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,710
I don't understand why my father

221
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,230
would steal the secret treasure
with others,

222
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,750
ruining our family.

223
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,430
My condolences.

224
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,180
(The Censorate censor did collude
with Grand Scholar Su Hang.)

225
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,280
My father is willing to help Ningyan.

226
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,400
If you want to be an official,

227
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,560
he'll certainly lend you a hand.

228
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,280
It's not entirely like that.

229
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,320
I've said

230
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
I wish to be an official with dignity,

231
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,400
so I'll never use your father's name.

232
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,640
Doing so would only

233
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,300
make him look down on me even more.

234
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,400
Simu,

235
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,830
you can rest assured.

236
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,990
Everything I said today

237
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,510
comes from my heart.

238
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,280
Even if I had doubts before,

239
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,630
seeing your heart now,

240
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,920
I feel the same.

241
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,510
I'll never let you down.

242
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,630
Xu.

243
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,640
Simu.

244
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,440
My Lady,

245
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,080
we've arrived.

246
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,200
We've arrived so soon.

247
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,040
Well.

248
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,710
Well.

249
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,830
Let's call it a day?

250
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,630
Xu,

251
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,040
you should

252
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,800
go back and rest.

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,880
I seem to have left something

what should we do?

265
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,720
How about

266
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,840
I bring it over to you tomorrow?

267
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,200
That won't work.

268
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,120

How about

I go back with you

273
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,160
to fetch it?

274
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,470
Well,

275
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,920
in that case,

What?

283
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,780
She's gone again?

284
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,650
Yes, she's come and gone
seven or eight times.

285
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,230
Every time Miss Simu reaches the door,

286
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,200
for some reason,

287
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,800
she turns back and heads to Xu Mansion.

288
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,400
How ridiculous.

289
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,990
She's wandering around at night.

290
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,510
What does this look like?

291
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,240
Listen.

292
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,110
Tomorrow,

293
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,880
have her copy books at home.

294
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,070
Unless I say otherwise,

295
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,910
she can't leave home.

296
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,960
Yes.

297
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,230
How about the two people
in the backyard?

298
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,790
They were going through the records.

299
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,200
I don't know
what they were searching for.

300
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,710
However, I've followed your orders.

301
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,550
Once it got dark,

302
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,220
I put the records back in the archives

303
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,070
and sent them away.

304
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,070
Good.

305
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,920
The Guardians and my Cabinet

306
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,960
have never been on good terms.

307
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,070
Letting them do this is enough.

308
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,600
Understood, My Lord.

309
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,510
After Simu returns,

310
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,400
ask her to wait for me
in the inner hall.

311
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,240
Yes.

312
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,680
Mr. Xu.

313
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,120
There's a blank here.

314
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,200
Thank you.

315
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,070
Mr. Xu, well...

316
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,280
Take it.

317
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

318
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,480
Mr. Xu,

319
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,340
the Prime Minister needed me,

320
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,360
so it took a little time.

321
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,790
This is the file I found earlier.

322
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,880
Please see if it's useful.

323
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,440
- Thank you.
- Then...

324
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,360
Take it.

325
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,470
Thank you.

326
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,200
There is one too, Mr. Xu.

327
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,040
Good.

328
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,520
Everyone,

329
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,600
please give me the files with blanks.

330
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,710
Ten liang of silver

331
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,680
for one blank.

332
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
My Lord.

333
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,840
My Lord, here.

334
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,990
(So far,)

335
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,750
(all the blanks are arranged
chronologically)

336
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,790
(from low to high positions)

337
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,310
(with no duplicates.)

338
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,160
(As expected,)

339
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,840
(all these blanks)

340
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,230
(belong to the same person.)

341
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,960
(These files clearly record)

342
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,030
(this person's life trajectory.)

343
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,360
(But for some reason,
his name has been erased.)

344
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,310
(Who is this person?)

345
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,990
I didn't expect us
to arrive so soon again.

346
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,510
Well,

347
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,400
I'll go back now.

348
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,840
Something's wrong?

349
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,400
So beautiful.

350
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,310
How surprising.

351
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,990
It's the 15th tonight.

352
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,840
With the moon accompanying us,

353
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,400
our time was not wasted.

354
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,540
Why haven't you unsheathed your sword?

355
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
The time is not right.

356
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Three years from now,

357
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,660
in the battle between heaven and men,

358
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,750
your blood will be used

359
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,920
to refine this sword.

360
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,510
Then you must live to see that day.

361
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,790
Let's have another round.

362
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,680
Sure.

363
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,870
Have another round.

364
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,790
Who are you?

365
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,920
How dare you cause chaos
in the Dafeng capital?

366
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,510
Today is not suitable for a duel.

367
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,720
Let's fight another day.

368
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,030
I'll be ready anytime.

369
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
Trying to run?

370
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,310
The trajectory is finally clear.

371
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,790
(In Yuanjing Year 10,)

372
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,600
(he came in 3rd
in the Imperial Examination)

373
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,020
(and served as an Imperial Diarist.)

374
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,790
(In Yuanjing Year 12,)

375
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,360
(he became a censor in the Censorate.)

376
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,680
(In Yuanjing Year 15,)

377
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,340
(he served as the War Supervisor
in the Battle of Linyuan Pass.)

378
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,200
(That same year, he should've been
rewarded for his success,)

379
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,610
(but things took a sudden turn.)

380
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,160
(He somehow got involved in something)

381
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,400
(and was sentenced to death.)

382
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,840
(His subordinates, including Su Hang,
were also purged.)

383
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,960
(This was his last appearance.)

384
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,840
(Who is this person?)

385
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,550
(Why has his name been erased?)

386
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,200
How bold!

387
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,840
Alright, tell me.

388
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,150
Tell me

389
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,840
how to scold you.

390
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,990
Go ahead.

391
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,160
You ungrateful thing.

392
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,470
How dare you deceive me

393
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,600
and let outsiders stay?

394
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,790
Go accept your punishment.

395
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,230
- Yes.
- Get out!

396
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,750
Why are you still here?

397
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,510
- Please calm down.
- He should suffer.

398
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,400
Calm down.

399
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,550
It's not his fault.

400
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,990
My case was urgent,

401
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,960
so he helped me.

402
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,990
I wasn't being helpful enough?

403
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,160
You were very helpful.

404
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,880
Everyone knows

405
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,880
my Cabinet and the Guardians
have never been on good terms.

406
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,270
Yes, yes.

407
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,750
I knew you focused on your case,

408
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,550
so I tried my best to help you.

409
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:56,990
Can't you see it?

410
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,070
Yes, yes.

411
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,270
But you're still not satisfied
and want to ruin my rules.

412
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
Come on.

413
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,230
Is this how the Guardians do things?

414
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,550
Is this how it works?

415
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,830
Mr. Wang,

416
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,840
please calm down.

417
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,990
As for the rules,

418
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,160
to be honest,

419
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,310
I've found the necessary clues
for the case.

420
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,960
It was due to negligence
by the Personnel

421
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,160
that things were delayed.

422
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,000
You jerk!

423
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
What negligence is that?

424
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400
You're talking nonsense.

425
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,310
Do you believe

426
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,270
I'll charge you with framing?

427
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,120
My Lord,

428
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,310
the records in the Personnel

429
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,440
matters to the country.

430
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,540
They should be

431
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,860
regularly checked, sorted,

432
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,160
and clarified for doubts, right?

433
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,030
Of course.

434
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,960
Every file is checked
by a designated person,

435
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,070
and any suspicions

436
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,960
are immediately reported to the Cabinet.

437
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,310
Good.

438
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,310
May I ask

439
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,200
if any of the suspicions on these files

440
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
have been reported?

441
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,360
What suspicions?

442
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,700
(Censorate censor)
What?

443
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
(Censorate censor)

444
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,980
(Came in 3rd)

445
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,640
My Lord, please calm down.

446
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,750
I came here today to handle the case,

447
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,310
not to oppose the Personnel.

448
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,310
These suspicions

449
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,200
are crucial to the case.

450
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,400
If you could offer some guidance,

451
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,550
I'll certainly

452
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,230
remember it.

453
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Sit down.

454
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,470
Calm down.

455
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,990
Sit down.

456
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,470
No, I'll stand and listen.

457
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,640
I told you to sit.

458
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,600
Alright, I'll sit and listen.

459
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,270
Did Lord Wei ask you to investigate?

460
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,520
No.

461
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,750
I was entrusted by someone else.

462
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,040
You...

463
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,640
What have you found?

464
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,430
I'll explain when we get back.

465
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:15,910
Bro,

466
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,030
what happened?

467
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,430
Mr. Xu.

468
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,450
It's so late.
Anything wrong with the Guardians?

469
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:25,300
Thugs caused a disturbance
on South Street,

470
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,750
and they even injured Mr. Nangong.

471
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,640
They beat Mr. Nangong?

472
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,270
(I wonder)

473
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,200
(who this hero is.)

474
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,120
Right now, Mr. Nangong is furious

475
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,640
and has gathered all the Guardians,

476
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,550
searching the city.

477
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,710
He said he'd turn over the capital
to find these two.

478
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,970
Are they male or female?

479
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,920
One male and one female,

480
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,790
working together.

481
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,920
Did anyone see their faces?

482
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,880
It was dark.

483
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
We couldn't see them,

484
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,960
but one of them wore light armor
and carried a silver spear.

485
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,680
A silver spear?

486
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,270
I understand now. Keep looking.

487
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,110
Yes.

488
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,200
It...

489
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,680
Won't be...

490
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,270
Her, right?

491
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,960
No. 2,

492
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,600
where are you?

493
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,780
(Xu Mansion)

494
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,880
We arrived again.

495
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,400
It's getting late.

496
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,870
Well,

497
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,840
how about you head back first?

498
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,790
Since that's the case,

499
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,200
I guess...

500
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,470
Well.

501
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,640
I'll go back now.

502
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,840
Next time I see you,

503
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:12,030
I'll turn you into candy hawthorns.

504
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,010
Sorry for disturbing you.

505
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,070
(Xu Mansion)

506
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,920
Simu,

507
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,750
I'll walk you back.

508
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,200
I think it's still early.

509
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,680
Can you be gentler?

510
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,550
My aunt just had the craftsmen fix it.

511
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,790
Before she could enjoy it,

512
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,310
you've already ruined it like this.

513
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,070
Stop talking.

514
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,750
I'll compensate you.

515
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,030
Why make such a fuss?

516
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,270
What happened?

517
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,790
I ran into No. 4.

518
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,360
No. 4?

519
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,280
It's me.

520
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,470
Mr. Chu.

521
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,070
Why do you look like this?

522
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,840
The Guardians are after me.

523
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,310
What happened?

524
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,840
It's a long story.

525
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,400
It's all because of No. 2.

526
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,270
My sect has a blood feud with his.

527
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,200
I just regret not killing him.

528
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,680
Lucky for him to run fast.

529
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,030
If I meet him again,

530
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,600
I'll beat him until he cries
for his mother,

531
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,750
begging for mercy.

532
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,360
On, no.

533
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,400
I told him about my senior.

534
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,750
What should I do now?

535
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,400
What should I do?

536
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,750
Why did you talk so much?

537
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,620
You came to my house,

538
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,940
and you either beat up my family

539
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,990
or destroyed my furniture.

540
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,400
How am I supposed to explain this?

541
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,230
- I won't use my spear. Let's fight.
- Wait.

542
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,370
- Let's fight.
- Don't move.

543
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,200
Luckily,

544
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,750
I haven't said too much about my master.

545
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:32,440
Just stay at my place

546
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
for a couple of days.

547
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,280
Alright.

548
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,640
That leading Gold Gong
is difficult to deal with.

549
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,960
This matter seems to have
stirred up a hornet's nest.

550
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,850
If Lord Wei decides to pursue this,

551
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,030
I'm not sure

552
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,790
how to explain it to my master.

553
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
Maybe

554
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,470
we can ask No. 3's brother for help.

555
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,840
He's a Guardian.

556
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,470
You mean Xu Qi'an?

557
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,440
Yes.

558
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,840
Xu Qi'an, I need you.

559
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,550
Reply quickly.

560
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:08,969
(No. 4)

561
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Who is it?

562
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,350
Nothing.

563
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,240
Let's continue.

564
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,990
His official career path is clear.

565
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,750
Su Hang was implicated by him

566
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,710
and got purged for some reason.

567
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,920
(Unknown)
Once we find out who he is,

568
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,640
we'll uncover the secret
behind Su Hang's death.

569
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,710
But who is he?

570
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,880
(Purpose unclear)
I don't know yet,

571
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,960
but I think

572
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,990
that what led to their execution

573
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,700
might have something to do with this.

574
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,230
Secret

575
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,970
treasure?

576
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,960
All these blanks

577
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,310
are probably for the same name.

578
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,360
But strangely,

579
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,400
he and I served in the same court,

580
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,470
yet I don't remember anyone like him.

581
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,600
Back then,

582
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,750
when I was in charge of the Personnel,

583
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,200
the first task was

584
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,470
to check all the previous files.

585
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,710
So, I didn't give up.

586
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,030
I changed my approach

587
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,230
and started following the timeline.

588
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,810
As expected, I made a discovery.

589
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,680
Yuanjing Year 17.

590
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,550
That's right.

591
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,440
(Yuanjing Year 17)
The last blank in the timeline

592
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,310
is in Yuanjing Year 17.

593
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,030
I've gone through the old histories

594
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,310
and relevant letters,

595
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,600
and eventually,
I found a secret document

596
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,120
in the Judicial Review's archives.

597
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,960
In Yuanjing Year 17,

598
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,640
a treasure was stolen from the Palace.

599
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,470
What treasure was it?

600
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,710
The theft of a treasure
in the Palace is no small matter.

601
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,440
But it's not just me;

602
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,460
all the officials have no recollection

603
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,470
of this event either.

604
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,990
No recollection again?

605
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,990
In Yuanjing Year 17,

606
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,850
did something else major happen as well?

607
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,360
The Battle of Linyuan Pass.

608
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,000
Follow up.

609
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
(Linyuan Pass)

610
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,700
(Linyuan Pass)

611
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,670
Are you saying he took advantage
of the weak defense of the capital

612
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,150
during the Battle of Linyuan Pass

613
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,150
to steal the secret treasure?

614
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,240
I'm not sure
whether these two events are connected.

615
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,960
Perhaps it's a coincidence.

616
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,190
However, at that time,

617
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,550
I already realized

618
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,990
someone was deliberately
hiding the truth.

619
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,190
(War Supervisor)
Blanking the Personnel's files

620
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,440
without attracting others' attention

621
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,670
and leaving any traces behind.

622
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,510
I'm just a Prime Minister.

623
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,240
It may not be something I can handle.

624
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,800
If Lord Wei doesn't want to pursue this,

625
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,670
I advise you

626
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,590
to stop digging into it.

627
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,760
The trail

628
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,600
ends here.

629
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,540
We still don't know his identity

630
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,360
or what the stolen treasure was.

631
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,440
What could have been lost in the Palace?

632
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,990
And who is this nameless person?

633
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,280
All names have been erased.

634
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,800
If it were just a writing mistake,

635
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,760
then surely not every document
would be affected, right?

636
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,590
Could it be

637
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,590
that someone used a secret method

638
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,840
to erase this person's name?

639
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
(I understand now.)

640
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,920
(He first allied with Su Hang)

641
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,070
(to steal the treasure from the Palace)

642
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,960
(and then, to avoid capture,)

643
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,840
(used some sort of magic)

644
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,510
(during the Battle of Linyuan Pass)

645
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,030
(to erase all traces of himself.)

646
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,590
(If that's the case,)

647
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,990
(figuring out the source of that magic)

648
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,360
(or what the treasure actually was)

649
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,030
(is the key to this case.)

650
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,920
(How strange.)

651
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,880
(He not only stole the treasure)

652
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,030
(but also erased all traces of himself.)

653
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,990
(Then why cause trouble,)

654
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,630
(risking being discovered?)

655
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,470
(First, he blew up Sangbo,)

656
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,550
(and then he put Shen Shu inside me.)

657
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,840
(I'm just a mere Guardian.)

658
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,880
(I have nothing to do)

659
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,760
(with his actions.)

660
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,820
(Wait.)

661
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,080
(Maybe I do have something)

662
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,740
(to do with him.)

663
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,920
Inside you, there is something

664
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,290
that can help me nourish my severed arm.

665
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,720
What thing?

666
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,800
I only know

667
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,030
that thing

668
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,510
was not originally inside you.

669
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,070
Someone deliberately

670
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,800
put it there.

671
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,550
(Could it be)

672
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,360
(that the treasure
wasn't a physical object)

673
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,110
(but something that could be
placed inside the body?)

674
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,470
Maybe we should stop.

675
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,280
I've known my father's death.

676
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,800
My wish has been fulfilled.

677
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,550
There's no point

678
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,180
in continuing.

679
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,740
How can that be?

680
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,060
Don't rush into ending it.

681
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,020
There's definitely a secret behind this.

682
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,420
Xu Qi'an, don't you agree?

683
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,340
Recently,

684
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,880
I haven't been able to sleep at night.

685
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,860
Only by coming here to check on you

686
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,980
do I feel more at ease.

687
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,220
It's fine now.

688
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,220
Don't be afraid.

689
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,900
Am I being overly cautious?

690
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,300
It is afraid.

691
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,780
Who is it?

692
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,700
Stop!

693
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,100
You're from Tianyu.

694
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,460
My Dharma name is Duku.

695
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,820
I'm here

696
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,860
to meet your Supervisor.

697
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,260
The Supervisor doesn't welcome you.

698
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,820
The Dafeng does not welcome you.

699
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,940
Tianyu monk,

700
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,180
go back to your Tianyu.

701
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,180
Is this

702
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,860
how the Dafeng treats its guests?

703
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,980
(Guardians)

704
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,260
They damaged two wine shops

705
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,560
(Street Patrol Report)
and affected four shops in total,

706
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,900
but there were no casualties.

707
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,460
These two

708
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,420
acted as they pleased

709
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,500
with great control.

710
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,620
It seems their skills
are on par with yours.

711
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,060
Father,

712
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,520
I request more manpower

713
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,860
for a search throughout the city.

714
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,900
Within a few hours...

715
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,060
Father?
