00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,230
Who did that?

190
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,740
(Silver Gong, Xu Qi'an)

191
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,540
(Silver Gong)

192
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,060
(Six Months Later)

193
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,950
That's all

194
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,280
about Duke Zhenbei's Bloodshed Case.

195
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,750
What was that mysterious light?

196
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,680
What caused the fall of anomalies?

197
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,200
Was that really heaven's wrath?

198
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,160
No one knows

199
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,680
the answer.

200
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,830
(Eradication)
But after that,

201
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,160
the Chuzhou Case

202
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,830
took a sharp turn.

203
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,200
Take everything away.

204
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,440
Following the anomalies,

205
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,160
the truth was made public.

206
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,560
His Majesty had covered it up

207
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
to maintain the imperial image.

208
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,310
Why did he uncover the truth all of a sudden?

209
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,450
That was all

210
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,040
thanks to

211
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,880
the Guardians.

212
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,100
(Censorate, Censor He)

213
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,200
Don't mistake it.

214
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,680
Tomorrow in court,

215
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,710
do what you have to do

216
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,200
with a clear conscience.

217
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,060
(Remonstration)

218
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,260
(Duke Que and Duke Cao
killed Commissioner Zheng Xinghuai.)

219
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,510
Wei Yuan,

220
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,930
how audacious of you.

221
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,310
You've come this far because of me.

222
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,990
Do you think you can challenge me now?

223
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,160
And you.

224
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,230
You two

225
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,200
battled for decades.

226
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Now, you're ganging up against me.

227
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,960
Good for you.

228
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,400
What else can you do? Let's see it.

229
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,680
I'll sentence you

230
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,990
to death for deception and disobedience.

231
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,200
Who else is on their side?

232
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,470
Step forward

233
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,120
and let me see.

234
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,790
There they are.

235
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,840
You too?

236
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,680
Are you revolting against me?

237
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm the Emperor of the Dafeng,

238
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
the ruler of the state.

239
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,120
I can't be wrong!

240
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,940
All of you are educated.

241
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,060
Don't you know

242
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,300
this is an act of rebellion?

243
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,700
Rebels!

244
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,460
All of you!

245
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,180
I'll kill all the rebels!

246
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,260
All of you!

247
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,860
- Guards...
- Your Majesty!

248
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,180
The Second Sage's Knife!

249
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,020
I'm holding

250
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,660
the sacred treasure of the Yunlu Academy

251
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,580
to remonstrate with you!

252
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,980
Gentlemen should be honest.

253
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,220
So should the Emperor!

254
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,780
Your Majesty,

255
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,380
issue

256
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,860
an Edict of Introspection!

257
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,300
Your Majesty,

258
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,220
issue an Edict of Introspection!

259
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,060
I've done nothing wrong.

260
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,820
Ever.

261
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,540
No one knew

262
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,500
the secret chamber of the Haoqi Tower

263
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,920
kept proof of officials' guilt
and dirt on them.

264
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,540
Amazing!

265
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,500
The Guardians are unbelievably capable.

266
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,780
Agreed.

267
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,300
Lord Wei's tactical mind is unmatched.

268
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,500
Well,

269
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,300
Lord Wei's strategy succeeded.

270
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,300
The long-standing issues

271
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,740
and those greedy officials in court

272
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,140
shook the state.

273
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,660
Then what happened?

274
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,860
After this incident,

275
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,540
the state turned unstable.

276
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,020
The Witcher's Sect was aggressive,

277
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,860
provoking us constantly.

278
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,300
Lord Wei volunteered
to guard the northern border.

279
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,420
Three months later,

280
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,220
in a battle against The Witcher's Sect,

281
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,420
he was killed.

282
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,660
He died a worthy death.

283
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,900
Our war hero was

284
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,260
eventually brought back home.

285
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,780
Lord Wei's death was

286
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,020
a heavy blow to Prime Minister Wang.

287
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,580
In a few days' time,

288
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,500
his hair turned white.

289
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,340
Luckily, Mr. Xu was there.

290
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,480
Who's Mr. Xu?

291
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,960
Yes.

292
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,220
After Lord Wei passed away,

293
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,300
perhaps only Mr. Xu
could hold the state

294
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,260
and share Prime Minister Wang's burden.

295
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,200
His future would be promising.

296
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,380
The sky would be the limit.

297
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,460
(Past and Present)
He's great.

298
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Mr. Xu's capable.

299
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,900
Father, Mother,

300
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,220
he's back. He's back.

301
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,140
Father,

302
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,300
Mother, I'm home.

303
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,300
Welcome home.

304
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,340
You're back, son!

305
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,740
Why did you come back early?

306
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,980
The proof of corruption
of the Commissioner of Wanzhou was solid.

307
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,500
It was much easier to convict him
than I thought.

308
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,970
You won't leave again, will you?

309
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,810
Right.

310
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,740
On the way back,

311
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,300
I received the transfer order.

312
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,100
Floods suddenly struck Jianzhou

313
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
and submerged the fields,

314
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,900
making the locals homeless.

315
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,300
The Crown Prince assigned me
to control the floods

316
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,580
and help the people.

317
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,860
I'll set out tomorrow.

318
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,270
Tomorrow...?

319
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,380
As a new official,

320
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,340
you've gained the Crown Prince's trust.

321
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,140
But the situation in court remains unclear.

322
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,660
I wonder if that's good.

323
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,260
Of course it is.

324
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,500
Serving the people is

325
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,560
a gentleman's duty.

326
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,620
It's a great deed.

327
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,020
Lingyue is right.

328
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,060
When the state is unstable

329
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,260
in chaos,

330
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,860
as a scholar

331
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,340
and a chosen one,

332
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,460
I'm obligated to support the Dafeng.

333
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,380
I know, I know.

334
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,740
"If fate hadn't let Xu Xinnian be born,

335
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,090
the Dafeng would still be in the dark."

336
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,640
Alright. Enough.

337
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,540
You'll leave tomorrow.

338
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,900
Go to your room to rest.

339
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,800
I'll call you when the meal is ready.

340
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,420
Wait, where's Lingyin?

341
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,190
I brought her green bean cakes from Wanzhou.

342
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,860
She's like a big green bean cake.

343
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,420
- Lingyin!
- Lingyin!

344
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,820
Green bean cakes!

345
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,660
Where were you?

346
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,850
Green bean cakes for you.

347
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,340
Green bean cakes!

348
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,940
Who gave you

349
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,740
the candied hawthorns?

350
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
Did you buy them for her?

351
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,660
I was in the kitchen all day.

352
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,340
How could I buy them for her?

353
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,380
You have all my money.

354
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,380
I couldn't buy them even if I wanted to.

355
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,780
Who bought them for you?

356
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,700
Who was it?

357
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,460
Did you buy them for her?

358
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,500
No.

359
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,420
She held my leg and kept begging me.

360
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,240
So you paid for them?

361
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,550
You're rich.

362
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,940
Stop. Or you'll lose all your teeth.

363
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,540
I don't need teeth.

364
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,500
I don't need them.

365
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,580
I don't need teeth.

366
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,700
I can eat a lot without them.

367
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,900
I apologize for her.

368
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,460
My sister's spoiled.

369
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,940
Please don't mind her.

370
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,740
Son,

371
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,500
do you know him?

372
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,820
No.

373
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,220
No?

374
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,860
Why didn't he take the money?

375
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,980
What a strange man.

376
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Stop eating!

377
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,980
Don't eat anything from strangers.

378
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,980
- Or you might be taken away!
- No.

379
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,500
Are you deaf? Can you hear me?

380
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,450
- Let's go.
- Can you?

381
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,900
- Let's eat.
- You only like eating.

382
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,740
Come on.

383
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,980
Senior Song,

384
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,340
this is the 48th time.

385
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,740
Are you sure plums

386
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,580
can grow as big as peaches?

387
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,220
This time

388
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,420
is the charm.

389
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,660
Hey,

390
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,740
why not

391
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,220
graft rabbit heads on cows?

392
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,460
That way, I can eat

393
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,580
spicy rabbit heads the size of cow heads.

394
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,780
Caiwei,

395
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,740
don't always

396
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,180
think about food.

397
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,420
Besides,

398
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,460
the combination of animals isn't a graft

399
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,700
but hybridization.

400
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,780
And don't forget reproductive isolation.

401
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,600
Reproductive isolation?

402
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,020
Reproductive isolation

403
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,900
means different species

404
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,340
can't...

405
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,700
Can't what?

406
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,180
Right.

407
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,740
What is it?

408
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,900
What's reproductive isolation?

409
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,180
What's reproduction?

410
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,220
What's isolation?

411
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,500
Senior Song,

412
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,750
you have a visitor outside.

413
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,780
Outside... reproduction...

414
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,580
Outside... isolation...

415
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,580
I was paid one liang of silver

416
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,300
to deliver this book and the cart

417
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,620
to you.

418
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,620
Senior Song.

419
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,140
(The Codex of Alchemy)

420
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,060
(Equivalent exchange is
the unchanging...)

421
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,100
"Equivalent exchange

422
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,260
is the unchanging principle of alchemy."

423
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,740
Equivalent exchange.

424
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,620
That's right.

425
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,980
Master once said

426
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
the essence of alchemy

427
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,060
isn't change

428
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,060
but transformation.

429
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,060
Transformation...

430
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,740
"Why can weapons work?

431
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
Because of energy.

432
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,220
Why do lives exist?

433
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,540
Because of energy."

434
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,780
Is life also a kind of energy?

435
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,420
Is that so, Senior Song?

436
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,540
Don't interrupt.

437
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,900
"The essence of alchemy is
an equivalent exchange.

438
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,180
Humans and weapons need energy.

439
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,260
They can transform or merge.

440
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,220
If done properly, souls can be rebuilt

441
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,380
to achieve rebirth!"

442
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,020
How is that possible?

443
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,180
What a bunch of nonsense.

444
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,460
Whoever wrote this book

445
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,860
should be executed!

446
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,000
Ask that man

447
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,380
who gave him this book.

448
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,660
Sure.

449
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,740
Who gave you this book?

450
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,060
Why do I find it so shocking

451
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,900
yet familiar?

452
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:56,340
3, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.

453
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,260
Who taught me these moves?

454
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,140
8 Circles.

455
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,180
- I won.
- Enjoy.

456
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,420
It's as you said.

457
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,240
No sugar.

458
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,450
I put soy sauce, chopped green onion,
and minced garlic.

459
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,580
Leave me alone!

460
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,460
Go away!

461
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,780
Wei Yuan is dead.

462
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,140
You Guardians...

463
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,540
How dare you kick me!

464
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,300
Do you know who my father is?

465
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,740
I don't care.

466
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,300
Abducting a woman

467
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,460
is against the law.

468
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,740
You insulted the Guardians.

469
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,820
That makes you more guilty.

470
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,020
Take him away!

471
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,260
Get up.

472
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,510
Let's continue.

473
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,470
No, I quit.

474
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,540
- No more money.
- Let go!

475
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,020
Let me go!

476
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,620
Hands off!

477
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,500
What's up, Guangxiao?

478
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:57,340
Nothing.

479
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,140
This place seems so familiar.

480
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,220
Did we play mahjong here?

481
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,300
We're going to Jianzhou.

482
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,620
I hope we can work together.

483
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,460
I need your help.

484
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,220
That's right.

485
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,820
You two, put aside your prejudice

486
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,860
for the greater good.

487
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,100
Fine.

488
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,140
I'll do it for you.

489
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,820
Don't worry.

490
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,020
I've got a new case

491
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,060
to cultivate sword energy.

492
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,460
We'll return

493
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,820
in triumph.

494
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,660
Your case is trash.

495
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,500
Get rid of it.

496
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,370
(Ten years it takes to grind a sword.
Its frosty edge has yet to be tested.)

497
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,380
(I'm showing it today.
Who's been done injustice?)

498
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,380
Miss, it tastes good.

499
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,260
Cheer up. You've only read files
for a few days.

500
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,370
Pull yourselves together.

501
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,380
Chief,

502
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,580
we haven't gone home for five days.

503
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,020
Alright. I know.

504
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,190
Let's go have fun in the brothel.

505
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,860
Constable Wang is so hot!

506
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,500
- Thanks.
- So hot!

507
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,340
I'm flattered.

508
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,940
So hot!

509
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:42,860
Your Highness,

510
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,140
why do you suddenly
want to go to the Lake Villa?

511
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:46,900
I don't know either.

512
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,860
I just want to go back there.

513
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,300
Besides,

514
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,300
maybe I can draw inspiration from it.

515
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,500
Come to think of it,

516
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,580
whenever you go back there,

517
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,780
you're inspired to write poems,

518
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,980
and they're wonderful.

519
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,020
However,

520
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,260
I have to remind you

521
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,980
that every time you leave there,

522
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,980
you'll always feel unwell

523
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,060
with no appetite.

524
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,820
It's not that bad.

525
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,540
I also don't know why...

526
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,660
Princess has arrived!

527
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,820
Who is this?

528
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,740
Who is this?

529
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,660
How dare you stare at her!

530
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,620
Bow!

531
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,820
Your Highness, I'm sorry

532
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,060
for getting in your way.

533
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,420
(Lake Villa)

534
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
Didn't I say

535
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,140
that even if I seldom came,

536
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,860
this place had to be kept clean?

537
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,140
Yes.

538
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,700
Sorry for my negligence.

539
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,140
Why bother? You didn't come here.

540
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,980
What a beautiful line.

541
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,580
Agreed. So is this line.

542
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,420
The word "rustling" is brilliant,

543
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,140
bringing out the sound of the eastern wind.

544
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,400
This one is better.

545
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,260
"Thunder faintly rolled
beyond the lotus pool."

546
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,740
- Go and check.
- This line...

547
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,940
This is well-written, too.

548
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,180
But this one is the best.

549
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,860
No, I beg to differ.

550
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,380
A young man sent this book

551
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,300
to you, Your Majesty.

552
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,180
"Love not your golden dress, I pray.

553
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,580
More than your youthful golden hours."

554
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,460
What a masterpiece.

555
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,540
"Through the window,
she sees dusk of the day.

556
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,500
In the gilded room,
she wipes her tears away."

557
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,780
"Pearls in the moonlit sea
bore tears of a maid.

558
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,580
Jade stones burned in the sun

00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,100

♪The sky is clear now; the clouds are gone♪

561
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,900
I like this line.

♪No more cold starts at night♪

563
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,020
Finished.

564

Here you go.

565
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:10,060
(Pearls in the moonlit sea
bore tears of a maid...)

566
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,580
Where's the rest?

567
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,660
What is it?

568
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,420
The rest will be done

569
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,500
in the rest of this year.

570
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,000
You tricked me!

571
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,320
You want to bargain with me again.

572
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,900
No, if I gave you the full piece,

573
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,220
how could I be with you all the time?

574
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,580
That's shameful.

575
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,300
You're so thick-skinned!

576
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,660
Ow! It hurts!

577
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,900
Give me a few days.

578
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,020
I'll make it up to you.

579
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,420
I'll give you a book of poems!

580

I doubt it. Write it now!

581
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,140

Have some meat.

00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,620
Don't just eat fish.

00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,460
- What's wrong?
- Mother,

645
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,340
your fish is too salty.

646
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,540
No, it's not.

647
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,540
Really? Let me try it.

Son,

652
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,020
have a drumstick.

Eat it. Let's eat.

654
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,980
- Let's eat.
- Eat up.

00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,820
Eat, everyone.

656
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,380
The fish isn't salty.

657
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,260
It's not?

658
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,800
More salt and the dead fish would turn.

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,980
Run!

660
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,020
- Good.

- Great.

00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,190
Father, I'll help you to the carriage.

675
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,460
No need.

676
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,340
Let's go.

677
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,100
Come on.

678
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,020
Mr. Xu,

679
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,580
it's time to set out.

680
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,740
Come on.

681
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
I'm taking you to see someone.

682
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,140
Master,

683
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,380
Mr. Xu is here.

684
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,660
I know

685
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,220
it's bitter to be forgotten by others.

686
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,620
Isn't that all because of you?

687
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,780
I've

688
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,500
brought that man back.

689
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,160
It's an equivalent exchange.

690
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,060
How will you pay me back?

691
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,580
With fortune inside, one won't live forever.

692
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,220
Once it's drawn out, one will die.

693
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,260
If you want

694
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,380
the fortune inside me,

695
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,300
draw it out anytime.

696
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,220
I'm not the one

697
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,700
coveting the fortune in you

698
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
from the beginning.

699
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,300
Do you know

700
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,260
why Supervisor gave you
the Black Gold Saber

701
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,260
and manuals of skills,

702
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,460
and why he shielded you all the time?

703
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,980
He means

704
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,220
to use the Dafeng's fortune
to reach higher ranks,

705
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,660
while you

706
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,380
own the fortune,

707
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,460
and you've become

708
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,180
a Fighter.

709
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,060
You're perfect to assist him

710
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,380
with his cultivation.

711
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,430
Once he no longer needs you,

712
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,780
a pawn like you

713
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,260
will be abandoned.

714
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,580
Then

715
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,180
he'll draw out

716
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,780
the fortune.

717
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,780
Without it,

718
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,340
you'll

719
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,300
end up dead.

720
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,540
Do you mean you're saving my life?

721
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,820
Don't you find that absurd?

722
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,660
We made painstaking efforts

723
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,940
to find the only way to success.

724
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,660
Only by casting the mystifying spell

725
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,580
can we have Supervisor shielded.

726
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,780
That way,

727
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,100
you'll be able to get rid of him

728
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,460
and regain freedom.

729
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,270
I'm

730
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,440
the only one you can trust.

731
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,210
Who exactly are you?

732
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,340
In life,

733
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,260
the simplest is the best.

734
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,860
I hoped you'd enjoy three meals a day

735
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,460
in peace.

736
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,980
That's why

737
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,430
I named you Ningyan,

738
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,270

Part One ends.

781
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,580
That's it?

782
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,100
How about

783
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,020
we play around round?

784
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:57,320
- Sure.
- OK.

785
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,170
One more round.

786
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,340
No, thanks.

787
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,220
Maybe next time.

788
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,700

789
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,820
Yeah.

790
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,780
It was like they skipped The Witcher's Sect.

791
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,340
That's in Part Two.

792
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,080
It also includes the things in Yunzhou.

793
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,380
Great!

794
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,540
Let's play that one next time.

795
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,020
Sure. Yeah.

796
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,360
Let's go.

What does

803
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,880
the last sentence
that man in black said mean?

804
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,280
Do you know that?

805
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,500
No.

806
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,660
About that,

807
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,020
I'll tell you

808
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,460
next time.
