40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,190
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

41
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,670
What did he mean
by "Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li"?

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,470
What you saw is exactly what I saw.

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,720
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

44
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,360
He ended up dead at a barren hill
outside the capital.

45
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,110
I think he was robbed and killed.

46
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,990
War has never ceased in the North.

47
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,640
The Dafeng's suffered a series of defeats.

48
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,830
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

49
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,080
I can't believe
I didn't hear of this huge matter.

50
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,550
It's bad.

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,550
It's too serious.

52
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,590
I'll tell Lord Wei at once.

53
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,430
Hold on.

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,320
Bring him along.

55
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,830
Thanks.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,080
Lord Wei!

57
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,270
Xu Qi'an, how dare you

58
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,270
come up without permission.

59
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,320
Lord Wei, I have an urgent matter to report.

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,320
You have a cup of tea's time.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,600
Yes.

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,830
What happened?

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,430
Enough is enough.

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
If you keep at it,

65
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,960
everyone in the Dafeng

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,760
will know we're here within three days.

67
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,270
Hold yourself back, please?

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,520
My Charm Spell had never failed.

69
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,870
How come it didn't work

70
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,150
on Mr. Xu?

71
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,670
Ordinary men might be enchanted by you,

72
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,830
but not him.

73
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,260
(Chuzhou)

74
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,760
Blood shall be shed for 3,000 li.

75
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,080
(Devotion to Duty)

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,150
Do you mean Duke Zhenbei,
who guards Chuzhou,

77
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,430
lied about the war situation?

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
That wouldn't be strange.

79
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,110
The strange thing is

80
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,240
if Duke Zhenbei did lie about it,

81
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,360
why didn't we receive any tip-offs?

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,240
After the New Year, I sent most scouts

83
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,080
to the northeast.

84
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,520
Few were left in the North.

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,150
Duke Zhenbei keeps Chuzhou
under airtight surveillance.

86
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,760
Information from there is always scarce.

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,120
If he kept this matter secret,

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,910
the court

89
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,120
would be unlikely to know.

90
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,960
(Scouts were sent to the northeast.)

91
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,960
(What's Lord Wei up to?)

92
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,640
What do you think

93
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,320
we should do?

94
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,910
It's no longer your concern.

95
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
I'm going to the Palace.

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,720
Rou,

97
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,390
bring him along.

98
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,830
We're going to the Palace.

99
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes.

100
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,910
Master, are you saying someone powerful
is behind Mr. Xu?

101
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,270
I'm not sure,

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,760
but his black saber is a rarity.

103
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,230
Also,

104
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,680
a mere Silver Gong like him

105
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,910
was able to take my spear.

106
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm sure Xu Qi'an's more than he lets on.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,270
You're too naive

108
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,760
to enchant him with your spell.

109
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,150
If he's as good as you say,

110
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,080
why not tell him about my matter?

111
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,520
We need to prioritize things.

112
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
Besides,

113
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,790
I don't trust him enough

114
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,520
to bring up your matter.

115
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Are you assessing
his personality and character?

116
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,280
So?

117
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,830
Do you like him?

118
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,000
This is it.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,060
(Xu Mansion)

120
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Greetings, ladies.

121
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,030
Who are you here for?

122
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,030
Xu Qi'an.

123
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm here

124
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,350
not to argue with all of you.

125
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,470
The war situation in the North is critical.

126
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,590
Kui's gathered troops to launch attacks.

127
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,200
(Chu Xianglong)
War is imminent.

128
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,720
(Duke Zhenbei's Deputy)
That's why

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,150
we're asking for 300,000 liang

130
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,350
and 250,000 dan of provisions and fodder

131
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,550
to meet

132
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,270
the army's urgent needs.

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Your Majesty,

134
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,880
in the 36th year of Yuanjing,

135
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
Jiangzhou was flooded.

136
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,000
Jingzhou suffered droughts.

137
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,560
Jiingzhou had locust plagues.

138
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,150
The court sent them relief several times.

139
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,640
Yuzhou and Zhangzhou,
the two granaries of the state,

140
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,680
barely have any grains left.

141
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,350
We have no more for the army.

142
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,120
Why not gather them from the prefectures?

143
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,070
Objection.

144
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,600
Your Majesty,

145
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,270
even if they could be

146
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,470
delivered by water from the prefectures,

147
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,910
it'd cost a lot of manpower, time,

148
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,150
and supplies on the way.

149
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,080
By the time they reached Chuzhou,

150
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,350
the provisions left would be less than half.

151
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
It's

152
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,960
not too wise.

153
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,990
Your Majesty,

154
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,470
I have an idea.

155
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,560
We can add a temporary corvee,

156
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,440
the delivery corvee,

157
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,710
ordering civilians to deliver the provisions.

158
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,880
That way,

159
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,320
they'll be sent to the border in full,

160
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,160
and

161
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,150
it'll save us a lot on delivery costs.

162
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,440
Your Majesty, you rule with benevolence

163
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,080
and care about the people.

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,390
The spring plowing now

165
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,000
is the busiest time of the year.

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
Our people can't handle extra corvee.

167
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,750
Besides,

168
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,270
after last year's natural disasters,

169
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,910
they barely had extra grains left.

170
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,960
Such corvee would make things worse,

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
driving them to death.

172
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,790
It'd ruin the state and the people!

173
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,230
You shall die, Mr. Cao!

174
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,070
You...

175
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,960
Prime Minister Wang puts the people first.

176
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,560
That's admirable.

177
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,560
But what about those in Chuzhou?

178
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,600
Aren't they

179
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,590
also the people of the Dafeng?

180
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,750
Your Majesty,

181
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,910
you probably don't know.

182
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,030
Kui's breaking in in full fury.

183
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,790
They've started several fierce battles
before the New Year.

184
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,080
Thanks to Duke's gallantry and strategies,

185
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,560
we've held all the trumps,

186
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,520
but now,

187
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,230
our troops are exhausted.

188
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,030
Please, Your Majesty,

189
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,470
send over their provisions and pay soon

190
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,680
to show all the soldiers

191
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,910
the court

192
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,880
didn't forget their merits.

193
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,080
Please be benevolent, Your Majesty.

194
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,560
Give this matter

195
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,350
further thought.

196
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,940
(Self-restrained and Virtuous)

197
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,470
Mr. Wei,

198
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,000
as a great strategist,

199
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,390
what do you think?

200
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,870
Thanks.

201
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,400
Ningyan should be back soon.

202
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,830
Please wait a minute.

203
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,620
Sorry for troubling you.

204
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,080
Lingyue!

205
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,950
Lingyue.

206
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,560
I meant to bathe just now.

207
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,560
Where did Ningyan put the soap?

208
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,440
Go back to your room.

209
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,350
I'll bring it to you.

210
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,830
You've got visitors?

211
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,760
Hold on, Miss.

212
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,680
Is he

213
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,760
your...

214
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,630
second brother?

215
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,080
Yes, he's Xu Xinnian.

216
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,750
Xu Qi'an's cousin, Xu Xinnian?

217
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,990
A student at the Yunlu Academy?

218
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
Correct.

219
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,110
You see, the Spring Exam is near.

220
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,590
I've been too busy studying at school

221
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,470
to see you.

222
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,710
How about you go to see my brother?

223
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,710
Miss?

224
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,710
I'm fine.

225
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,430
You may leave.

226
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,040
He wasn't studying at school.

227
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,830
He lied to avoid us.

228
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,990
To think you did your best to help him.

229
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,630
Men are alike!

230
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
Master!

231
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,960
Where are you going, Master?

232
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,120
Excuse me.

233
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,230
Where's Xu Xinnian?

234
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,950
Over there.

235
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,950
Thanks.

236
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,630
Who are you?

237
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,710
Lingyue,

238
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,400
leave the soap on the stand.

239
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,240
I'll get it myself.

240
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,590
Lingyue, you...

241
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,440
Who are you?

242
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,510
Y-Y-You...!

243
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,510
How did you get in?

244
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,520
Get out!

245
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,830
Who exactly are you?

246
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,280
Out!

247
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,750
- Help!
- Shut up!

248
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,750
Assassin!

249
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,160
What are you doing?

250
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,160
Your Majesty,

251
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,710
in times of peace,

252
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,830
military households live on military farms.

253
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,920
In times of war,

254
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,350
the army needs supplies from the court.

255
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,800
That's the norm.

256
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,240
However,

257
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,680
before we go further,

258
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,510
I have something else to report.

259
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,280
What is it?

260
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,960
When my Copper Gong

261
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,200
saw some civilians

262
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,960
fight to death outside the capital,

263
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,400
he ordered them to stop,

264
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,960
but the group with more members

265
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,510
didn't listen.

266
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,510
They killed a man in their way

267
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,160
and ran away.

268
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,110
The victim yelled before death,

269
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,630
"The North is in danger!"

270
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,590
It is indeed.

271
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,800
Kui's been

272
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,560
robbing and killing the locals everywhere

273
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,710
to start a war.

274
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,200
- That's why they...
- That's why

275
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,990
"blood shall be shed for 3,000 li"

276
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,040
in the North because of Kui.

277
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,870
General Chu,

278
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,440
do you think

279
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,080
you can cover that up

280
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,440
by calling it robbing and killing?

281
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,350
Wei Yuan,

282
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,800
what do you mean

283
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,990
by "blood shall be shed for 3,000 li"?

284
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,280
Your Majesty,

285
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,280
that's sheer nonsense!

286
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,200
Shut up.

287
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,560
Do you have any proof?

288
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,470
Your Majesty,

289
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,200
I brought over the victim.

290
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,320
His body is outside the gate.

291
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,510
You may have a coroner check it.

292
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,440
The victim

293
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,320
was from the North.

294
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,110
Saying the North is in danger
based on one body?

295
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,160
Lord Wei, you're...

296
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,000
Do an autopsy.

297
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,990
Do it!

298
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,120
Yes.

299
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,040
Summon those of the Bureau

300
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,680
for questioning.

301
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,870
The rest of you,

302
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,470
wait outside.

303
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,640
You,

304
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,230
hang back.

305
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,560
What are you doing?

306
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,410
Shhh!

307
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,400
Help!

308
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,520
Shut it!

309
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,400
Who exactly are you, Miss?

310
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,830
I don't know you at all.

311
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,280
May I get dressed first?

312
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,560
"Miss"?

313
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,040
You don't know me?

314
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,710
I swear I don't!

315
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,280
Xu Xinnian, you liar!

316
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,200
Are you going back on your word?

317
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,870
Who... who are you?

318
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,750
What's going on?

319
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,440
Looks like Xinnian is

320
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,280
in her debt,

321
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,830
but he pretends he doesn't know her.

322
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,160
Xinnian has grown up.

323
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,920
That's good news, Uncle.

324
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,990
Not exactly.

325
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,110
I think

326
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,320
he tries to deny it.

327
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,510
He's getting mad at her.

328
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,040
But

329
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,470
he's matured, indeed.

330
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,870
He's making a mistake.

331
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,160
He can't deny such a thing.

332
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,750
Denying it?

333
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
Lying?

334
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,720
Some scholar he is.

335
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,590
Why did they stop talking?

336
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,430
Mr. Xu,

337
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,350
you're back.

338
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,960
Yes, I am.

339
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,710
Why are you here?

340
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,350
Master and I came to see you.

341
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,920
Is the girl inside...?

342
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,670
Oh no.

343
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Wait and see.

344
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,590
You liar

345
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,200
must pay the price.

346
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,470
What are you doing here?

347
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,000
Lord Wei,

348
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,110
is that

349
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,120
all true?

350
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,110
Minister,

351
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,080
do you think I was joking?

352
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,710
I wouldn't dare.

353
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,240
But

354
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,630
if such bloodshed

355
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,280
is true,

356
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,590
how many people in the North will die?

357
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,440
The Guardians' scouts are everywhere.

358
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,280
How come we didn't hear a word?

359
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,560
His Majesty orders you

360
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,830
to go back to his study.

361
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,470
After you, Lord Wei.

362
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,430
Your Majesty,

363
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,470
I've checked Chu Xianglong

364
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,080
with the Gazing Spell.

365
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
He didn't lie.

366
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,410
Every word he said is true.

367
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,350
Thanks, Song Qing.

368
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,440
Lord Wei, who told you such a lie?

369
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,750
His Majesty almost doubted the Duke.

370
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,470
I don't think

371
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,990
the Duke ever offended you, Lord Wei.

372
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,070
Your Majesty,

373
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,300
it concerns national security.

374
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,230
What he said might be true,

375
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,470
but the situation in the North

376
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,440
might be not.

377
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,350
Lord Wei,

378
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,640
what makes you say so?

379
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,480
Your Majesty,

380
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,840
Lord Wei has a point.

381
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,640
We can't be more careful

382
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,920
about national security.

383
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,440
We must check it thoroughly.

384
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,040
How?

385
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,990
Keep gathering provisions and money

386
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,120
to deliver to Chuzhou

387
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,360
while sending a team led by an imperial envoy

388
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,750
to go along to investigate everything.

389
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,960
Seconded.

390
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,510
Seconded.

391
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,160
Seconded.

392
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,320
Seconded.

393
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
He doesn't know you.

394
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,440
That's right.

395
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,400
You also lied to me.

396
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,680
You'll pay a higher price for that.

397
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,200
The truth is

398
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,270
my brother studies at the Yunlu Academy.

399
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,550
He's the most orthodox scholar.

400
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,680
Also, he's...

401
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,710
Get to the point!

402
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,920
Yes, I'm getting there.

403
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,270
The point is

404
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,440
his career.

405
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,310
His career?

406
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,600
Yes. Think about it.

407
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
As a student at the Yunlu Academy,

408
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,750
my brother's outstanding.

409
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,400
He'll take office in the court

410
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,920
to serve the people.

411
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,160
If the ill-willed found out

412
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,270
he had connections with various forces

413
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,510
and used that against him,

414
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,550
how could he devote himself
to the people's welfare?

415
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,030
You know the official circles, right?

416
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,240
Well...

417
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,240
Well...

418
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:51,600
That said,

419
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,960
I helped him, didn't I?

420
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,990
You did, so he asked me to return the favor.

421
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,600
He's only

422
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
a humble student.

423
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,160
What could he do?

424
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,030
You have no idea how he begged me in tears,

425
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,120
saying he owed you so much,

426
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,640
but he couldn't see you

427
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,990
or do anything for you.

428
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,920
He was an animal!

429
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,760
Look,

430
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,030
he even gave me the Jade Mirror

431
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
so that I'd give it my all to help you.

432
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,520
But what did you do?

433
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,840
You beat him up before he could explain.

434
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,790
I feel bad for him.

435
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,200
I didn't know

436
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,790
No. 3 was so thoughtful.

437
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,510
Son, hang in there!

438
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,990
We're almost there.

439
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,230
Me neither.

440
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,710
You seem to know a lot about the Realm Sect.

441
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,760
Of course.

442
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,230
I always handle
No. 3's work in the capital.

443
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,350
I have no choice.

444
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,990
An elder brother is like a father.

445
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,270
I ought to

446
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,600
help him.

447
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,910
Alright.

448
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,470
Now, I understand what No. 3 meant.

449
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,280
Su Su.

450
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,870
Su Su!

451
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,470
You're in someone else's bed again.

452
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,310
Pay him!

453
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,990
Sorry for

454
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,880
my abrupt visit today.

455
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,350
Good day.

456
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,640
Take care. Bye.

457
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,520
Let's go.

458
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,070
I'll give your money to him.

459
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,340
Master, what about my matter?

460
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,270
(Modest and Curious)

461
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,920
How could I bring it up?

462
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,710
I had helped No. 3 before,

463
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,470
but I beat him just now.

464
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,030
We're even.

465
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,990
How could I ask him for help?

466
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,280
Don't worry.

467
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,120
I'll figure something out to help you.

468
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,960
Alright?

469
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,070
But we don't know others in the capital.

470
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,510
Who'll go to
the Ministry of Personnel to check it?

471
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,000
If all else fails,

472
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,710
we'll break into that place

473
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,880
in the dead of the night.

474
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,790
Be realistic, Master.

475
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,990
We're in the capital.

476
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,400
What you did in Yunzhou won't work here!

477
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,920
I can easily
get into the Ministry of Personnel.

478
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,510
Why do you want to go there?

479
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,780
(Sanjiu Clinic)

480
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,680
Father...

481
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,200
You woke up!

482
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,120
- Lingyue.
- You're awake.

483
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,030
Finally, you're awake, Xinnian.

484
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,870
Great!

485
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,840
You're in a clinic.

486
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,360
The physician has examined you.

487
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,680
Do you still feel unwell?

488
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,460
Father, Lingyue,

489
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,120
turn around. Don't look at me!

490
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,070
It's rude.

491
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,120
Turn around!

492
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,680
Sure, sure.

493
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,790
Come on. We're family.

494
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,120
How fussy!

495
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,000
Father,

496
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,510
when you took me here,

497
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,160
did you put clothes on me?

498
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,550
You were dying.
I couldn't care about other things.

499
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,470
Hadn't I taken you here in time,

500
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,230
would you have woken up so quickly?

501
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
The physician said

502
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,750
you caught a mild cold on the way here.

503
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,600
One dose of decoction would cure you.

504
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,720
So...

505
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,360
did anyone

506
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,960
see my face?

507
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,270
The physician of the clinic
outside our house wasn't there.

508
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,360
We walked down a street
and two lanes to find this place.

509
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,440
I think,

510
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,230
perhaps

511
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,200
everyone

512
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,120
might've seen it.

513
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,070
Xinnian!

514
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,040
Xinnian!

515
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,160
- Xinnian!
- Xinnian!

516
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,960
Help!

517
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,510
He passed out again!

518
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,400
He fainted again!

519
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,160
Send a team to the North

520
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,270
to investigate the bloodshed?

521
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,680
It's a vital task.

522
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
His Majesty hasn't decided

523
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,510
on the Lead Investigator.

524
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,710
Will it be me?

525
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,400
You're a mere Silver Gong.

526
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,500
The Lead Investigator shall head
tri-ministries in the joint investigation.

527
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,640
You aren't qualified for that post yet.

528
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,550
Yes, of course.

529
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,230
Tell me about it.

530
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,310
How's Li Miaozhen doing?

531
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,960
She's fine and well-adapted to the capital.

532
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,200
Listen,

533
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,030
given her sensitive identity,

534
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,130
she can't stay for too long.

535
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Find a way to send her out.

536
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,030
Well...

537
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,230
That might be difficult.

538
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,600
How so?

539
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
She's here to investigate something.

540
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,960
She won't leave

541
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,550
before finding out the truth.

542
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:23,750
Back then, I was eager to get to the bottom

543
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,400
of the bloodshed.

544
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,310
I promised

545
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,600
to give her a hand.

546
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,880
What

547
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,230
did you promise her?

548
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,440
Take a seat.

549
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,750
We want to go there for Su Su's father.

550
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,270
But why the Ministry of Personnel?

551
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,750
Su Su's father is Su Hang,

552
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,030
a Presented Scholar
from the 29th year of Zhende.

553
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,960
Later, in the 14th year of Yuanjing,

554
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,230
he rose to the Imperial Diarist
in the capital.

555
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,270
Then he disappeared. We don't know

556
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,790
whether he's alive or dead.

557
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,640
We haven't heard from him

558
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,030
for over two decades.

559
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,160
And you think

560
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,200
since he had gone to his post here,

561
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,470
the Personnel must have his records.

562
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,030
Go to the Personnel?

563
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,160
I should be punished

564
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,510
for not reporting it to you.

565
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,000
Never mind.

566
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,200
News about the bloodshed for that

567
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,400
is an equivalent exchange.

568
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,310
You're wise, Lord Wei.

569
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,960
But I'm not powerful enough

570
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,550
to enter the Personnel's archive.

571
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,470
Thankfully, we have you.

572
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,550
You're sophisticated.

573
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,070
It's easy for you

574
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,400
to get us in.

575
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,390
I promise you.

576
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,470
Once it's done,

577
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,750
I'll send her out at once.

578
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,470
The Guardians

579
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,600
don't have access to the Personnel.

580
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,470
Besides,

581
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,470
it's Wang Zhenwen's ministry.

582
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,440
It's even harder for us to get in.

583
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,640
But

584
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,160
if it's just to check some files,

585
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,750
you don't need to go there yourself.

586
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,400
I know someone

587
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,600
who can help you.

588
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,550
Who is it?

589
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,550
Your brother,

590
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,640
Xu Xinnian.

591
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,350
Cijiu,

592
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,160
I've repaired the windows.

593
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,390
Would you

594
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,840
like to take a look?

595
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,630
Xinnian,

596
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,590
look.

597
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,990
I made you a new robe

598
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,270
with your favorite cloud pattern.

599
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,750
How about

600
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,920
you try it on?

601
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,440
Yes, try it on.

602
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,280
Put it on.

603
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,550
Try it on.

604
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,990
Xinnian!

605
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,520
Xinnian!

606
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,150
Xinnian!

607
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,030
I heard you were taken to the clinic.

608
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,160
Were you sick?

609
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,720
He's fine.

610
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,230
He's perfectly healthy.

611
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,240
Right?

612
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,470
Are you sure you're fine?

613
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,550
Worry not, Mother.

614
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,030
As fragile as he seems,

615
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,310
he's always been healthy.

616
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,680
He's studying hard, though,

617
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,920
so he feels tired sometimes.

618
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Right, Xinnian?

619
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,880
I'm glad you're fine.

620
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,030
I made lotus seed soup for you.

621
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,920
Have some. Move these to the side.

622
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,880
Stop. Take a break.

623
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,750
Eat up.

624
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,400
Is he stressed out?

625
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,310
My son is still studying.

626
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
With your talent,

627
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,270
you'll come out on top

628
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,360
in this year's Spring Exam.

629
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,550
But you know,

630
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,270
work hard, play hard.

631
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,990
That's how we should live.

632
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,360
Why not

633
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,350
take today off

634
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,960
to rest

635
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,470
and relax?

636
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,960
Aren't you going to

637
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,230
cook other food in the kitchen?

638
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,960
- Go ahead.
- That can wait.

639
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,160
Just go!

640
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,070
He's under too much pressure.

641
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,400
I want to comfort him.

642
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,380
Just go cooking.

643
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,520
He needs to eat.

644
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,040
Xinnian,

645
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,120
you know what?

646
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,030
I just heard something fun in the street.

647
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,440
There was

648
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,990
a young man

649
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,990
who suddenly fell ill.

650
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,200
He...

651
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,280
He was

652
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,270
naked

653
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,510
and carried through the streets.

654
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,360
They said he looked

655
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,640
quite handsome.

656
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,920
I... I had a bet with my friends

657
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,600
on if he'd

658
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,920
show his face

659
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,120
in the streets again.

660
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,240
Isn't it funny?

661
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,920
Is it?

662
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,230
Is it not?

663
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,710
So funny!

664
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,470
He was naked...

665
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,940
(Bright and Sunny)

666
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,030
Isn't it funny?

667
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,200
Mother,

668
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,070
stop making things worse.

669
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,600
Did I?

670
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,030
How come?

671
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,960
What did I do?

672
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,030
Whose things?

673
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,360
I did nothing wrong.

674
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,470
Pingzhi, how did I...? Wait...

675
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,880
I...

676
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,920
What did I do?

677
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,600
(Xu Mansion)

678
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Cijiu!

679
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,590
Cijiu!

680
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,200
I'm coming in.

681
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,760
Cijiu?

682
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,960
Where's he?

683
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,790
Is he not back yet?

684
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,760
Cijiu,

685
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,730
what are you doing here?

686
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
What do you want?

687
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,030
You sound energetic.

688
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,510
That's a relief.

689
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I picked up fine herbs

690
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,600
for you

691
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,920
to nourish your body.

692
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,150
Cijiu,

693
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,960
I'd appreciate it

694
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,510
if you could do me a favor.

695
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Go to the Personnel?

696
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,550
Yes, that's right.

697
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,400
If a Guardian like you can't get in,

698
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,920
what can I do?

699
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,400
I asked Lord Wei the same thing,

700
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,360
but he said if I came to you,

701
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,710
you'd know what to do.

702
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,720
You're lying.

703
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,270
The honorable Lord Wei wouldn't...

704
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,110
What's up?

705
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,230
What's on your mind?

706
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,760
Nothing.

707
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Cijiu,

708
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,360
don't keep it from me.

709
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,960
If you have an idea,

710
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
that'll be greatly helpful.

711
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,990
Keep thinking.

712
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,590
Think hard.

713
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,030
It's not that I refuse to help you.

714
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,510
Actually,

715
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,030
one of my friends might be able to help,

716
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,790
but...

717
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,160
but...

718
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:38,960
this person might not want to see me.

719
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,920
Give it a go.

720
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,570
You won't know if you don't try.

721
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,520
Have a try.

722
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,680
Try it, please!

723
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,310
I'll think about it.

724
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,640
Yes, you do that.

725
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,120
Relax. I'll massage you.

726
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,750
Over here.

727
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,510
Easy!

728
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,480
So

729
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,400
Lin'an is on her way back.

730
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,440
Yes.

731
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,840
Hearing that Xu Qi'an died,

732
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,230
she made sure Duchess Yu was fine

733
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,840
and rode back immediately.

734
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,680
However...

735
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,070
What's wrong?

736
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,680
Princess Lin'an took the wrong path

737
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,600
in haste.

738
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,790
She could've taken the main road

739
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,160
and arrived in three days,

740
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,940
but she strayed into the Dark Forest

741
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,270
to take a shortcut.

742
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,550
Bandits were all over that place.

743
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,960
To protect Her Highness,

744
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,990
we contacted local authorities in secret

745
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,510
and wiped out

746
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,470
all those bandits.

747
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
As soon as

748
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,270
she got out,

749
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,160
she ended up in the Sand Col

750
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,550
in the desert.

751
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,400
After trekking for hours,

752
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,130
she almost fainted due to dehydration.

753
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
We had to

754
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,680
show up

755
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,160
as members of a trade caravan

756
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
to save her life.

757
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,030
You had us protect her covertly,

758
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,470
but we failed

759
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,640
and showed ourselves.

760
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,360
I should be punished.

761
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,790
It must've been tough.

762
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,920
Where is she now?

763
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,490
♪Light fur coats and shirts♪

764
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,560
♪Have taken away♪

765
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,910
♪A little warmth of me♪

766
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,360
Your Highness, if you don't mind,

767
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,750
I will

768
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,400
be your friend in the future.

769
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,450
♪I sigh alone, with my eyes lowered♪

770
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,530
♪The long dream came to a halt again♪

771
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,680
Please hurry up, sir.

772
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,860
(Talk)

773
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,990
"Let's the Meixi Bridge talk at."

774
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,910
What's that?

775
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,030
"Let's talk at the Meixi Bridge."

776
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,100
(Let's talk at the Meixi Bridge.)

777
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,630
Cijiu, what are the lanterns for?

778
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,800
They're the signals we use

779
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,320
to send messages.

780
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,880
If my friend wants to come,

781
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,920
we'll meet at the Meixi Bridge the next day.

782
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,510
Signals?

783
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,030
How mysterious.

784
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,840
Who is this person?

785
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,320
You'll know tomorrow.

786
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,780
(Meixi Lake)

787
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,940
(Meixi Lake)

788
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,870
Cijiu,

789
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,280
it's passed the agreed time.

790
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,960
I don't think your friend will come.

791
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,240
Hold on.

792
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,030
My friend must've caught up with something.

793
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,990
Isn't it hot here?

794
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,990
Have some watermelon.

795
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,510
Stop it.

796
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,110
It's rude.

797
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:26,110
I'd like one more piece, sir.

798
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,120
Sure.

799
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,470
- This one is sweet.
- I'll take all of them.

800
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,680
Sir,

801
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,590
thanks for taking care of me these days.

802
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,540
If you need help in the future,

803
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,630
you'll find me
at the Lake Villa in the capital.

804
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,510
It's nothing.

805
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,350
Miss,

806
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,990
don't you have things to attend to?

807
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,960
Go ahead.

808
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,870
Thanks.

809
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,700
(Good Harvests)

810
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,600
Guys,

811
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,800
come out now.

812
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,150
Her Highness has arrived safely.

813
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,990
Good job,

814
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,990
everyone.

815
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,510
Let's go to the Palace to claim rewards.

816
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,020
Great!

817
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,470
More liquor, sir.

818
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,360
Coming.

819
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,560
Enjoy.

820
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,430
Thanks.

821
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,240
Do you like the food?

822
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,030
It's great!

823
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,510
Where are we going next?

824
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,600
To the brothel!

825
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,590
Sir, you haven't paid for the drinks.

826
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,670
How dare you!

827
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,350
Let's go.

828
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,360
Didn't you forget something?

829
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,910
Pay up.

830
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,320
Do you know who I am?

831
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,360
Behave yourself

832
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,200
and go away!

833
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,360
Or...

834
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,670
How dare you assault an officer in public!

835
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Never mind.

836
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,760
Miss, the drinks are on the house.

837
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:38,950
My treat.

838
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,030
I'll say it one last time.

839
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,030
Pay up.

840
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,670
You're doomed!

841
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,350
Guards,

842
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,360
seize her!

843
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,720
They're wanted criminals.

844
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,110
Seize them! Go!

845
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,120
Boring.

846
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,100
(Treasure Sect)

847
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,470
Sorry, we failed to recognize you.

848
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,630
Please forgive us

849
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,630
and spare us!

850
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,800
Get lost.

851
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,080
Hold on.

852
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,310
Pay up.

853
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,310
Scram!

854
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,360
We broke your furniture.

855
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,650
Is it enough to pay for your loss?

856
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,070
Yes, more than enough.

857
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,280
Thank you, Miss.

858
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,360
Thank you, sir.

859
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,240
Thanks.

860
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,990
Thank you.

861
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,510
You're good.

862
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,470
So are you.

863
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,320
Too bad, so much fine liquor

864
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,920
got wasted for nothing.

865
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,080
Cijiu,

866
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,470
it's been almost six hours.

867
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,590
Shall we keep waiting?

868
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,510
Yes.

869
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,470
Sir, I'd like two pieces.

870
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,310
Sure.

871
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,760
I thought you wouldn't eat it.

872
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,720
Stop lying.

873
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,760
Eat your melon.

874
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,280
I am.

875
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,310
Sir,

876
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,350
two more, please.

877
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,820
It's too hot, isn't it?

878
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,800
Slow down. Don't choke on it.

879
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,390
Give me two more.

880
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:54,910
Cijiu,

881
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,800
it's been another four hours.

882
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,320
We can't keep waiting.

883
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,670
Or my stomach will explode.

884
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,070
I don't think your friend will come.

885
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,880
I guess that person doesn't want to see me.

886
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,360
Who exactly is it?

887
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,070
When I used to set off lanterns from home,

888
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,550
my friend would come the next day.

889
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,240
I never got stood up once.

890
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,190
But now...

891
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,750
"Two sticks of grass stay firmly together.

892
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,240
Yet two hearts

893
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,240
can't be as firm."

894
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,910
Indeed.

895
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,920
Your friend stood you up
without prior notice.

896
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,110
How mean.

897
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,720
Hold on.

898
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,110
You set off lanterns from home.

899
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,470
Which home?

900
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,080
Right.

901
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,150
We've moved.

902
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,090
It's not that my friend refuses to see me.

903
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,400
It's not, right?

904
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,680
Come on.

905
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,720
Let's go.

906
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,110
It's a long trip, Your Highness.

907
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:08,170
Going back alone is too dangerous.

908
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,120
(Xu Residence)

909
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,630
(Xu Qi'an died.)

910
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,700
(He's dead!)

911
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,720
(I have to see him one last time.)

912
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,470
(Xu Qi'an,)

913
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,320
(wait for me.)

914
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,510
(That's an order!)

915
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,350
Miss, are you

916
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,200
looking for someone?

917
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,900
The Xu Family moved away a long time ago.

918
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,140
(Meixi Bridge)

919
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,080
Cijiu,

920
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,920
aren't they a bit over the top?

921
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,360
It's windy tonight.

922
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,470
We'll succeed in this way.

923
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,240
Hold the thread.

924
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,840
Don't let it go. I'm almost done.

925
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,470
Don't you trust your brother?

926
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,960
I trust you the least.

927
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,670
If so, ask your father to do this.

928
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,360
