How can outlaws

Li Yuchun, have had enough.

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,150
I quit.

00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,040

- Chief!
- Chief!

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,760
We're told by the high-ups

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,520
to let you visit the prisoner.

53
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,270
You only have a few minutes.

54
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,270
That should be enough.

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,320
Yes.

56
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
But

57
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,390
first,

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,710
you have to wake him up.

59
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,960
Wake him up?

60
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,110
He's been

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,320
sleeping like that for days.

62
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,990
It's normal.

63
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,990
Fighters sleep a lot.

64
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,430
It's my father's dream life.

65
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,550
Thank you.

66
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,110
Ningyan.

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,920
Wake up! This isn't the time

68
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,990
to practice!

69
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,320
(Unite the heart and the mind.)

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,590
(Let the energy run.)

71
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,960
(The Spirit Stage!)

72
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,980
(7th Rank Fighter, Spirit Stage)

73
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,640
It stinks!

74
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
I stayed up for several nights

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,430
to reach the Spirit Stage.

76
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,550
Hey, what brings you here?

77
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,960
Yesterday, your colleagues

78
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,360
sent a message to our house,

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,920
saying you were in jail.

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,800
Lingyue rushed to the Academy
to tell me overnight.

81
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,350
Hearing that you were imprisoned,

82
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,520
I rushed back instantly

83
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,880
and waited until dawn

84
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,830
to get in when the Inner City opened.

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,590
How are the others

86
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,590
at home?

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,910
Mother went to seek help

88
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,150
from her townspeople all night.

89
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,150
Father rushed to the Bureau

90
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,270
and the Imperial Guards.

91
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,830
Lingyue

92
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,880
almost cried her eyes out.

93
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,200
When she found me,

94
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,000
she spoke in a trembling voice.

95
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,910
Lingyin was worried sick, too.

96
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,230
She only had a bowl of congee for breakfast.

97
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,270
I made them suffer.

98
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,470
I've talked to my masters,

99
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,160
but

100
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,120
they and Wei Yuan aren't exactly friends.

101
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,560
The Dean said

102
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,030
Grand Princess is your reference.

103
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,560
Only she can help you out.

104
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,640
Too bad,

105
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,790
she's in the Palace.

106
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,960
It's fine.

107
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,440
Just now, your two colleagues said

108
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,790
they could get me a permit.

109
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,910
I'll visit her in the Palace.

110
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,310
Cijiu,

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,320
are you mad at me?

112
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,400
I am.

113
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,590
I'm mad that you failed to kill that scum!

114
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,390
You're a scholar indeed!

115
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,030
I'll get you out.

117
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,270
Don't worry.

118
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,440
I'm blessed by the heavens.

119
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,960
I've been in jail three times

120
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,200
and got out twice.

121
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,520
Plus, Grand Princess's behind me.

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,720
I'll be fine.

123
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,230
I surely hope so.

124
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,270
Do you have money?

125
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,360
Yes.

126
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,470
Pay that jailer and tell him

127
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,710
you need one of my belongings back.

128
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,830
It's the Jade Mirror you saw.

129
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,120
If it's still there,

130
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,270
bring it to the Anji House on the east side

131
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,030
and show it to a man, Heng Yuan.

132
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,520
Tell him to inform No. 1

133
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,270
that No. 3 is in the Guardians' dungeon.

134
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,270
He needs help.

135
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
What if the mirror is gone?

136
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,470
Then forget it.

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,470
No need to bother

138
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,270
Grand Princess either.

139
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,680
His Copper Gong, badge,

140
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,830
weapon, and uniform

141
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,790
can't be taken away.

142
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,760
The rest is all yours.

143
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,710
Please send in a word.

144
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,860
(Shiqian Gate)

145
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,740
(Entry Permit)

146
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,500
(Xu Xinnian requests
to see Grand Princess.)

147
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm from the Yunlu Academy.

148
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,320
I'd like to see the Grand Princess.

149
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
Please tell her I'm here.

150
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,200
Wait a minute.

151
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,640
This is as far as we can go.

152
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
The rest is

153
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
on your own.

154
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
Thank you,

155
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,520
Mr. Song and Mr. Zhu.

156
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,680
We'll do anything

157
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,710
to get Ningyan out.

158
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,830
You have a visitor, Your Highness.

159
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,200
Xu Xinnian of the Yunlu Academy

160
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,250
greets the Grand Princess.

161
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,830
What brings you here?

162
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,390
My cousin, Xu Qi'an, is in great peril.

163
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,270
Please help him, Your Highness.

164
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Xu Qi'an?

165
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,030
What happened?

166
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,680
A Copper Gong badly injured a Silver Gong.

167
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,590
Clearly, the attacker meant to kill.

168
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,960
To put it seriously,

169
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,710
that's attempted murder.

170
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,880
My cousin might've acted rashly,

171
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,030
but had he done nothing,

172
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,470
that poor girl would've been

173
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,000
assaulted by Silver Gong Zhu.

174
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,350
Justice must be upheld

175
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,590
against power and interest.

176
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,470
He might not be a scholar,

177
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,320
but he'd sacrifice himself for righteousness.

178
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
How

179
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,590
did Lord Wei punish them?

180
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,830
Silver Gong Zhu is discharged

181
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,120
from office forever.

182
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,120
My cousin will

183
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,520
be cut in half in seven days.

184
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
My teachers,

185
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Master Mubai

186
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,680
and Master Youping, wrote this

187
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,680
(To Huaiqing)
to seek your help.

188
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,080
(Xu Qi'an is a rare genius
with half-written poems alone.)

189
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,920
I see.

190
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,590
The thing is

191
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,160
the Guardians are an imperial force.

192
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,990
They only listen to my father.

193
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,470
I'll see what I can do.

194
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,870
Thank you, Your Highness.

195
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,110
(We can't pin all our hope on her alone.)

196
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,080
(She's agreed to help,)

197
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,510
(but who knows how much she'll do?)

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,110
(Xu Cijiu,)

199
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,230
(what exactly)

200
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,960
(have you done these years?)

201
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,040
(In the Spring Exam next year,)

202
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,800
(I must come on top!)

203
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Your Highness,

204
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
it's been confirmed.

205
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,630
What Xu Xinnian said

206
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,710
is all true.

207
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,350
Were Xu Qi'an and Silver Gong Zhu
hostile against each other?

208
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
They had barely crossed paths.

209
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,710
Although Zhu did say

210
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,630
in private that he was jealous of Xu,

211
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,560
and he hated him.

212
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,320
Was the Governor of Taikang's family sent

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,590
to the Imperial Office of Music?

214
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,800
No.

215
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,320
Over the years,

216
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,560
Zhu repeatedly assaulted
convicted officials' families,

217
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,470
but

218
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,080
no one stood up to protect them.

219
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,110
I also found out

220
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
that Zhu

221
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,080
did provoke Xu Qi'an to attack

222
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,590
- but...
- But

223
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,230
he didn't think a mere Copper Gong

224
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,990
could unleash such great power.

225
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,320
I see what happened.

226
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,590
You may leave.

227
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,830
Yes.

228
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,100
(Forever Peace)

229
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,380
(Emperor's Chamber)

230
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,670
Your Majesty,

231
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,560
you're awake.

232
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,040
What time is it?

233
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,510
Your Majesty,

234
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,920
it's a quarter past the Yin hour.

235
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,710
It's the coldest at night.

236
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,350
Practicing too hard

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,090
might impair your health.

238
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,470
Any word from the Treasure Sect?

239
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,160
I've passed your order

240
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,230
to send in words immediately

241
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,440
once the State Preceptor comes out.

242
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,080
Your Majesty,
there was a sudden explosion at Sangbo.

243
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,800
The Ancestral Temple was destroyed.

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,870
The Ancestral Temple

245
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,240
has been destroyed.

246
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,900
(Forever Peace)

247
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,590
Wei Yuan.

248
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,110
Greetings, Your Majesty.

249
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
The ceremony just ended.

250
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,160
How did this happen?

251
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,800
I am still investigating.

252
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,470
What about the sword?

253
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,200
It fell into the Sangbo Lake.

254
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,600
We're trying to retrieve it.

255
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,400
Where is the Supervisor?

256
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,830
Your Majesty,

257
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,800
the Astronomical Bureau sent in words,

258
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,800
saying

259
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,110
the Supervisor was unwell

260
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,510
and is unable to see you.

261
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,560
The other corpses are like these ones.

262
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,110
Your Majesty,
we've found no signs of enemy invasion.

263
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,800
Wei Yuan.

264
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,340
(Cultivate the Mind)

265
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,240
By His Majesty's order,

266
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,230
no entry is allowed.

267
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,040
Huaiqing.

268
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,000
What now?

269
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,110
The situation remains unknown.

270
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,240
Lord Wei.

271
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,040
Lord Wei.

272
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,440
What's the status?

273
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,840
The Ancestral Temple was destroyed,

274
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,200
but

275
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,120
the culprit is long gone.

276
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,160
Was it to do with the worshiping ceremony?

277
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,360
His Majesty gave me 15 days to solve the case

278
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,310
and find the culprit.

279
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,200
I told him

280
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,160
it wouldn't

281
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,200
be easy to solve.

282
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,360
I'm still feeling anxious.

283
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,360
Your anxiety comes from within.

284
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,880
It needs to

285
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,990
be addressed from within, too.

286
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,790
You're right.

287
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,400
Can the State Preceptor come out early?

288
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,510
I'll issue an edit to confer the title

289
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,070
of the Supreme Consort on her.

290
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,990
(Chu Yuanzhen)
I understand.

291
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,540
(No. 4 of Realm Sect, 4th Rank of Men Sect)

292
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,840
I'll relay it to my master.

293
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,310
Alright, everyone.

294
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,790
Stop worrying.

295
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,230
All will be well.

296
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,110
Father,

297
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,160
was it linked to the incident
at the ceremony?

298
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,480
Father,

299
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,400
when I saw Lord Wei just now,

300
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,120
he said it'd be hard to solve this case.

301
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,710
I believe

302
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,200
he wanted me

303
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,550
to put in a good word for him

304
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,120
and ask for more time.

305
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,030
I happen to know a skilled investigator.

306
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,920
With his help,

307
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,070
this case will

308
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,880
be solved in 15 days.

309
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,270
Who is that?

310
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,200
It's none other than a Guardian, Xu...

311
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,640
Objection!

312
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,510
Is Princess Huaiqing
promoting her people again?

313
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,880
Father!

314
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,720
Father,

315
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,840
Brother hasn't said anything.

316
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,640
Huaiqing is trying to steal the thunder.

317
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,120
Please say something.

318
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,470
What do you suggest then?

319
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,510
I don't know.

320
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,360
What I do know is

321
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,790
your health

322
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,230
matters more than anything in the world.

323
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,440
Father,

324
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,550
Sangbo is an imperial sanctuary.

325
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,960
I wonder

326
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,640
what kind of treasure is kept there.

327
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,840
If someone can go in and out of there,

328
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,710
they can break into my mansion, too!

329
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,880
Relax.

330
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,120
With me here,

331
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,750
I dare them to lay a finger on my princess.

332
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,880
The explosion at Sangbo is serious,

333
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,880
causing a panic among court officials.

334
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,440
Father,

335
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,030
I might not excel in investigation,

336
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,440
but the Imperial Guards
and those of the Ministries

337
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,070
can solve this case together.

338
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,680
If Brother takes on this job,

339
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,920
I won't object to it.

340
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,600
The Crown Prince

341
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,790
will handle this case.

342
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,470
Yes, Father.

343
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,350
Do you mean

344
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,750
Lord Wei hinted that you should step in,

345
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,310
but Princess Lin'an interfered

346
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
to stop you?

347
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,470
Clearly,

348
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,270
she didn't know Xu Qi'an was in trouble.

349
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,750
Why not tell her about it just now?

350
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,120
Had she known,

351
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,030
she would've let you handle it.

352
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,400
It wasn't the right time.

353
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,470
Tell her now.

354
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,840
Father's paranoid.

355
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,230
The Sangbo Explosion

356
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,440
poses a huge threat to royalty.

357
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,230
Promoting her guest advisor now

358
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,310
would raise Father's suspicion.

359
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,070
What's even more suspicious is

360
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,160
she did so at the risk of annoying Father

361
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,160
but backed down when you interfered.

362
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,280
Wait.

363
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,990
That wasn't her style.

364
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,440
Your Highness!

365
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,230
Your Highness!

366
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,640
Bad news!

367
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,920
Why the rush?

368
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,840
I heard from those in the Palace

369
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,920
that... Copper Gong Xu was imprisoned!

370
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,480
What?

371
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,030
When I asked them,

372
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,360
they said he overreached himself,

373
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,600
trying to kill a Silver Gong.

374
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,640
That was a capital offense!

375
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,600
Lord Wei was outraged

376
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,330
and sentenced him to be
cut in half in public!

377
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,280
I'm afraid

378
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,400
he won't survive this time.

379
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
Xu Qi'an...

380
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,360
It's Xu Qi'an.

381
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,400
No...

382
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,200
Help him, Brother!

383
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Please help Xu Qi'an!

384
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,050
- Please!
- Hold on.

385
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,070
Who's Xu Qi'an?

386
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,110
Xu Qi'an...

387
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,270
He's my guest advisor.

388
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,070
Your guest advisor is a Guardian?

389
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,760
No, no...

390
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,720
I'm going to see Father!

391
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:40,070
- Lin'an!
- Your Highness!

392
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,230
Slow down. Lin'an!

393
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,380
(The virtuous...)

394
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,920
As you expected,

395
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,960
Princess Lin'an went to the Imperial Study.

396
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,400
Xu Qi'an broke the law,

397
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,790
and he's Lord Wei's man.

398
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,030
Father wouldn't meddle in it.

399
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,360
However,

400
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,510
she begged His Majesty for mercy.

401
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,630
In the end,

402
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,200
she said Xu Qi'an was her kept man.

403
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,710
Her kept man, she said?

404
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,510
How ridiculous!

405
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,680
But

406
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,550
that did sound like her.

407
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,920
His Majesty summoned Crown Prince

408
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,550
and Noble Consort Chen in a rage.

409
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,510
Father would calm down soon.

410
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,990
Everyone knows

411
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,230
Lin'an would never fool around with men.

412
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,030
Does she even know what a kept man is?

413
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,310
(Erudite and Upright)
I really didn't know what that was,

414
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,270
Father.

415
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,440
My servants and maids told me to say that,

416
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,750
Brother!

417
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,880
They said a kept man is

418
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,120
a man I keep

419
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,310
as a guest advisor.

420
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,960
You have to trust me, Mother!

421
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,200
Enough!

422
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,600
Kneel!

423
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,310
Your Majesty,

424
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,270
as spoiled as she is,

425
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,550
she'd never do such unspeakable things.

426
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,230
Please trust her, Your Majesty.

427
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,280
Father,

428
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,880
she was eager to help that man.

429
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,750
This is all but a misunderstanding.

430
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,030
Please trust her, Father!

431
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,270
Your Majesty.

432
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,600
Do you want me to die early?

433
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,310
I'm really sorry.

434
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,200
I'd never have a kept man.

435
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,880
He's merely a Copper Gong.

436
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
Why are you so eager to help him?

437
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,360
I can't lose him.

438
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,280
He...

439
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,960
He can write poems

440
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,120
and solve cases.

441
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,470
He can solve cases, too?

442
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,790
He can solve any case.

443
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,750
I saw the case files he processed
as a Guardian.

444
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,910
How good was he?

445
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,200
He solved almost all the cases

446
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,040
with speed.

447
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,120
Father, I beg you to allow him

448
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
to investigate the explosion

449
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,230
and redeem himself.

450
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,110
Fine.

451
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,120
If you also value his ability,

452
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,030
I'll give him a chance

453
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:30,870
to let him

454
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,470
make amends for his faults

455
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,230
by assisting you with this case.

456
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
Thank you, Father!

457
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,990
If he can't solve it within 15 days,

458
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,470
I'll have him executed.

459
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,750
Are you Xu?

460
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,750
You're...?

461
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,160
Some Imperial Guards have a message for you.

462
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:17,030
They're caught up with something,

463
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,070
so they can't come.

464
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,960
Those traitors!

465
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,360
They agreed to come when we drank yesterday

466
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,550
now they stood me up.

467
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,840
A bunch of pigs!

468
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,400
Ningyan,

469
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
I promised your father

470
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,600
to keep you safe.

471
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,840
I might not be a skilled fighter,

472
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,440
but I am

473
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
a man of my word.

474
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,440
Your noodles.

475
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,120
Didn't I tell you specifically no coriander?

476
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,890
Why did you add it?

477
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,920
Where's garlic? I want it.

478
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Yes, sure.

479
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,470
Without garlic,

480
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,880
noodles taste less good.

481
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,990
Fill myself up

482
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,360
and then I can work.

483
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,070
Ningyan,

484
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,790
give me a minute.

485
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,440
I'll eat up soon.

486
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,630
It this fresh garlic?

487
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,150
It's good!

488
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,120
Here's an edict!

489
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,200
Guardian, Copper Gong Xu Qi'an,

490
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,230
is skilled at solving cases.

491
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,990
He shall redeem himself

492
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,360
by solving the Sangbo Explosion in 15 days.

493
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,310
If he succeeds,

494
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,230
he'll be reinstated.

495
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,440
Otherwise,

496
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,270
he'll receive his punishment.

497
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,070
Also, the Guardians
shall provide full support.

498
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,880
The end.

499
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,230
Lord Wei,

501
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,710
His Majesty made an exception and gave

502
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,840
the Guardians another chance.

503
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,880
That little Copper Gong

504
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,920
is so fortunate.

505
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,960
It's all

506
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,440
thanks to you, too.

507
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,960
Lord Wei,

508
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,470
thanks.

509
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,920
Let's go.

510
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,710
Fortune does favor fools like Xu Qi'an.

511
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,750
How silly.

512
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,990
How am I silly?

513
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,120
Do you know why Father
talked to the Grand Princess?

514
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:42,640
He dropped a hint on her outside the study.

515
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,230
Then she advised His Majesty to give Xu

516
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,960
a chance to redeem himself.

517
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,990
I don't need you tell me.

518
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,710
I knew, of course.

519
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,880
I just didn't say it.

520
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,310
With a blockhead like yours?

521
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,720
Enough.

522
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,550
Stop arguing.

523
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,960
Release him from the prison.

524
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,040
Yes.

525
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,400
Send a word to Li Yuchun

526
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,990
that His Majesty released Xu Qi'an

527
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,990
to let him redeem himself.

528
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,550
And he, Silver Gong Li,

529
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,120
is also reinstated.

530
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,760
Remember,

531
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,200
make it grand.

532
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,480
Ningyan,

533
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,270
I promised your father

534
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,070
to keep you safe.

535
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,070
I might not be a skilled fighter,

536
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,230
but I am

537
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,680
a man of my word.

538
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,990
Where's the outhouse?

539
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,440
Ningyan,

540
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,640
you won't die,

541
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,550
Ningyan!

542
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,470
His Majesty is giving you a chance
to redeem yourself.

543
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,600
Hurry!

544
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,990
My man!

545
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,690
My man!

546
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,990
I miss you so much!

547
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,880
You're killing me!

548
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,830
I... I'm going to die because of you!

549
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,290
- Ningyan!
- Get off me!

550
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,310
Go away!

551
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,870
Ningyan,

552
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,440
I had the runs just now

553
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,030
and wasted a bit more time.

554
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,360
No more accidents will happen now.

555
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,630
Ningyan,

556
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,400
here I come!

557
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,960
Who are you

558
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,160
to break into the Haoqi Tower at night?

559
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,790
Why are you here?

560
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,230
Uh, sir,

561
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,360
I passed by.

562
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,270
If there's nothing else,

563
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,710
I... I'll be off.

564
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,870
Stop!

565
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,640
Why bring a saber with you?

566
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,310
Too tight.

567
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,360
I can't untie it in a rush.

568
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,400
Please give me a hand.

569
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,400
Ningyan...!

570
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,990
The Sangbo Explosion.

571
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,920
His Majesty ordered me to solve it

572
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,880
to redeem myself.

573
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,790
You really got lucky this time

574
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,030
and had a narrow escape.

575
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,840
How did His Majesty know?

576
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,760
We only know Lord Wei
went to see him at Sangbo.

577
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,070
Then the edict to release you
came this morning.

578
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,470
Lord Wei?

579
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,960
Let's get out of here.

580
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,920
It's filthy.

581
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,310
Let's go.

582
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,310
Come on.

583
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,150
You're out.

584
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,350
Mr. Jiang.

585
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,440
They told me everything.

586
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,760
Thank you for putting in

587
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,990
good words for me.

588
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,800
Don't mention it.

589
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,800
You did nothing wrong anyway.

590
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,360
We Gold Gongs are on your side.

591
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Good boy.

592
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,720
Well done.

593
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,280
I'll fight Yang Yan over you again later.

594
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,110
You should join me!

595
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,840
Thanks for your appreciation.

596
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,320
Who's this?

597
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,150
That petty thief was out of his mind.

598
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,240
Just now, he made a fuss

599
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,510
with his rusty saber outside,

600
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,880
so I seized him.

601
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
Is he crazy?

602
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,800
I guess.

603
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,590
But then again, Mr. Jiang,

604
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,760
if he dared to break into our office,

605
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,470
someone might be behind him.

606
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,990
We should

607
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,030
throw him in jail

608
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,880
and torture him. He'll confess.

609
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,070
You're right.

610
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,640
Guards.

611
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,800
Don't bother to question him. Lock him up

612
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,720
and torture him.

613
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,640
Sure.

614
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,190
I'm going to work, Mr. Jiang.

615
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,030
See you.

616
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,590
- Mr. Jiang.
- Goodbye.

617
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,430
Mr. Jiang.

618
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,960
Let's drink someday.

619
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,800
No problem!

620
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,280
Go.

621
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,070
Ningyan...

622
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,470
Ningyan...

623
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,440
Ningyan...!

624
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,320
What's wrong, Ningyan?

625
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,070
I hear someone calling my name.

626
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,720
Are you hearing voices?

627
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,720
You're free.

628
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,190
You won't be in jail ever again.

629
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,800
Rest assured.

630
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,320
The two of us will help you solve the case

631
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,440
and keep you safe.

632
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,120
My man.

633
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,200
My man.

634
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,420
(Xu Residence)

635
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,200
Cijiu,

636
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,400
the Grand Princess...

637
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,150
Her Highness is upright.

638
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,670
Let's hope she'll lend a hand.

639
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,960
Mother, Xinnian,

640
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,590
eat something.

641
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:00,070
You can't think on an empty stomach.

642
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
I wonder if Ningyan has anything

643
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,440
to eat in jail.

644
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,120
Mother,

645
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,990
Lingyue is right.

646
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,400
We need to eat in order to help Ningyan.

647
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,910
Lingyue,

648
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,190
you've barely eaten anything lately as well.

649
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,630
Eat something.

650
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,760
I regret

651
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,880
taking him in back then.

652
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,470
I thought you never wanted him here?

653
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,510
Don't you know I'm all bark and no bite?

654
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,920
Hadn't Ningyan's father

655
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,590
saved your father,

656
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,190
we wouldn't have become a family,

657
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,030
and you wouldn't have been born.

658
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,840
Are you alright, mother?

659
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,830
I'm fine.

660
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,800
I'm just a bit

661
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,470
disturbed.

662
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,550
Eat up

663
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,990
for your energy to recover.

664
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,070
What goodies are you eating without me?

665
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,760
You're back, Ningyan!

666
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,670
Let me hold you, little one!

667
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,030
Do you miss me?

668
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,760
I've been missing you so much!

669
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,990
Let's eat. What do we have?

670
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,320
I'm starving!

671
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,440
Is there anything good?

672
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,070
You're so annoying!

673
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,440
The food isn't for you.

674
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,880
What's wrong?

675
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,360
I heard from Cijiu

676
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,670
that while I was away,

677
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,030
you were too worried to eat.

678
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,190
I... I was fine.

679
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,110
I had a good appetite.

680
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,760
I ate a lot every day.

681
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,430
Where's my Sis?

682
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,560
Ningyan.

683
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,870
Ningyan,

684
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,280
I thought...

685
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,470
I'm fine.

686
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,150
I heard you barely ate anything lately.

687
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,800
Yes.

688
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,840
I even gave her my favorite drumsticks.

689
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,840
Good girl.

690
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,470
I'm back safe and sound. Let's eat.

691
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,510
I'll make another dish.

692
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,110
No need, Sis.

693
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,360
I'll go get you a cup.

694
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,640
Dig in.

695
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,360
Leave Ningyan alone.

696
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,920
