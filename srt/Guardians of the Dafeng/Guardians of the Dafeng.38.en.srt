Summon the Cabinet

41
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,550
to the court immediately

42
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,470
for Duke Huai's Bloodshed Case.

43
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,510
Yes.

44
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,390
Lin'an,

45
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,830
what's the emergency?

46
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:57,310
Brother,

47
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,720
Father won't admit...

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,270
He won't admit

49
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,110
Uncle created

50
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,640
the bloodshed in Chuzhou, will he?

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,200
Brother...

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Don't forget who you are.

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,550
This isn't your concern.

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,960
Can't you be like Huaiqing?

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,040
She's been silent.

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,880
Why?

57
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,800
Isn't it true that Uncle killed those people?

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,640
Shut up!

59
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,950
Lin'an,

60
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,110
Father adores you

61
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,870
because you're a sweet girl,

62
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,040
and you never interfere in state affairs.

63
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
But now,

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,390
how come you've changed?

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,830
Are you getting involved

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,670
because of Xu Qi'an?

67
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,270
He incited you, didn't he?

68
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,550
He didn't do anything.

69
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,960
I haven't seen him for days.

70
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,920
I can't see him.

71
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,390
I feel guilty.

72
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,520
Duke Huai is my uncle.

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,960
He committed such atrocities in Chuzhou.

74
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,200
We're family.

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
How could I stay out of this?

76
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,480
So

77
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,110
did you ask to see me

78
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,710
to make me

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,670
remonstrate with Father?

80
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,240
Father wouldn't see you,

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,110
let alone me.

82
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
Lin'an,

83
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,360
there's no right or wrong in court.

84
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,040
Only gains and losses matter.

85
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,320
Whether or not my words
carry weight is one thing.

86
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,150
As the Crown Prince,

87
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,000
I must stand four-square

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,910
with the nobility and imperial clansmen.

89
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,680
You're a princess.

90
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,910
No one cares about what you do.

91
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,150
Were you a prince,

92
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,640
those words of yours would cost you

93
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,030
your chance of coming to the throne.

94
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,790
But he murdered so many people.

95
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,420
Hundreds of thousands of them!

96
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,560
Shouldn't he pay for their deaths?

97
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
Or who'd be in awe of the Dafeng royalty

98
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,230
and the law of the Dafeng?

99
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,470
There were, there are, and there will be

100
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,710
tons of such things.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,590
Once Father makes the decision,

102
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,760
no one can change it.

103
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,470
Listen, silly,

104
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,000
Father's throne was

105
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,120
built on bones and blood.

106
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,120
If we didn't come,

107
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,710
our imperial image
built in the last 600 years

108
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,760
would be ruined by you.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,910
My Lord,

110
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,680
Duke Zhenbei killed
all the people of Chuzhou.

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,150
Those 380,000 souls need justice.

112
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,080
Everyone else in our state needs justice.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,060
(Duke Cheng, Imperial Clansman)
After the Battle

114
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,760
of Linyuan Pass, Duke Zhenbei was ordered

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
to guard the northern border.

116
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,320
Now that he's dead,

117
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,030
can't we keep

118
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,440
his posthumous name intact?

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,830
His merits can't offset his crimes.

120
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,110
Your Majesty,

121
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,230
it's true that he safeguarded our state,

122
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,960
but it's also true
that he was guilty beyond forgiveness.

123
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,030
He shall be punished.

124
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,500
Your Majesty, Wang Zhenwen

125
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,780
(Duke Lu, Imperial Clansman)
is defaming a duke in public.

126
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,890
That's a capital crime.

127
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,760
Dukes,

128
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,390
think carefully about this case.

129
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,390
(Duke Li, Imperial Clansman)

130
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,560
You're a lowly eunuch.

131
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,470
Without His Majesty's appreciation,

132
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,790
you wouldn't have the right to speak here.

133
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm grateful for Your Majesty's kindness.

134
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,230
However,

135
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,230
for the sake of the imperial image,

136
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
the Dukes

137
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,470
shouldn't try to cover up this case.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,440
Yesterday, the three masters of the Academy

139
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,710
meant to come

140
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,390
to rebuke Your Majesty.

141
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,470
I stopped them.

142
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
They said

143
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,880
now that

144
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,470
Duke Huai killed the people of Chuzhou,

145
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,520
the Academy

146
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,350
would write down his crimes

147
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,120
in history

148
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,270
to warn future generations.

149
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,830
How the Dukes

150
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,880
covered for him today

151
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,440
would also be engraved in it

152
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
in full detail.

153
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,760
Duke Li,

154
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,960
you've always been proud

155
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
and erudite.

156
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,790
You're a role model for Imperial Clansmen

157
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,350
and every student in the state.

158
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,560
Would you rather see

159
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,640
the Yunlu Academy write down

160
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,640
how you covered for a murderer

161
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,000
and be condemned forever?

162
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,030
How dare you threaten me!

163
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,440
Are you being rebellious?

164
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,440
When did advice become a threat?

165
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,400
You...

166
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,830
All of you...

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,360
Your Majesty,

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,790
permission to speak.

169
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:43,910
Simu said,

170
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
His Majesty held a sudden meeting earlier

171
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,120
to discuss Duke Huai's Bloodshed Case.

172
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,560
How did it go? What's the conclusion?

173
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,560
Officials didn't win,

174
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,320
but neither did His Majesty.

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,230
The debate would drag on and on.

176
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,680
Unexpectedly,

177
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,150
State Duke Cao stepped forward

178
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,270
to speak up.

179
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
Your Majesty,

180
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,990
over the years, we've been
having internal and external troubles.

181
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,150
People have been struggling.

182
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,440
Tax arrears keep building up.

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,150
Despite your unceasing tax cuts

184
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,440
to ease people's burden,

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,390
complaints are heard everywhere.

186
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,350
At this time,

187
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,590
if they knew about the bloodshed,

188
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,120
what would they think about the court?

189
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,790
What would squires and petty officials think?

190
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,910
Would they think

191
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,590
the court was hopeless

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,960
and do worse

193
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,630
in exploiting the people

194
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,560
even more brazenly?

195
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,440
How bold!

196
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,400
Are you calling me fatuous

197
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,110
and the officials

198
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,440
blind and incompetent?

199
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,200
I wouldn't dare.

200
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,960
But aren't the officials

201
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,510
acting as if they're blind and incompetent?

202
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,040
They keep shouting

203
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,590
to uphold justice for the people

204
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,830
and convict the culprit now.

205
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,080
Has anyone considered the bigger picture?

206
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,110
As court officials,

207
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,470
don't you know the image of the court

208
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,680
also represents your image?

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,510
But Duke Zhenbei

210
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,800
was indeed guilty.

211
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,960
Your Majesty,

212
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,590
Duke Zhenbei is...

213
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,470
is already dead.

214
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,710
Can death erase everything?

215
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,710
Yes.

216
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,750
Chuzhou was harassed by Kui for years.

217
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,830
The city fell into ruin.

218
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,750
When Kui seized it,

219
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,560
Duke Zhenbei put up a desperate struggle,

220
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,110
battling the chief of Kui alone.

221
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,800
He killed the Mighty Bone

222
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,200
and guarded the gate of the Dafeng

223
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
to the end.

224
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,470
He fell with the city

225
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,160
and died heroically!

226
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
After that war,

227
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,560
Chuzhou will enjoy over ten years

228
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,870
or tens of years of peace.

229
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,550
Your Majesty,

230
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,230
he died a worthy death.

231
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
He's a hero of the Dafeng!

232
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,350
Your Majesty!

233
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,200
State Duke Cao,

234
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,830
did you forget

235
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,960
not only I witnessed the bloodshed?

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
The...

237
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,990
the mission,

238
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,990
those 20,000 troops in Chuzhou,

239
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,040
and the people in the capital all know it!

240
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,430
Can you...

241
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,670
can you...

242
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,680
can you keep all of them quiet?

243
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,110
They used the images of the court and royalty

244
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,560
and the chief of Kui's death as leverage.

245
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,400
Although Chuzhou fell,

246
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,440
that was all Kui's fault.

247
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,750
What a wonderful chain.

248
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,990
It sounds reasonable.

249
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,830
In that case,

250
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,750
the fall of Chuzhou wouldn't be intolerable.

251
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,990
It happened all because of war

252
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,110
and Kui.

253
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,870
Duke Huai would turn from a murderer

254
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,160
to a hero and guardian of the Dafeng

255
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,110
who even killed the chief of Kui.

256
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,560
That was a great merit.

257
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,190
- Wait!
- Wait!

258
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
You first, Ningyan.

259
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,280
This plan wasn't too bad,

260
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,320
but it'd hold the officials back at most.

261
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,750
The sharp ones could easily tell

262
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,870
that was His Majesty's show.

263
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,710
Correct.

264
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,680
Mr. Zheng's last line is the point.

265
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,710
Many people know about the bloodshed.

266
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,800
Could such a self-deceiving show

267
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,470
silence everyone?

268
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,320
He started paving the way a long time ago.

269
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,110
He knew it couldn't.

270
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,470
Was all this

271
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,200
also to lay the groundwork?

272
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,200
Does His Majesty have

273
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,920
more cards up his sleeve?

274
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
After Duke Huai died,

275
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,800
the North lost the sky-propping pillar.

276
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,750
Kui can't stir up more trouble,

277
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,080
but

278
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,040
The Witcher's Sect

279
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,750
can go around

280
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,160
Chuzhou

281
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,750
and head straight to the capital

282
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,920
to deal a death blow.

283
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,160
The sky-propping pillar is too big

284
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,630
and hard to control.

285
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,230
Once it falls,

286
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,470
it'll be

287
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
lose-lose.

288
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,400
Is that so?

289
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,400
Your Majesty,

290
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,590
reports from every palace said

291
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,710
no one was harmed.

292
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,800
Nothing was stolen.

293
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,510
Has the assassin been seized?

294
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,990
Your Majesty,

295
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,120
not yet.

296
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,200
Keep looking.

297
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,040
Yes.

298
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,320
An assassin broke in?

299
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,400
Why

300
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,230
didn't I know?

301
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,590
I kept it quiet, telling them

302
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,230
not to make a fuss.

303
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,750
It happened suddenly,

304
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,990
causing panic in the Palace.

305
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,040
Even the Empress

306
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,800
was frightened.

307
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,830
The assassin must be caught quickly

308
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,320
to put an end to this matter.

309
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,760
The Empress

310
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,230
can stop worrying.

311
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,320
Your chess skills

312
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,750
have further advanced, Your Majesty.

313
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,470
Are you giving up?

314
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,760
Another around.

315
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,170
(Edict, Prime Minster Wang Zhenwen)

316
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,330
(is guilty of malpractice.)

317
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,800
(He's removed from office. The end.)

318
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,220
(Looking up, one can face the heavens.
Looking down, one won't disappoint...)

319
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,830
Court adjourned.

320
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,110
Good day, Your Majesty.

321
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,710
Your Majesty...

322
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,560
I'm tired.

323
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,110
So are you.

324
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,630
I implore you to convict Duke Zhenbei!

325
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,160
Mr. Zheng.

326
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,590
Wait, Mr. Zheng.

327
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,350
Mr. Zheng,

328
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,100
you left Chuzhou without permission

329
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,360
to seek justice in the capital,

330
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,540
thinking you'd win for sure.

331
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,960
Did you think

332
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,300
you'd end up like this?

333
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,160
Here's my advice.

334
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,520
Mr. Zheng,

335
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,590
Chuzhou has been destroyed.

336
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,200
You should stay there

337
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,040
to rebuild the city.

338
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,800
Stay out of

339
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,110
the things in the capital.

340
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,630
That's also His Majesty's thought.

341
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,230
You're shameless.

342
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,710
What can I do?

343
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,440
That old geezer.

344
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,230
How stupid!

345
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,080
When you came back

346
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,800
to report on your work after the inspection,

347
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,200
we met once.

348
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,710
Back then,

349
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,960
you were gray-haired

350
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,880
but vigorous.

351
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,960
Lord Wei,

352
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,470
are you also giving up?

353
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,030
Xu Qi'an

354
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,790
is a valuable talent.

355
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,440
I believe

356
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,990
he's a born Fighter.

357
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,360
His temper and character
can give me a headache, though.

358
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,230
I told him

359
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,880
to survive in the official circles,

360
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,550
think about three things.

361
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,710
Danger,

362
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,360
retreat,

363
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,030
and change.

364
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,750
Before taking action,

365
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,360
think about the consequences

366
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,470
and what's involved.

367
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
Weigh the pros and cons

368
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,550
before engaging in

369
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
or giving up.

370
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,230
If you can't stop what's coming your way,

371
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,960
then retreat.

372
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,960
Take a step back.

373
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,790
But Xu Qi'an said,

374
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,640
"Lord Wei,

375
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,840
I understand all that,

376
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,640
but

377
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,310
I don't care."

378
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,840
What a boorish Fighter.

379
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,440
If you call him "boorish",

380
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,120
that means you can't change him.

381
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,310
Step back

382
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,750
to be safe.

383
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,470
When you're safe,

384
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,310
you can think about

385
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,750
how to change the situation.

386
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,990
There's still room to turn the tide.

387
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,710
Mr. Zheng,

388
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,680
why not take a step back

389
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,360
and take things slow?

390
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,020
(Wang Mansion)

391
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,840
Commissioner of Chuzhou, Zheng Xinghuai,

392
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,680
would like to see Prime Minister Wang.

393
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,070
He's with a guest at the moment.

394
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,790
He won't be able to see you soon.

395
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,030
Commissioner Zheng,

396
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,550
you should go.

397
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,870
Sir.

398
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,880
Go to the Secretary of War's Mansion.

399
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,310
Yes.

400
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:28,140
(Wang Mansion)

401
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,740
(Ministry of War)

402
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,520
Sir.

403
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,980
(Ministry of War)

404
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,820
(Censorate)

405
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,660
(Court of Judicial Review)

406
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,470
Sir, it's getting dark.

407
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,200
Let's go.

408
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,540
(Court of Judicial Review)

409
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,580
(Juyi Inn)

410
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,350
Mr. Xu.

411
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,110
Mr. Zheng.

412
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,200
Sorry,

413
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,810
I disappointed you.

414
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,230
The streets are packed.

415
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,360
It's the Dragon Boat Festival.

416
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,030
Earlier today,

417
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,600
I went to see Lord Wei.

418
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,470
So did I.

419
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,520
Mr. Xu,

420
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,200
how about

421
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,990
we eat plain noodles? My treat.

422
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,460
(Noodles)

423
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,350
Mr. Zheng,

424
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,960
I'm not hungry.

425
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,120
I am.

426
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,790
- Enjoy.
- This is a specialty of Jiangnan.

427
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,310
It's been my favorite since childhood.

428
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,310
Taste it.

429
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Earlier today,

430
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,160
I went to the Six Ministries
and other offices.

431
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,790
Thankfully, Lord Wei let me in.

432
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,160
Or I'd be even more embarrassed.

433
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,960
The officials are waiting.

434
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,640
I understand.

435
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,870
Mr. Zheng,

436
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,030
what are you going to do next?

437
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,960
What do you suggest?

438
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,960
There's a well-known tale

439
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,360
in my hometown

440
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,440
called The Tortoise and the Hare.

441
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,200
I'd like to tell you about it.

442
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,350
Go ahead.

443
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,710
The Tortoise and the Hare are racing.

444
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,400
The Hare is faster,

445
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,710
leaving the Tortoise far behind.

446
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,310
The Hare is

447
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,790
proud of its speed,

448
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,070
thinking it'll win for sure

449
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,920
and going to nap halfway.

450
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,920
Meanwhile, the Tortoise

451
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:02,600
keeps crawling and crawling,

452
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,440
crawling and crawling.

453
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,470
It hasn't stopped at all.

454
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,270
By the time the Hare wakes up,

455
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,510
the Tortoise has reached the finishing line.

456
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,030
As slow as it is,

457
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,600
it'll get there eventually.

458
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,880
Why not consider Lord Wei's advice

459
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,270
to think about those three things?

460
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,310
Take a step back

461
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
and take things slow.

462
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,240
Mr. Xu,

463
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,550
I'm going to tell you a story, too.

464
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,390
Please.

465
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,880
Many years ago, a scholar

466
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,270
became an official at a young age.

467
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,400
He was full of political ambition.

468
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,750
At the age of 30,

469
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,310
he went to Chuzhou.

470
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,880
Everyone thought

471
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,120
he volunteered to serve the people there,

472
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,960
but actually,

473
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,990
he was exiled to that remote barren land

474
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,120
for offending the then Prime Minister.

475
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,750
At first,

476
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,680
he hated that place.

477
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,680
That exiled official

478
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,030
was frustrated.

479
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,600
He was eager to make achievements

480
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,440
to return to the capital someday.

481
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,160
Why didn't he go back to the capital?

482
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,920
In the beginning, he put his career first.

483
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,270
Later,

484
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,880
he saw how poor the locals were,

485
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,550
but he also saw

486
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,680
their kindness

487
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,400
and vitality.

488
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,440
He loved to go to one street.

489
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,750
Originally, he went there
only to eat plain noodles.

490
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,680
Then

491
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,360
he found the coarse buns
sold in the shop on the street corner

492
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,270
also flavorful.

493
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,440
He saw the widow on the west side

494
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,640
marry another man

495
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,640
and a boy with snot
playing games on the street corner

496
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,200
grow up

497
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,960
and help his father run the lamb stall.

498
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,200
In 20 years' time,

499
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,710
he got to know many people there

500
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,600
and walked down every street.

501
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,030
That city wasn't as beautiful as Jiangnan

502
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,400
or as bustling as the capital,

503
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,710
but as time passed,

504
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,640
it became his hometown.

505
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,840
He decided

506
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
to stay.

507
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,230
Is the scholar in that story

508
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,120
you, sir?

509
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,200
I'm over 50 years old.

510
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,440
I should know the mandate of heaven.

511
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,440
I became unambitious a long time ago.

512
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,880
I just wanted to look after my mother,

513
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,270
children, and grandchildren

514
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,880
while keeping Chuzhou safe.

515
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,920
But the city was destroyed

516
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,710
overnight.

517
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,360
All those people

518
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,680
ended up dead.

519
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,030
I wanted to live a carefree life.

520
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,990
I wanted to take things slow.

521
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,600
But the deceased

522
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,790
came to haunt me every single night.

523
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,120
I couldn't live

524
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,270
or die.

525
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,440
I couldn't give in

526
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,200
or give up.

527
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,360
Bones piled up.

528
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,470
I saw them all the time.

529
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,070
Their wail was echoing.

530
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,750
Lord Wei said to take things slow.

531
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,360
He might be right,

532
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,840
but I...

533
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,790
cannot stop.

534
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,790
Sir, would you like some water lanterns?

535
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,550
Float them with your wishes

536
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,400
to pray for heaven's blessing

537
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,840
and your wishes to come true.

538
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,510
I'd like one.

539
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,520
Here you go.

540
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,440
Thank you, sir!

541
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,680
Mr. Zheng,

542
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,470
may your wishes come true.

543
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,750
I hope so.

544
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,990
What's going on in the Cabinet lately?

545
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,270
Your Majesty,

546
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,750
Prime Minister Wang didn't see anyone.

547
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,920
What about Wei Yuan?

548
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,310
Two days ago, after the court meeting,

549
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,840
Commissioner Zheng
went to the Guardian Yamen.

550
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,030
Lord Wei received him.

551
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,070
Since then,

552
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,400
they haven't crossed paths again.

553
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,470
Both of them are smart.

554
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,550
Rejecting Zheng Xinghuai

555
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,160
is to give him a way out.

556
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,470
But

557
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,030
Wei Yuan

558
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,880
respects me even less.

559
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,400
What did Zheng Xinghuai do?

560
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,920
Your Majesty,

561
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,750
he didn't take Lord Wei's advice.

562
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,400
He's been running around

563
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,200
to incite the high-ups

564
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,510
and persuade the officials.

565
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,360
But they won't see him.

566
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,640
They know

567
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,640
what you're thinking.

568
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,640
He's digging his own grave.

569
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,160
Who are you?

570
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,720
Step back.

571
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
I am

572
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,470
the Commander of Chuzhou,

573
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,790
State Duke of Protection, Que Yongxiu!

574
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
I'm here to sue

575
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,600
the Commissioner of Chuzhou,
Zheng Xinghuai!

576
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,750
He murdered Duke Zhenbei!

577
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:05,310
He killed 380,000 people of Chuzhou!

578
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,550
He

579
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,270
deceived the mission

580
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,990
and hunted me

581
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,030
in order to cover up the truth

582
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,990
that he colluded with Kui

583
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,270
to frame Duke Zhenbei,

584
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,510
accusing him of killing those people!

585
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,920
He is unforgivable!

586
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,470
Your Majesty,

587
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,790
Zheng Xinghuai sided with the mission

588
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,200
to go after me.

589
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,160
He framed the bloodshed
against Duke Zhenbei

590
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,400
to cover for his collusion with Kui.

591
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,120
He is unforgivable!

592
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,640
Your Majesty, please uphold justice for me,

593
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,310
for Duke Zhenbei,

594
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,200
and for the people of Chuzhou!

595
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,510
Your Majesty!

596
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,440
380,000 people

597
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,880
died tragically.

598
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,440
Duke Zhenbei!

599
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,160
How dare he lie to me.

600
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,880
Those poor souls

601
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,230
of 380,000 people.

602
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,790
And my poor brother!

603
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,470
Let all of them read it.

604
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,310
Yes.

605
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,640
He fooled me.

606
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,480
What...!

607
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,230
What a tragedy!

608
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,990
Take a look.

609
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,090
Look, everyone!

610
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,710
Please, Your Majesty!

611
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,550
Your Majesty,

612
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,640
Zheng Xinghuai colluded with Kui,

613
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,510
killed Duke Zhenbei,

614
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,070
and twisted the facts
to deceive Your Majesty.

615
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,630
He is unforgivable!

616
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,440
His entire clan shall be executed!

617
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,880
I tried to stop Zheng Xinghuai,

618
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,630
but he was too stubborn.

619
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,240
Weren't he stubborn,

620
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,030
he wouldn't have been exiled
by my predecessor.

621
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,760
It's too soon to act.

622
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,240
Why couldn't he wait a bit longer?

623
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,840
I had men look for Que Yongxiu in secret

624
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,840
but didn't find him.

625
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,400
Now that he's in the Palace,

626
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,990
there's no more wiggle room.

627
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,630
Not exactly.

628
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,800
The officials obeyed His Majesty's thought

629
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,280
because Duke Zhenbei had died.

630
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,880
Dead men tell no tales.

631
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,840
Now that Que Yongxiu is back alive,

632
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,920
things can take a favorable turn.

633
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
I've had people check out Que Yongxiu.

634
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,280
If he's found guilty,

635
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,760
we can convict Duke Zhenbei.

636
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,280
This is our chance.

637
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,320
Que Yongxiu's return

638
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,150
did give someone hope to reverse the case.

639
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,920
During the meeting earlier,

640
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,150
His Majesty made us leave

641
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,240
to have State Duke Cao and others

642
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,280
conclude this case.

643
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,720
Your Majesty,

644
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,960
a thorough investigation is needed.

645
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,160
This case

646
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,840
is huge.

647
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,190
It must be thoroughly investigated.

648
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,680
Have

649
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,720
the Court of Judicial Review investigate it.

650
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,760
State Duke Cao,

651
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,990
you're the Lead Investigator.

652
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,920
Yes.

653
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,550
Take the Gold Badge.

654
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,670
Go to the inn to arrest Zheng Xinghuai now.

655
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,800
Kill him if he resists!

656
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,070
You're wise, Your Majesty!

657
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,880
Thank you, Your Majesty!

658
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,800
Your Majesty,

659
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,670
your health is most important.

660
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,510
Go...

661
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,510
Go fetch me

662
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,440
- a Golden Pill.
- Yes.

663
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,670
Take care of yourself, Your Majesty.

664
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,350
Eunuch Yang.

665
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,510
Lord Wei,

666
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,440
Prime Minister Wang.

667
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,920
What's the situation

668
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,510
in the Imperial Study?

669
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,240
The meeting just ended.

670
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,550
His Majesty is a bit tired

671
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,030
and taking a nap.

672
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,110
He won't see anyone else today.

673
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,880
He's made his decision

674
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,360
and had men go to the inn

675
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,840
to arrest Commissioner Zheng.

676
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,960
You fell sick from grief.

677
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,150
It's nothing too severe, though.

678
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,030
Take some herbs

679
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,360
and rest, then you'll be fine.

680
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,150
Are you with the Bureau?

681
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,320
I heard Physicians there are highly skilled.

682
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,630
The formidable Supervisor can tell fortune.

683
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,320
I know what you're thinking

684
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,990
and why Xu Qi'an asked me

685
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,280
to treat you.

686
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,960
However,

687
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,920
if you wish to see my master,

688
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,590
just give up.

689
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,960
The Bureau never interferes in state affairs.

690
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,880
That's the rule.

691
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:46,950
Who are you?

692
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,320
How dare you break in!

693
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,720
Sir, I'll go and check.

694
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,240
I'll go.

695
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,510
Stay put, Mister.

696
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,590
I'll go.

697
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,670
Xu Qi'an doesn't want you to get hurt.

698
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,280
Thank you, Miss.

699
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,990
But I need to face

700
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,760
what comes my way.

701
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,590
I have to trouble you

702
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,470
to pass this to Silver Gong Xu.

703
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,630
We're ordered by His Majesty

704
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:30,280
to take Zheng Xinghuai
to Judicial Review for questioning!

705
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,150
What is Mr. Zheng guilty of?

706
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,510
The Commander of Chuzhou,
Duke Que Yongxiu returned.

707
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,240
He told His Majesty

708
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,280
about what really happened in Chuzhou.

709
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,630
The truth is

710
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,550
Commissioner Zheng Xinghuai

711
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,110
colluded with Kui,

712
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,990
causing the deaths
of Duke Zhenbei and 380,000 people!

713
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,670
No! None of that is true!

714
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,760
No one can take Mr. Zheng away!

715
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,070
So weak and ignorant.

716
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,840
Don't overreach yourself.

717
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,510
Seize them!

718
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,300
Silver Gong Li Yuchun!

719
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,320
Copper Gong Song Tingfeng!

720
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,920
Copper Gong Zhu Guangxiao!

721
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,030
We'll protect Mr. Zheng to the death!

722
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,990
Copper Gongs?

723
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,840
Are 7th-Rank Fighters trying to stop me?

724
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,840
Plus a lowly Silver Gong, huh?

725
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,120
Go!

726
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,510
What about Gold Gongs?

727
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,190
Gold Gong Peng Yuan!

728
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,760
Gold Gong Fang Wuyan!

729
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,840
Gold Gong Sima Qing!

730
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,470
Gold Gong Wu Lei!

731
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,070
Gold Gong Yan Ming!

732
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,510
Gold Gong Huo Juncheng!

733
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,630
Gold Gong Jiang Lyuzhong!

734
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,400
Gold Gong Nangong Qianrou!

735
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,760
Gold Gong

736
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:21,960
Yang Yan!

737
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,360
All of you are the pillars of the court

738
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,510
with a limitless future.

739
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,670
Before you defy His Majesty's order,

740
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,190
think about

741
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,960
the consequences

742
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,590
of challenging the court.

743
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,840
If you take one step forward,

744
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
you'll know

745
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,360
the consequences!

746
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,190
The Guardians

747
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,880
are here to protect Mr. Zheng!
