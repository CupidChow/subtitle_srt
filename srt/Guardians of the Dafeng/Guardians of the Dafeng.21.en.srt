You're just 4th Rank Fighters.

41
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,030
How dare you only stand with me here?

42
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,390
Rou!

43
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,280
After taking three of my strikes,

44
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,910
he won't die,
but he can only struggle to survive.

45
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,230
However,

46
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
who exactly is this guy?

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,560
I'm talking about that arm.

48
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:45,680
Arm?

49
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,560
From my observation,

50
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,270
that arm doesn't belong to him.

51
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,150
The strength of its demonic power

52
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,200
is the most powerful I've ever seen.

53
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,480
Yang Qianhuan,

54
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,080
are your eyes on your back?

55
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,120
Before he left,

56
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,790
I secretly glanced at him.

57
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,470
Could you turn around and speak?

58
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,520
You weren't like this before.

59
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,670
I can't.

60
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,270
Please allow me to refuse.

61
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,080
I do things according to my own will.

62
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,680
I don't care about anyone's opinion.

63
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,830
I've carefully observed Wei Yuan
and the Supervisor.

64
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Didn't you all

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,640
notice this?

66
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,520
What do you mean?

67
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,910
One stands on the Watchtower,
with his back to you;

68
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,790
the other sits on the Bagua Platform,
with his back to us.

69
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,120
We all think

70
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,200
Wei Yuan and the Supervisor

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,560
have the demeanor of great masters.

72
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,790
Alright, let's get to the point.

73
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,680
Based on the current intel we have,

74
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,830
that hand must be the sealed object
from the Sangbo lakebed.

75
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,670
That's right.

76
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,230
That man in gray is Heng Hui.

77
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,440
As long as we can catch him,

78
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,560
we'll find out
where Princess Pingyang is.

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,910
The Sangbo Case happened
only a few days ago,

80
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,320
and you Guardians

81
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,710
have got so many details?

82
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,920
Wait.

83
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,590
Why have I never heard

84
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,120
my juniors from the Astronomical Bureau
mention this case to me?

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,320
Didn't you ask them for assistance?

86
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
You Guardians

87
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,080
don't have such great abilities.

88
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,760
We Guardians didn't even
deploy the Gold Gongs.

89
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,470
The one handling the case

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,080
was just an ordinary Copper Gong.

91
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,680
A Copper Gong?

92
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,880
Which one?

93
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,470
You should have heard of him.

94
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,910
He's quite famous in the Bureau.

95
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,270
His name is Xu Qi'an.

96
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,520
Xu

97
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,680
Qi

98
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,870
An?

99
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,830
I heard of him
when I first returned to the Bureau.

100
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,350
He's an alchemy genius.

101
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
But I didn't expect

102
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,830
that he would also handle
the Sangbo Case.

103
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,000
Doesn't this make him
stand out even more?

104
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,120
What a strong rival.

105
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,470
What's the deal with that demonic hand?

106
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,870
I don't know.

107
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm not interested
in these strange powers

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,830
and have no desire to be interested.

109
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,790
Listen carefully.

110
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,640
In today's battle,

111
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,520
I, Yang Qianhuan,

112
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
will take the lead in merit.

113
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,590
He's been away from the capital
for months,

114
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,960
and his condition is worsening.

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,880
Should we get him another physician?

116
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,230
Forget it.

117
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,350
Let him die from the illness.

118
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,360
Senior,

119
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,760
I've suffered serious injuries.

120
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,920
The severed arm has backfired.

121
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,400
Heng Hui,

122
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,510
stop this while you still can.

123
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,590
Senior,

124
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,040
I entered the Azure Hall when I was six

125
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,830
and have been by your side ever since.

126
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,750
You taught me to chant scriptures,

127
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,830
taught me to meditate,

128
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,630
took care of my clothes, food

129
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,320
and daily needs,

130
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,200
and treated me like a brother,

131
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,320
like a father.

132
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,990
Now,

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,400
there's something

134
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,750
I want to ask of you.

135
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,440
I want...

136
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,830
I want

137
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,870
to eat you, Senior.

138
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,320
I want to eat you, Senior.

139
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,820
(Guardians)

140
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,670
Lord Wei.

141
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,340
(Like a Dragon Entering the Thunder)

142
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,980
- Why the laugh?
- Why the laugh?

143
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,550
Nothing.

144
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
I didn't laugh.

145
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,950
I didn't laugh.

146
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,440
We fought fiercely last night.

147
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,590
Where were you?

148
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,230
You Gold Gongs

149
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,830
are best

150
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,160
at fighting.

151
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,110
I'm a mere Copper Gong.

152
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,990
I'd only hold you back

153
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,200
if I went.

154
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,630
You're just afraid of death.

155
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,320
- Absolutely not.
- Enough.

156
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,040
Last night, Heng Hui appeared
at the Minister of War's Mansion.

157
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,680
These Gold Gongs...

158
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,400
They were injured by Heng Hui.

159
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,830
Last night, the yamen set up a trap
at the Minister of War's Mansion.

160
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,920
Three Gold Gongs

161
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,710
and one 4th Rank disciple
of the Supervisor.

162
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,230
Four 4th Rank experts
didn't capture Heng Hui.

163
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,710
Did you see where he came from?

164
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,990
A severed hand.

165
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,710
As expected.

166
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,400
Lord Wei,

167
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,710
what rank is the owner
of this severed hand?

168
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,710
At least 2nd Rank.

169
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,040
Most likely, 1st Rank.

170
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,710
What's the origin of this severed hand?

171
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,200
Is it related to the Tianyu?

172
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,990
This matter

173
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,920
involves a very secret affair.

174
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,470
I do not know

175
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,320
the specific details.

176
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,990
What we know now is

177
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,230
Heng Hui has been seriously injured.

178
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,990
He is still in the city.

179
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,110
I have reported the situation
to His Majesty.

180
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,710
The city search continues.

181
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,350
You

182
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,710
continue your investigation.

183
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,120
Yes.

184
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Where is the Minister of War now?

185
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,360
He is under house arrest in his mansion

186
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,870
in the name of protection.

187
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,470
I'll investigate it now.

188
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,880
Wait.

189
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,110
Mr. Zhang is a 2nd Rank official.

190
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,510
Be cautious.

191
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,590
Officials of the 4th Rank or above

192
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,280
should not be subjected to Gazing Spell.

193
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,400
This is the rule.

194
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,640
Yes.

195
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,800
However,

196
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,990
you can still bring a sorcerer.

197
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,680
Understood.

198
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,990
Then I'll have Caiwei accompany me.

199
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,630
No need.

200
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,200
A stronger sorcerer

201
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,680
has been waiting for you at the yamen
for the whole night.

202
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,280
Waiting for me?

203
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,110
You must be the alchemy genius Xu Qi'an.

204
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,800
It's just a few tricks.

205
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,630
As for alchemy,

206
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,040
the Bureau is the best of the time.

207
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,200
Quite perceptive.

208
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,200
May I ask who you are?

209
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,470
The best sorcerer of the Bureau,

210
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,740
Yang Qianhuan.

211
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,680
I assume

212
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,680
you must know me.

213
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,400
Huan

214
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
Qian

215
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,100
Yang.

216
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,960
It's Yang Qianhuan.

217
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,190
My senior.

218
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,510
The only formationist

219
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,080
in the Dafeng.

220
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,830
A 4th Rank formationist.

221
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,590
Senior Yang.

222
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,110
I've long admired your name.

223
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,830
I've long admired you.

224
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,710
Senior Yang,

225
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,680
why are you facing away from me?

226
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,710
Only by facing away from the crowd

227
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,110
can one show

228
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,870
the demeanor of a great master.

229
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,350
What do you think?

230
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,200
(So,)

231
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,590
(he's a Chunibyo boy.)

232
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,640
Senior Yang,

233
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
you're right.

234
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,080
What do you need from me?

235
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,440
Take it.

236
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,560
What's this?

237
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,020
My Merit Records.

238
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,500
(Merit Records)
Yesterday,

239
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,200
I assisted the Guardians

240
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,110
in taking down a madman.

241
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,200
This madman has a bronze body
and iron arms.

242
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,630
His demonic energy is terrifying.

243
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,160
The three Gold Gongs
were no match for him.

244
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,440
Luckily, in the end,

245
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,560
I used the Killing Intent

246
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,680
of Heaven, Earth, and Men

247
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,990
to turn the tide

248
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,560
and secure the victory,

249
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,750
defeating the madman.

250
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,470
Based on this,

251
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
I, Yang Qianhuan,

252
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,600
will take the lead in merit.

253
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,360
I've written all the details
of this battle thoroughly.

254
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,650
Take your time to read it.

255
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,920
Just announce it to the world as it is.

256
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,510
Just announce it to the world

257
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
as it is.

258
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,310
That's all?

259
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,280
Senior Yang,

260
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,600
why not go directly to Lord Wei?

261
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,550
I'm just a small Copper Gong.

262
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,070
I've asked,

263
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,710
but I don't know
what Wei Yuan was thinking.

264
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,030
He said you're in charge
of the Sangbo Case,

265
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,550
and that everything
must be reviewed by you

266
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,910
before it can be disclosed.

267
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,840
(Lord Wei sure knows
how to shift blame.)

268
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,130
Rest assured, Senior Yang.

269
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,550
Once I finish handling this case,

270
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,960
I'll certainly announce it
to the world as it is.

271
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
That's good.

272
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,120
It's not in vain that I've waited
for you all night.

273
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,160
You go back to work.

274
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,130
I'm going to sleep now.

275
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,500
Senior Yang, don't rush off.

276
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,960
Anything else?

277
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,790
It's nothing serious.

278
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,230
I just suddenly remembered a line

279
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,550
that suits your temperament.

280
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:26,750
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

281
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,270
There is no one like me in this world.

282
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
It's wild,

283
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,760
solitary,

284
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,520
and invincible.

285
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,120
What a good line.

286
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,640
What a good line.

287
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,120
I stumbled upon this line
some time ago

288
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,510
but had never met anyone
who could match it

289
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,400
until today when I saw you.

290
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,040
How about this?

291
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,030
If you don't mind,

292
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,470
I'll give you this line as a gift

293
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,550
for our first meeting.

294
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,850
You really know how to flatter me.

295
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,710
Since you're offering it so sincerely,

296
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,750
I won't

297
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,400
stand on ceremony.

298
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,880
Let me take a moment to appreciate it.

299
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,930
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

300
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,720
There is no one like me in this world.

301
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,460
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

302
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,060
There is no one like me in this world.

303
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,920
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

304
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,550
There is no one like me in this world.

305
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,670
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

306
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,270
There is no one like me in this world.

307
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,230
It's a good line,

308
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,920
but it still feels

309
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,230
like something is missing.

310
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,230
It's missing your handsome face.

311
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,200
By the way, Senior Yang,

312
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,070
you've accumulated so many merits.

313
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,270
Do you mind adding one more?

314
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,270
Do you know how?

315
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,470
Tell me quickly.

316
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,440
Here's the thing.

317
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,920
I need to go
to the Minister of War's Mansion

318
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,030
to interrogate Zhang Feng.

319
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,200
I need a powerful sorcerer like you

320
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,600
to help me discern the truth.

321
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,880
You Guardians just can't do your job

322
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,750
without our Bureau.

323
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,230
Fine. I'm in a good mood today.

324
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,920
I'll go with you.

325
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,600
Alright, I'll prepare the horse now.

326
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,680
Please wait a moment.

327
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,110
No need.

328
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,470
Close your eyes lightly,

329
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,440
and bow your head for two breaths.

330
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,310
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars.

331
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,200
There is no one like me in this world.

332
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,440
I found it.

333
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,070
It feels just right now.

334
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,310
Senior Yang,

335
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,640
where is this?

336
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,960
Who are these rogues

337
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,990
to dare to trespass
the Minister of War's Mansion?

338
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm the Lead Investigator
of the Sangbo Case.

339
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,440
Vanish.

340
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:04,960
Vanish again.

341
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,680
Vanish again.

342
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,520
Keep vanishing.

343
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,750
Senior Yang, what are you doing?

344
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,720
Don't worry.

345
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,030
I'm just setting up a formation

346
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,200
to move them to a quieter place.

347
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,800
How bold!

348
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,920
Who's making the noise here?

349
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,920
Who are you

350
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,640
to dare trespass
the Minister of War's Mansion?

351
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,710
I'm the Lead Investigator
of the Sangbo Case.

352
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,550
Vanish.

353
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,120
This one can't vanish.

354
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,990
Vanish? Vanish what?

355
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,310
Let's go

356
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,680
inside to talk.

357
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,070
I apologize for the disturbance.

358
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,360
Please forgive me, Mr. Zhang.

359
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,640
Mr. Xu is young and talented.

360
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,880
I heard that not only
has the Sangbo Case progressed rapidly,

361
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,880
but you also uncovered the culprit

362
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,880
behind Earl Pingyuan's case.

363
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,960
Mr. Zhang,

364
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
you flatter me.

365
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,990
No need for pleasantries.

366
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,070
Ask what you need to ask.

367
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,840
I'm here to understand the case

368
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,440
and speed up the investigation.

369
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,310
Mr. Xu, you're joking.

370
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,310
You Guardians are handling the case,

371
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,440
so you must be

372
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,200
more familiar with the details.

373
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,990
What clues could there be here?

374
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,340
Senior Yang,

375
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,710
during the questioning just now,

376
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,640
which things were true

377
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,750
and which were false?

378
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,440
None of it was true.

379
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,400
This old fox.

380
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,550
If there's nothing else,
I'll return to the Bureau.

381
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,440
Alright, thank you, Senior Yang.

382
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,280
Okay.

383
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,310
Goodbye...

384
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,270
Senior Yang,

385
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,110
are you alright?

386
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
It's nothing.

387
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,830
It happens.

388
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,440
We've found Heng Yuan.

389
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,600
What happened?

390
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,960
You're too late.

391
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,750
He's already gone to paradise.

392
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,880
He's dead?

393
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,920
Between me and death,

394
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,030
he chose the latter.

395
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,710
His life

396
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,400
was taken by the demonic hand.

397
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,470
I want to eat you, Senior.

398
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,270
No.

399
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,200
I can't kill him.

400
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,310
Heng Yuan is a Martial Monk.

401
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,600
His blood and qi were strong,

402
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,470
just enough to heal your injuries.

403
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,310
What?

404
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,360
You no longer want revenge?

405
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,550
No.

406
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
He is my senior.

407
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:48,830
No.

408
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,470
I can't kill him.

409
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,230
You once told me

410
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,070
that everyone can be killed

411
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,710
for your revenge.

412
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Why is he

413
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,200
an exception?

414
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,920
He is my senior.

415
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,680
I respect him most in this world.

416
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
So,

417
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,310
what about Pingyang?

418
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,840
Pingyang...

419
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,070
Pingyang...

420
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,310
Heng Hui.

421
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,110
Heng Hui.

422
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,600
Everyone in this world can be killed,

423
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,200
but not my senior.

424
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,070
Heng Hui!

425
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,920
Senior,

426
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,070
didn't you always want to know

427
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,750
what happened

428
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,600
a year ago?

429
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,030
Afterward,

430
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,030
the evil object disappeared.

431
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,750
Only I stayed behind,

432
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,550
waiting for all of you.

433
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,680
Is it because you have something to say?

434
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,270
He's gone,

435
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,440
but he didn't give up on revenge.

436
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,230
He handed the burden to me.

437
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,310
Now,

438
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,230
I want to tell you all a story.

439
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,030
A story from a year ago.

440
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,790
Is it the story of Heng Hui
and Princess Pingyang?

441
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,750
One year ago,

442
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,960
in the Azure Hall,

443
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,270
Heng Hui first met Princess Pingyang.

444
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,510
In Heng Hui,

445
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,960
Pingyang saw

446
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,640
the freedom she had long yearned for.

447
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,990
To escape her arranged marriage,

448
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,840
they decided

449
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,400
to leave the capital asap.

450
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,620
(Duke Yu's Mansion)

451
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,840
In order to leave the capital,

452
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,230
they needed a weapon
that could conceal their aura

453
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,960
to hide from the Bureau sorcerers.

454
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,910
Additionally,

455
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,070
they needed someone

456
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,510
who could help them forge new identities

457
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,590
and find a way

458
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,710
to leave the capital.

459
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,720
For this,

460
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,070
Princess Pingyang

461
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,600
found a trustworthy friend,

462
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,160
the lineal son of Earl Pingyuan.

463
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,750
At that time, Earl Pingyuan
and the noble factions

464
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,230
were already drifting apart.

465
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,960
After learning of the plan from his son,

466
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,920
he colluded
with the then-Vice Minister of War

467
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,030
and devised a plan

468
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,790
to send Princess Pingyang
out of the capital,

469
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,400
in order to strike

470
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,750
at Prince Yu's faction.

471
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,750
Where is Princess Pingyang now?

472
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,750
Has Earl Pingyuan provided her
with a new identity?

473
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,130
(Wang Heng from Jianzhou)
The naive Princess Pingyang

474
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,960
was unaware
of the complex court politics

475
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
and the malice of people's hearts.

476
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,380
A naive and unworldly girl

477
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,380
and a Wanderer
who'd been away from the world.

478
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,360
The moment they decided
to leave together,

479
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,150
the tragedy

480
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,910
was already sealed.

481
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,360
Human hearts can be venomous.

482
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,880
Once they left the capital,

483
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,280
they revealed

484
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,880
their true intentions,

485
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,470
planning to assault Princess Pingyang.

486
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,550
Pingyang and Heng Hui
fought to the death.

487
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,390
In the end,

488
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,120
one was killed,

489
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
and the other

490
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,030
committed suicide with a hairpin.

491
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,470
Princess Pingyang died?

492
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,230
You said "they".

493
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,400
Who else was involved,

494
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,240
besides Earl Pingyuan's lineal son?

495
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,840
Another villain

496
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,120
was Zhang Feng's son,

497
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,990
Zhang Yi.

498
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,000
No!

499
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,830
No!

500
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,070
Stop!

501
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,270
Heng Hui!

502
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,440
Heng Hui!

503
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,640
Since Heng Hui died a year ago,

504
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,510
why is he here now?

505
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,400
After someone dies,

506
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,500
they cannot come back to life.

507
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,510
Someone used secret magic to seal
Heng Hui's primordial spirit in his body

508
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,440
and turned him
into an unconscious walking corpse.

509
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,990
In this year,

510
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,840
what sustained him was revenge.

511
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:19,510
It's the blood feud
of Princess Pingyang.

512
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,600
Who saved him?

513
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,990
What is their true purpose?

514
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,960
This

515
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,680
is still unknown.

516
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,710
In Heng Hui's memory,

517
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,470
this part is very vague.

518
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,270
He only knows
that the person used his body

519
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,270
to refine the demonic energy
for the demonic hand.

520
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,470
A corpse puppet.

521
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,110
A secret method of the Witcher's Sect.

522
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,310
It seems Heng Hui was merely a vessel.

523
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,270
The mastermind behind this

524
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,510
used the corpse puppet
to weaken the demonic energy,

525
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,070
so they could use the demonic hand.

526
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,990
The witness has died.

527
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,510
Do you have any proof
of what you just said?

528
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,470
If you don't believe it,

529
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,230
take the body back

530
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,120
and have the coroner examine it.

531
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,920
Be gentle.

532
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,040
Here it is.

533
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,180
(Heng Hui was defeated and fled.)

534
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,660
(The Witcher's Sect's secret method.)

535
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,680
Lord Wei, Princess Lin'an is here.

536
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,270
Xu Qi'an,

537
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,840
accompany Princess Lin'an

538
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,600
to the morgue.

539
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,830
Yes.

540
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,980
(The Witcher's Sect)

541
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,580
(Peace)

542
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
Your Highness.

543
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,390
Your Highness.

544
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,360
We haven't confirmed the identity
of this corpse.

545
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,240
Perhaps it isn't Princess Pingyang.

Once I reach the South,

563
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,320
I'll write to you.

564
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,640
♪Though this world is bitterly cold♪

565
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,670
♪I only wish for Xu's safety♪

566
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,930
♪Neither joy nor sorrow lingers♪

567
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:45,020
♪Flowers fall; their fragrance fades♪

568
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,880
Wait for me.

569
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,510
I'll definitely come back to see you.

570
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,130
♪To bloom brightly♪

571
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,160
Cover it.

572
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,540
Cover it.

573
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,280
Your Highness.

574
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,440
Princess Lin'an was heartbroken,

575
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,110
but she still identified that corpse.

576
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,280
It's Princess Pingyang.

577
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,140
Also,

578
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,670
Duchess Yu is on the way to the morgue.

579
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,830
Understood.

580
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,360
Leave.

581
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,440
Your Highness, this is serious.

582
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,150
It may cause a change in the court.

583
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,390
- Should we prepare...
- Leave!

584
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,120
Yes.

585
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,030
Don't you love to play?

586
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,360
Don't you love to joke?

587
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,320
What are you doing now?

588
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,360
Get up!

589
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,960
Why are you so obedient now?

590
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,150
I almost forgot

591
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
the fresh pomegranates from this year.

592
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,110
Aren't pomegranates your favorite?

593
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,960
Let me peel one for you.

594
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,240
It's so sweet.

595
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,030
It's really sweet.

596
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,510
Pingyang, try it.

597
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:53,150
This is the pomegranate from this year.

598
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,760
Go on, eat it.

599
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,470
Aren't they your favorite?

600
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,280
Why aren't you eating?

601
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,880
It's really sweet.

602
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,720
Pingyang,

603
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,880
from now on, I'll always be with you.

604
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,320
I'll take you home.

605
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:23,400
Shall we go home?

606
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,800
Pingyang, let's go home.

607
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,110
Who did this?

608
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,960
Who did this?

609
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,630
Earl Pingyuan's lineal son

610
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,510
and the Minister of War's son,

611
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Zhang Yi.

612
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,400
Was she insulted?

613
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,110
She used a golden hairpin

614
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,200
to commit suicide.

615
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,680
Thank you.

616
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,300
(The heaven and earth bear witness.)

617
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,080
Good.

618
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:59,150
We will handle this as you suggested.

619
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,090
Go and take care of it.

620
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,990
Yes.

621
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,070
How's the Sangbo Case going?

622
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,190
Why didn't Wei Yuan come today?

623
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,920
Your Majesty,

624
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,630
Princess Lin'an seeks an audience.

625
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,360
Lin'an?

626
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,320
What does she want?

627
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,920
Tell her to go back.

628
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,910
Yes.

629
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,150
What brings you here?

630
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,670
I'm Lin'an.

631
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,670
I need to report.

632
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,550
It's a grievous injustice.

633
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,920
I plead for imperial judgment.

634
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,240
Come in.

635
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,370
White bones are buried in yellow earth.

636
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,570
A year of suppressed injustice

637
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,510
makes the living mourn in agony

638
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,030
and the spirits weep blood.

639
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,150
The heaven and earth

640
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,550
bear witness.

641
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,030
This blood letter is for justice,

642
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,630
waiting for an execution.
