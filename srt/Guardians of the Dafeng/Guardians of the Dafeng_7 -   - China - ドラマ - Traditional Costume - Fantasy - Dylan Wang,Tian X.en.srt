Guardians.

42
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,280
Put your hands down.

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,200

44
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,720
Are you Xu Qi'an?

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,550
Speak.

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,240
Yes, I am Xu Qi'an.

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,600
That's right.

48
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,470
Come with us.

49
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,950
Wait.

50
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,920
My Lords,

51
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,390
I haven't done anything wrong.

52
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,960
Do no wrong,

53
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,520
and fear no Guardians.

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,240
Why do I feel
like there's a burnt smell on me?

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Smell it.

56
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,990
Is there?

57
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,550
It seems like there is.

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,320
Let me smell you.

59
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,240
I think I have it too.

60
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,480
Prepare some bathwater later.

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,870
I need to bathe and change.

62
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,710
Alright.

63
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,140
(Noble Consort Chen, Mother of Lin'an)

64
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,960
Greetings, Mother.

65
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,760
Your handwriting is messy,

66
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,360
and your grammar is poor.

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
It seems

68
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,480
you haven't been diligent lately.

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,240
Mother,

70
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,320
these are just drafts.

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,640
Days ago, my master even praised me

72
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,970
for being diligent in my studies.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,640
Look at your messy hair
and disheveled clothes.

74
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,800
That's not like a princess.

75
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,200
Mother,

76
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,870
I look like this

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,760
because I went
to the Astronomical Bureau

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,080
to study alchemy.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,110
I even managed to make fake silver.

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,710
Those alchemists praised me

81
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,200
for being smarter and more talented
than Huaiqing.

82
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Take a seat.

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,600
You caused

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,270
an explosion at the Astronomical Bureau.

85
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,150
This has spread within the Palace.

86
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,960
By tomorrow,
everyone will know about it.

87
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Then

88
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,830
people will mock you,
the Crown Prince's sister,

89
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,000
for being inferior to Huaiqing
in every way.

90
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,830
You'll even drag down the East Palace.

91
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,240
Mother,

92
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,770
it was an accident this time.

93
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,040
I promise

94
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,270
I'll work hard

95
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,240
to surpass Huaiqing

96
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,860
and not disgrace the Crown Prince.

97
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,590
The Second Prince

98
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,150
is mediocre in both talent
and martial arts,

99
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,390
but because he has Huaiqing as a sister,

100
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,830
even the Emperor
thinks more highly of him.

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,270
The Crown Prince

102
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,590
excels in everything

103
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,230
and loves you dearly.

104
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,320
You must not tarnish his reputation
as his sister.

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,760
Your Highness,
shall I go prepare the hot water now?

106
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,710
Your Highness, your hand is injured.

107
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,230
I'll fetch the imperial physician.

108
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,120
My Lord, if you could tell me

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,200
what happened,

110
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,000
I would be eternally grateful.

111
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,710
The rules for Guardians are strict.

112
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,350
Accepting bribes over ten liang

113
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,820
results in fifty ashes of cane.

114
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,680
Over fifty liang results in exile.

115
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,080
Over a hundred liang

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,480
results in execution.

117
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,470
I need to follow the rules.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
Honestly,

119
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm just following orders.

120
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,760
I don't know

121
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,790
the specifics.

122
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,350
But

123
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,520
you seem like a decent man.

124
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,440
As a brother,

125
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,470
I'll tell you this:

126
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,250
When you arrive
at the Guardian Yamen,

127
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,230
say what you should,

128
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,400
but never say

129
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,760
what you shouldn't.

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,800
Here we are.

131
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,000
This is the Guardian Yamen.

132
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,540
(Haoqi Tower)

133
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,630
Go ahead.

134
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,880
Good luck.

135
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,060
(Haoqi Tower)

136
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,150
We meet again.

137
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,640
Mr. Yang.

138
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,670
Sit.

139
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,100
It's been a long time, Mr. Yang.

140
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,150
Rou,

141
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,760
get to work.

142
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
You scoundrel.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
I told you not to call me Rou.

144
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,310
Perfect timing.

145
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,910
You can try out my new torture tools.

146
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,270
Answer

147
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,830
whatever you're asked.

148
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,270
If you lie,

149
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,080
you'll face punishment.

150
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,960
Yes.

151
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,440
Xu Qi'an,

152
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,270
do you know that the mastermind
behind the tax silver case was Mr. Zhou?

153
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,120
I heard Miss Caiwei
from the Astronomical Bureau mention it.

154
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,230
Do you know Zhou Li wanted to kill you?

155
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,070
Yes.

156
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
So, to avoid retaliation,

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,230
you struck first,

158
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,560
kidnapped Weiwu Marquis's son,
and framed Zhou Li

159
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,880
to bring down the Zhou Family

160
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,680
and eliminate future threats.

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,520
My Lord, I don't understand

162
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,790
what you're saying.

163
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,150
On the day Weiwu Marquis's son
was kidnapped,

164
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,520
you weren't on duty at the yamen.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,200
Where did you go?

166
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I went to a brothel to listen to music.

167
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
It was neglect of duty,

168
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,150
but it had nothing to do with this case.

169
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,960
How do you explain the permit record?

170
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,160
The yamen's records of issuing permits

171
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,830
show multiple entries of you

172
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,750
going to the Inner City.

173
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,320
My Lord, I'm innocent.

174
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,400
I have never been to the Inner City,

175
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,710
nor have I ever taken a permit
from the yamen.

176
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
My Lord,

177
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,630
you must've made a mistake.

178
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,440
(I had others to handle permits
for the Inner City.)

179
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,830
(My tracks are clean.)

180
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,400
(If you're trying to trick me,)

181
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,030
(you're still too inexperienced.)

182
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,920
Rou,

183
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,560
I already told you, didn't I?

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
When dealing with truly smart people,

185
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,350
your skills aren't enough.

186
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,920
Not bad.

187
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,230
If we hadn't gathered evidence
in advance,

188
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,230
we might have

189
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,630
believed you just now.

190
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,350
(Xu Qi'an's Trace Record)
On March 10,

191
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,150
Xu Qi'an was followed on his way back
from the Yunlu Academy.

192
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,560
Maybe someone from the Zhou Family.

193
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,830
That night,
we drove away Zhou assassins.

194
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,750
On March 11,

195
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,960
the Xu ladies were brought
to Yunlu Academy for safety.

196
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,870
On the same day, Xu Qi'an
went to the Imperial Office of Music,

197
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,870
using the alias Yang Ling
to write To Fuxiang.

198
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,160
He then bought a bag of green tangerines
before the Imperial Office of Music.

199
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,440
On March 16,

200
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,510
you went to a brothel in the morning,

201
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,610
where you drugged Butterfly and Begonia
in a private room.

202
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,470
You then went
to Zhou Li's private residence,

203
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,160
using unknown means
to abduct four people.

204
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,080
Afterward, you and Xu Pingzhi
disguised yourselves as coachmen,

205
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,110
rammed Weiwu Marquis's son
with a carriage,

206
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,350
and abducted him using the same method.

207
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,630
Finally,

208
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,110
you returned to the brothel,
pretending to be drunk,

209
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,960
staying until midnight
before returning home.

210
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,960
Framing the Vice Minister of Revenue

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,800
and kidnapping Weiwu Marquis's son

212
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,870
are enough

213
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,350
for your entire family to be executed.

214
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,470
(Why?)

215
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,830
(Why would the Guardians track me?)

216
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,110
(I'm just a Speed.)

217
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,710
(This doesn't make sense.)

218
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,000
(Wait a minute.)

219
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,870
(They witnessed everything)

220
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,160
(but didn't stop it.)

221
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,800
(Why is that?)

222
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,990
Do you have anything else to say?

223
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,630
I confess.

224
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,280
It was all done by me.

225
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,320
But please rest assured, My Lord.

226
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,630
I will keep my mouth shut

227
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,040
and never reveal a single word
to anyone.

228
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,440
What are you talking about?

229
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,510
You followed me

230
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,400
but didn't intervene.

231
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,280
In my opinion,

232
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,630
Mr. Zhou's

233
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,350
political enemy

234
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,240
must be

235
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,320
the Guardians.

236
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I told you

237
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,510
he was perceptive.

238
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,960
Just so so.

239
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,920
We were just testing you earlier.

240
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,440
If you had shown any flaws
during the interrogation,

241
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,870
or if you had broken

242
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,080
under the ironclad evidence,

243
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,110
what awaited you

244
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,830
would've been true punishment.

245
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,870
But now, what awaits you

246
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,870
is an invitation from the Guardians.

247
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,230
The Guardians

248
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,350
are inviting

249
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,160
me?

250
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,590
Your Highness,

251
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,470
Xu Qi'an has been taken
by the Guardians.

252
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,710
That's right.

253
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,160
The Grand Princess recommended you.

254
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,350
The Grand Princess?

255
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,470
Huaiqing?

256
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,780
The princess has arrived.

257
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,560
It's her?

258
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,470
Sir, after you.

259
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,440
Why did she recommend me?

260
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,470
We're just following orders.

261
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,750
If you're curious,

262
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,230
you can ask Lord Wei.

263
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,280
Of course,
that's just one of the reasons.

264
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,110
You're talented.

265
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,200
I confirmed that
during the tax silver case.

266
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,790
But the Guardians have their rules.

267
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,320
The minimum standard is the Qi Stage.

268
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,870
You're still far from that.

269
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,820
Yes, yes.

270
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,200
That's why we needed to test you.

271
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,920
But clearly,

272
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,200
you've proven yourself again.

273
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,470
Mr. Zhou is doomed sooner or later.

274
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,400
We've started taking action against him.

275
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,510
But your solving of the tax silver case

276
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,400
has indeed sped up our progress.

277
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,400
So, you value

278
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,590
my investigative skills?

279
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,560
We value your resourcefulness

280
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,880
and your ability to keep secrets.

281
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,000
Rou,

282
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,280
as agreed before,

283
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,630
he is mine now.

284
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,510
Please give us some space
for a private conversation.

285
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,110
The choice is yours.

286
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,230
Will you choose me

287
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,350
or him?

288
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,750
We're both Gold Gongs,

289
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,320
and our authority is equal.

290
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,080
But he only focuses on cultivation.

291
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,680
He won't have time to guide you.

292
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,280
If you follow me,

293
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,320
I can personally guide you.

294
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,040
In three to five years at most,

295
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,470
you'll be able to inherit my mantle.

296
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,280
Thank you for your kindness.

297
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,830
But during the tax silver case,

298
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,870
Mr. Yang gave me the chance
to make amends.

299
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,800
I've always remembered that favor.

300
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,040
I'd like to work under him.

301
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,870
Are you sure about this?

302
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,830
He won't have time to guide you.

303
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,230
At most,

304
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,990
he'll hand you over to his Silver Gongs

305
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,310
and deal with you half-heartedly.

306
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,800
Rou,

307
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,630
obviously,

308
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,680
he's not interested in your approach.

309
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,320
What's the use

310
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,680
of inheriting your mantle?

311
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,080
What's the point

312
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,680
of getting close to him?

313
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,710
You always extract people's spinal fluid

314
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,590
and open their skulls.

315
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,350
That's creepy as hell.

316
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,400
Yes, yes.

317
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,590
Stop calling me Rou.

318
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
Sit.

319
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm Yang Yan,
Gold Gong of the Guardians.

320
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,960
I'll be your immediate superior
from now on.

321
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,080
You can call me Mr. Yang.

322
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,990
If that feels too formal,

323
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
you can call me Yan, Yang,
or whatever you like.

324
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,630
Yan...

325
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,590
Yan.

326
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,200
Smart move.

327
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,990
With your potential,

328
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,110
if you follow me for a while,

329
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,680
you'll be able to walk freely

330
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,110
across the capital of the Dafeng.

331
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,020
(Like a Dragon Entering the Thunder)

332
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,280
The Guardians' primary duties

333
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,590
are supervising the officials

334
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,110
and guarding the capital.

335
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,960
You'll learn

336
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,750
the specifics in time.

337
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Now, I'll handle
your household registration

338
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,230
and process the relevant paperwork.

339
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,480
Later,

340
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,160
I'll introduce you
to your assigned Silver Gong.

341
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,170
- Mr. Yang.
- Mr. Yang.

342
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,790
From here on,
I leave everything to you two.

343
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,400
Take him through the basics

344
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,200
of being a Guardian.

345
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

346
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,760
Yan,

347
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,550
take care.

348
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,520
Song Tingfeng.

349
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,240
Zhu Guangxiao.

350
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Good for you.

351
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,120
You're officially one of us now.

352
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,790
From now on,

353
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,230
I'll count on you two to guide me.

354
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,120
Working under Yan

355
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,200
is fairly relaxing.

356
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,910
But

357
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,600
the downside is you might be assigned
to the Breeze Hall,

358
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,440
just like us.

359
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,280
The Breeze Hall?

360
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
What's wrong with it?

361
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,640
Nothing wrong.

362
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,230
But when we're on the job,

363
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,610
- we have to be careful.
- Got it.

364
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,790
Why are we flying again?

365
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,310
We're taking you up higher

366
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,840
so you can see and hear

367
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,020
everything clearly.

368
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,120
Are you afraid of heights?

369
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,570
No. I've even gone bungee jumping.

370
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,030
- Bungee jumping?
- Not important.

371
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,270
Good. Look.

372
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,680
In the Guardians' ranks,

373
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,410
the lowest level is the White Laborer.

374
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,440
They're unofficial staff,

375
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,930
(White Laborer)
handling chores like pouring tea.

376
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,880
(Devotion to Duty)
Above it is the Recorder.

377
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,410
(Recorder)
They keep records

378
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,400
and organize documents.

379
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,710
This is the Copper Gong.

380
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,260
(Copper Gong)
They're proper Guardians.

381
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,600
Whether it's solving cases

382
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,990
or capturing criminals,

383
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,990
we're always on the front lines.

384
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,280
Someone is escaping.
Why don't you chase him?

385
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,990
He can't escape.
We're just used to this.

386
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,540
(Silver Gongs)
Next is the Silver Gong.

387
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,070
They enjoy the privileges of a Baihu.

388
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,440
You've seen their combat skills.

389
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,840
They're much better than us.

390
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,920
After the Silver Gong

391
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,070
is the Gold Gong.

392
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,160
(Twelve Gold Gongs)
It's the highest rank.

393
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,040
There are only twelve Gold Gongs

394
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,120
in the Dafeng City,

395
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,670
and they answer directly to Lord Wei.

396
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,710
That's the structure.

397
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,200
If you have questions, just ask me.

398
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,270
(Heart Tower)
Before joining the Guardians,

399
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,270
there's one more step.

400
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,440
It's a qualification test.

401
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,160
A qualification test?

402
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,440
Yes. The test

403
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
was designed by Lord Wei.

404
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,120
It has three components:

405
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
intelligence, strength, and heart.

406
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,880
(Heart Tower)

407
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
It's like heaven.

408
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,720
Mr. Song.

409
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,790
Mr. Yang instructed

410
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,840
we'd administer his test.

411
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,200
Since you're at the Energy Stage,

412
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,550
we'll skip the strength test

413
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,900
and go to the intelligence test.

414
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,260
We're holding two brocade boxes.

415
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,400
One is empty,

416
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,770
and the other contains something.

417
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,230
You can ask one of us a question,

418
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,840
but you can only ask one question.

419
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,440
One of us always tells the truth,

420
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,710
and the other always lies.

421
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,880
You have an incense stick of time
to figure it out.

422
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,300
We won't give you any hints.

423
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,880
Lord Wei calls this a simple game,

424
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,440
but very few people manage

425
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,480
to solve it.

426
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,120
Even I

427
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,710
only figured it out

428
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,360
after the incense burned out.

429
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,230
It's said that only Gold Gongs

430
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,310
can solve it

431
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,270
in twenty breaths' time.

432
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,200
Alright.

433
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,410
I'll give it my best shot.

434
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,680
Start.

435
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,610
If you were him, what would you tell me?

436
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,070
Nothing.

437
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,910
The thing is here.

438
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,390
How long?

439
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,510
Three breaths' time.

440
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,800
Go upstairs.

441
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,680
Next test.

442
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,630
(First Floor)
The second test is the heart test.

443
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,230
There are no specific requirements.

444
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,310
But remember.

445
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,840
Follow your heart.

446
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,270
If you act overly pretentious,

447
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,310
your score will drop.

448
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,270
Score? What's that?

449
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,990
What do you think this test is for?

450
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,400
Scores are divided into four grades:
A, B, C, and D.

451
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,430
The better your aptitude,

452
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,740
the easier it is to be nurtured.

453
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,350
I am a B.

454
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,480
He is a C.

455
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,790
I'm C+.

456
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,180
(Second Floor, Heart Tower)

457
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,360
This is the Sky-Cleaving Axe.

458
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,030
It symbolizes the path of the Fighter,

459
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,500
which is cutting through thorns

460
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,430
and saving the day.

461
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,270
Bring out the Heart Mirror.

462
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,390
What's this?

463
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,280
The Heart Mirror.

464
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,660
It questions the heavens above
and your true self below.

465
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,070
What they pursue in their hearts

466
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,640
is the path of the Fighter.

467
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,550
Follow your heart.

468
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,920
If you feel nothing, just go upstairs.

469
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,480
Let's go.

470
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,140
(Third Floor, Heart Tower)

471
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,200
Who's this?

472
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,470
The founder of the Three Sects
of Heaven, Earth, and Man.

473
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,540
He is also the first Sect Leader
of the Dafeng.

474
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,640
You don't recognize him?

475
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Isn't it carved well?

476
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,200
My apologies.

477
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,400
Let's continue.

478
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,640
It's that way, right?

479
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,310
No, you...

480
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,260
(Fourth Floor, Heart Tower)

481
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,160
I suppose
you don't recognize him either.

482
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,160
Please introduce him.

483
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,750
This is the statue of the Second Sage.

484
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,230
He's the founder and a 1st Rank master

485
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,710
of Yunlu Academy.

486
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,600
With his vast knowledge,

487
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
he dedicated his life
to teaching students,

488
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,050
inspiring them to ambitions,

489
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,160
and cultivating thoughts
for the common people.

490
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,920
He upheld the philosophy
of learning as the foundation.

491
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,600
Inside this redwood box

492
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,030
is the Second Sage's Knife,

493
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,160
the most treasured artifact
of the academy.

494
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,510
Back then, the Second Sage
used this Knife

495
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,300
to ensure the stability of the Dafeng.

496
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,500
Why is this treasured artifact
of Yunlu Academy

497
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,680
in the Guardian Yamen?

498
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,270
Of course, it's a replica.

499
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,750
The real Knife

500
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,030
is stored in Yunlu Academy.

501
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,840
Listen, the knife is immensely powerful.

502
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,990
It even resonates with people.

503
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,960
If it were unleashed,
it'd be unstoppable.

504
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,120
Fortunately,
Yunlu Academy keeps it suppressed.

505
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,070
What are you doing?

506
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,440
Let me tell you.

507
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,470
Since the Second Sage's death,

508
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,780
this knife has been dormant
for over a thousand years.

509
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,070
Mr. Song,

510
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,400
can I take this one home

511
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,710
for the kids to play with?

512
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,040
Take it.

513
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,070
Thank you.

514
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,710
I have another one.

515
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,240
Mr. Song,

516
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,360
I'm the only one left now.

517
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,360
Shall we continue?

518
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,160
You haven't knelt yet.

519
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,030
Should we call it a day?

520
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,120
I'm not used

521
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,440
to kneeling.

522
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,680
Except for my parents,

523
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,550
not even the Jade Emperor
could make me kneel.

524
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,510
You've got backbone.

525
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,710
When Lord Wei set this heart test,

526
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,790
he instructed

527
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,050
that if anyone passed the fourth floor
without kneeling,

528
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,570
they must be a heinous criminal.

529
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,870
They should be expelled
from the Guardians

530
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,010
and suffer a thousand cuts.

531
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,680
A thousand cuts?

532
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,640
Of course, if you don't want to keel,

533
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,960
we won't force you.

534
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,990
Guangxiao, let's wrap up.

535
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,270
Sirs, give me another chance.

536
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,710
I'll try. I can do it.

537
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,550
I'm going upstairs now.

538
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:11,200
Long live the Emperor.

539
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Mr. Song,

540
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,920
was I sincere enough?

541
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,160
Do I need to prostrate myself?

542
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,960
Xu Qi'an, can you stop messing around?

543
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,920
Come on. I knelt.

544
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,440
Hurry up and record it.

545
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,120
Fine. Guangxiao, mark it down.

546
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,970
You can fool us,

547
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,470
but can you fool the Heart Mirror?

548
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,470
I told you.

549
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,300
The Heart Mirror

550
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,470
questions the heavens above

551
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,640
and your true self below.

552
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,980
Any acts against your conscience

553
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,840
cannot be hidden.

554
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,840
What's happening?

555
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,600
I knelt.

556
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,960
I...

557
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,790
No, I knelt.

558
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,710
Why am I such a phony?

559
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,160
Who knows why you're such a phony?

560
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,200
Xu Qi'an, watch me.

561
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,680
Look.

562
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
See that?

563
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,200
People like us

564
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,710
should bow down.

565
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,640
What kind of people are we?

566
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,580
(Govern with Virtue)

567
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,550
The sun is shining,

568
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,640
not a cloud in the sky.

569
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,440
Enjoying the scenery here

570
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,880
is far more interesting
than reading books inside.

571
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,960
Indeed, the number of books
we can read is decreasing.

572
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,510
I heard that the Astronomical Bureau
got a blue-covered book.

573
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,750
It records

574
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,270
the essence of heaven and earth
and all living things.

575
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm quite curious.

576
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,440
What a coincidence.

577
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,400
The author of this book

578
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,550
is Xu Qi'an.

579
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:52,960
That new Copper Gong, Xu Qi'an?

580
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,800
Exactly.

581
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,600
I've brought him under my wing.

582
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,150
Father,

583
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,960
give me this man.

584
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,720
Rou,

585
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,990
you always work alone.

586
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,230
Why do you want him now?

587
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,790
Lord Wei, you truly see everything.

588
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,440
Rou may seem indifferent to the world,

589
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,270
but whenever I want to do something

590
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,840
or desire someone,

591
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,510
he becomes uncontrollable

592
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,270
like this,

593
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,470
ignoring right and wrong,

594
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,230
and insists on competing with me.

595
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,160
Lord Wei,

596
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,940
I can't compete with your foster child.

597
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,230
You must help me.

598
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,290
Aren't you also a foster child?

599
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,280
That's true.

600
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,230
Yang Yan, I'm warning you.

601
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,750
If you call me Rou again,

602
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,120
I'll use my Spine Whip

603
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,920
to feed your tendons
and skin to the dogs.

604
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:45,960
But Father called you that first.

605
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,440
Father can call me that,

606
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,790
but you're not worthy.

607
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,960
Father, look at him.

608
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:59,230
He's obviously targeting me.

609
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,680
Lord Wei,

610
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,640
this is the new Copper Gong's
test result and household registration.

611
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Please evaluate it.

612
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,400
Rou,

613
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,910
how many breaths' time did you take
to answer the questions?

614
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,160
I took 15 breaths.

615
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,920
This chatterbox, Yang Yan,

616
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,710
took 19 breaths.

617
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,400
The new Copper Gong, Xu Qi'an,

618
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,510
took 10 breaths.

619
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,200
Not bad.

620
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,230
He solved the tax silver case
in a short time.

621
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,470
With his intelligence,

622
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,600
this isn't surprising.

623
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,550
(Intelligence Test)
The Recorder for this

624
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,550
hesitated for about seven breaths.

625
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
How is that possible?

626
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,880
Father, I must have him.

627
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,550
Unfortunately,

628
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,270
you're too late.

629
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,260
(Heart Test:
Didn't keel on the first four floors)

630
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,960
Didn't keel on the first four floors?

631
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,440
Utterly arrogant.

632
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,710
I don't want him anymore.

633
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,720
Mr. Yang,

634
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,070
he's yours now.

635
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,440
Father,

636
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,030
what should be done

637
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,990
with such a heinous man?

638
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,470
Where is he now?

639
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,150
The Copper Gongs in charge of the test

640
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,470
took him to the sixth floor.

641
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,540
(New Copper Gong Xu Qi'an)

642
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,310
When Lord Wei set this Heart Mirror,

643
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,790
he indeed gave instructions.

644
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:24,470
He said that if someone passed
four floors without kneeling,

645
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,840
they must be a heinous criminal.

646
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,790
However,

647
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,550
Lord Wei left one final chance,

648
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,270
which was the fifth room.

649
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,120
But no one has ever entered that room.

650
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,550
You, on the other hand,

651
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,470
are the only one.

652
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,620
(Sixth Floor, Heart Tower)

653
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,390
Mr. Song,

654
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,960
are these all Heart Mirrors?

655
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,200
Of course.

656
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,410
Before the Heart Mirror,

657
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,120
any act against one's true self

658
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,990
is futile.

659
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:54,970
The rules are the same.

660
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,650
You only have an incense stick of time.

661
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,500
Make good use of it.

662
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,710
When you're done,

663
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,550
knock on the door,

664
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,680
and I will know.

665
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,550
Young man,

666
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,510
good luck. Try to survive.

667
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,160
After slaying millions of enemies,

668
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,920
the sword at my waist
still reeks of blood.

669
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,120
My return with a golden sword breaker

670
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,640
has silenced the entire court.

671
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,280
Oh, no.

672
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,640
It seems Lord Wei aims to be powerful.

673
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,160
But I have no interest in power.

674
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,230
I just want to find a place

675
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,920
to live a simple and peaceful life.

676
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
(No, I can't panic.)

677
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,990
(I must stay calm.)

678
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,200
(Think carefully.)

679
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,230
(The duty of the Guardians is
to supervise officials.)

680
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,160
(Lord Wei's poem)

681
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,200
(also conveys loyalty to the nation
and the suppression of officials.)

682
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,070
(This poem isn't about competition.)

683
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,310
(It's about empathy.)

684
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,070
(If that person without any loyalty
to his emperor or master)

685
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,400
(is truly heinous by nature,)

686
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,680
(they wouldn't be able
to confront their true self)

687
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,710
(and write an empathetic poem
for the heart test.)

688
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,630
(On the contrary,)

689
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,740
(it proves they still have
redeemable qualities.)

690
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,120
(Only then would Lord Wei
give them this chance.)

691
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,750
(Since you want empathy,)

692
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,400
(I shall empathize with you.)

693
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,610
You're paid as a court official.

694
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,600
You live off the people's resources.

695
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,050
You can easily oppress
the common people,

696
00:31:59,050 --> 00:31:59,850
(Long and Arduous)

697
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,330
but you can't fool the heavens.

698
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,960
This Speed is saying

699
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,120
he's feeding off the people's resources,

700
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,510
not the Emperor's.

701
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,600
How absurd.

702
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,720
Yang Yan,

703
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,120
what do you think?

704
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,600
I don't understand.

705
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,220
(You're paid as a court official.)

706
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,310
Once he's promoted
from Copper Gong to Gold Gong,

707
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,030
you'll understand.

708
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,400
Father, do you truly think

709
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,200
he can become a Gold Gong
in the future?

710
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,640
As long as he's a Warrior,

711
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,160
there's no problem.

712
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,550
The three schools each have their rules.

713
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,920
Sorcerers are burdened by mortal fate,

714
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,710
and so are Witches.

715
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,310
In this world,
only Warriors are the purest.

716
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,440
I despise those who abuse their power,

717
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,400
but I must admit

718
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,230
the more rebellious the Warrior,

719
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,430
the more courageous
and skilled they become.

720
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,720
In their hearts,

721
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,400
there is no fear

722
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
or reverence.

723
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,880
In the future,

724
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,840
such a person could overturn the world.

725
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,920
Unruliness is the mark

726
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,360
of a Fighter.

727
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,160
Caring for the world makes one a hero.

728
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,360
The greatest hero

729
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,600
serves the nation and its people.

730
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,500
(Fair and Just,
Integrity, Impartiality.)

731
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,820
(Breeze Hall, Task Room)

732
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,270
Call out.

733
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,630
Come on.

734
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,750
- Mr. Song.
- Call out.

735
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,710
Mr. Song.

736
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,990
When can I get the results?

737
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,840
The test results have been submitted.

738
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,960
Just wait.

739
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,280
You're here.

740
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,200
Mr. Zhu,

741
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,070
do you have the results?

742
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,910
No.

743
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,470
But Mr. Yang instructed me

744
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,960
to take you for marrow cleansing.

745
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,950
Marrow cleansing?

746
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,470
After officially joining the Guardians,

747
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,150
the Guardian Yamen offers you
a chance to enhance your strength

748
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,580
through medicinal marrow cleansing.

749
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,500
Open the pool.

750
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,070
What is this?

751
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,440
It seems bottomless.

752
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,840
The Marrow Cleansing Pool.

753
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,240
This is the Marrow Cleansing Pool?

754
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,200
Guangxiao.

755
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,550
The marrow liquid costs 150 liang.

756
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,630
I'm opening one for you.

757
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,190
No, wait.

758
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,970
Mr. Zhu, I don't have
so much money with me.

759
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,330
Wait. I don't have so much money.

760
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,580
How could you just pour it in?

761
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,670
This is coercion!

762
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,990
We didn't have the money either.

763
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,840
We only earn five liang a month.

764
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,620
Do you think we wanted
to become Guardians?

765
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,590
We're all here paying off debts.

766
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,360
It's been poured in.

767
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,440
Sort it out yourself.

768
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,870
I won't do it. Let someone else do it.

769
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,400
- I can't pay for it.
- It's a joke.

770
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,240
Each hall will cover it.

771
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
This is a welcome gift for newcomers.

772
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,120
It's almost time.

773
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,630
Xu Qi'an, don't be shy.

774
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,840
Take off your clothes and shoes.

775
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,400
You're pretty quick.

776
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,080
- I'm ready.
- Alright.

777
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,420
(Focus Tower)

778
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,680
Yang Yan,

779
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,920
give me Xu Qi'an.

780
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,470
I'll trade you a Silver Gong for him.

781
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,990
Do you take me for a fool?

782
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
Silver Gongs are easy to find.

783
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,310
An A+ talent is hard to come by.

784
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,990
(Test results
for the new Copper Gong: A+)

785
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,420
You're honing your willpower
and have no time to guide him.

786
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,510
Two Silver Gongs.

787
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,590
Two?

788
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,590
Even a hundred wouldn't do.

789
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,440
I don't have time to guide him myself,

790
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,030
but someone else will.

791
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,080
Your Silver Gongs are
all out on assignments.

792
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,960
Who's left?

793
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,150
My Breeze Hall

794
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,360
is full of talents.

795
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,840
Breeze Hall?

796
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,920
Li Yuchun?

797
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,760
He's strict and doesn't tolerate
any mistakes.

798
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,410
Do you think he'd tolerate Xu Qi'an?

799
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,180
Let me tell you.

800
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,400
Within three days,

801
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,070
it'll be chaos.

802
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,720
I don't agree.

803
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,760
Li Yuchun, let me remind you.

804
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,880
He's an A+ talent.

805
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,280
You must take him in for me.

806
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm talking to you.

807
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,240
Your OCD is acting up again, isn't it?

808
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,240
Yes, it is.

809
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,440
He committed crimes
like kidnapping, framing, and colluding.

810
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,550
He disregards the law.

811
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,960
Even if he's rated A+,

812
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,110
I can't tolerate someone vile like him.

813
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,680
Mr. Yang,

814
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,360
as an enforcer of the law,

815
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,130
you should expel him
from the Guardian Yamen

816
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,070
to set an example.

817
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,800
I'd like to expel you instead.

818
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,160
How about this?

819
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,080
Just ten days.

820
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,960
After that,
when Silver Gong Zhang returns,

821
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,400
I'll transfer him immediately, okay?

822
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,470
Not even a single day.

823
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,470
Li Yuchun, you...

824
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,560
Stand down.

825
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,320
Li Yuchun, good for you.

826
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,550
This is how you treat me?

827
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,450
This is how you treat
your cousin-in-law?

828
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,470
Fine.

829
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,280
I'll go tell my cousin right now.

830
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
Because of you,

831
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,650
her cousin couldn't issue orders,

832
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:51,730
which led to his disgrace.

833
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:53,670
Other Gold Gongs
mocked and humiliated him,

834
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,380
and he can't work
as a Gold Gong anymore.

835
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,590
This is work.

836
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,990
Why drag Ying into this?

837
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,070
Why can't I?

838
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,510
She's my cousin.

839
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,590
Her husband is bullying her cousin.

840
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,150
Shouldn't she stand up for him?

841
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,630
She's been upset with me these days.

842
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,110
You'll only make things worse.

843
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,770
How am I supposed to go back home?

844
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,590
Go back home?

845
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,840
You're righteous and tough.

846
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,360
What do you need a home for?

847
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,440
Forget about it.

848
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,190
Guardians enforce the law impartially.

849
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,240
Romance

850
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,440
and family ties

851
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,840
can be abandoned.

852
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,590
This goes against my principles.

853
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,510
You can't mix personal
and public matters.

854
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,350
You...

855
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,200
Abandon it?

856
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,440
What should I do then? Tell me.

857
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,030
Abandon it all.

858
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,550
Alright, alright, I agree.

859
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,080
Just ten days.

860
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,260
(Like a Dragon Entering the Thunder)

861
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,190
I knew it.

862
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,440
My cousin-in-law is reasonable.

863
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,280
My cousin

864
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,880
is lucky to be with you.

865
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,470
Let's go.

866
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,250
Come with me to meet
your new subordinate.

867
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,560
Wait.

868
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,840
What now?

869
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,960
There's a thread.

870
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,110
You should treat your OCD.

871
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,240
Let's go.

872
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,970
- Mr. Yang.
- Mr. Yang.

873
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,900
- Chief.
- Chief.

874
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,560
What's going on?

875
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,680
My Lord,

876
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,870
he just entered the pool.

877
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,800
He should be operating

878
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,070
in the first cycle by now.

879
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,630
In that case, I'll head back first.

880
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,360
You'll pay for the marrow liquid.

881
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,080
Wait a minute.

882
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,840
You don't have any official duties now.

883
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,030
What's the rush?

884
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,760
The marrow liquid takes time
to circulate.

885
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,070
It'll take at least ten cycles to work.

886
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,760
You expect me to wait alone?

887
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,190
My youth is precious too, okay?

888
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,990
Do you still have youth to spend?

889
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,080
You...

890
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,470
One cycle?

891
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,380
