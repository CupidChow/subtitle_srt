40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,190
It must've cost you a lot of money.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,280
(As expected.)

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,360
(My future father-in-law is a Fighter
obsessed with martial arts.)

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,270
(He shouldn't be hard
to get along with.)

00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,190
How can it be measured by money?

46
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,520
Thank you, Miss.

47
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,480
Why?

48
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,700
You lied to me!

49
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,270
Xu Qi'an, I won't trust you ever again!

50
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,550
Get out! Out!

51
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,430
Leave me alone!

52
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,360
I can't stay here anymore!

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,550
Not anymore!

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,240
My family betrayed me!

55
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,830
Get out!

56
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,710
Out!

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,990
What a nice saber!

58
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,110
You must be Miss Xu Lingyue.

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,920
Your brother is right.

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
You're gorgeous

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,150
and elegant.

62
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,150
You're flattering me, Simu.

63
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,710
After thinking,

64
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,360
I believe this is perfect for you.

65
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,240
Isn't it

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,430
the Whitening Cream from the Beauty Shop?

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,640
It brightens and nourishes
the skin fantastically.

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,670
Ms. Li gave me a jar.

69
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,920
It was really good.

70
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,240
I waited in line for days
but failed to get another one.

71
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,110
Miss Simu,

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,710
it's so sweet of you.

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,150
I pulled some strings to get it.

74
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,570
That's fine.

75
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,430
Such cream is designed for beauties like her.

76
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,590
I'll try it for you.

77
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,110
Thanks. It's so thoughtful of you.

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,550
(Unlike her mother, Miss Xu)

79
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,240
(seems more sophisticated.)

80
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,390
(That's good.)

81
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,270
(I can't wait to know more about her.)

82
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,990
Actually,

83
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,040
I have another gift for you.

84
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,990
Does it smell good?

85
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,640
This is the latest book of poems.

86
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,550
(Elegant Poems)
You may read it.

87
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,700
(Top Men of the Dafeng 101)

88
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,590
Thanks, Simu.

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,830
Who's this curious little girl?

90
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,150
I stopped by the Moon Resto on my way here

91
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,430
and picked up goodies for you.

92
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,480
Moon Resto!

93
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,040
Moon Resto!

94
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,670
Little one, thank Miss Wang first.

95
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,640
Thank you, Miss Pretty.

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,800
Eat up.

97
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,710
I came in haste, underprepared.

98
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,080
I apologize for the humble gifts.

99
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
No, no, no. They're too nice!

100
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,360
You're wonderful...

101
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,960
You must be thirsty coming all the way here.

102
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,230
I'm sorry for our humble abode
and poor treat.

103
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,150
- Please bear with it.
- Yes.

104
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,320
No, it's great.

105
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,710
You have

106
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,120
a beautiful house of class.

107
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,520
After seeing you,

108
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,200
I realized why Xinnian turned out talented,

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,710
kind, and pure.

110
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,230
That's also true.

111
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,230
Other things aside,

112
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,790
my son, Cijiu, has been

113
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,320
studying hard for 18 years.

114
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,760
He is a talent.

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,320
Once he passes the Spring Exam,

116
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,880
his... his future

117
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,760
will be limitless.

118
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,910
Xu Cijiu,

119
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,470
your 18 years of handwork are futile.

120
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,470
Your future

121
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,270
is ruined.

122
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,590
Now, you're a joke in the scholar circles.

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,230
How foolish!

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,520
How stupid!

125
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,230
Why did I believe a liar?

126
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,560
Or I wouldn't have ended up like this!

127
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,560
If fate hadn't let Xu Xinnian

128
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,120
be born...

129
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,620
Xu Qi'an, say something to comfort me.

130
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,600
Cijiu,

131
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,630
let it go.

132
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,520
Have some hot water.

133
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,030
Hot water?

134
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,470
Hot water?

135
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,440
How foolish!

136
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,710
How stupid!

137
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,470
You're a fool, Xu Xinnian!

138
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,270
Sorry,

139
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,270
Xinnian was humiliated earlier

140
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,230
because of me.

141
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,150
Don't blame yourself, Miss.

142
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,590
Cijiu's always been obedient,

143
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,320
well-behaved,

144
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,910
and calm.

145
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,640
He'd never cross the line

146
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,080
or cause others trouble.

147
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,320
- Right?
- Yes, that's true.

148
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,760
Are you sure he's fine?

149
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,600
Of course!

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,880
- Don't worry.
- He's fine.

151
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,390
No need to worry!

152
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,150
Don't worry!

153
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,930
Alright then.

154
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,910
If fate hadn't let Xu Xinnian

155
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,710
be born,

156
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,470
the Dafeng would still be

157
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,710
in the dark!

158
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,230
Cijiu,

159
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,120
enough is enough.

160
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm tired. I need to sleep.

161
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,010
Are you hanging yourself for real?

162
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,680
Alright. Never mind.

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,640
I'm sorry. Get down now!

164
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,880
Leave me alone!

165
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,120
You can't die! Get down!

166
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Let me die!

167
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
- Knock it off!
- Leave me alone!

168
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,520
Stop!

169
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,740
- Let me die!
- I'm sorry...

170
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,590
Xinnian is in his room.

171
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,440
(Bright and Sunny)

172
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
Xinnian!

173
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,530
Don't kill yourself, Xinnian...!

174
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,830
He's studying at this time.

175
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,760
Let's not interrupt him.

176
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,920
Come on.

177
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,830
Miss Simu came all the way here.

178
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,910
So what if he's studying?

179
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,520
He can continue later.

180
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,590
Is there dust in your eyes?

181
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
- Xin...
- Let me die!

182
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,710
He's been studious since childhood.

183
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,440
Yes, that's right.

184
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,200
"It's never too early to learn."

185
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,830
It's better to

186
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,120
let him focus on his study.

187
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,230
Yes, she's right.

188
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,150
I'd like to have a word with him.

189
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,710
What do you think

190
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,040
about this poem?

191
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,920
This line is beautiful.

192
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
Hello.

193
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,240
What's up?

194
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,560
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

195
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,590
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

196
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,350
Xinnian is busy with his study.

197
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,280
Let's not

198
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,920
disturb him.

199
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,950
Sure.

200
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,550
Hold on.

201
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,510
I apologize for my father

202
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,960
for what happened earlier.

203
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,440
But I believe

204
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,920
with your talent,

205
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,400
one day,

206
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,960
you'll enter the Cabinet

207
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,040
and become a minister.

208
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,680
You'll go up in the world

209
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,160
and achieve your goals.

210
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,590
I see you're studying.

211
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,230
I won't disturb you.

212
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,120
I'll

213
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,350
come again another day.

214
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,630
Sure. No problem.

215
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,160
(Xinnian,)

216
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,230
(I'm sure)

217
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,630
(that after this,)

218
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,830

Your Highness,

233
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,470
how did it go?

234
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,630
Yang Youde said Father was working

235
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,830
and told me to go back.

236
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,320
As the ruler of the state,

237
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,350
he's always busy

238
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,320
with state affairs.

239
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,630
Father is mad at me

240
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,830
and avoiding me.

241
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,280
I just heard a joke from others.

242
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,470
Would you like to hear it for fun?

243
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,710
Got kicked out of the Personnel?

244
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,040
Yes. Many people saw it.

245
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,400
They said Xu Xinnian
covered his belly like a dead fish

246
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,870
and couldn't move for a long while.

247
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,510
How strange!

248
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,560
Xu Qi'an is gallant and smart.

249
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,630
How come his brother is so simple-minded?

250
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,350
How dare he, a student,

251
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,470
go to provoke

252
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,320
the Prime Minister who'll decide his career!

253
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,120
Your Highness,

254
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,830
you probably don't know

255
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,510
that he seems to admire

256
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,750
Prime Minister Wang's daughter.

257
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,750
That's why the Prime Minister fumed.

258
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,590
Xu Xinnian is

259
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,560
a top student at the Yunlu Academy.

260
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,440
He's young and talented.

261
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,400
Why was Wang Zhenwen mad?

262
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,800
So what if he's a top student?

263
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,510
There are plenty of them in the state.

264
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,960
Xu Xinnian is

265
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,350
of humble birth

266
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,800
without an official post or title.

267
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,440
He might be talented,

268
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,830
but

269
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,040
compared with Miss Wang,

270
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,750
he's a worthless nobody.

271
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,920
Is one's family background

272
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,320
really that important?

273
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,440
Of course.

274
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,930
People should be matched
for marriage in our state.

275
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,710
Miss Wang is the Prime Minister's daughter,

276
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,110
while Xu Xinnian is

277
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,400
a humble civilian.

278
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,350
Other than him,

279
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,560
even Mr. Xu, who's made great contributions,

280
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,350
doesn't deserve her.

281
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,430
Your Highness!

282
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,110
Your Highness, I didn't mean that.

283
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,710
I'm saying he's smart and resourceful.

284
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,810
He's more than qualified

285
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,040
to be her match.

286
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,280
Your Highness...!

287
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,040
I've never had anything so flavorful.

288
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,350
Was it made by a new Imperial Chef?

289
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,750
No.

290
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,630
It was seasoned

291
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,870
with chicken powder

292
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,040
to bring out the umami of the ingredients.

293
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,160
Besides,

294
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,800
the one who made such powder is...

295
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
Xu Qi'an?

296
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
Yes.

297
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,040
Mother,

298
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,560
he owns unmatched talent.

299
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,630
He can write poems

300
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,710
and solve cases.

301
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,510
He was in charge of retrieving tax silver

302
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,080
in Yunzhou.

303
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,750
Such a rare talent

304
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,280
is also my guest advisor.

305
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,200
Shouldn't you

306
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,990
reward him, Mother?

307
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,400
I know what you're thinking.

308
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,920
I'll advise your father to grant him

309
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,750
a title of nobility when the time's right.

310
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,440
Your father is

311
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,110
aware of his contributions.

312
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,920
He hasn't granted him a title

313
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,920
because he must've had other plans.

314
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,080
That's not up to us.

315
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,230
I'd appreciate it

316
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,590
if you'd put in a good word.

317
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,750
Thank you, Mother.

318
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,990
Let's eat.

319
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,280
Eat up.

320
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,710
(Xu Mansion)

321
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,630
What are these?

322
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,920
Wang Zhenwen was impeached by his rivals.

323
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,590
Lord Wei asked you
to send those letters

324
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,440
to the Personnel.

325
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
What...?

326
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,540
(Yao Lin of Revenue embezzled
thousands of liang of gold.)

327
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,510
If such scandals were...

328
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,350
I mean if such secret letters were leaked,

329
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,080
who knows how many officials
in town would be found guilty?

330
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,630
Looks like the official circles
will undergo great changes.

331
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,830
Few have access to such secret letters.

332
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,080
They wouldn't be leaked.

333
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,710
Hadn't Lord Wei given the order,

334
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,550
do you think

335
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,440
you'd be allowed to read them?

336
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,920
Will the Guardians help Prime Minister Wang?

337
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,470
This is important.

338
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,800
It's also a power struggle.

339
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Why did Lord Wei choose me?

340
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,320
He said

341
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,960
it'd only be convincing if you sent them.

342
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,160
Here's the thing.

343
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,280
Everyone in the capital knows

344
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,560
Xu Xinnian was kicked out

345
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,990
of the Personnel for Wang Simu.

346
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,200
As his brother, you stood up

347
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,230
to bring them together.

348
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,080
You sneaked into the Guardians' archive
to steal the letters

349
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,400
and gave them to Wang Zhenwen

350
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,240
in order to

351
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,080
patch things up with him.

352
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,440
What a brilliant story Lord Wei made.

353
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,680
He should've been a scriptwriter.

354
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,080
Scriptwriter?

355
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,110
It's urgent.

356
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,350
I'm on it now.

357
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,040
Wait.

358
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,450
Are you going over like this?

359
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,400
Do you think it's easy
to sneak into the archive?

360
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,240
Hey,

361
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,120
what are you doing?

362
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,990
I knew it.

363
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,400
You'd fall into my hands someday.

364
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,120
What...?

365
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,040
How's he?

366
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,990
You didn't break him, did you?

367
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,350
No.

368
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,280
He dodged my whip.

369
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,110
He said he had a better story
to get it done more easily.

370
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,990
It goes like this.

371
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,960
You, Xu Xinnian, were kicked out

372
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,990
of the Cabinet because of Wang Simu.

373
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,630
In order to win over that girl,

374
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,400
you sneaked into your brother's room

375
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,470
to steal the letters

376
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,400
and gave them to Wang Zhenwen

377
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,960
to patch things up with him.

378
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,670
Remember,

379
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,160
let Miss Wang pass the letters.

380
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,320
That'll work better.

381
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,230
What a brilliant story you made.

382
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,200
If that's the case,

383
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,360
I'm on it now.

384
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,200
Hold on.

385
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,120
Are you going over like this?

386
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,600
- What...?
- Do you think it's easy

387
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,440
to steal the letters from your brother?

388
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,790
You're meticulous.

389
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,440
Choose one.

390
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,630
Which one

391
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,110
causes no pain?

392
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:35,550
No one.

393
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,790
The more the pain, the more the gain.

394
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,910
The more the pain,

395
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,120
the more the affection.

396
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,960
Relax.

397
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,230
I can control my strength.

398
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,510
I won't break your veins or bones.

399
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,800
This one it is.

400
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,230
It looks small.

401
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,070
Sure.

402
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,960
Good choice.

403
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,920
One strike will

404
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,600
leave six holes in you.

405
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,200
No.

406
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,070
They won't heal quickly.

407
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,070
This one.

408
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,510
It's not too sharp,

409
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,710
and it won't leave holes.

410
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,920
That's better.

411
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,440
It'll make your face swell.

412
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,590
No.

413
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,160
Simu is attracted

414
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,710
to my good looks the most.

415
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,160
Use this one then.

416
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,470
It's bigger,

417
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,840
but I can't take it. Just don't hit my face.

418
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,160
The hammer is the best!

419
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,120
One strike is enough.

420
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,700
It'll break your head and cause bleeding.

421
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,480
No, no, no!

422
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,990
Scholars can't be brain-damaged.

423
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,200
Use this one instead.

424
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,450
I won't make soup with it for Mother tonight.

425
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,310
We aren't poor.

426
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,230
We don't need it.

427
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,230
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

428
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,400
- No second thoughts?
- No.

429
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,600
Let's do it.

430
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,000
Here I come!

431
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,400
Look, Miss.

432
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,120
Take this. Go ahead.

433
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,800
Xinnian.

434
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,280
Simu.

435
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
What happened to you?

436
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,870
Nothing.

437
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,470
I asked you out tonight

438
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,270
to bring something to you.

439
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,030
Please pass them to your father.

440
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,020
(Censor Yuan's relative
stole others' properties.)

441
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,580
(Yao Lin embezzled...)

442
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,550
These...

443
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,580
(Duke Cao took bribes.)

444
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,840
Where did you

445
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,640
get such secret letters?

446
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,920
I took them from my brother.

447
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,070
Your brother?

448
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,340
Isn't he Lord Wei's right-hand man?

449
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,350
Xinnian,

450
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,910
you...

451
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,640
Let me see.

452
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,840
Did he beat you up?

453
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
He didn't beat me.

454
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
I hit...

455
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,910
I fell.

456
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,550
Tripped and fell.

457
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,310
Does it hurt?

458
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,590
Not at all.

459
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,440
Simu...

460
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,960
Xinnian...

461
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,360
Simu...

462
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,990
It hurts if you keep pressing it.

463
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,360
Sorry, Xinnian.

464
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:04,200
I went to the Judicial Review
and Censorate earlier

465
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,070
to make them drop the charges,

466
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,160
but

467
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,070
State Duke Cao got there first.

468
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,640
Minister Sun,

469
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,600
I contacted Crown Prince's other supporters.

470
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,750
After hearing the news,

471
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,400
they avoided me like the plague.

472
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,840
Prime Minister Wang,

473
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
how about we yield to His Majesty

474
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
on the delivery corvee?

475
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,680
That corvee does more harm than good!

476
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,360
I could yield,

477
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,030
but the people would suffer.

478
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,640
The worst situation is

479
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,880
I'll retire.

480
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,470
No, you can't, Prime Minister!

481
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,400
You cannot do that, Prime Minister!

482
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,510
Don't do that.

483
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,400
If you retire,

484
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,510
you'll play right into Duke Cao's hand.

485
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
It's not bad to step down now.

486
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,310
Quitting at the peak of my career is

487
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,640
better than ending up dishonorable.

488
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,470
Besides,

489
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,550
I can make a comeback later.

490
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,070
Gentlemen

491
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,750
should know when to quit to avoid harm.

492
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,360
But officials should be remonstrative!

493
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,070
As the Prime Minister,

494
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,880
if I didn't say it, no one else could.

495
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,070
Father,

496
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,550
I need to talk to you.

497
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,840
Miss Simu is

498
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,920
cultured and courteous.

499
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,120
It must be important,

500
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,790
or she wouldn't interrupt us.

501
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,870
Come in.

502
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,040
What is it?

503
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,510
These things

504
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,750
in my hand

505
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,960
can help Father and the rest of you out.

506
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,580
(Duke Cao took bribes.)

507
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
(Trod on a five-year-old child.)

508
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,160
With these letters,

509
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,030
we have a chance to turn things around.

510
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,840
Who gave you these letters?

511
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,310
The one who you kicked out of the Personnel.

512
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,680
He didn't hold a grudge

513
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,070
but paid a huge price to obtain

514
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,680
and send over these letters.

515
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,680
His brother is

516
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,680
Guardian Xu Qi'an.

517
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,080
(Self-disciplined and Pure)

518
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,960
She's grown up.

519
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,910
Yes.

520
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,120
When I saw her years back,

521
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,840
she was a little girl.

522
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,960
Thank you for remembering my daughter.

523
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,710
- Your Majesty...
- I heard

524
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,710
your wife was sick and bedridden.

525
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,920
She was feeling a bit unwell.

526
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,510
Thanks for your concern.

527
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,440
- Youde.
- Yes.

528
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,360
Have someone

529
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,920
send a Golden Pill from the Treasure Sect

530
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,510
to Prime Minister Wang's mansion.

531
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,750
Thank you, Your Majesty.

532
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,360
Your Majesty, I...

533
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,200
Well,

534
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,960
let's chat another day.

535
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,800
Yes.

536
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,640
(Duke Cao...)
Walk him out.

537
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,480
Yes.

538
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,580
(Overreached himself by stealing
national funds and tributes.)

539
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,440
Your Majesty,

540
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
I'll take my leave.

541
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,990
This morning, in court,

542
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,920
His Majesty changed his mind.

543
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,960
He rejected Prime Minister Wang's resignation

544
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,710
and exonerated him.

545
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,310
My guess is

546
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,920
those secret letters

547
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,960
are about State Duke Cao.

548
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,120
He's Father's trusted follower

549
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,960
who's never joined any parties.

550
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,510
He only takes orders from Father,

551
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,510
so he's remained powerful all these years.

552
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,310
This time,

553
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,920
Wang Zhenwen must've found dirt on him,

554
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,510
forcing Father to compromise.

555
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,360
Whether the impeachment against Wang

556
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,070
is serious or not,

557
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,120
Father is sharp enough to tell.

558
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,470
That was to make an example of Wang

559
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,270
to warn others.

560
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,070
Prime Minister Wang

561
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,600
turned the tide overnight.

562
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,600
That was unexpected, though.

563
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,590
Your Majesty!

564
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,040
Your Majesty!

565
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,870
Your Majesty,

566
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,760
Wang Zhenwen...

567
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,710
How did he acquire those secret letters?

568
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,390
Wei Yuan.

569
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,350
Yes.

570
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,440
It must be him.

571
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,520
Youde.

572
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

573
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,230
I'm tired.

574
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,120
Help me to rest.

575
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,550
- Yes.
- Your Majesty,

576
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,840
Wei Yuan is colluding with court officials.

577
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,750
We must stop him.

578
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,360
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

579
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,440
Mind your own business.

580
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,600
Had Lord Wei interfered,

581
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,030
His Majesty wouldn't have done nothing.

582
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,640
Father knows him too well.

583
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,880
Lord Wei cares about the people.

584
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
His goal

585
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,360
isn't to rise in court.

586
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,640
His ambition

587
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,550
isn't to gain power.

588
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,710
I didn't believe the Guardians
could supervise officials.

589
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,470
Turns out, your people are really good.

590
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,230
We're simply serving the court.

591
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,750
Why did the Guardians

592
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,750
help me?

593
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,550
Grains are eight wen per jin.

594
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,070
(Grains are eight wen per jin.)

595
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,920
Brown rice, 12 wen per jin.

596
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,550
Rice, 18 wen per jin.

597
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,070
At this time two years ago,

598
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,070
paddy rice was only four wen per jin.

599
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,230
Brown rice was six wen per jin.

600
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,960
Lord Wei,

601
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,510
if you want to talk about prices,

602
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,550
go to my place.

603
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,160
We can discuss them all night.

604
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:23,960
This year,

605
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,360
prices have shockingly doubled.

606
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,600
The past few years have been eventful.

607
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,840
With war in the North

608
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,200
and droughts in the South,

609
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,600
the Treasury has almost been emptied.

610
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,880
Despite huge pressure from the Palace,

611
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,750
I didn't raise this year's farm tax.

612
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,920
But that didn't change anything.

613
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,710
In times of peace,

614
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,960
prices are low.

615
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,990
In times of chaos,

616
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,200
farmland is abandoned.

617
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Roads are blocked.

618
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,270
Prices rise.

619
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,990
As powerful officials,

620
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,470
we're concerned about the people,

621
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,480
but

622
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,600
we can't imagine how hard their lives are.

623
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,440
There are people struggling in poverty
in the capital.

624
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,270
In this world,

625
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,790
how many civilians

626
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,990
would be ground like rice

627
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,040
but

628
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,310
suffer in silence?

629
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,750
You're benevolent and selfless.

630
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,840
I was narrow-minded.

631
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,070
Prime Minister Wang.

632
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,030
After you, Lord Wei.

633
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,120
I helped you

634
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,790
because I saw

635
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,840
that facing overwhelming pressure

636
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,640
and His Majesty's wrath,

637
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,120
you held on to your principles

638
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,310
and spoke for the people.

639
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,760
That's why

640
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,120
I'm entrusting this huge task to you.

641
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,230
Lord Wei,

642
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,030
what is it?

643
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,640
The Witcher's Sect is rampant in the North,

644
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,790
slaughtering civilians.

645
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,550
I'll

646
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,510
petition His Majesty

647
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,360
to attack that sect soon.

648
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,760
Then

649
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,230
I can only rely on you

650
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,960
to safeguard the court

651
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,710
and the Dafeng.

652
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,580
(...the people.)

653
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,440
Looking up,

654
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,920
one can face the heavens.

655
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,120
Look down,

656
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,070
one won't disappoint the people.

657
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,150
Sir,

658
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,160
Silver Gong Guardian,
Xu Qi'an, came to see you.

659
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,360
(Personnel)
Without permission,

660
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,200
the Guardians can't enter the Personnel.

661
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,400
You should leave.

662
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,840
Hold on.

663
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,360
I'm Xu Qi'an,

664
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,640
Xu Xinnian's elder brother

665
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,540
- Greetings.
- and a Silver Gong Guardian.

666
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,750
Silver Gong!

667
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,710
Lord Wei sent me here for investigation.

668
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,640
You... Did I not make myself clear?

669
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,160
I'll say it again.

670
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,680
The Personnel is off-limits.

671
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,300
Without His Majesty's edict, the Guardians

672
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,470
aren't allowed in.

673
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,030
Please leave.

674
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,150
Sir,

675
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,550
do us a favor

676
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,640
and let us in.

677
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
Do you a favor?

678
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,350
Alright.

679
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,530
Fine. Close the gate.

680
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,390
Hey...

681
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,920
My hand...

682
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,230
- Never mind.
- Let me go!

683
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:19,230
I have other plans.

684
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,750
You're too slow.

685
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,880
I've waited for a while.

686
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,200
It occurred to me

687
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,680
that I shouldn't have worn my uniform

688
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,840
to work with a civilian.

689
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,030
It wouldn't be of help.

690
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,310
What's Wang Zhenwen doing?

691
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,290
A drop in need shall be returned
with a spring in deed, no?

692
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,400
Look at that petty official.

693
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,840
As low-ranking as he is,

694
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,550
he's so bureaucratic.

695
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,550
By the way,

696
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,960
why did you stop me just now?

697
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,880
Had you let me go,

698
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,460
I would've turned that place upside down!

699
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,550
Calm down.

700
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,310
I've sent a message

701
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,840
to ask Miss Wang for help.

702
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,680
Really?

703
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,040
Fine.

704
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,960
I'm off.

705
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,960
Where are you going?

706
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,880
Let's talk.

707
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,820
About what?

708
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,220
If I need you, I'll send Su Su over.

709
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,710
Have you paid?

710
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
Sir,

711
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,070
put it on my tab.

712
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,070
Sure.

713
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,590
Hey, little boy.

714
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,710
Give me my pouch.

715
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,200
Your pouch? Can you prove it?

716
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,030
Finders keepers.

717
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,230
A gold sunflower seed is in it

718
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,680
with the character "Zhi".

719
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,640
Open it and look.

720
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,030
Give it back!

721
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,960
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?

722
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,360
- Picking a fight?
- It's mine.

723
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,550
- Do you know me?
- Give it

724
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,550
- Don't push me.
- back.

725
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,120
- It's my pouch.
- It's not yours.

726
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,990
It's mine.

727
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,200
It's my pouch.

728
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,510
(Mu Nanzhi)
How did you know a gold sunflower seed

729
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,680
was in it with the character "Zhi"?

730
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,510
It's my pouch.

731
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,880
Of course I know.

732
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,200
Your pouch?

733
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,920
There's a character "Zhi",

734
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,750
but it's not on a gold sunflower seed.

735
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,780
(Pig.)
(It says "Pig".)

736
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,270
I knew it.

737
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,790
No wonder I was so unlucky

738
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,360
that I lost a pouch every time I hung out.

739
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,600
So all those pouches

740
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,470
were taken by you, pig!

741
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,110
(Looks like)

742
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,640
(she's that unlucky victim.)

743
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,790
Miss, he stole your pouch.

744
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,920
- I saw everything.
- Really?

745
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,230
You have to believe me.

746
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,510
He even beat me.

747
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,880
You little liar!

748
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,720
What's wrong?

749
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,550
Whose pouch is it?

750
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,470
I get it.

751
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,640
You two are

752
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,070
setting me up

753
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,960
in public in broad daylight.

754
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,310
You're partners in fraud, right?

755
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,070
Let's go to the authorities.

756
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,910
Are you coming?

757
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,830
No.

758
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,400
- Yes or no?
- I didn't say anything.

759
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,750
I saw nothing.

760
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,470
Stop it.

761
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,440
Your partner ran away.

762
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,550
Will you go with me?

763
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,830
I...

764
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,710
I... I'll let it slide this time.

765
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,400
But next time,

766
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,310
I'll make you pay!

767
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,880
I made it.

768
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,670
Here you go, 600 liang.

769
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,200
Thanks.

770
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,820
(Looking up, one can face the heavens...)

771
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,470
Your writing has further improved, Father.

772
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,190
It can literally be seen from the back.

773
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,470
How powerful.

774
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,670
You wrote,

775
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,800
"Looking up, one can face the heavens.

776
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,650
Looking down,
one won't disappoint the people."

777
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,470
But that's not how you've been acting lately.

778
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,880
What do you mean?

779
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,550
What's your point?

780
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,240
Let me be clear.

781
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,720
If you're here for that Guardian Xu,

782
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:53,990
don't bother

783
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,510
to say it.

784
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,410
Why?

785
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,990
Do you feel guilty?

786
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,240
Father,

787
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,920
you know

788
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,590
you owe the Xu Family.

789
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,400
If you keep avoiding them,

790
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,840
can you face the heavens?

791
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,880
Won't you disappoint them?

792
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,110
The Xu brothers

793
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,190
are in cahoots.

794
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,800
Mu,

795
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,720
you're a clever girl.

796
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,920
You weren't fooled
by their ruse of self-injury, were you?

797
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,150
You're right, Father.

798
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,670
I saw through

799
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,470
Xinnian's silly trick,

800
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,960
but I also saw

801
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,590
he went this far for me.

802
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,400
He was sincere.

803
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,760
Although he played a trick,

804
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,190
he made me happy.

805
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,280
I wouldn't mind.

806
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,550
Besides, he did so

807
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,400
to change your opinion on him.

808
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,990
To change my opinion,

809
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,400
he has to pass the Spring Exam first.

810
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,880
That won't happen soon.

811
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,720
Father, you haven't told me

812
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,280
why you refuse to help the Xu Family.

813
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,320
If you're so ungrateful,

814
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,360
won't others look down on the Wang Family?

815
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,440
The Personnel is off-limits.

816
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,320
Ever since I became
the Vice Minister there 14 years ago,

817
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,360
not one Guardian has been
allowed in the archive.

818
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,110
No exceptions since the Dafeng was founded.

819
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,830
Well,

820
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,470
they don't

821
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,190
have to go inside.

822
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,110
Y-Y-You...

823
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,360
Some chicken soup you made.

824
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,240
Alright, I'm full.

825
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,390
Take this.

826
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,960
This Healing Powder is fantastic

827
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,150
and extremely rare.

828
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,390
Father,

829
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,470
who is it for?

830
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,760
Your injured admirer, Xu.

831
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
Mr. Chu.

832
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,800
I'm late. My apologies.

833
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

834
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,150
How did it go?

835
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,190
Don't get me started.
A geezer fooled us.

836
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,280
Good liquor!

837
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,150
This 30-year-old liquor

838
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,400
tastes rich and strong.

839
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,070
Let's set aside the troubles.

840
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,350
Why not

841
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,190
indulge in drinks?

842
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,110
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

843
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,120
Here we go.

844
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,120
Ouch!

845
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,920
Bear with it.

846
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Easy!

847
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,830
Just stop.

848
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,720
It's nothing serious.

849
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,560
I'm fine.

850
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,840
Nothing serious?

851
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,630
I only hit you once.

852
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,920
How come you were badly injured?

853
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,630
Who left all those scratches?

854
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,990
I hit myself a few more times.

855
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,110
But I was badly injured for nothing.

856
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,110
We didn't get to see Prime Minister Wang.

857
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,150
I made a bad plan.

858
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,400
Let me put more powder on you.

859
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,390
Don't bother.

860
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,150
I realized something yesterday.

861
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,470
With Prime Minister Wang's experience,

862
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,190
he must've seen through

863
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,240
our silly trick instantly.

864
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,630
I should go back to study.

865
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,720
That's the right path.

866
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,280
No need to be in a rush.

867
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
I am!

868
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,590
All those means of trickery you taught me

869
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,630
would only backfire.

870
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,320
Who knows when I can see Simu again?

871
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,070
Right now,

872
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,440
only if I pass the Spring Exam

873
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,720
and gain an official rank

874
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,800
will I be able to see her again.

875
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,640
Fine. Alright.

876
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,920
You should leave, Ningyan.

877
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,280
I don't want to see you again.

878
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,360
Wait, Cijiu,

879
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,400
I can explain it.

880
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,800
- Go away!
- Or I can spin it.

881
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,840
- Ningyan, Xinnian.
- No.

882
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,800
There you are.

883
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,110
I'm here to tell you

884
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,070
that Miss Wang came.

885
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,440
Mother is with her now.

886
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,760
Which Miss Wang?

887
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,880
Who else could it be?

888
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,920
Cijiu wrote all these

889
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,670
when he was a child.

890
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,140
(Idle fathers raise spoiled children.)
Look, frogs.

891
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,500
(Lazy teachers make wild students.)

892
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,720
His cursive style looks free and easy.

893
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,030
Even the characters he wrote in childhood

894
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,550
look adorable.

895
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,960
Yes, they are.

896
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,550
So adorable.

897
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,590
There's more.

898
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,510
Check this out.

899
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,760
At Cijiu's 100-day birthday,

900
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,510
we hired an artist to draw our family.

901
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,990
You're as young and beautiful
as before, Mrs. Xu.

902
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,840
Yes.

903
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,350
Look.

904
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,150
Cijiu was crying.

905
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,510
I was so worried. I didn't know why

906
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,360
until later.

907
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,550
You know why he cried?

908
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,670
He wet his pants!

909
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,760
Stop looking at it!

910
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,840
Xinnian.

911
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,760
Miss Wang.

912
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,590
Why are you so nervous?

913
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:03,880
She's our guest.

914
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,130
There's my sister-in-law.

915
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,110
- When did you come?
- Don't say that!

916
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,760
It's rude.

917
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,800
How offensive.

918
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:11,310
Here I am.

919
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,070
You know what?

920
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,190
Just now, he feared

921
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,510
he couldn't see you again

922
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,920
and decided to study even harder.

923
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,280
And now, there you are.

924
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,590
He's all shy and timid.

925
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,600
Xu Cijiu,

926
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,990
do scholars like you never mean what you say?

927
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,670
Don't listen to them.

928
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,960
Did they lie?

929
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,720
Not exactly.

930
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,280
Ningyan,

931
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,510
can we have a word

932
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,590
in private?

933
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,760
Sure.

934
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,760
My father said

935
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,880
the archive is off-limits.

936
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,280
Outsiders can't get in without permission.

937
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,240
But the rainy season has come.

938
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,470
It's humid.

939
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,070
All those files in the archive

940
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,510
can't get wet or moldy.

941
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,110
All of them

942
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,760
will be moved to the backyard

943
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,470
to be dried.

944
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,030
I've made arrangements.

945
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,990
My carriage will take you to the backyard.

946
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,320
Someone will wait for you there.

947
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
Thank you for your assistance.

948
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,840
You're a lucky man, Xinnian.

949
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,800
Xinnian,

950
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,470
let me check your face.

951
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,510
It's fine.

952
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,870
"It's fine."

953
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,590
Ningyan,

954
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,030
don't you have things to attend to?

955
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,840
Go ahead. Hurry up.

956
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,470
Yes, sure.

957
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,550
I'm going.

958
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,080
Aunt,

959
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,510
did you wash my Guardian uniform?

960
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,920
Where did you put it? I need it.

961
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,670
- I have to go.
- Help me find it.

962
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,760
How many times have I said

963
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,630
it was made of silver

964
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:03,920
and not washable?

965
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,720
Why did you wash it?

966
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,960
They've left.

967
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,380
(Xu Mansion)

968
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,240
Ningyan,

969
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,550
let me ask you something.

970
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,030
You were talking about

971
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,720
going somewhere off-limits.

972
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,670
Miss Wang's family

973
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,470
must be powerful, right?

974
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,440
You're so sharp, Aunt.

975
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,400
His father is a court official.

976
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:37,760
Is he

977
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,360
high-ranking?

978
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,280
He's fine.

979
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,070
How high is that?

980
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,590
- Take Uncle as an example.
- Sure.

981
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,280
He's an Imperial Guard

982
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,360
of...

983
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,440
the 7th Rank.

984
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,800
You know that.

985
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,510
I do. Go on.

986
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,440
Her father is above him...

987
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,960
by six ranks.

988
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,360
Is that clear?

989
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,590
Let's go, sir.

990
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,920
Make the horse go faster.

991
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,550
Does it hurt?

992
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,840
Such scratches

993
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,320
aren't worth mentioning.

994
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,630
Xinnian,

995
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,840
do you know who gave me this?

996
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,630
My father

997
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,720
gave me such powder made by the Palace.

998
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
He's

999
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,920
agreed to help your family in secret

1000
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:43,840
and allowed me to see you.

1001
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,840
You're so smart.

1002
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:46,990
Do you know

1003
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,510
what that means?

1004
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,590
I'll study assiduously

1005
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
to gain an official rank.

1006
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,240
I won't let you and your father down.

1007
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:02,360
Then...

1008
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,760
Then I will...

1009
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,440
I've put powder on it.

1010
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
