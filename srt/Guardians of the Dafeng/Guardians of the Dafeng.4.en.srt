- Sir,
- Lingyue.

43
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,720
he insulted me first.

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,960
Ningyan stopped that man.

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,440
Why are you arresting him?

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
I'll judge

47
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,470
whether he's guilty or not.

resisting arrest

53
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,670
will make things worse.

You're playing right into their hands.

Are you hurt, Lingyue?

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,600
Get up.

57
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,550
Mr. Zhu,

58
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,870
please take care of my cousins.

59
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,080
I will.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,480
Take him away!

61
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,990
Mr. Zhou,

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,640
I'll take it from here.

63
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,670
No need.

64
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,320
I'll question him myself.

65
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,550
After you.

66
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,870
Who are you?

67
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,960
A constable

68
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,200
from the Changle County Government.

69
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,200
So?

70
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,590
I'm here to see Caiwei.

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,990
Senior Caiwei?

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,040
A friend asked me to give her

73
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,830
(The Codex of Alchemy)
this book

74
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,110
with a message.

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,920
"Xu Qi'an is in trouble.

76
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,760
Help him."

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
What happened?

78
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
It's the 48th time.

79
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,390
Senior Song has been faking the tax silver

80
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,760
for two days but failed.

81
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,520
In the Astronomical Bureau,

82
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,200
he's the most talented alchemist.

83
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,800
I can't believe he failed.

84
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,870
Let's go and check.

85
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,590
Excuse me. Coming through.

86
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,110
It's working!

87
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,060
(Song Qing, Astronomical Bureau,
6th Rank Alchemist)

88
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,680

89
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,230
Senior Song!

90
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
Senior Song!

91
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,360
Senior Song!

92
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,390
Are you alright?

93
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,780
Did you get hurt?

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,030
It's not the salt

95
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,560
or the temperature

96
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,710
and definitely not my alchemy skills.

97
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,560
You're right.

98
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,030
Why couldn't I make it?

99
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Senior Song!

100
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,790
Senior Song!

101
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,120
Senior Song!

102
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,960
A constable came to see Senior Caiwei

103
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,230
with a message.

104
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,350
"Xu Qi'an's in trouble.

105
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,230
Help him."

106
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,710
Xu Qi'an?

107
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,320
That name sounds familiar.

108
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,000
What else did he say?

109
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,470
He left this book, too.

110
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,910
"Equivalent exchange

111
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,030
is the unchanging principle of alchemy."

112
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,350
"Equivalent exchange"!

113
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,960
Yes! That's right!

114
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,520
When teaching me alchemy, Master said

115
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,830
the essence of it isn't change

116
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,030
but transformation.

117
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,790
(The Codex of Alchemy)
Who gave you this book?

118
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,300
(The Codex of Alchemy)

119
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,470
What's "chemistry"?

120
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,000
What does "atom" mean?

121
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,200
I know every character in the book,

122
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,680
but together,

123
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,560
I'm completely clueless.

124
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,640
What about you, Senior Song?

125
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
Be quiet.

126
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,990
Read it carefully.

127
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,320
"To fake silver,

128
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,030
step one,

129
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,640
filter the salt water."

130
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,630
Yes.

131
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,880
I did so, too.

132
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,520
"Step two,

133
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,790
evaporate it

134
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,960
for crystallization

135
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,590
and melt the crystals."

136
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,830
"Step three,

137
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,990
be careful.

138
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,560
It's the key to making the tax silver.

139
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Your success

140
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,910
depends on it."

141
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,710
Step three!

142
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,710
- That's it?
- It...

143
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,910
Where's the rest?

144
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:49,910
He only gave you this?

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,120
Yes, just this one.

146
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,150
So what's

147
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,640
step three?

148
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,030
He meant to leave us hanging.

149
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,830
I'll ask you again.

150
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,320
Who gave you this book?

151
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
Uncle Pingzhi?

152
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,150
He scared me.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,910
I am

154
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,080
Xu Pingzhi, Baihu of the Imperial Guards.

155
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,710
I'm sorry that my nephew

156
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,200
offended you.

157
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,470
My apologies.

158
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,910
Xu... Pingzhi?

159
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,680
Yes, that's me.

160
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Mr. Zhou,

161
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,710
can we end things

162
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,560
here and now?

163
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
Yes. Sure.

164
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,710
The Baihu of the Imperial Guards said so.

165
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,960
Sure, let's end it.

166
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,120
Hey,

167
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,160
how about this?

168
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,230
You can

169
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,230
stab and kill him

170
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,630
and then kill yourself.

171
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,710
That way, we're even.

172
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,670
What do you say?

173
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,510
A lowly Imperial Guard is

174
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,680
nothing more than a man of straw.

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,080
How dare you get in my way!

176
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,590
Finish him!

177
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,430
Yes!

178
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Ningyan,

179
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,870
I'm here for you.

180
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,590
No one can take you away.

181
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,350
Bring it on!

182
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I was reckless.

183
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,160
I thought they'd fight fair and square,

184
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,080
doing one-on-ones,

185
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,630
but they beat me together.

186
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,630
So shameless!

187
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,280
But don't worry.

188
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,350
I always have a backup plan.

189
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,920
Before I came,

190
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,560
I had asked your aunt to see Cijiu

191
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,960
to get help from the Yunlu Academy.

192
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Also,

193
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,710
I had sent a message to the Imperial Guards.

194
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,350
Once my men come,

195
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,320
they'll get us out

196
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,560
in no time.

197
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,040
Imperial Guards?

198
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,800
Given their speed,

199
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
they'll arrive in a few minutes.

200
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,710
Just wait.

201
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,050
Uncle,

202
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,160
are the Imperial Guards

203
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,560
- really good?
- Yes.

204
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,590
Can they handle Zhou Li?

205
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,160
They'll die for me!

206
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,160
Fine.

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,830
Master, Mr. Mubai,

208
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,110
please do me a favor.

209
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,120
What is it?

210
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,400
Brother offended
Vice Minister of Revenue's son

211
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,160
to protect my sister.

212
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,560
Please

213
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,800
help him.

214
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,990
Your brother,

215
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,630
the one who wrote,

216
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,470
"Fear not you've no admirers.

217
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,040
There's someone
who loves your song"?

218
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,920
That talent?

219
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,550
- Yes.
- Cijiu,

220
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,280
I'll help him out. Don't worry.

221
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,510
Go back with your master

222
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,350
to study.

223
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,960
This is none of your business.

224
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I'll deal with my student's trouble.

225
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,950
Come on!

226
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,990
Where's your brother now?

227
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,080
In the Changle County.

228
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,400
(Heart Spell)
I go miles away with one step.

229
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,160
That old geezer is such a busybody.

230
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,590
(Dustless Spell)
I should leave.

231
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,160
I'm going to Changle.

232
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,830
I'm still learning it.

233
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,830
You're...

234
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,350
good enough.

235
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,990
I thought those two masters

236
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,440
wouldn't help out.

237
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,680
How should we...?

238
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,920
We'll ride!

239
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,760
Let's go!

240
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,490
Where's Ningyan?

241
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,350
The Ministry of Justice took him away.

242
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,920
Don't worry, Miss Xu.

243
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,830
We've done what Ningyan

244
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,110
told us to do.

245
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,710
If the Astronomical Bureau steps in,

246
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,400
I'm sure

247
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,320
he'll be fine.

248
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,960
He has connections there?

249
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,680
He's something else.

250
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,870
Ningyan is wonderful.

251
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,040
If they hurt him,

252
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,510
I'll fight them with my life!

253
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes, me too!

254
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,990
Are he

255
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,680
and his colleagues close?

256
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,880
Ningyan

257
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,870
is

258
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,280
quite special.

259
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,200
Special?

260
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,350
Mr. Wang,

261
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,920
can you tell me more about him?

262
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,560
It's kind of embarrassing,

263
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,590
but officers like us

264
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,440
are hardly

265
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,110
clean and honest.

266
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,080
The best we can do is

267
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
not exploit the civilians.

268
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,400
As for

269
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,440
the loaded ones,

270
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,510
getting money from them

271
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,350
isn't

272
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,870
wrong, is it?

273
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,400
But Ningyan never does that.

274
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,870
Civilians

275
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,870
or rich people,

276
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,440
he never extorts money from them.

277
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,510
When your family was in trouble,

278
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,990
I meant to

279
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,230
help him

280
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,320
get some money.

281
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,280
He smiled

282
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,590
and agreed.

283
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,400
But when I gave him his share,

284
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,710
he had it

285
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,750
returned quietly.

286
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,350
He's smart.

287
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,040
No fish survive if water is too clear.

288
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,750
It's simple as that.

289
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,350
But he doesn't know.

290
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,440
When you think he's dumb,

291
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,080
he's sophisticated

292
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,200
and tactful.

293
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,800
He knows the ways of the world

294
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,870
and gets along well with us.

295
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,080
Now that he's in trouble,

296
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,110
all of us are worried.

297
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,760
Uncle.

298
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,640
Uncle?

299
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,950
Uncle.

300
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,280
It's been two hours.

301
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,920
Where are the Imperial Guards?

302
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,320
They must've caught up with something.

303
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,870
Be patient.

304
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,350
There they are!

305
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,950
Xu Qi'an,

306
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,750
it's time to take your last meal.

307
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,670
Get out.

308
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,230
Listen,

309
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,160
don't play tricks with me.

310
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,870
I don't want to break your limbs

311
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,040
and drag you out.

312
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,830
Move it!

313
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,520
Come on!

314
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's go!

315
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,400
Ningyan!

316
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,510
Where are you taking him?

317
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,520
Ningyan!

318
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,670
Come back!

319
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,040
Zhou Li,

320
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,080
my men will come anytime.

321
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,560
If you lay a finger on Ningyan,

322
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,630
I'll kill you!

323
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,590
Just now, you said,

324
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
"A mad ordinary man..."

325
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,350
What's the rest again?

326
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,950
Are you mute?

327
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,000
Alright.

328
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,280
Give him that.

329
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,780
(Confession)

330
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,830
Sign it.

331
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,510
To spare myself torture?

332
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,800
So you aren't mute.

333
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,990
But you got it wrong.

334
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,990
What I'm saying is

335
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,840
torture before signature

336
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,550
or the other way around.

337
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,100
(Xu Qi'an will be exiled to Yunzhou.)

338
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,590
Are you mad?

339
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,640
You're so short-fused.

340
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,920
If you're mad now,

341
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,960
how will you react later?

342
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,200
Each and every tool here

343
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,030
can cause you excruciating pain,

344
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,470
but it won't kill you.

345
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,270
I'll show you

346
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,070
that you're

347
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,030
a man of straw after all.

348
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
It only takes

349
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,070
a pinch

350
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,270
to finish you for good.

351
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,640
Report, Minister!

352
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,030
Two masters of the Yunlu Academy

353
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,440
demand to see you.

354
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,750
(Sun Jingzong, Minister of Justice)

355
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,270
Yunlu Academy?

356
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Stop following me!

357
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,710
This isn't your business, you know.

358
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,840
It's mine.

359
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,750
It's not your concern.

360
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
Chunjing.

361
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,150
Jinyan.

362
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,280
What

363
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,400
brings you to

364
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,240
my office?

365
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,230
Your men arrested my student, Xu Qi'an.

366
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,510
Please release him,

367
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Minister Sun.

368
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,680
The Ministry of Justice

369
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,840
never arrests people easily.

370
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,310
Tell me what happened.

371
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,470
- He...
- Report!

372
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,360
Minister Sun,

373
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
alchemists of the Astronomical Bureau

374
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,800
are breaking in.

375
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,760
We can't stop them.

376
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,120
Supervisor

377
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,710
of the Astronomical Bureau's disciple,

378
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,550
Song Qing

379
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,200
greets you, Minister.

380
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,270
Breaking into the Ministry of Justice

381
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,070
is against the law.

382
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,120
Leave now!

383
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,200
Minister Sun,

384
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,400
I'm here to ask you

385
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,600
to release a man.

386
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,910
Who is it?

387
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,440
Xu Qi'an.

388
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,200
He was falsely arrested earlier today.

389
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,350
Minister.

390
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,440
Did our officers

391
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,880
arrest Xu Qi'an earlier?

392
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,070
As far as I know,

393
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,470
we made

394
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,470
no arrests today.

395
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,520
No?

396
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,230
But he is...

397
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,640
in our prison.

398
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,920
Who brought him back?

399
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,830
Well...

400
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,000
Director Huang!

401
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,800
Come here.

402
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,550
- Minister.
- Did you

403
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,880
have him arrested?

404
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,360
Yes, Minister.

405
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
Explain the whole thing

406
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,200
in front of everyone!

407
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,510
Here's the thing.

408
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,790
Mr. Zhou filed a suit

409
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,200
that someone beat him in the street.

410
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,640
It was too sudden,

411
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,160
so I didn't have time

412
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
to get an arrest warrant.

413
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,600
I thought we should arrest him first

414
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,400
before he ran away.

415
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,470
Gents should be honest.

416
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,620
(Heart Spell)
So should ordinary men.

417
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,470
Heart Spell!

418
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,840
Mr. Zhou wanted Xu Qi'an

419
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,200
to die in our prison.

420
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,640
It was easy, so I did him a favor.

421
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
4th Rank.

422
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,550
Heart Spell.

423
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,760
Minister!

424
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,920
I heard

425
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,030
your uncle brought you up.

426
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,360
So I have reason to believe

427
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,790
you two planned this together.

428
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,040
Zhou Li,

429
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,880
leave my family alone!

430
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,550
You also have a cousin

431
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,070
who's pretty.

432
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,790
She can go to the Imperial Office of Music!

433
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,790
That's not included in the confession.

434
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,030
Add it now!

435
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,400
Do it right here

436
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,270
in front of him.

437
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,520
Yes.

438
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,790
Take him away.

439
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,070
(There they are.)

440
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,960
(Finally!)

441
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,520
Sir,

442
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,360
I haven't done

443
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,990
questioning him.

444
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
This is our ministry,

445
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,790
not the Ministry of Revenue.

446
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,680
If you like questioning others,

447
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,960
go to your father's ministry.

448
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,960
That is if it's a judiciary, too.

449
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,600
Did you not hear my order?

450
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
Take him away!

451
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,480
Hold on!

452
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,720
Sir,

453
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,270
this man meant to kill me in public.

454
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,920
I'm the victim.

455
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,440
Sir,

456
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,840
you'd better

457
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,550
not interfere.

458
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,640
Mr. Zhou,

459
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,310
say that

460
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,400
to Minister Sun

461
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,030
who's right outside.

462
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,350
Director Huang,

463
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,070
you've gone too far!

464
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,310
This is huge.

465
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,880
How dare you act on your own!

466
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,310
You're disgracing

467
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,840
our whole ministry!

468
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,200
You should be glad I'm not dead.

469
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,680
I'll reintroduce myself.

470
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
I'm the new disciple
of the Astronomical Bureau.

471
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,600
Xu Qi'an

472
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,160
greets you, seniors.

473
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,230
Did you write this book?

474
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,590
Senior Song,

475
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,440
this isn't the place to talk.

476
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,840
Once we get out,

477
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,990
ask me anything.

478
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,750
I'll tell you

479
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,920
all I know.

480
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,470
Qi'an, I'm here.

481
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,510
It's fine. I'll protect you.

482
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,680
Minister Sun,

483
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,840
why are those alchemists...?

484
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,230
They're here for that man.

485
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,590
And

486
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,550
those two masters of the Academy...

487
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,550
They're also here for him.

488
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,400
Are you Xu Qi'an?

489
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,070
Yes.

490
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,880
I'm Cijiu's master.

491
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,400
Greetings.

492
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,680
"Fear not you've no admirers.

493
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,230
There's someone
who loves your song."

494
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,470
Did you write that?

495
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,800
No, actually.

496
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,440
I'll explain it to you later.

497
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,230
- You...
- We're done here.

498
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,030
It's time to leave.

499
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,390
Fine.

500
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,070
Wait.

501
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,310
I have something else to do.

502
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,470
Please give me a minute.

503
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,360
Xu Qi'an,

504
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,440
what do you want?

505
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,160
You're insane...!

506
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,830
Masters...

507
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,030
Masters, have you had lunch?

508
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,120
Xu Qi'an,

509
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,750
my father is the Minister of Revenue!

510
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,880
Please.

511
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,710
Not here.

512
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,600
Please stop.

513
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,880
- Mr. Zhou!
- Minister!

514
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,600
This is your office!

515
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,750
I'm assaulted in broad daylight!

516
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,550
I demand justice!

517
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,640
Calm down, Mr. Zhou.

518
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,840
I'll tell His Majesty

519
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,440
in court tomorrow.

520
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,360
Get up now.

521
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,200
Zhou Li.

522
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,910
What now?

523
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,960
I'm showing you

524
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,070
that ordinary men can get mad.

525
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,750
A furious ordinary man...

526
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,200
I see.

527
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,360
Luckily, Masters came in time

528
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,920
to help you out.

529
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,680
By the way, Cijiu,

530
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,680
since when do I become so popular

531
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,200
that two masters are fighting over me

532
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,070
to be their last disciple?

533
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
And they invite me

534
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,840
to the Yunlu Academy

535
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,230
to talk about poetry and Taoism.

536
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,550
You see,

537
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,120
they love your poems,

538
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,150
such as

539
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,550
Seeing Yang Gong off to Qingzhou
at Mianyang Pavilion.

540
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,710
I thought they valued my character.

541
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,270
Turns out, it's my poetry.

542
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,680
When did I write that poem?

543
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,400
You don't remember?

544
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
Why did those

545
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,750
of the Bureau also come?

546
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,550
I had Constable Wang

547
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,120
bring a book to them

548
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,600
that would pique their interest.

549
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,310
Also, they invited me

550
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,880
to give them a lecture tomorrow.

551
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,160
I couldn't say no!

552
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,230
I'd like one.

553
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,750
I'll try it and buy some next time.

554
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,590
Be careful.

555
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,840
Yogurt! Creamy yogurt!

556
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,680
Young lady,

557
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,990
would you like one?

558
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,440
(Yogurt)

559
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,280
Excuse me.

560
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,680
I'd like some.

561
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,920
- Sure.
- I'll take them.

562
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,970
Here you go.

563
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,200
Thank you.

564
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,040
Take it.

565
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,750
One for you.

566
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,590
Thank you.

567
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,510
Taste it, Cijiu.

568
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,550
Here.

569
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:08,960
This is good.

570
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,640
As for the melon-favored one...

571
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,280
Aunt,

572
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,790
thanks for everything.

573
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:17,830
Here.

574
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,790
I didn't do it for you!

575
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Had something happened to you,

576
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,120
everyone in the Xu Clan

577
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,200
would've been affected.

578
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,840
Xu Lingyin!

579
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,170
Stop!

580
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,570
- You'll fall!
- Be careful.

581
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,470
Come on!

582
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,840
Here, Lingyue.

583
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,900
(Gu Ruohan, the Swordsman)

584
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,550
You...

585
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,790
Take it

586
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,920
before your mother sees it.

587
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,910
Come on!

588
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,830
Ningyan,

589
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,200
how did you know?

590
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,750
I knew a long time ago.

591
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,030
He's low-paid.

592
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,960
I'll buy

593
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,230
the books you like.

594
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,710
I'm richer than you.

595
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,150
Where's my uncle?

596
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,040
He hasn't come back?

597
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,720
Zhou Li,

598
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,550
my men will come anytime.

599
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,360
If you lay a finger on Ningyan,

600
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,200
I'll kill you.

601
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,600
Zhou Li,

602
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,360
my men will come anytime.

603
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,470
If you lay a finger on Ningyan,

604
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,750
I'll kill you!

605
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,030
Somebody help!

606
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,680
Help...

607
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,800
Well,

608
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,310
correct me if I'm wrong.

609
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,070
Did you forget about me?

610
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,710
Cijiu,

611
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,550
your father is asking you.

612
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,030
He... he's talking to you!

613
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,680
Father...

614
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,790
Eat up.

615
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,230
Sit down.

616
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,640
Lingyue, sit.

617
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,640
You ingrates!

618
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,600
Don't blame us.

619
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,230
What... what did you

620
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,070
promise me

621
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,120
back then?

622
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,710
You said you'd get it done.

623
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,680
You were reckless.

624
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,070
I was eager to help.

625
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,880
Yes! Right!

626
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,120
It was all Zhou Li's fault.

627
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,640
He insulted my cousin.

628
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,360
We must make him pay.

629
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,640
Right, Cijiu?

630
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,360
I'd do the same as Ningyan!

631
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,600
Good boy!

632
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,470
You boors are alike.

633
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,000
Let's eat.

634
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,910
Dig in.

635
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,750
Don't act on impulse ever again.

636
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,960
Don't be like your uncle.

637
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,270
Lesson learned, Aunt.

638
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,880
It turned out to be a blessing.

639
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,360
From now on,

640
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,840
our family

641
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,920
will be of one heart

642
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,710
and one mind.

643
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,440
Let's eat.

644
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,240
Miss,

645
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,240
you're...

646
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,310
Is Xu Qi'an in?

647
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,640
You weren't in the Astronomical Bureau.

648
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,920
No, the Municipal Office.

649
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,600
You were so lucky

650
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,200
that you found Senior Song.

651
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,240
Hadn't it been me,

652
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,170
that blue book wouldn't

653
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,150
have worked.

654
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:47,830
By the way,

655
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,550
why did you and Zhou fight?

656
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,230
When we were shopping,

657
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
he tried to hit on my cousin.

658
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,470
She's indeed a beauty.

659
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,400
Yes, she's pretty.

660
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,600
As pretty as you.

661
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,840
Of course.

662
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,120
We're as fair

663
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,840
as fairies.

664
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,360
I'm here for business, though.

665
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,360
It's about the Tax Silver Case.

666
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,440
Do you know

667
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,550
who swapped your uncle's tax silver?

668
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,030
I'm a low-ranking constable...

669
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,600
They were a Qianhu

670
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,710
of the Imperial Guards,

671
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,680
Lu Changzhi,

672
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,120
and a clerk of the Revenue,

673
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,030
Zheng Xin.

674
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,630
So?

675
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,200
Vice Minister Zhou Xianping of Revenue,

676
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,470
who's also Zhou Li's father,

677
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,790
is behind them.

678
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,680
It only takes a pinch

679
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
to finish you for good.

680
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,360
Zhou Xianping is

681
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,360
Zhou Li's old man?

682
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,840
Since you solved the Tax Silver Case,

683
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,120
you've made enemies with him

684
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,360
and got involved in it.

685
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,160
What happened in the street that day

686
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,880
was a trap they set.

687
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,120
They wandered around me

688
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,840
and hit on my cousin

689
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
to provoke me

690
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,510
so that they could kill me.

691
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,800
You're smart.

692
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,240
Hey,

693
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,200
is that why you're here?

694
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,310
Thanks.

695
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,510
There's something else.

696
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,640
Say it.

697
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,200
Following the leads,

698
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,230
we've found Zhou Xianping,

699
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,680
but he's high-ranking

700
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,600
and well-connected.

701
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,470
We don't want to alert him,

702
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,880
so now, we're stuck.

703
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,030
But His Majesty said

704
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,070
I could only return to

705
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,160
the Bureau after this case.

706
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,310
So

707
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,480
Xu Qi'an,

708
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,990
I read the cases you solved in the Office.

709
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,840
You're quite good.

710
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,790
Do you need my help with your case?

711
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,550
Fine. Let's hear it.

712
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,000
Father.

713
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,070
What are you looking at?

714
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,470
You freaked me out!

715
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,680
Who's that girl?

716
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,270
She came to

717
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,150
see Ningyan so late.

718
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,360
Is something going on between them?

719
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,800
She's with the Astronomical Bureau,

720
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,400
Astrologer Chu Caiwei.

721
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,840
That bureau?

722
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,560
Yes.

723
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,590
She also handles the Tax Silver Case.

724
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,320
That boy is good!

725
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,470
An astrologer like her is

726
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,760
too good to let go.

727
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,720
I think it's a bad idea.

728
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,320
We're no match

729
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,590
for the Vice Minister of Revenue.

730
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,200
Ningyan,

731
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,990
you know those of the Bureau.

732
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,990
Cijiu studies at the Yunlu Academy.

733
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,470
With your backgrounds,

734
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:45,760
if we behave ourselves,

735
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,920
no one can harm us.

736
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,880
We're like the meat

737
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,110
on their chopping block.

738
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,110
They're in control.

739
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,190
We don't have a say here.

740
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,240
Exactly.

741
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,590
When the case happened,

742
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,670
wasn't I at the Yunlu Academy?

743
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,440
Ningyan returned safe and sound

744
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,670
because of Zhou Li's rough handling.

745
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,510
He was at fault.

746
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,110
If his father acts

747
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,800
and creates another case

748
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,360
to kill all of us legally,

749
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,990
will the Bureau

750
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,670
and the Academy

751
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,470
break into the jail to rescue us?

752
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,310
What to do then?

753
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,880
Act against Vice Minister Zhou?

754
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,110
We're humble,

755
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,400
while he's 4th Rank!

756
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,840
Here's what I think.

757
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,280
One,

758
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,720
someone must be behind him.

759
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,080
Two,

760
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,320
His Majesty is trying to

761
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,400
maintain a delicate balance.

762
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,110
Caiwei once said

763
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,510
when the Secretary of Revenue

764
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,800
impeached Zhou,

765
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,630
His Majesty brushed it aside.

766
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,470
Were his rivals trying to bring him down?

767
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,720
Throughout history,

768
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,990
all emperors use the art of balance.

769
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,760
His Majesty didn't dismiss Zhou,

770
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,880
meaning it's a matter of power struggle.

771
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,720
Even the Municipal Office can't touch him.

772
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,120
Not exactly.

773
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,080
First off,

774
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,280
why did he create the Tax Silver Case?

775
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,800
Not for corruption.

776
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,440
He could take bribes anytime.

777
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,430
Yes.

778
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,670
No need to do it during the inspection.

779
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,390
Was he

780
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,070
in urgent need of money?

781
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,720
He needed it

782
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,070
to fill the hole

783
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,240
that would be discovered

784
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,880
during the inspection.

785
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,280
I get it.

786
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,920
So we need to uncover their plot

787
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,840
so that Zhou can't get away.

788
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,920
Battle wolves with tigers.

789
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,550
We won't deal with him ourselves.

790
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,880
We'll be the spark

791
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,920
to start a fire to kill him.

792
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,510
Do it as soon as possible.

793
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,720
Step back further.

794
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,760
We don't need to target him.

795
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,760
A high-ranking official like him

796
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,590
is cunning and crafty.

797
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,550
So far, we aren't his match.

798
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,760
Still,

799
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,840
he has a weak spot.

800
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,870
Zhou Li.

801
00:36:59,070 --> 00:36:59,910
Correct.

802
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,070
Compared with his father,

803
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,990
Zhou Li is spoiled and dumb.

804
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,920
If there aren't enough charges,

805
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,670
we'll make some,

806
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,590
giving Zhou Xianping's rivals leverage.

807
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,110
You can become the Prime Minister.

808
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,280
Knock it off, Uncle.

809
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,590
Use your connections

810
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,720
to check out Zhou Li.

811
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,150
Who does he hang out with?

812
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,590
Does he have any quirks?

813
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,760
Where does he usually go?

814
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,320
We need all the information.

815
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,550
It's on me.

816
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,360
Cijiu, go to the Academy tomorrow.

817
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,550
Ask your masters to protect the girls.

818
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,640
Sure.

819
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,310
What about you?

820
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,870
Me?

821
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,550
I'll find a way out for the Xu Clan.

822
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,240
(It looks like a modern building.)

823
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,360
Have you been here before?

824
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,160
It's my first time.

825
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,550
You don't look surprised.

826
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,030
I've seen skyscrapers.

827
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,110
There are a lot in Shanghai.

828
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,070
I...

829
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,280
I've always been calm.

830
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,990
I can keep a straight face

831
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,280
in front of anything.

832
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,470
Perhaps

833
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,190
it's a gift.

834
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,280
Very well.

835
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,110
He who has a calm mind

836
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,110
can work with me.

837
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,670
Please let me know

838
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,440
if there's anything wrong.

839
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,240
Begin.

840
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,190
(In my previous life, if I could)

841
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,990
(make a fire with a flick,)

842
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,280
(that'd be awesome!)

843
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,510
Hold on.

844
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,840
Have you failed

845
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,550
at this step repeatedly?

846
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,390
Yes.

847
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,590
Please guide me.

848
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,880
Your failures aren't

849
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,880
due to the materials,

850
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,280
the temperature,

851
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,990
or your alchemy skills.

852
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,880
The problem lies in

853
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,160
two words.

854
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,400
(Materials)
Electric voltage,

855
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,630
in layman's terms,

856
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,990
means the strength of a shock.

857
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Both water and voltage

858
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,280
flow from high to low.

859
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,590
If you spill water

860
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,720
from this cup on a person,

861
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,720
it's fine, right?

862
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,760
Yes.

863
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,110
But what if it's a waterfall?

864
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,960
If one gets hit by it,

865
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,280
its impact can break

866
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,670
that person's bones

867
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,360
or even kill him or her.

868
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,030
Electricity is the same.

869
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,190
I call this phenomenon

870
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,160
voltage.

871
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,240
I know it.

872
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,880
You're clever.

873
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,920
Is what you just said

874
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,880
included in that book of alchemy?

875
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,190
Of course.

876
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,280
Also, only I have

877
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,920
read and studied

878
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,320
that book.

879
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,920
The note sent to you earlier is only

880
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,110
a drop in the ocean.

881
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,920
That book introduces

882
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,550
all kinds of knowledge

883
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,990
and alchemy techniques

884
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,920
that are unheard of.

885
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,200
I've decided

886
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,720
to share this book

887
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,440
with the Bureau.

888
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,110
Great! Brilliant!

889
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,360
Yes!

890
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,510
That blue book was a gift to thank you

891
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,400
for helping me.

892
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:41,880
I've perfected the making of fake tax silver

893
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,550
and told you about voltage.

894
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,240
That's not free.

895
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,440
Always keep in mind

896
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:48,320
the principle of alchemy is...

897
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,600
"Equivalent

898
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,870
exchange".

899
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,030
Of course.

900
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,110
Name your price then.

901
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:05,110
How rude.

902
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,030
Alchemy can't be bought with money.

903
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,960
(What's free)

904
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,360
(is most expensive.)

905
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,630
All set, huh?

906
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,990
"Huan".

907
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,600
"Qian".

908
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,910
"Yang".

909
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,360
It's Yang Qianhuan,

910
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,670
my senior,

911
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,990
the sole formationist

912
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,440
in the Dafeng.

913
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,590
And those two are...?

914
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,360
Supervisor prepared them for you.

915
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,800
Do you use sabers or swords?

916
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,990
Sabers.

917
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,920
A fan of sabers?

918
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,760
Calm down.

919
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,590
It's a gift from Supervisor.
