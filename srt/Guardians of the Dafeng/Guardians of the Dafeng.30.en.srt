Tianyu Dharma.

00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,990
You again!

47
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,990
Shut up!

48
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,080
I'll destroy the Dharma. You're next.

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,830
Let's see which weapon is faster,

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,800
my sword or your spear.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,670
Supervisor, come out now.

52
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,950
Senior Song,

53
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,390
what's this?

54
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,760
Tianyu Dharma!

55
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,960
It's as formidable as they say.

56
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,760
The more powerful one is,

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,640
the harder one withstands its pressure.

58
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,800
My fruit...

59
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,520
Tianyu

60
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,760
appears as strong as ever.

61
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,200
Tianyu Dharma!

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,520
Ningyan,

63
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,120
what's going on?

64
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,470
I'm not sure.

65
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,390
Looks like

66
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,350
a punitive expedition.

67
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,790
Supervisor,

68
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,150
how long will you keep hiding?

69
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,680
Ningyan,

70
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,640
the Xus must be tough.

71
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,960
Do not kneel!

72
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,270
I didn't.

73
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,590
Let's see who'll kneel.

74
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,340
(Is this the power
of a high-ranking cultivator?)

75
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,550
What now?

76
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,520
The pressure is gone.

77
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,710
Why look at me?

78
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,440
I didn't kneel!

79
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,460
(2nd Rank of Tianyu, Arhat)

80
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,590
I said

81
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,190
no entry...

82
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,440
An ant can't shake a tree.

83
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,680
Here I am.

84
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,150
Did someone intervene?

85
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,960
Are you alright, Uncle?

86
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,520
I'm fine.

87
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,440
It's good to be young.

88
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,080
You're much stronger.

89
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,350
I've become old.

90
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,590
I was caught off guard

91
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,440
and couldn't keep my feet.

92
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,750
Shouldn't the Xus be tough?

93
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,590
Shut up.

94
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,630
What's wrong, little one?

95
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
Father,

96
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,470
it's so loud outside.

97
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,990
It'll quiet down soon.

98
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,440
An immortal is in the sky.

99
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,280
Alright, little one.

100
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,200
Stop staring at it.

101
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,630
Help your father up.

102
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,110
Protect your father.

103
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,470
Knock it off!

104
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,350
Little one, go back to bed.

105
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,400
Go back to sleep.

106
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,350
What can you do?

107
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,420
Did I raise you
for over 20 years for nothing?

108
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,200
Of course not.

109
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,040
Relax.

110
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,870
Heroes will become old.

111
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,320
Back then,

112
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,830
your uncle was a tough warrior.

113
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,230
I fought back and forth against enemies

114
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,350
without blinking!

115
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,440
Yes, I know.

116
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,110
And that

117
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,920
took a toll on my uncle's knees,

118
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
making them so weak now.

119
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,830
You little ingrate!

120
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,510
Are you mocking me?

121
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,830
No, I'm sorry.

122
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,280
My bad.

123
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,870
- Will you stop?
- Yes, I'm sorry.

124
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,960
No more sarcasm, huh?

125
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
What's up?

126
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,200
(This is Xu Qi'an's home.)

127
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,620
(Xu Mansion)

128
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,420
(Xu Mansion)

129
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,420
(Xu Mansion)

130
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,160
Who was it?

131
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
Supervisor,

132
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,920
you know why we're here.

133
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll

134
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,040
cut to the chase.

135
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,710
Thanks.

136
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,280
Have some tea.

137
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,110
It's been a while
since your junior, Du'e's last visit.

138
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,710
Did he forget the way to the Bureau?

139
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,080
In the Dafeng,

140
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,630
you know everything.

141
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,590
Turns out, that saying

142
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,110
isn't false.

143
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Shen Shu has reappeared.

144
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,230
The two of us came

145
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,590
to bring him back to Tianyu.

146
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,800
Please return him to us.

147
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,560
What if

148
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,200
I won't?

149
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,760
Supervisor,

150
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,230
in that case,

151
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,560
we will

152
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,800
attack your state.

153
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,800
We might not be

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,680
as powerful as you in the Dafeng,

155
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,110
but I assure you

156
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,440
that once we strike,

157
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,110
your capital will be leveled to the ground.

158
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,880
Supervisor,

159
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,470
think carefully.

160
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,960
Will you choose that man

161
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,630
or your capital?

162
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,430
I won't.

163
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,950
Are you

164
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,680
going to risk everyone's life in town

165
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,200
to keep Shen Shu?

166
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,510
I won't

167
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,200
let him go because I can't.

168
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,280
You want to take him away,

169
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,830
but you don't know

170
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,110
it's best for him

171
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,870
to stay in the Dafeng.

172
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,710
How so?

173
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,920
Shen Shu's host Xu Qi'an is special.

174
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,470
Other than Shen Shu, he has

175
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,800
something else in his body.

176
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,830
If Shen Shu is separated from it,

177
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm afraid

178
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,680
you won't be able to see him again.

179
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,630
Supervisor,

180
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,110
could it be what went missing

181
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,110
from the Palace 20 years ago?

182
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,990
But even so,

183
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,750
that was your bureau's mistake.

184
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,160
Why should Tianyu suffer?

185
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,470
You came all the way here
not to be fooled by some lie.

186
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,110
How about

187
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,830
we have a bet?

188
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,950
Bet what?

189
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,990
Everyone's life in the Dafeng

190
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,560
and the future of Tianyu.

191
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,990
Did you hear it?

192
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,230
This was cast by a Tianyu cultivator.

193
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,400
We've been at peace with Tianyu for decades.

194
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,320
Too bad, war will break out again.

195
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,830
They acted in our capital.

196
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,630
(Pure and Noble)
Tianyu was without scruple.

197
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,080
Why hasn't Supervisor taken action

198
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,350
to destroy the Dharma

199
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,710
as retaliation against Tianyu

200
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,560
to vent our anger?

201
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,650
- Yes.
- That's right.

202
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,230
Don't be troubled, Your Majesty.

203
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,040
Supervisor is powerful enough

204
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,400
to handle this deceptive trick.

205
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,590
I'm always

206
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,510
full of trust in him.

207
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,350
But this time, Tianyu came, well-prepared.

208
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,160
Their sorcerers are different.

209
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,320
They aren't ranked by power.

210
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,680
If

211
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:31,350
even Supervisor's hands are tied,

212
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,230
how will the Dafeng look?

213
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,350
Your Majesty,

214
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,510
Chu Caiwei

215
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,800
of the Bureau came to see you.

216
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,750
Send her in.

217
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,590
Yes.

218
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

219
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,310
When will Supervisor act?

220
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,480
Your Majesty,

221
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,990
Master said

222
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,510
it'd be beneath him to destroy the Dharma,

223
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,160
and it'd set tongues wagging.

224
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,640
Send a junior instead

225
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,640
to showcase our national prestige.

226
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,270
Will that be

227
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,510
Sun Xuanji?

228
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,520
Your Majesty,

229
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,600
Senior Sun hasn't come out for over 20 years.

230
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,310
He's still been in closed cultivation.

231
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,510
Is it Yang Qianhuan then?

232
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,840
Senior Yang's energy ran backward

233
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,360
during yesterday's practice.

234
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,910
What?

235
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
It ran backward?

236
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,510
Now of all times?

237
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,400
Who's left?

238
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,360
You and Song Qing can't win a duel.

239
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,470
Aside from you two,

240
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,880
who can the Bureau send?

241
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,230
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

242
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,360
Master asked me to borrow someone from you.

243
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,390
That person

244
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,510
will have a duel

245
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,880
on behalf of the Bureau with Tianyu's envoy.

246
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,470
Borrow someone from me?

247
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Who is it?

248
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,550
(It's odd.)

249
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,130
(Supervisor removed its pressure,)

250
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,440
(but the Dharma remains.)

251
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,030
(Could it be)

252
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,790
(that even he couldn't deal with Tianyu?)

253
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,830
(Right.)

254
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,200
(If even he couldn't handle it,)

255
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,640
(it'd cause panic in the capital.)

256
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,280
(Then)

257
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,440
(the date between Simu and me today)

258
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,480
(would be postponed.)

259
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,440
(Whatever.)

260
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,880
Ningyan, reel it in.

261
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,030
You look too haughty.

262
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,520
How about now?

263
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,960
Is it better?

264
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,960
Never mind.

265
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,120
Mr. Xu Ningyan in the middle,

266
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,550
please don't move. Look at me.

267
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,750
Smile, everyone.

268
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,960
Please take a look.

269
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,200
It's nice. It looks good.

270
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,600
Good work.

271
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,470
Full of vitality.

272
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,120
Especially you, Aunt.

273
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,470
You brim with energy

274
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,990
as if

275
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,440
you're in your 20s.

276
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,440
Is that...

277
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,390
me?

278
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,440
Is it not?

279
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,710
You're in your prime!

280
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,070
He's too honest.

281
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,270
That little cheat.

282
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,750
(Xu Mansion)

283
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,230
Have him make more drawings of us.

284
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,710
- Sure. Good idea.
- Agreed.

285
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,790
Come on.

286
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,440
Please continue to draw us, sir.

287
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,360
Alright.

288
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,440
Pose now.

289
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,810
- Good.
- Don't move.

290
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,040
Excellent!

291
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
Mr. Nangong?

292
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,790
I need to go.

293
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,960
Let's take a break, sir.

294
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,600
Mr. Nangong...

295
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,070
What brings you here?

296
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,270
Lord Wei summoned you.

297
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,980
(Downward File)

298
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,120
Did you ask for me, Lord Wei?

299
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,990
When will Li Miaozhen leave?

300
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,710
The case remains unclear.

301
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,160
We need more time.

302
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,880
I told you a long time ago,

303
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,130
Heaven and Men never ceased fighting.

304
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,270
The battle between her
and Chu Yuanzhen is inevitable.

305
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,030
But it can't happen now.

306
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,230
I understand.

307
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,840
I've found some leads.

308
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,990
As soon as I solve this case,

309
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,230
I'll send her out.

310
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:07,550
Fine.

311
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,510
You're

312
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,880
too deep into it anyway.

313
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,070
What do you need me to do?

314
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,640
Just now, His Majesty

315
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,230
sent someone to summon you.

316
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,520
You'll have to

317
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,070
go to the Palace with him.

318
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,070
His Majesty summoned me?

319
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,400
Shouldn't he and others be discussing

320
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,790
plans to deal with Tianyu?

321
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,800
That's right.

322
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,920
His Majesty ordered you

323
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:34,990
to break it!

324
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,470
Break...

325
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,720
it?

326
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,740
(Self-restrained and Virtuous)
I deserve death!

327
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,120
Why?

328
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,880
Your Majesty ordered me to break the Dharma.

329
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,360
If I refused and defied your order,

330
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,030
I'd be executed.

331
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
If I followed your order,

332
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,200
how could a mere Silver Gong
defeat the Dharma?

333
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,510
I wouldn't survive.

334
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,030
Please kill me now, Your Majesty.

335
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,990
Are you blaming me?

336
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,360
I... I wouldn't dare.

337
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,680
I fear that I'll

338
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,030
betray your trust, Your Majesty.

339
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,160
I don't trust you

340
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,310
but the Bureau.

341
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,270
Supervisor borrowed you from me

342
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,120
to deal with the Dharma.

343
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,790
Supervisor?

344
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,790
The Bureau holds tons of skilled masters.

345
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm only a Silver Gong. Why me...?

346
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,070
(Could it be)

347
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:09,990
(that he knew the powerful Shen Shu
was in me?)

348
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,270
He's chosen you of all people.

349
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,310
You're fighting that duel.

350
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,310
I'm not seeking your opinion.

351
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm telling you

352
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,750
this duel

353
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,640
concerns our national image.

354
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,510
Whatever you do, you must

355
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,840
break the Dharma

356
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,030
and win!

357
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,790
Rest assured.

358
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,910
You'll be

359
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,840
handsomely rewarded.

360
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,360
(What if I fail?)

361
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,960
You may leave.

362
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,070
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,150
(Could it be...?)

364
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,710
(The Evil Hand escaped
after the Sangbo Explosion.)

365
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,550
(Then Supervisor said he was sick.)

366
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,270
(Later, in Yunzhou...)

367
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,750
Supervisor borrowed you from me

368
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,600
to deal with the Dharma.

369
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,600
(Letting the Evil Hand in my body that day)

370
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,270
(is to have me break the Dharma.)

371
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,840
Mr. Xu!

372
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,400
Not that way.

373
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,440
Xu Qi'an.

374
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,870
Lord Wei.

375
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,230
Did you hear what I just said?

376
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,440
I know Supervisor chose me,

377
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,360
but it's beyond my ability

378
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,550
to break the Dharma.

379
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,150
Lord Wei,

380
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,160
can you persuade His Majesty

381
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,750
to choose someone else?

382
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
He's made his decision.

383
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,920
I'm afraid

384
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,990
there's no room for change.

385
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,880
Never mind. It's too much to ask.

386
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,120
Why did Supervisor choose me?

387
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,470
If I lose the duel,

388
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,400
His Majesty will punish me for sure.

389
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,840
Lord Wei, I'm afraid I can't serve you

390
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,750
in the future.

391
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,880
Rest assured.

392
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:04,310
You'll be punished even if you win.

393
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,070
His Majesty has never liked you.

394
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,030
Don't worry too much, though.

395
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,030
What do you mean?

396
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,840
Tianyu is being aggressive.

397
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,400
If we lost the duel,

398
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,200
it'd bring shame on the Dafeng.

399
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,030
Supervisor chose you by name.

400
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,680
He didn't randomly recommend you
to His Majesty.

401
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,470
I know,

402
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,750
currently,

403
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,030
it's hard for you to break it,

404
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,920
but Supervisor chose you

405
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,920
for a reason.

406
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,680
(I was right.)

407
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,510
(It's likely that he chose me)

408
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,640
(because I had Shen Shu inside.)

409
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,840
(But Lord Wei doesn't know that.)

410
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,510
You're right, Lord Wei.

411
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,160
I'm sure he'll help me break the Dharma.

412
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,310
That way, the Dafeng's image remains intact,

413
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,680
and it won't be beneath him.

414
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,550
I'm not sure what exactly he's up to,

415
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,840
but that old geezer

416
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,680
knows all.

417
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,550
His actions are unpredictable.

418
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,440
No one knows what's on his mind.

419
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,600
Do you?

420
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,600
If even you couldn't read his mind,

421
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,680
how could I?

422
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,480
Alright.

423
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,640
Don't think too much.

424
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,200
At this point,

425
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,160
just play by ear.

426
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,440
Look,

427
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,920
the Tianyu Dharma

428
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,070
consists of eight variations.

429
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,120
Here are the records

430
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,790
of the others that appeared before.

431
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,750
The one we see now

432
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,640
(Qi Dharma)
is called Furious Vajra Dharma.

433
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,750
No one has seen it

434
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,070
or recorded it before.

435
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,350
But

436
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,120
they're all the same.

437
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,270
A Dharma is a formation.

438
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,640
A formation has weak spots.

439
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,440
Use them to break the formation,

440
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,440
not brute force.

441
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,440
Understand?

442
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,760
Yes.

443
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,910
Alright.

444
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,400
Go home

445
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,120
and study these records carefully.

446
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,790
It's nothing different from what I found

447
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,790
at the Academy.

448
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,550
There are no specific solutions.

449
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,710
Is this duel dangerous?

450
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,150
Well...

451
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Don't worry.

452
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,710
Lord Wei said

453
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,960
since Supervisor recommended me,

454
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,880
he'd have my back and assist me.

455
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,600
Besides, Lord Wei values me.

456
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,400
He'd never put me in harm's way.

457
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,920
I won't be in danger.

458
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,920
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

459
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,030
With Supervisor's help,

460
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,600
breaking that Dharma is as easy as winking.

461
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,910
Ningyan,

462
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,120
once you succeed,

463
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
you'll be the Dafeng's hero.

464
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,070
His Majesty will reward you!

465
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,310
Big rewards!

466
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,440
Rewards?

467
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,550
Big rewards?

468
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,400
Isn't it as good as a windfall?

469
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,360
Of course.

470
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,070
Can we go to

471
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,790
the infield to see it?

472
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,710
A windfall?

473
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,790
I want to see it, too!

474
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,870
Ningyan...

475
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,880
The infield.

476
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,880
Sure, I guess.

477
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,960
Very well then.

478
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,990
Choose the best seats for us,

479
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,400
preferably in the front rows.

480
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,940
Or we can't see the details clearly,

481
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,230
such as your moves and expressions.

482
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,440
Ningyan will win honor for the Xu Clan.

483
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,470
Yes.

484
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,280
Lingyue,

485
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,680
let's go

486
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,960
pick up new clothes

487
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,990
this afternoon!

488
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,440
Great!

489
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,310
What color do you like?

490
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,550
(It's a huge event.)

491
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,640
(All the grandees in town will be there,)

492
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,200
(especially...)

493
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,960
Mother, may I join you?

494
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,270
Sure. We'll all go there.

495
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,600
- Alright.
- You too.

496
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
Join us.

497
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,400
Ningyan, where are you going?

498
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,960
I'm going to

499
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,840
practice my saber skills.

500
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,640
I need to practice.

501
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,840
Tell me if your saber needs to be sharpened.

502
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,990
Xu Qi'an, what are you doing?

503
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,070
Do you think

504
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,600
he'll come, Master?

505
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,270
From what I know of him,

506
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,750
he's not that bold.

507
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,550
Perfect timing.

508
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,550
Master happens to be free today.

509
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,200
Why do you need to see him?

510
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,760
Nothing serious.

511
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,790
I have some questions about alchemy.

512
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,840
Senior Caiwei.

513
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,550
It's empty.

514
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,470
- Throw it.
- Sure.

515
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,310
Thanks.

516
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:39,830
Over here.

517
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,030
I'm afraid you're wrong this time.

518
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,680
Master, Xu Qi'an would like to see you.

519
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,070
With all due respect,

520
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,230
I have

521
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,510
never been wrong.

522
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,360
Where are you going, Xu Qi'an?

523
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,400
You're wise, indeed.

524
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,200
He'll rise to fame after this duel.

525
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,750
Of course.

526
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,640
But

527
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,920
given his personality,

528
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,070
weren't you afraid

529
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,750
he wouldn't like the path you chose for him?

530
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,230
"Leave tomorrow's worry for tomorrow."

531
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,280
Then

532
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,310
what about today?

533
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,270
"Drink today's wine

534
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,790
today."

535
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,640
(If Supervisor knew Shen Shu was in me,)

536
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,920
(I'd get nothing from him.)

537
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,120
(If he didn't know,)

538
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,360
(I'd be the one telling him.)

539
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,840
(What to do?)

540
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,200
We've checked this street.

541
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,710
There's no sign of him.

542
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,160
What should we do?

543
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,230
I remember it's somewhere around here.

544
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,440
Hadn't you told me the wrong way,

545
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,840
I wouldn't have gone to Xu's old house.

546
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,750
Without me,

547
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,790
you wouldn't have seen Mr. Xu.

548
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,040
You...

549
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,510
Your Highness?

550
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,920
It really is you!

551
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,550
What brings you here?

552
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
Your Highness,

553
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,680
these are...

554
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,680
Hearing that you'll represent us
to fight the Dharma,

555
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,200
I'm concerned about you,

556
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,070
and I should help you as your master.

557
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,310
It's too kind of you.

558
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,680
So

559
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
are you confident

560
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:06,230
of winning?

561
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,400
It at least owns the power of the 3rd Rank,

562
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,550
while I'm a mere Silver Gong

563
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,150
caught unprepared.

564
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,360
What do you think, Your Highness?

565
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,800
I trust you.

566
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,400
You are Xu Qi'an,

567
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,320
the youngest Silver Gong Guardian ever

568
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,670
and my best guest adviser.

569
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,630
You've battled injustice and evil and won.

570
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,320
You've kept surprising us

571
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,840
and never let us down.

572
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,840
In all of the Dafeng, is there anyone

573
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,240
better than you to fight this duel?

574
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,280
So,

575
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,240
now,

576
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,880
relax and be at your best.

577
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,670
Also, think about what reward you want

578
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,920
for crushing that Dharma.

579
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,640
Uh...

580
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
reward?

581
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,360
Your Highness,

582
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,760
isn't it too soon to consider that?

583
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,280
One can dream.

584
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,920
Have you never had dreams?

585
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,070
To be honest,

586
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,920
I thought to myself in private

587
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,920
that if I won by luck,

588
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:25,960
I'd ask His Majesty for a Pardon Token.

589
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,760
Don't be silly!

590
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,840
A Pardon Token can only save you once.

591
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,800
If

592
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,150
someone keeps setting you up,

593
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,400
that token will be useless.

594
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,240
It can't save you forever.

595
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
You'll be killed eventually.

596
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,840
Such things have never

597
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,400
stopped throughout history.

598
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,630
As a member of royalty,

599
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,030
I've seen enough of them.

600
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,470
So

601
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,510
what do you suggest?

602
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
What you need

603
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,840
isn't a Pardon Token

604
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,800
but status.

605
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,440
Think about it.

606
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,280
With a high status,

607
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,550
you'll gain connections.

608
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
With connections,

609
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,760
you'll know more members of the nobility.

610
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,550
When you're in trouble,

611
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,960
only those people

612
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,030
can save your life.

613
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,800
If,

614
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,960
I mean if

615
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:30,150
you get to know royalty,

616
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,320
and if some blind noble girl

617
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,720
falls for you...

618
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,070
What I'm saying is

619
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,070
if you become one of the imperial family,

620
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,920
no one can threaten you.

621
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,550
You'll enjoy all the glory and wealth

622
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,990
and the masses' respect.

623
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,400
In a word,

624
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,440
a noble status can be of great help,

625
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,400
such as a rank of nobility.

626
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,920
Do you understand?

627
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,280
I do.

628
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,960
I appreciate your advice

629
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,440
and thoughtfulness.

630
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,360
Are you sure you know?

631
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,280
Absolutely.

632
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,580
(Xu Mansion)

633
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,630
Just now, did I talk too much

634
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,240
and look a bit pushy?

635
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,960
Yes, a little bit.

636
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,470
You're a princess after all.

637
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,070
Mr. Xu should be honored

638
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,190
that you came in person to visit him.

639
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,960
Be that as it may,

640
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,510
had I been less straightforward,

641
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,440
that bonehead wouldn't have understood.

642
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,070
That's also true.

643
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,200
Do you think

644
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,670
he'll defeat Tianyu?

645
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,880
Don't worry, Princess.

646
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,280
Mr. Xu has seen your point.

647
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,720
He'll win at all costs.

648
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,160
The Astronomical Bureau

649
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,880
will fight a duel against Tianyu!

650
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,550
Read the imperial notice on the notice board!

651
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,550
(Notice)

652
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:32,760
"Tianyu is challenging the Bureau to a duel.

653
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,280
Silver Gong Xu Qi'an
will represent the Dafeng

654
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,550
to battle the Dharma.

655
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,470
The duel between the two sides

656
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,110
will begin in three days

657
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,510
in the square of the Star Tower.

658
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,350
Civilians are

659
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,840
welcome to go and watch it."

660
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,150
Great!

661
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,990
Finally, someone's stepped up!

662
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,070
This is great!

663
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,630
Guys, listen,

664
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,070
the Bureau and Tianyu

665
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,110
will fight a duel in three days.

666
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,550
Silver Gong Xu Qi'an will battle the Dharma!

667
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,320
It'll be grand.

668
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,030
Let's go and watch it together.

669
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,670
Yes, we'll all go.

670
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,800
See you in three days.

671
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,360
Why choose a mere Silver Gong?

672
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,920
He's quite capable.

673
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,960
He single-handedly

674
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,070
destroyed The Witcher's Sect's scheme.

675
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,720
I also heard he'd break the Dharma.

676
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,110
That'll humiliate Tianyu for sure.

677
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,470
- Great.
- Cheers!

678
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,430
Excuse me.

679
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,800
Welcome.

680
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:33,990
As usual.

681
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,950
A pot of...

682
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,200
Half a pot of wine.

683
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,400
Half a roast chicken.

684
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,600
Uh...

685
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,240
This way, please.

686
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
I'm really sorry, Miss.

687
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,190
Other tables have been taken.

688
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,070
You two can share a table.

689
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,670
He ordered the same as you.

690
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,880
Half a roast chicken.

691
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,840
Half a pot of wine.

692
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,470
Together, it's a full set.

693
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,950
Sure.

694
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,990
Sir...

695
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,070
Had you been killed,

696
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,320
that would've spared me trouble.

697
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,510
Stop being so mean.

698
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,240
Do you know each other?

699
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,440
What a nice surprise!

700
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,800
Here's your wine.

701
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,640
Please enjoy.

702
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,400
Stop eating and drinking!

703
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,960
That duel will begin at the Star Tower!

704
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,030
Go and look!

705
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,720
- Let's go!
- Break the Dharma?

706
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,670
Come on. Let's go.

707
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Xu Qi'an?

708
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,150
Isn't the duel in three days?

709
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Mr. Xu?

710
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,440
Is that him?

711
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,800
I'm Yang Qianhuan.

712
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,800
Holding the sun and moon,
I pluck the stars...

713
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,980
Whatever!

714
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,650
Break it! Come on!

715
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,320
It's behind you!

716
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,400
I know.

717
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,320
Senior Yang,

718
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,530
get down now!

719
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,880
Supervisor ordered you to go back!

720
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,720
Did you forget

721
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,670
your energy ran backward? Remember?

722
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,510
Nonsense!

723
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,550
Master is getting in my way to fame.

724
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,920
Supervisor said

725
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,880
you should stay out of this.

726
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,920
Go back and tell him

727
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:12,950
it's time

728
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,960
for me, Yang Qianhuan, to soar up,

729
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,030
make a name for myself,

730
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,150
reach the heavens,

731
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,400
change everything,

732
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,840
break all by force!

733
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,470
Reach the heavens,

734
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,510
change everything,

735
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,070
flash and dash!

736
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
