Today

41
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,270
is the 25th.

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,470
The Grand Princess will go study
at the Astronomical Bureau.

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,830
With Xu Qi'an,

44
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,030
I won't have to go
to the Bureau anymore.

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,880
Your Highness.

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,880
- Your Highness.
- This way.

47
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,800
Your Highness.

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,670
What is it?

49
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,110
Calm down before you speak.

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,440
Xu Qi'an

51
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,040
went to the Bureau.

52
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,040
What?

53
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,710
(Today, Huaiqing will go study
at the Bureau.)

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,800
(If they meet, my lie will be exposed.)

55
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,080
Do I always cause such a big scene
when I come here?

56
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,430
Senior Song,

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,150
if this happens again next time,

58
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,920
we should meet somewhere else.

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,670
I usually keep a low profile.

60
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,640
It's not about you.

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
The Grand Princess is coming.

62
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,320
Perfect.

63
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,240
I can meet the Grand Princess

64
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,080
and catch up.

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,040
You know the Grand Princess?

66
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,240
We have some acquaintance.

67
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,480
I've roughly understood this mirror.

68
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,920
It hides a mysterious
and complex formation.

69
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,960
Especially this broken jade piece.

70
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
From what I see,

71
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,270
it is the work of the Earth Sect.

72
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,270
The Earth Sect?

73
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,920
The Earth Sect was once famous,

74
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,550
but it disappeared

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,040
over a decade ago.

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,710
Yah!

77
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,240
Yah!

78
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,000
Yah!

79
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,320
Huaqing.

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,570
Huaiqinig.

81
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,540
I...

82
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,700
I have something important
to tell you.

83
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,820
Say it.

84
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,260
The weather is so nice today.

85
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,940
Let's go boating.

86
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,460
Huaiqing.

87
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,500
Well.

88
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,180
The Sangbo Pageant is in a few days.

89
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,420
Our ceremonial attire
must be ready by now.

90
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,460
Let's go back to the Palace to check.

91
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,700
I dreamed last night

92
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,100
that the Bureau exploded.

93
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,380
I think we shouldn't go in.

94
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,460
Here we go again.

95
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,500
Fine.

96
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,900
Carry her to the Bureau

97
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,300
and have the physicians

98
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,540
check her properly.

99
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

100
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,020
(I can't go in.)

101
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,380
(I can't go in.)

102
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,460
(Xu Qi'an is in the Bureau.)

103
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,580
Princess Lin'an,

104
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,100
she seems stiff now.

105
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,060
Have two more people come to help.

106
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,340
(Xu Residence)

107
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,100
This mirror is yours. I can't claim it.

108
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,820
So, I can't delve deeper
into its mysteries.

109
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,020
Claim it?

110
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,140
Once you claim it,

111
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,540
you can enter the mirror

112
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,820
and explore.

113
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,100
(No. 7, No. 6)

114
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,460
(No. 7, No. 8)

115
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,820

116
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,020
(No. 2)

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,260
(No. 1)

118
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,940
(No. 7)

119
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,140
(No. 2, No. 3)

120
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,020
(No. 8)
No. 1.

121
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,900
No. 2.

122
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,260
No. 4.

123
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,220
No. 5.

124
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,340
(No. 2, No. 4)

125
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,180
Where is No. 3?

126
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,860
Am I No. 3?

127
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,300
Senior,

128
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,220
where are you?

129
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,620
(No. 9)

130
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,700
Answer me.

131
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,300
(No. 2, No. 3)

132
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,100
You're not Jinlian.

133
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,380
Where is Jinlian?

134
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,060
Is Jinlian alive?

135
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,140
How did you get this mirror?

136
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,940
Are you with the Realm Sect?

137
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,140
(Realm Sect?)

138
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,500
(Jinlian?)

139
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,140
(He must be the old man
who gave me the mirror.)

140
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,700
(This No. 9)

141
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,940
(calls him Senior.)

142
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,500
(No. 3)
(Could they)

143
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,220
(share a master?)

144
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,820
I'm not with the Realm Sect.

145
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,500
An old man gave me this mirror.

146
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
How can you prove
you're not with the Realm Sect?

147
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,220
State your name.

148
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,460
I'm just a nobody.

149
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
(No. 6)
I am Zilian of the Earth Sect.

150
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,300
Not long ago,

151
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,500
I received a distress signal
from Senior Jinlian.

152
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,460
I learned he arrived
in the Dafeng's capital.

153
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,220
Only in the capital

154
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,420
could he escape
the Realm Sect's pursuit.

155
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,340
But when I arrived in the capital,

156
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,340
I lost contact with him.

157
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,700
He must be in grave danger,

158
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,980
which is why he gave you this mirror

159
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,860
to avoid their pursuit.

160
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,220
What do you mean?

161
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,660
Why give up the Jade Mirror?

162
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,580
Can the Realm Sect track its location?

163
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,540
Exactly.

164
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,620
(No. 2, No. 3)
Senior entrusted this mirror to you,

165
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,420
hoping you could divert disaster for him

166
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,660
and face the Realm Sect's wolves.

167
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,060
(So, he's dumping this mess on me?)

168
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,980
(I'm just a Speed.)

169
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,340
(No, no.)

170
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,660
(I'm just a small Guardian.)

171
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,860
I think

172
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,460
it's best for you not to get involved.

173
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,740
Can you return the mirror to me?

174
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,340
I will reward you handsomely.

175
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,420
Fine. How should I return it?

176
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,620
(No. 9)
I'm in the capital.

177
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,380
We can trade anytime.

178
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,340
What do you want?

179
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,500
There's no need to be polite.

180
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,140
Well.

181
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,100
This mirror belongs to you,
so it's my duty to return it.

182
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,260
However,

183
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,740
at the time, your senior

184
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,580
told me this was a supreme treasure.

185
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,380
He sold it to me for 500 liang of gold.

186
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,300
I'm not asking for money,

187
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,300
but

188
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,820
since the treasure is being returned,

189
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,340
the gold should also be returned.

190
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,340
Wouldn't you agree?

191
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,500
It's an equivalent exchange.

192
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,140
Fine.

193
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,060
At dusk,

194
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,580
I'll be waiting for you

195
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,580
at the Harmony Room of Moon Resto

196
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,340
in the north of the city.

197
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,780
(No. 9)

198
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,540
Oh, no.

199
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,780
I'm losing out.

200
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,180
He agreed so easily.

201
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,140
I should've asked for 1,000 liang.

202
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,660
(No. 6)
No. 3, don't trust No. 9.

203
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,260
Don't respond.

204
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,700
Don't respond.

205
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,580
Don't respond.

206
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,300
Yan,

207
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,660
I have something urgent to report.

208
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,500
Speak.

209
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,660
Today, you...

210
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,140
I know I look ugly today.

211
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,260
No, just not as free-spirited as usual.

212
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,820
That's still thanks to you.

213
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,060
What does it have to do with me?

214
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,020
Stop with the nonsense.

215
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,100
Tell me what you have to say.

216
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,500
What is this?

217
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,780
It looks like it contains another world.

218
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,460
This is the Jade Mirror,

219
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,740
a treasure of the Earth Sect.

220
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,660
The Earth Sect?

221
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,860
Are you sure it's the Earth Sect?

222
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,220
Absolutely.

223
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,420
This is serious.

224
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,700
Follow me to see Lord Wei.

225
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,300
See Lord Wei?

226
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,820
Remember.

227
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,300
Keep your words concise and truthful.

228
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,180
Don't hide anything.

229
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,780
Understood.

230
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,660
Subordinate Yang Yan.

231
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,100
Subordinate Xu Qi'an.

232
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,860
We have to report to Lord Wei.

233
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,700
He's a mere Copper Gong.

234
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,900
How can he meet with Lord Wei?

235
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,900
This is significant.

236
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,620
He is the direct reporter.

237
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,780
Let him in.

238
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,100
Lord Wei,

239
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,340
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an has to report.

240
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,020
Speak.

241
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,860
Lord Wei,

242
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,300
this mirror pertains to the Earth Sect.

243
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,580
Please inspect it.

244
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,060
The Earth Sect?

245
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,500
Where did it come from?

246
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,020
Your Highness.

247
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,780
Your Highness, what's wrong?

248
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,220
Call the imperial physician!

249
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,540
No need for imperial physicians.

250
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,060
The Bureau's physicians
nearly killed me.

251
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,740
You went to the Bureau?

252
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,140
Earlier, Huaiqing and I

253
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,900
argued at the Bureau's entrance
for an hour.

254
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,900
I got exhausted

255
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,060
and was carried into the Bureau.

256
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,100
You have no idea.

257
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,660
As soon as I entered,

258
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,260
Huaiqing summoned physicians

259
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,060
to transfer energy to me.

260
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,980
Princess Huaiqing

261
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,300
called physicians for you?

262
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,220
I think she did it on purpose
to get back at me.

263
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,780
As soon as I entered,

264
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,700
those physicians tormented me for hours

265
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,500
before I escaped.

266
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,500
Your Highness, you've had a hard time.

267
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,340
Fortunately,

268
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,660
pretending to be Huaiqing
wasn't exposed.

269
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,140
It wasn't exposed?

270
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,620
Xu Qi'an wasn't at the Bureau.

271
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,820
He wasn't there?

272
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,740
Then wasn't this trip

273
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,100
a waste of your effort?

274
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,300
Slow down.

275
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,900
She's been acting strange lately.

276
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,220
Have someone keep an eye on her.

277
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,340
Yes.

278
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,420
(Haoqi Tower)

279
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,420
(It really is him.)

280
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,580
Five hundred liang of gold?

281
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,020
I was merely seeking

282
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,100
reasonable profit.

283
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,180
You didn't expose your identity.

284
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,700
Well done.

285
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,500
Thanks to the teachings
of the Guardian Yamen.

286
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,380
Since that's the case,

287
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,900
why not proceed with the trade?

288
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,740
This concerns the Earth Sect.

289
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,980
Their sudden appearance
in our Dafeng capital

290
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,180
might bring harm.

291
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,660
After careful thought,

292
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,020
personal gain is insignificant

293
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,500
compared to the Dafeng's safety.

294
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,220
So, I decided to report this matter.

295
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,340
Are you courting death?

296
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,940
Do not hide anything from Lord Wei.

297
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,700
Lord Wei, sorry.

298
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,020
In truth,

299
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,940
I was afraid of dying.

300
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,340
Speak.

301
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,980
I planned to trade with him
at Moon Resto.

302
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,620
Who knew...

303
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,060
(No. 6)
Who are you?

304
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,780
Why do you say No. 9 cannot be trusted?

305
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,020
Are you with the Realm Sect?

306
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,140
Yes.

307
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,580
Why do you claim No. 9 is insane?

308
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,260
No. 9 belongs to the Earth Sect.

309
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,980
They are a group of ruthless
and violent lunatics.

310
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,900
If you believe him,

311
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,580
your life will be in danger.

312
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,100
But No. 9 just said you're the lunatics.

313
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,340
Well...

314
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,820
He's lying to you.

315
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,380
How do I know you're not lying to me?

316
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,740
Besides,
why didn't you confront him earlier

317
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,220
when he was here?

318
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,940
(No. 3)
The No. 3 Mirror

319
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,180
was sealed by the Earth Sect,

320
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,620
cutting off our connection.

321
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,380
I used a secret technique

322
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,540
to contact you
when he wasn't paying attention.

323
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,820
My time is limited.

324
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,140
You should stay out of this mess.

325
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,060
If you return the Jade Mirror

326
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,380
to the Realm Sect,

327
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,060
I will do my best

328
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,260
to protect your life.

329
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,020
What do you mean

330
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,420
by "protect my life"?

331
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,860
(No. 3)
I've told you.

332
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,860
No. 9 is ruthless and violent.

333
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,420
Now that you know where he'll be,

334
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,980
he won't let you live.

335
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,220
Then I simply won't trade with him.

336
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,340
What can he do to me?

337
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,780
The Earth Sect

338
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,540
can use the Jade Mirror

339
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,260
to track your location.

340
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,780
Then I'll just throw the mirror away.

341
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,100
You...

342
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,980
The weapon has bonded with you.

343
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,860
Even if you discard it, the Earth Sect

344
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,380
can still find you and silence you.

345
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,660
So, you thought of us.

346
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,540
It concerns the Earth Sect,

347
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,460
so the Guardians would be interested.

348
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,940
If you asked for Lord Wei's help
to deal with them,

349
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,180
on one hand,

350
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,460
you'd ensure your safety.

351
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,900
On the other hand,

352
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,460
you'd gain credit for reporting it.

353
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,220
This is quite a clever deal.

354
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,380
I was merely seeking

355
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,220
reasonable profit.

356
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,580
Shameless.

357
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,100
Yang Yan.

358
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,820
Yes.

359
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,420
Go check

360
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,260
while there's daylight.

361
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,220
Yes.

362
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,140
(Zilian, Earth Sect,
4th Rank Yin Spirit)

363
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,460
Leader, I have fulfilled the mission.

364
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,220
You've brought back an enemy.

365
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,860
(Tea House)

366
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,460
Yang Yan.

367
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,260
Cyan Wei's hound.

368
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,660
Stay out of this.

369
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,980
What if I must interfere?

370
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,620
Then don't blame me
for being ruthless.

371
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,140
Xu Qi'an.

372
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,020
What are you still doing here?

373
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,860
Get out.

374
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,860
I feel this room is a bit chilly.

375
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,100
Let me tend to the brazier
before leaving.

376
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,780
No need. Put it down; I'll do it.

377
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,620
No, no.

378
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,020
Such menial tasks

379
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,060
should be left to me.

380
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,900
Let me.

381
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,380
Truly a natural fire-tender.

382
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,660
You flatter me.

383
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,820
Ghosts Formation.

384
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,260
My Ghosts Formation

385
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,540
ensures an easy entrance
but an impossible exit.

386
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
Even as a 4th Rank Fighter,

387
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,020
you'll be drained to death inside.

388
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,060
The Guardians

389
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,780
are still mediocre.

390
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,980
The Guardians.

391
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,420
Gold Gong.

392
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,620
This

393
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,220
feels much better.

394
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,860
You have copper skin and iron bones.

395
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,100
Why not fight back?

396
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,780
I'm waiting

397
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,260
for my spear.

398
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Here it comes.

399
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,060
Alright. Adjust it.

400
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,060
Come back.

401
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,220
Good.

402
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,220
Good.

403
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,940
Lord Wei.

404
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,060
These two are my colleagues
from Breeze Hall.

405
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,660
Copper Gong Song Tingfeng.

406
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,500
I am.

407
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,980
Copper Gong Zhu Guangxiao.

408
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,820
I am.

409
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,940
- Greetings, Lord Wei.
- Greetings, Lord Wei.

410
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,420
Thank you both for your efforts.

411
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,500
It's nothing.

412
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,460
We shall take our leave.

413
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,940
Go ahead.

414
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:11,860
Lord Wei,

415
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,100
I love tea.

416
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,340
In my leisure time,

417
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,940
I crafted this tea table.

418
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,260
Today, I present it for your appraisal.

419
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,740
What is unique

420
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,260
about this tea table?

421
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,300
This tea table is crafted
from Xuantian marble.

422
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,420
It combines squares and circles,

423
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,740
and it's understated yet luxurious.

424
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,900
It's carved with pine trees,

425
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,100
with space below for bonsai or incense.

426
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,900
It emphasizes an elegant atmosphere.

427
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,580
A stove is placed below,

428
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,020
allowing tea

429
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,060
to be brewed on top.

430
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,060
This small mechanism

431
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,140
was inspired

432
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,540
by techniques from the Bureau.

433
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,340
What use is this?

434
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,100
You still have to pour water
to brew tea.

435
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Not quite.

436
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,020
Lord Wei.

437
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,100
Please press here lightly.

438
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,980
With this,

439
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,620
even if you're reading,

440
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,460
you can conveniently brew tea.

441
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,860
Isn't that quick and practical?

442
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,220
These are Fangshan Dew Bud,

443
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,220
Junshan Yinzhen,

444
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,620
Taiping Houkui,

445
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,500
and Dafeng Xiaoqinggan.

446
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,660
All are rare treasures.

447
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,020
I collected them

448
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,220
over some time.

449
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,540
Good.

450
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,300
Here are tea snacks prepared for you.

451
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,180
(The first rule of being a worker:)

452
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,140
(Understand the needs
of leaders and clients,)

453
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,580
(and appeal to their preferences.)

454
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,060
It does have some thoughtful design.

455
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,100
Hence, I named it

456
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,380
the Kung Fu Tea Table.

457
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,020
Good.

458
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,740
Experts from the Earth Sect

459
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,140
truly are formidable.

460
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,900
The tea aroma is strong,

461
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,540
delicate, intense,

462
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,300
and smooth,

463
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,140
with a lingering aftertaste.

464
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,460
Lord Wei,

465
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,020
where did this tea come from?

466
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,460
By comparison,

467
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,820
the teas I brought today

468
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,340
truly pale in comparison.

469
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,540
If you like it,

470
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,060
I'll have Rou pack some

471
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,860
for you to take back.

472
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,740
Thank you, Lord Wei.

473
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,060
How about this?

474
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,500
Let this tea table serve
as a token of gratitude

475
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,580
for Lord Wei.

476
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,540
Lord Wei wouldn't care
for your shabby thing.

477
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,620
Not so.

478
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,300
Ordinary people
may not recognize its value,

479
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,060
but to true tea connoisseurs,

480
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,420
it's like a treasured saber that shines

481
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,500
when it finds a worthy master.

482
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,020
This tea table,
placed in Lord Wei's tea room,

483
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,300
would truly shine.

484
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,660
Marvelous.

485
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,500
Rou,

486
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,500
fetch some tea leaves.

487
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,020
Yes, Lord Wei.

488
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,180
You're injured.

489
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,940
Lord Wei, I'm back.

490
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,860
It's a wound from a Yin Spirit,

491
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,980
nothing serious.

492
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,180
Sorry for my incompetence.

493
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,700
I failed to capture the culprit.

494
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,140
The Earth Sect's Yin Spirits
are formless and shadowless.

495
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,660
It's not your fault.

496
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,780
The person who contacted you first

497
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,100
was indeed from the Earth Sect

498
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,860
and did want to kill you.

499
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,180
But I've driven him off.

500
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,100
You'll be safe for now.

501
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,980
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

502
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,660
For the coming days,

503
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,420
post some Guardians covert sentries
near the Xu Residence.

504
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,660
Understood.

505
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,140
Since the mirror has bonded with you,

506
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,660
you shall keep it for now.

507
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Thank you, Lord Wei.

508
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,180
Lord Wei,

509
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,940
the culprit is injured.

510
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,140
Please allow me
to gather my Silver Gongs

511
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,740
to search the capital.

512
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,340
I'm certain we can apprehend them.

513
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,980
No need.

514
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,660
Others will handle it.

515
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,020
Junior.

516
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,180
I hope you've been well.

517
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,980
Senior.

518
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,740
- Elder Xu!
- Elder Xu!

519
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,540
Elder Xu, you're finally out.

520
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,420
Both of you are older than me.

521
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,660
Is it okay to call me that?

522
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,980
Not at all.
The capable one is the elder.

523
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Thanks to you,
we got to witness Lord Wei's grandeur.

524
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,020
Rest assured,

525
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,020
we won't forget this favor.

526
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,500
If you need anything,
just let us know.

527
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,660
Tell us.

528
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,940
How did you get into the Haoqi Tower?

529
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,780
In fact, it was simple.

530
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,900
Xu Qi'an.

531
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,020
When did you get here?

532
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,100
Why didn't anyone inform me?

533
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,180
Well.

534
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,460
Ningyan...

535
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,420
Were you just in the Haoqi Tower?

536
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,740
Me?

537
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,780
Of course not.

538
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,740
I wasn't.

539
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,980
I just

540
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,260
happened to pass by

541
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,500
and had an upset stomach.

542
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,980
So, I used the restroom.

543
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,300
You

544
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,980
used the restroom

545
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,700
in the Haoqi Tower?

546
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,580
Not only that,

547
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,540
but he also sat with Lord Wei,

548
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,940
enjoying tea and chatting merrily.

549
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,980
Mr. Nangong.

550
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,260
Li Yuchun,

551
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,660
your subordinate is clever
and resourceful.

552
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,580
He's only been here a few days,

553
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,980
yet he's formed a deep bond
with Lord Wei.

554
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,500
How about this?

555
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,420
Why don't you move Breeze Hall
into the Haoqi Tower?

556
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,100
That way,
Gold Gongs and Silver Gongs

557
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,780
won't need to overstep
by delivering messages for you.

558
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,220
That's just troublesome.

559
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,620
Keep up the good work.

560
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,860
Forget the Guardian system

561
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,340
or the Breeze Hall.

562
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,940
As long as Lord Wei favors you,

563
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,100
what can we do about it?

564
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,020
So sarcastic.

565
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,220
Chief.

566
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:15,740
Chief.

567
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,300
You must've noticed.

568
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,340
He's doing it on purpose.

569
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,020
Good.

570
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,220
Good.

571
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,580
This is tea from Lord Wei.

572
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,060
It's from Lord Wei.

573
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,860
It's expensive.

574
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,460
If the files aren't sorted out today,

575
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,060
none of you can go home.

576
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,500
Mr. Xu, let me.

577
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Don't tire yourself out.

578
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,620
Come on, let me.

579
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,060
You just have a seat.

580
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,260
We'll handle it.

581
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,220
Ignore the files. Come on.

582
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,380
This way.

583
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,460
The capable one is the elder.

584
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Relax.

585
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,540
- Elder Xu.
- My elbow.

586
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,580
Five hundred fifty-three.

587
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,220
- How many tonics did she consume?
- 555.

588
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,780
- How much vital energy was infused?
- 556.

589
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,420
Xuan!

590
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,140
Useless fool.

591
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,100
Gang.

592
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,260
Catch this.

593
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,980
Is it too late for me to fall now?

594
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,860
Your Highness.

595
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,740
I truly can't go on.

596
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,260
Look at everyone.

597
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,100
They're all spent.

598
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,060
Your Highness,
how does your body feel now?

599
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,660
I feel

600
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,540
it's as if there's a blazing fire

601
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,820
surging in my chest.

602
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,620
It's roaring and unstoppable.

603
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,060
I'm brimming with boundless energy.

604
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,900
No, no.

605
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,260
Your Highness.

606
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,580
These days,

607
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,420
to avoid Xu Qi'an
from discovering anything amiss,

608
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,060
we've been waking early
and resting late,

609
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,020
rushing around constantly.

610
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,820
Besides, the ordeal at the Bureau today

611
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,620
was utterly nerve-wracking.

612
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,580
Your medication is long-acting,

613
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,660
but the entire Shaoyin Palace

614
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,740
is extremely exhausted.

615
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,740
I know you're all working hard.

616
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:38,620
I'm tired too.

617
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,620
Pretending to be Huaiqing these days,

618
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,180
I even find her a bit cute

619
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,900
after meeting her today.

620
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,420
But the poetry contest is still far off,

621
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
and giving up now

622
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,420
is not an option.

623
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,620
Come on, let's keep going.

624
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,660
Everyone, come on.

625
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,180
Your Highness!

626
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,620
Even so,

627
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,420
if we keep this up,

628
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,180
we might not even make it
to the poetry contest.

629
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,180
Besides,

630
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,580
we've had enough poems.

631
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,860
Why not just

632
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,900
let him go?

633
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,220
No.

634
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,700
If he helped us win this time,

635
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,540
what about next time?

636
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,740
And the time after that?

637
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,740
If Xu Qi'an ends up
siding with Huaiqing again

638
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,340
and writing great poems for her,

639
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,100
won't we just get overshadowed again?

640
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,900
All our efforts would've been
for nothing.

641
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,300
So, Your Highness, are you saying...?

642
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,140
I'm saying

643
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,540
we need to think of a way.

644
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,220
If we're going to act,

645
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,820
we should put an end to it.

646
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,300
Gang,

647
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,540
with your kind face,

648
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,180
how can you

649
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,820
have such a vicious heart?

650
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,820
- No, Your Highness...
- What I meant was

651
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,180
we should recruit him completely.

652
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,140
That way,
even if he discovers my true identity,

653
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,740
he'll still be loyal to me.

654
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,980
But

655
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,460
he's utterly devoted
to the Grand Princess.

656
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,380
So what?

657
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,340
Where there's a will, there's a way.

658
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,740
Everyone

659
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,940
has their weaknesses.

660
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,220
Come, let's continue.

661
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,820
No, no.

662
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,500
Are you mimicking me?

663
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,100
Gang, I saw it!

664
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,660
Where there's a will, there's a way.

665
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,820
Hurry up! Hurry!

666
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,300
(Peace and Prosperity)

667
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,500
I'm exhausted.

668
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,820
At least,

669
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,980
I managed to pry
Lord Wei's preferences from Cijiu,

670
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,700
which allowed me to connect with him.

671
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,140
In the future,

672
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,220
both Lord Wei

673
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,140
and the Grand Princess will protect me.

674
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,660
I'll be untouchable

675
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,180
in the capital of the Dafeng.

676
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,220
(Jinlian, Earth Sect,
4th Rank Yin Spirit)

677
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,660
Calm down.

678
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,100
It's me.

679
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,700
When I last saw you
at the Pitch-pot Stall,

680
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,940
you were only a 9th Rank Fighter
at the Essence Stage.

681
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,500
Now, you've reached the Qi Stage.

682
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,700
You are truly blessed
with great fortune.

683
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,220
Old man,

684
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,180
did you break into my home

685
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,780
just to congratulate me?

686
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,220
I'm here

687
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,220
to tell you something.

688
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,860
The soul of my junior, Zilian,

689
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,540
has already ascended to heaven.

690
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,380
You no longer need to worry about him.

691
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,740
Wait.

692
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,060
Are you here
to take back the Jade Mirror?

693
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,980
That's the No. 9 Mirror my junior held.

694
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,660
I've already reclaimed it.

695
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,460
As for the one you have,

696
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,380
consider it a gift to invite you

697
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,220
to join the Realm Sect.

698
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,060
The Realm Sect?

699
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
The Jade Mirror was originally one.

700
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,020
I split it into nine pieces,

701
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,860
connected by secret techniques,

702
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,020
enabling communication between them.

703
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,580
I've gifted them
to seven different individuals,

704
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,980
forming the Realm Sect.

705
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,900
Now, with you,

706
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,980
the Sect is complete.

707
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:05,900
Old man,

708
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,300
you're overestimating me.

709
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,020
I'm just a rookie Copper Gong
who's just stepped into the Qi Stage.

710
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,420
No need to be modest.

711
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,420
I've said it before

712
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,300
you're someone blessed by fortune.

713
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,500
Please enlighten me.

714
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,380
I've always said

715
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,700
you're a person of great destiny.

716
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
That's why I picked you back then.

717
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,420
However, I can't figure out

718
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,860
the source of this fortune,
no matter how I try.

719
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
On that day, though,

720
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,540
the aura of the woman

721
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,860
in the carriage was extraordinary.

722
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,180
She was radiant yet restrained,

723
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,620
a rarity in the world.

724
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,060
If you give her a bracelet,

725
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,300
something will definitely happen
between you two.

726
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,020
So, why hesitate?

727
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,900
Rest assured.

728
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,940
Joining the Realm Sect

729
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,740
won't restrict your actions.

730
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,020
Among the eight people

731
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,500
of the Realm Sect, including you,

732
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,820
none are ordinary.

733
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,180
Though you're scattered
across the land now,

734
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,820
the day will come when you all meet.

735
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,020
Why not join early

736
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,780
to form bonds of camaraderie?

737
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,660
It can avoid future conflicts
that could lead

738
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,820
to death or injury.

739
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,100
(If what this old man says is true,)

740
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,340
(and every member of the Sect
is extraordinary,)

741
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,580
(then by mingling with this circle,)

742
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,660
(won't I easily break)

743
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,820
(into high-level social networks?)

744
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,300
Fine.

745
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,380
I agree to join the Realm Sect.

746
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,020
If you need help in the future,

747
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,980
feel free to use the Jade Mirror
to reach out to me

748
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,380
or to the other members.

749
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,380
If they happen to be in the capital,

750
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,220
they'll surely...

751
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,980
By the way,

752
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,700
mutual aid is

753
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,780
the foundation of the Realm Sect.

754
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,820
Additionally,

755
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,340
mirror holders are addressed
by their mirror numbers.

756
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,700
(No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4,
No. 5, No. 6, No. 7, No. 8).

757
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,620
Is anyone there?

758
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,140
(No. 6, No. 8)

759
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,260
What's wrong?

760
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,860
Contacts should've been restored.

761
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,260
(No. 4)
Everyone, contact has been restored.

762
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,420
No. 3,

763
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,020
I reached out to Taoist Jinlian

764
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,700
through the mirror

765
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,780
and learned the general situation.

766
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,020
Thank you for helping

767
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,180
Mr. Jinlian resolve the crisis.

768
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,620
It was nothing.

769
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,780
No. 6,

770
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,580
thank you for warning me,

771
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,860
or I would've fallen into Zilian's trap.

772
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,260
(No. 2, No. 3)

773
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,100
No need to thank me.

774
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,740
It was just a small favor.

775
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,980
I haven't been keeping up
with mirror messages for a while.

776
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,140
Can someone tell me

777
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,740
what happened?

778
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,300
You must've been busy

779
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,860
(No. 2)
with cultivation, alchemy,

780
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,420
and serving that wicked Emperor.

781
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,540
No. 2, mind your words.

782
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,660
We agreed beforehand

783
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,900
(No. 2)
not to reveal our identities

784
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,860
in front of newcomers.

785
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,500
Oh, please.

786
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,340
When No. 6 joined,

787
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,660
you blurted out my identity right away.

788
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,140
I'm just returning the favor.

789
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,620
(No. 1, No. 2, No. 3)
That was an honest mistake,

790
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,060
but you're doing it on purpose.

791
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,100
(No. 3, No. 4)
Yes, I am.

792
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,180
What are you going to do? Hit me?

793
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,460
No. 3, let me tell you.

794
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,100
No. 4 is Chu Yuanzhen, Chief Disciple
of the Dafeng's Treasure Sect,

795
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,820
and the Saint of Men.

796
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,980
Keep that in mind.

797
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,740
No. 3, let me tell you.

798
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,500
No. 2 is the Winged Woman, Li Miaozhen,

799
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,020
known as the Saintess
of Heaven.

800
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:13,860
Remember this.

801
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,500
She's utterly shameless.

802
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,660
- These two
- You just wait.

803
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,900
must be crazy.

804
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,860
(No. 4)
I'll never let you return alive.

805
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,780
(No. 2)
Bring it on!

806
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,980
I'll surely kill you.

807
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,340
(No. 4)
Winged Woman? I'll clip your wings!

808
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,620
Come on, come and clip them.

809
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,180
- You're nothing!
- Come here then!

810
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,900
So noisy.

811
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,060
(No. 1)
No. 1 has appeared.

812
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,740
I thought you'd only hide
behind the mirror and spy on us.

813
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,260
(No. 1)
With all this noise,

814
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,260
I couldn't keep my peace
even if I wanted to.

815
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,300
Everyone.

816
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,460
Everyone.

817
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,060
(No. 6)

818
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,860
No. 3 has just joined us.

819
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,900
Don't scare him off.

820
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,580
(No. 1)
No. 3,

821
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,420
which yamen in the capital do you serve?

822
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,060
(I'm not like No. 2 and No. 4.)

823
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,900
(Living in the world,)

824
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,740
(of course, I need to hide my identity.)

825
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:01,900
Serve in a yamen?

826
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,260
The capital's yamens

827
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,020
are nothing more than seats for idlers.

828
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,860
So,

829
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,300
are you a scholar?

830
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,340
No. 3,

831
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,460
though Mr. Jinlian
has allowed you to join us,

832
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,460
(No. 4)
you'll still need to earn our trust.

833
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,220
The Realm Sect has one rule:

834
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,060
What happens today

835
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,100
ends here.

836
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,980
No information here,

837
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,460
(No. 2, No. 3)
including our identities,

838
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,980
can be leaked to outsiders.

839
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,980
This is our consensus.

840
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,620
Rest assured.

841
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,820
I'm tight-lipped.

842
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,660
By the way, No. 1,

843
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,460
how are things in the capital lately?

844
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,260
Vice Minister Zhou has fallen,

845
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,420
and the political strife has begun.

846
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,900
However, his dismissal

847
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,620
was absurd.

848
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,900
It stemmed from a personal grudge
involving Weiwu Marquis' son,

849
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,220
which eventually exposed

850
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,780
a case of embezzling tax silver.

851
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,300
(I'd better show off a bit)

852
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,860
(to prove my value.)

853
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,500
(No. 1)

854
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,780
That's precisely what happened.

855
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,860
Anything else to discuss?

856
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,700
If not, let's adjourn.

857
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,660
I need to wipe out
mountain bandits tomorrow.

858
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,860
(No. 2, No. 3)
No. 3,

859
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,300
you've been here this long.

860
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,740
Could you share

861
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,060
your name with us?

862
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,900
I live and die

863
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,420
by my name.

864
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,740
I am

865
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,100
