00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,360
What's wrong?

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
Mr. Jinlian,

48
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,990
the Anji House

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,200
has been found.

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,160
What?

51
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,390
How are you holding up?

52
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,710
Do you need help?

53
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,670
I'm fine.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,110
They haven't found me.

55
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,880
What are you talking about?

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
What Anji House?

57
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,230
That place is

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,040
an abandoned ancestral hall on the east side.

59
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,360
It's a shelter for the children

60
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,990
I rescued.

61
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,150
I've been struggling

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,110
to support them these years.

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,590
Some homeless retired petty officials

64
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,760
and homeless children and seniors

65
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,800
live there, too.

66
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,520
Earlier today,

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,760
the court suddenly laid eyes on that place.

68
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,110
Clean it up.

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,830
Get rid of that shelf.

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
You...

71
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,740
Sir, we're renovating the ancestral hall.

72
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,710
Please step aside.

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm here

74
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,710
to help you.

75
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,040
Make it clean.

76
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,760
Clean the roof later.

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,870
I thought

78
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,390
they meant to take

79
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,360
those people back for questioning to find me,

80
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,360
but...

81
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,270
they renovated that place

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,710
and gave us

83
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,710
the long overdue funds.

84
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,300
Retired officials went

85
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,200
to the Ministry of Revenue over and over

86
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,600
to get the money but got kicked out.

87
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
I knew

88
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,110
something must've happened,

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,240
or we wouldn't have received the money!

90
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,480
I see.

91
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,600
No. 1, you're

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,760
in the capital.

93
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,690
Did you do it?

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,160
(No. 1)
No, not me.

95
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,670
No?

96
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,760
It was too noble. It couldn't be No. 4.

97
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,380
(No. 4)

98
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,760
It wasn't him.

99
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,270
If neither of them did it,

100
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,760
the only one left in the capital would be...

101
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
No. 3!

102
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,640
You're thinking too highly of me.

103
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,560
How could I command court officials?

104
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,440
You stay

105
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,590
out of this case.

106
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll assign it to others.

107
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,440
It was Lord Wei.

108
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,380
(Rule With Virtue)
Father,

109
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,270
the Anji House has been renovated.

110
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,560
The Guardians didn't go there.

111
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,470
Staff of the Ministry of Works
repaired everything.

112
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,430
Good.

113
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,680
What's so special about this place

114
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,030
that you care about it so much?

115
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,080
Was it

116
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,640
involved in Earl Pingyuan's murder?

117
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,910
It's only a shelter for the homeless.

118
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,270
There's something else.

119
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,280
Yang Yan.

120
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,360
Yes.

121
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,000
Ask Li Yuchun to get it done.

122
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,440
Do you know what I mean?

123
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,670
Yes.

124
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,700
(Aid, 500 Liang for Mount Dahuang,
Haoqi Tower)

125
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,920
Chief,

126
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,790
are we going to

127
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,440
hand out the supplies?

128
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,420
(Approval of Aid)

129
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,680
You're a bunch of pigs!

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,960
I thought you were good.

131
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,230
But you're dark and evil.

132
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,910
Drop the act.

133
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,390
Listen to me.

134
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,870
Either

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,790
bring Governor Liu back

136
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,670
or...

137
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,030
Scram!

138
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,440
Get out of here!

139
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,830
Don't obstruct the Guardians

140
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,080
in the course of our duty!

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
Arrest me now.

142
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,550
Come on!

143
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,000
Go ahead!

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Arrest me!

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,320
Arrest us! Arrest us!

146
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
I...

147
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,750
Don't.

148
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,770
Arrest us!

149
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,280
Arrest all of us here!

150
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,890
Come on!

151
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,060
(Waigou Village)

152
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,760
The bun got dirt on it.

153
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,320
This isn't the first time.

154
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,320
Just do the right thing.

155
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,310
Chief,

156
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,270
would you like a bun?

157
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,150
I have no time to eat.

158
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,070
I'm busy.

159
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,070
Get lost!

160
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,230
The Governor of Taihang was arrested.

161
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,710
I thought Lord Wei would be lenient.

162
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,350
He had his reason.

163
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,960
You reminded me

164
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,080
the locals suffered from heavy taxes.

165
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,440
If Mount Dahuang was sealed,

166
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,230
their life would be miserable.

167
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,320
You had me put in a good word
for the Governor.

168
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
Guess

169
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,470
what Lord Wei said.

170
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,600
What was it?

171
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,150
Mount Dahuang is rich in Yanxiao,

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,830
but how did Kui know that?

173
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,760
Not to mention it's right under our noses.

174
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,960
Are you saying

175
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,030
someone is Kui's spy?

176
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,200
Mount Dahuang is in Taikang.

177
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,640
The Governor didn't report anything
to cover the Kui's traces.

178
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,230
Is he their spy?

179
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
He's in the Municipal Office's custody

180
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,000
and being questioned as we speak.

181
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,990
But

182
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,350
Miss Chu has found out

183
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,350
about his espionage via the Gazing Spell.

184
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,560
All thanks to Lord Wei.

185
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
How interesting.

186
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,680
What do you mean?

187
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,590
Lord Wei abhors evils as deadly foes

188
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,200
yet always helps those in need.

189
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,470
He's in a cyan robe all day,

190
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,750
enjoying tea, books, and the game of Go.

191
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,990
He doesn't look like a leader at all,

192
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,510
but he's meticulous

193
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,920
and sharp.

194
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,440
I heard he can't fight either.

195
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,500
I don't understand

196
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,920
how he became the head of the Guardians

197
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,800
and the Censorate.

198
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Is that what you think about him?

199
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,230
In my eyes,

200
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,350
he's not the one you see.

201
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,510
Back in the day,

202
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,920
he safeguarded the state

203
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,200
with his wisdom and martial arts.

204
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,440
He was formidable.

205
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,350
No one knew how high his rank was.

206
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,470
Keep up!

207
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,990
In the Battle of Linyuan Pass 19 years ago,

208
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,710
as the Commander-in-chief,

209
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,110
he crushed the fierce Yao and Kui

210
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,990
from the north

211
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,800
that were said to be invincible

212
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,160
within a few months!

213
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,560
Fire!

214
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,510
Lord Wei

215
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:31,080
gained matchless merits in this battle.

216
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,800
He saved the Dafeng,

217
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,440
and he was honored as

218
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,440
the God of War of the Dafeng!

219
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,350
The high-ranking fighters in the state

220
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,710
have been following him since then.

221
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Thanks to his guidance,

222
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,630
they've become as skilled as they are now.

223
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,470
So,

224
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,280
do you get it now?

225
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,760
Good!

226
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,800
I only heard

227
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,350
about Duke Zhenbei's heroic deeds.

228
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,350
But now, I think

229
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,800
Lord Wei is even greater.

230
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,160
How come he can no longer fight?

231
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,590
Shortly after he built the Guardian Yamen,

232
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,470
he abandoned all his skills.

233
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,120
Why?

234
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,350
No one knows

235
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,920
or talks about it.

236
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,440
He doesn't want others to bring it up either.

237
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,830
So you'd better

238
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,960
not mention it.

239
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,830
Didn't that constable
go to Mount Dahuang with us for a case?

240
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,920
Municipal Office.

241
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,710
Mr. Xu, there you are!

242
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,650
Miss Chu asked for you.

243
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,600
Chu Caiwei?

244
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,950
Yes.

245
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,630
Did you kill him?

246
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,560
- No.
- No.

247
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
You may go.

248
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,590
Next batch.

249
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,230
Did you kill him?

250
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,920
- I didn't.
- No, not me.

251
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,710
You may go.

252
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,710
Miss Chu, Mr. Xu is here.

253
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,320
Xu Qi'an,

254
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,230
you've finally come!

255
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,350
What's going on here?

256
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,680
It's all your fault.

257
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,510
Your idea of slacking off is stupid!

258
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,920
My idea?

259
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,680
What's wrong?

260
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,630
I used your idea,

261
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,400
pretending to be sick

262
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,960
to not go to the office.

263
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,080
Chen Hanguang granted my request.

264
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,510
Wasn't that good?

265
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,750
Not at all!

266
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,510
That man is

267
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,230
a cunning old fox!

268
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,680
He said I didn't need to go to the office

269
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,710
because I'd be doing fieldwork.

270
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,870
In terms of fieldwork,

271
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,830
basically,

272
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,040
I have to check all the suspects one by one

273
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,470
with the Gazing Spell!

274
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,590
I can handle a few,

275
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,080
but look at the crowd outside.

276
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,630
There are hundreds of them.

277
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,280
I've been casting that spell

278
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,400
day and night for days.

279
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,080
It's making me dizzy

280
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,350
and sick.

281
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,350
Right.

282
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,590
That spell can help solve cases.

283
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,350
Why didn't I think of that?

284
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,160
Whatever.

285
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,320
I can't do it anymore.

286
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,440
Now that you're here,

287
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,710
this case is all yours.

288
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,350
Let me see.

289
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,020
(Interrogator: Chu Caiwei)

290
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,850
(Municipal Office: Case Summary)
"The victim, Liu Han,

291
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,110
was a petty Flag Officer at the gate.

292
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,400
He was killed late at night yesterday

293
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,990
and died on the table.

294
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,990
Everywhere else was left untouched.

295
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,680
Nothing was lost.

296
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,200
No sign of forced entry was found.

297
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,960
The victim probably knew the killer.

298
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,510
He sat upright in his chair.

299
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,680
Given the angle of his head,

300
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,080
he died instantly

301
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,400
without struggling.

302
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,800
Looks like he not only knew the killer

303
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,470
but also held him in awe or feared him.

304
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,280
How do you know that?

305
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,080
When people stay in their studies,

306
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,470
normally, they sit, relaxed

307
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,350
and laid-back

308
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,110
instead of being upright

309
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,350
and stiff like the victim

310
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,630
unless he had to

311
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,560
treat the one in front of him respectfully.

312
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,920
That makes sense.

313
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,870
The case file also says

314
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,560
he didn't have visitors last night

315
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,200
or make any enemies lately.

316
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Perhaps

317
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,800
we should question his direct supervisor.

318
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,200
That's a Baihu of the Insignia Guards.

319
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,590
He's waiting outside.

320
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,000
Send him in.

321
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,920
Yes.

322
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,470
Please let him be the last one!

323
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,960
Baihu Zhou,

324
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,190
tell me,

325
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,750
did Liu Han serve under you?

326
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,710
(Zhou Chixiong)
Yes.

327
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,280
(Insignia Guard)
Was he strange lately?

328
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,280
No.

329
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,560
When he was guarding the gate,

330
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,320
did anyone or anything suspicious
enter the city?

331
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,160
No.

332
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,470
Could he hide it from you?

333
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,800
We have tons of guards at the gate.

334
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,280
Bribing him alone

335
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,830
was useless

336
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,400
unless

337
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,560
they were all bought over.

338
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,560
Or they only

339
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,710
needed to bribe you, right?

340
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,630
What are you implying?

341
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,880
Baihu Zhou,

342
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,310
I'm asking routine questions.

343
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,600
Please be cooperative.

344
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,030
I didn't take bribes.

345
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,030
Aren't you a Guardian?

346
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,400
Feel free to investigate.

347
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
I, Zhou Chixiong,

348
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,600
have done nothing wrong.

349
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,160
Is there anything else?

350
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,400
I need to return to work.

351
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,270
If not, I'm leaving.

352
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,510
Thanks for your time.

353
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,710
Is what he said true?

354
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,920
Absolutely.

355
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,470
How come?

356
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,160
Did I think too much?

357
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,040
Miss Chu,

358
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,510
180 more people are outside to be checked.

359
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,680
Shall we continue?

360
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,200
What?

361
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,960
I'm going back to my office.

362
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,230
You may go on with your work.

363
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,640
What?

364
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,360
"Leave first".

365
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,710
You taught me that.

366
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,310
It's the 7th way to slack off.

367
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,640
You cannot leave me here alone.

368
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,400
No more gazing or I'll go blind.

369
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:32,960
Help me, please!

370
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,790
Pretty please!

371
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,440
Do you know

372
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,960
eye exercises?

373
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,550
6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

374
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,680
7, 2...

375
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:50,880
Close your eyes.

376
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,960
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

377
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,310
My vision's become much clearer!

378
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,990
Do them regularly

379
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,470
every morning and evening

380
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,360
for a quarter each time.

381
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,400
They'll relax your eyes and mind.

382
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,680
They're wonderful.

383
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,230
Are there more moves? Teach me.

384
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,360
I'll introduce such exercises to the Bureau.

385
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,030
There's one more.

386
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,110
It's to

387
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,550
press the temples

388
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,120
while brushing eye sockets.

389
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Press thumbs against the temples.

390
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,120
Brush eye sockets with index fingers.

391
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,840
Brush up and down

392
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,920
in turn.

393
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,070
Press gently!

394
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,030
Don't kill yourself.

395
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,120
Easy. Less pressure on the temples.

396
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,920
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

397
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,440
2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

398
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,960
3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

399
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,620
(South Gate)

400
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,340
(Sipai Community)

401
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Sangbo was the Xuanwu Lake in history.

402
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,270
(Sangbo Ceremony, Gengzi Year, Jiazi Day)
The founder of the Dafeng

403
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,680
obtained the Supreme Sword here.

404
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,640
With that sword,

405
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,440
he meditated in the lake for three years.

406
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,400
When he

407
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,550
broke out with it,

408
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,680
he reorganized his force

409
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,680
and became invincible.

410
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,610
(Carry on Legacy)
He overthrew the last dynasty

411
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,870
and united the Central Plains.

412
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,070
This is where he achieved his way

413
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,880
and the origin of the Dafeng.

414
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,310
The capital was built near Sangbo, too.

415
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,360
Later,

416
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,750
ancestors' tablets were enshrined
in the middle of the lake

417
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,590
to pray for

418
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,400
forever peace.

419
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,550
(Forever Peace)
That's why we have this ceremony.

420
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,870
People are

421
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,230
proud of such a legend,

422
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,200
making it a well-known urban tale.

423
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,720
Ningyan,

424
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,840
did no one tell you?

425
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
How come you didn't know?

426
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,150
Is that all?

427
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,200
Go on. Say something else.

428
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,680
Or I'll fall asleep.

429
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,790
Due to the great significance of Sangbo,

430
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,640
His Majesty always attends the ceremony

431
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,360
with other members of royalty

432
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,600
and court officials.

433
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,110
That's all.

434
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,110
Carry on.

435
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,240
Keep talking. Go on.

436
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,710
We the Guardians always

437
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,700
stay in the dark

438
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,120
to protect the imperial family.

439
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,360
Our job seems dangerous,

440
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,640
but the risks are low.

441
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,470
Among the masters here,

442
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,310
the number of those

443
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,750
above the 4th Rank is two-digit.

444
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,960
Don't fall off the cliff.

445
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,230
Why are you so weak?

446
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,840
What's wrong with you lately?

447
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,420
You always look drowsy.

448
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,750
Were you with girls behind our backs?

449
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,820
No.

450
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,310
Lord Wei said I was stuck in the Qi Stage.

451
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,960
I have to stay up to push my limits.

452
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,840
Then my stage will be stabilized.

453
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,120
The Spirit Stage?

454
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,280
What?

455
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,600
You've reached the Spirit Stage?

456
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,840
I don't know why,

457
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,470
but I have a really strong feeling.

458
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,100
I can't hold it for too long.

459
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,120
- You...
- You're talkative.

460
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,990
Keep talking then.

461
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,830
Talk to him.

462
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,160
Uh, I...

463
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,880
The Sangbo Lake is beautiful.

464
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,030
It's deep

465
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,510
and abounds with fish.

466
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,920
I don't know anything else!

467
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
Keep going.

468
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,750
I... Ningyan!

469
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,260
(Emperor Yuanjing)

470
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,420
(Empress)

471
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,840
(His Majesty only has two princesses.)

472
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,470
(Is she Lin'an?)

473
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,070
Over there, Your Highness!

474
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,230
Stop. I'm in the zone.

475
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,640
Look over there!

476
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,440
What's he doing here?

477
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,600
Drive him away!

478
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,440
Yes.

479
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,750
By the Princess's order,

480
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,680
all of you shall watch closely from here.

481
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,980
Do not take one step forward.

482
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,990
Princess?

483
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,600
Why did she give us that order?

484
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,070
What can we do from this far?

485
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,550
Gaze into space?

486
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,880
(Could it be Lin'an?)

487
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,680
(I turned down her offer.)

488
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,400
(Now, she's giving me a hard time.)

489
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:04,070
(She's indeed petty.)

490
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,060
(Forever Peace)

491
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,820
(Duke Yu's Wife, Duchess Yu)

492
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,440
Lin'an.

493
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,110
Aunt.

494
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,920
You haven't come to my place for a long time.

495
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,310
The pomegranates are ripe,

496
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,440
but no one eats them.

497
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,150
Have you

498
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,440
heard from Pingyang lately?

499
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,990
A few days ago,

500
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,710
I received news from her.

501
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,680
She said

502
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
she was fine.

503
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,400
You don't need to worry.

504
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,070
That's good.

505
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,310
Good.

506
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,440
Aunt,

507
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:34,030
Father will initiate the ceremony.

508
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,390
Lin'an,

509
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,840
come to visit me whenever you can.

510
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,920
The worship ends.

511
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,960
Greet His Majesty.

512
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,030
Between heaven and earth,

513
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,840
the land spreads.

514
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,850
(Founding Father Emperor Dewuzong's Tablet)

515
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,360
The Dafeng's power

516
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,680
grows without limit.

517
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Only my devotion

518
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,640
can build a prosperous state.

519
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
As the waters

520
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,920
run ceaselessly,

521
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,360
His Majesty's glory

522
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,160
will last eternally.

523
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
How grand!

524
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,270
I never saw this in my previous life.

525
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,920
If only we could get closer.

526
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,230
We can't see much from this far.

527
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,310
I know.

528
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,840
The Dafeng royalty worships
their ancestors today.

529
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,990
Right, No. 1 and No. 3?

530
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,470
(No. 6)
Counting the days,

531
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,440
the worshiping ceremony is today.

532
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,640
(No. 1, No. 3)
No. 1 is offline.

533
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,230
So is No. 3.

534
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,510
Interesting!

535
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,070
(Oh no.)

536
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,960
(No. 2 is sounding me out on my identity.)

537
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,310
(But No. 1 didn't respond either.)

538
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,960
(No. 1 must be here, too.)

539
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,200
Who is it?

540
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,680
Help me!

541
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,120
Help me!

542
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,790
Do you hear anything strange?

543
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,230
The ceremonial music?

544
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,230
It does sound a bit

545
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,160
too loud.

546
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,960
Help me!

547
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,680
Help me!

548
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,060
(Carry on Legacy)

549
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,120
Ningyan, don't...

550
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,070
They can see us.

551
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,030
Stop...

552
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,510
Come on. Stand up.

553
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,750
Or you'll be scolded again.

554
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,240
Father,

555
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,450
something's wrong over there.

556
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,360
Do you hear nothing at all?

557
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,480
Nothing.

558
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,550
I bet you were with girls without telling us.

559
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,360
You're so weak that you're hearing things.

560
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,600
Help me!

561
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,840
I'm hearing it again. Listen.

562
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,920
Stop looking!

563
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,680
Everything...

564
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,220
(Forever Peace)

565
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,700
(Carry on Legacy)

566
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,580
(Emperor Dewuzong's Tablet)

567
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,070
Your Majesty!

568
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,600
Protect His Majesty!

569
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,200
Protect His Majesty!

570
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,040
Yang Yan!

571
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,510
Protect the Empress.

572
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,960
Lin'an.

573
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,230
Go! Protect His Majesty!

574
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,510
Let's go, Princess!

575
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,350
Princess!

576
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,400
Move!

577
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,500
- Princess.
- Princess!

578
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,840
Are you alright, Princess?

579
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,750
- Princess?
- Princess?

580
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,310
I, Xu Qi'an,

581
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,310
am here to protect you.

582
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,550
Are you hurt, Grand Princess?

583
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,070
I'm fine.

584
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,920
You shouldn't have come.

585
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,760
Leave now.

586
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,440
Go!

587
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,910
Yes.

588
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,070
Are you Xu Qi'an?

589
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,960
I am.

590
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,960
You must be...

591
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,550
Silence!

592
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,680
Your Majesty,

593
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,640
I failed in my duty.

594
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,680
Let no one in.

595
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,070
Yes.

596
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,550
So what if you were 1st Rank?

597
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,670
You would've had a much longer life,

598
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,360
but it was shortened by worldly energy.

599
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,840
You barely outlived ordinary people.

600
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,960
I ascended the throne at 20.

601
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,150
I defeated all my enemies

602
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,630
to hold on to that chair.

603
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,920
No one could threaten me anymore.

604
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,990
But in the end, it turns out

605
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,320
that my biggest enemy

606
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,630
is time.

607
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:55,380
(Forever Peace)

608
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,070
Your Majesty.

609
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,700
Proceed with the ceremony.

610
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,740
Yes.

611
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,860
Proceed with the ceremony!

612
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,860
Grand Princess,

613
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,220
the ceremony is over.

614
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,380
Where are we going?

615
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,420
Be quiet.

616
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,900
You'll know when we're there.

617
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,100
Oh.

618
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,180
Wait, where...?

619
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,380
Off you go.

620
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,540
Grand Princess,

621
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,780
what's going on?

622
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,860
Did I do something wrong?

623
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,740
Why leave me in the middle of nowhere?

624
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,180
Lin'an is interested in you.

625
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,740
I don't want you near her.

626
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,980
But this is too far!

627
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,820
Otherwise,

628
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,940
what if she catches up?

629
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Let's go.

630
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,340
This incense is Being With the Moon.

631
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,820
It'll be with you as me.

632
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,460
​The moon is you

633
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,260
​that I see.

634
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,260
Shangguan Xixue!

635
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,260
You'll be the Empress.

636
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,820
Stay away from that lowly man!

637
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,940
- Father.
- Guards.

638
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,100
Seize him!

639
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,980
Take her back!

640
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,380
- Xixue!
- Father!

641
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,780
- Xixue!
- No!

642
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,580
Xixue!

643
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,900
Father.

644
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,700
Father.

645
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,100
Here are all the records of the Sangbo Lake.

646
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,660
Did something bad happen?

647
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,060
No.

648
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,300
(Notes on Sangbo)

649
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,260
The sword in the Ancestral Temple awakened.

650
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,420
(No. 1)
Now, it's become quiet again.

651
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,740
Emperor Yuanjing stayed in the temple
for a quarter

652
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,260
and did heaven knows what.

653
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,100
Then the ceremony continued.

654
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,020
You were there, indeed, No. 1.

655
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,580
Before the energy of the sword soared,

656
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,900
I saw a gust of demonic energy

657
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,540
condensing over Sangbo.

658
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,620
I sensed it, too.

659
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,020
But then

660
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,380
it darted away.

661
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,860
So

662
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,180
during the ceremony,

663
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,540
a demon or a demonized man
was near the capital.

664
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,980
(No. 1)
The sword sensed it and awakened,

665
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,260
scaring it away.

666
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,500
But with Supervisor in the capital,

667
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,140
who would dare

668
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,780
raid the city?

669
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,860
Maybe it wasn't a raid,

670
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
but something is hidden in Sangbo.

671
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,740
(No. 1)
No. 3,

672
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,060
what makes you say that?

673
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,020
(No. 6)

674
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,060
One of my friends

675
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,900
heard cries for help from the lake.

676
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,740
Is something sealed

677
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,220
in that lake?

678
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,820
No. 1,

679
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,740
you're from the Dafeng.

680
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,900
(No. 9, No. 1)
Do you know?

681
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,220
(No. 1)
No way.

682
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,460
If something were there,

683
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,380
I would receive the news.

684
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,620
No. 1 is

685
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,580
powerful in court.

686
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,820
That means

687
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,540
only royalty

688
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,620
or only Emperor Yuanjing knows that.

689
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,220
(No. 1)
I'll try to find out what it is.

690
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,100
(The Dafeng's 13 Rites)

691
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,740
I think I know what it is.

692
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,620
Is something hidden

693
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
in the Sangbo Lake?

694
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,780
(The Dafeng's 13 Rites)

695
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,020
That's not something you should know.

696
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,460
Forget what happened today.

697
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,460
Don't dig into it.

698
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,300
Don't talk about it.

699
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

700
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,580
Your Highness,

701
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,260
(Moon Palace)
Princess Lin'an

702
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,260
recruited Xu Qi'an as you days ago.

703
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,740
I don't understand.

704
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,620
Why not

705
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,700
unmask her?

706
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,620
Let her be.

707
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,980
Any updates on Lord Wei?

708
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,340
After the ceremony,

709
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
he had Yang Yan go to the Bureau,

710
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,420
but Supervisor said

711
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,580
he was too sick to see him.

712
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,100
He and Eunuch Yang sent by His Majesty

713
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,580
didn't ascend the Star Tower.

714
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,780
What should we do next, Your Highness?

715
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,420
Keep watching Sangbo,

716
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,060
especially the Supreme Sword.

717
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,700
If anything happens,

718
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
- let me know immediately.
- Yes.

719
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,220
Do you have any ideas?

720
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,340
No? Then keep thinking. Come on!

721
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,700
Shut up and use your brain!

722
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,290
You can't offer anything.

723
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,950
Don't be so full of yourself.

724
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,120
Do you have an idea?

725
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,580
They keep fighting.

726
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,420
Have they figured out a way?

727
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,500
Stop.

728
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,380
Don't worry too much.

729
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,260
We pulled through earlier, didn't we?

730
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,820
We did this time,

731
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,580
but Huaiqing is too smart.

732
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,020
She'll see through my trick soon.

733
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,780
Besides, many people saw me talk to him.

734
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,380
If someone digs into it,

735
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,220
my cover will be blown.

736
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,940
So what? That's fine.

737
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,180
We can always find another poet.

738
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,140
No!

739
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,380
I can't let him go.

740
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,420
Your Highness,

741
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:15,180
are you falling for Copper Gong Xu?

742
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,460
Falling for him?

743
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,940
He's a humble Copper Gong,

744
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,820
while I'm

745
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,940
the First Princess of the Dafeng.

746
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,260
Really?

747
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:31,140
When he darted over to save you earlier,

748
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,780
why did you cling on to him?

749
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,820
Are you teasing me?

750
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,820
I wouldn't dare.

751
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,540
I need ideas! Think!

752
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,540
Why look at me?

753
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,460
Your Highness, I have an idea

754
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,620
to make him remain loyal to you

755
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,620
to death.

756
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,260
