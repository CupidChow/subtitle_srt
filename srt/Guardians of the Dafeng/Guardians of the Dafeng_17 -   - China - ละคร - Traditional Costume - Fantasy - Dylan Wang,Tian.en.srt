40
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,110
Mother,

41
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,670
didn't you give the bracelet
to Ms. Wang?

42
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,880
Your father said I brought it with me
when I married him.

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,270
I kept it when we went to prison.

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,550
He insisted I keep it.

45
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,720
It's more precious than life.

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,360
Did you nag at Father again?

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
This time I didn't.

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,390
You know this.

49
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,910
Your father always thinks he's useless

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,960
and he owes us.

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,080
Where exactly did he go?

52
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,670
Who sent you here?

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,800
No one sent me.

54
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,960
I'm not lying.

55
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,040
My Lord, I was just passing by.

56
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,760
Just passing by.

57
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,590
Still trying to argue?

58
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,150
I'm not arguing.

59
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,640
Tell me the truth.

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,160
Well.

61
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,960
Did you hit him?

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
No.

63
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,590
- You hit him?
- No.

64
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,200
Is he so weak?

65
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,110
Wake him up.

66
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,870
My Lord.

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,550
Please spare me.

68
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,830
You brat.

69
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,480
You're tight-lipped, huh?

70
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,670
No, no. I'm not.

71
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,870
Do you have any accomplices?

72
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,960
No, no.

73
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,990
I really don't.

74
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,550
I'll tell you everything.

75
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,320
I'll tell you everything

76
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,480
that I know.

77
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,360
My name is Xu Pingzhi.

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,110
I'm a Baihu in the Imperial Guards.

79
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
My nephew is also a Guardian.

80
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,320
He's actually your colleague.

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,760
(No.)

82
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,110
(I can't mention Ningyan.)

83
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,520
(It might be bad for me.)

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,670
A Guardian?

85
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,670
Is he a Copper Gong, Silver Gong,
or Gold Gong?

86
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,640
No, no, no.

87
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,510
My Lord,

88
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,670
I was just joking with you.

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,390
Joking?

90
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,520
Are you tired of living?

91
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,920
This...

92
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,710
He fainted again.

93
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,230
Wake him up.

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,390
I'm wrong.

95
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,200
I won't do it again.

96
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,920
You are a seasoned one.

97
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,640
No, no. I'm still new.

98
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,270
I like you the way you are,

99
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,710
tight-lipped

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,990
and seasoned.

101
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,590
No, no. I'm not seasoned at all.

102
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,590
Tell me.
Were you really just passing by?

103
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,800
I was telling the truth.

104
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,430
I really was just passing by.

105
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,230
I had a bowl of noodles
outside the yamen.

106
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,350
My stomach even got upset.

107
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,030
I'm wrong. I'll change.

108
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,230
I won't pass by the yamen again.

109
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,150
Please spare me, My Lord.

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,080
You brat.

111
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,590
Did you eat garlic?

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,590
New garlic.

113
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,960
Ten years apart bring out ambitions.

114
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,590
Serving the people
without seeking credit.

115
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,560
The galloping horse kicks up dust,

116
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,270
welcoming a better future.

117
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,520
On the grassland outside Haoqi Tower,

118
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,170
we share the drink and time
in the breeze.

119
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,030
Enough.

120
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,440
With the clear moon and wind,

121
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,230
we read by a lamp in Breeze Hall.

122
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,790
Enough, enough.

123
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,200
On the grassland outside Haoqi Tower,

124
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,910
we share the drink and time
in the breeze.

125
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,100
Congratulations, Silver Gong Li.

126
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,440
You've been reinstated.

127
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,150
Congratulations
on Mr. Li's reinstatement.

128
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,350
Li Yuchun.

129
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,000
Lord Wei.

130
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,710
What is this about?

131
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,830
This is His Majesty's command.

132
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,120
Xu Qi'an defied his superior

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,030
and violated the law.

134
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,790
His Majesty appointed him.

135
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,470
If the Guardians don't follow,

136
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,690
we'll also violate the law.

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,440
You may leave now.

138
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,790
Xu Qi'an.

139
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,230
Come in.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Yes.

141
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,680
Greetings,

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Lord Wei.

143
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,960
The Gold Hall,

144
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,960
Breeze Hall,

145
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,080
and Suppression Hall

146
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,030
will handle this case

147
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,790
together,

148
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,150
and you'll be

149
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,320
the Lead Investigator.

150
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,060
(Sangbo Case Summary)

151
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,710
Beneath the Sangbo,

152
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,270
is there something sealed there?

153
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,710
Tell me what you think.

154
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,200
Sangbo is the forbidden area
of our Dafeng,

155
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,640
but to outsiders,

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,960
the only valuable thing there
is the Supreme Sword.

157
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,320
This file states that the Supreme Sword

158
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,760
is unharmed,

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,590
so the culprit's goal is not that.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,270
I think

161
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,470
there might be something else
in the Ancestral Temple.

162
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,830
As for the reason

163
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,560
why it shows up in Sangbo,

164
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,000
let me make a bold guess.

165
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,640
It's because this thing

166
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,470
needs the Supreme Sword to seal it.

167
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,830
Lord Wei, you must know

168
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,230
what this thing is.

169
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,630
Your task

170
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,440
is to find out who destroyed
the Ancestral Temple.

171
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,960
Whether this object exists

172
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,780
and whether it needs to be recovered

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,280
is none of your concern.

174
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,470
If you encounter any problems,

175
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,230
inform Yang Yan.

176
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,560
He will handle it.

177
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,230
His Majesty gave you a Gold Badge.

178
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,890
With this, you may move freely
within the Imperial City,

179
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,470
except in the Palace

180
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,560
and special restricted areas.

181
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,590
Yes, My Lord.

182
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,990
Has the Supervisor recovered?

183
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,630
That old man...

184
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,740
(Peace)

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,040
My Lord,

186
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,350
everyone from the Gold Hall,

187
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,920
Breeze Hall, and Suppression Hall

188
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,830
is here.

189
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,830
Please instruct us.

190
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,990
His Majesty ordered me

191
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,110
to investigate the explosion at Sangbo.

192
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,470
You all shall cooperate with me

193
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,630
and do your best

194
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,750
to repay the royal favor.

195
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,680
Yes.

196
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,920
Copper Gong Song Tingfeng.

197
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,760
Yes.

198
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,440
Lead a team to the Ministry of Works

199
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,630
to check the production

200
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,200
and usage records of gunpowder
over the past month.

201
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,870
A huge amount of gunpowder

202
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,660
is needed to destroy the entire temple.

203
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,070
It's impossible to transport it out
without leaving traces.

204
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,590
Even if the records are falsified,

205
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,630
there will still be clues.

206
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,470
Yes.

207
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,440
- Copper Gong Zhu Guangxiao.
- Yes.

208
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,040
Lead a team to the Ministry of Justice,

209
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,040
arrest all the officials
who went to the Ancestral Temple,

210
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,710
and interrogate them one by one.

211
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,550
Yes.

212
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,800
The rest,

213
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,230
follow me.

214
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,310
Yes.

215
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,430
My Lord, where are we going?

216
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,280
To the scene.

217
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,580
♪Watch out for fire late at night♪

218
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,520

230
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,620
(Forever Peace)

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,710
The temple
has been completely destroyed.

232
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,120
The bodies of the fallen soldiers
have been carried back.

233
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,920
No one has passed here afterward.

234
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,590
It seems

235
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,350
the lake surface
no longer holds any clues.

236
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,800
Why not

237
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,680
go see the bottom of the lake?

238
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,520
Sure.

239
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,200
Please, My Lord.

240
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,830
I'm here.

241
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,230
Are you okay?

242
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,710
You held your breath for a long time.

243
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,990
Your Qi force is too strong
for your Spirit Stage.

244
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,470
Perhaps it's because I cultivate

245
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,400
nonstop every day.

246
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,830
So,

247
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,200
did you find anything down there?

248
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,050
The foundation at the lakebed is intact.

249
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,060
The high platform collapsed
from a great height.

250
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,290
This suggests the explosion
happened inside the temple,

251
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,160
not at the lakebed.

252
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,160
They must've hidden the gunpowder
inside the temple.

253
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,870
Around the foundation,
there's a circle of stone pillars,

254
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,810
with tadpole-shaped inscriptions
carved on them.

255
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,280
They're roughly...

256
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,670
They're roughly like this.

257
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,710
This shape

258
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,440
seems to be

259
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,960
the Tianyu Language.

260
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,870
Is Tianyu behind this?

261
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,230
Not only that.

262
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,470
The stone pillars around the foundation

263
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,110
seem to be arranged
according to some specific pattern.

264
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,200
This arrangement

265
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,630
should be a formation.

266
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,440
Arranging a formation
in the capital of the Dafeng...

267
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,990
The Astronomical Bureau.

268
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,670
Ningyan.

269
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,630
This seems to involve a lot.

270
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,280
Mr. Sun,

271
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,680
Mr. Chen,

272
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,830
how is the case going?

273
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,350
Eunuch Yang,

274
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,510
the Ministry of Justice and the yamen

275
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,560
interrogate

276
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,440
over a hundred people overnight.

277
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
Currently,

278
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,320
we have some leads.

279
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Leads?

280
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,750
So, it's not settled yet.

281
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,750
This time, 312 soldiers

282
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,160
patrolling near Sangbo

283
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,350
died in this explosion.

284
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,590
Their death is the same.

285
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,110
They were drained of their blood

286
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,200
without any other wounds
on their bodies.

287
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,590
We think

288
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,230
it must be an expert

289
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,470
who did this.

290
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,280
Another expert.

291
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,920
This makes things more complicated.

292
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,200
Report!

293
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,760
Mr. Sun,

294
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,350
the Guardians are still outside,

295
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,730
saying it's an imperial command,

296
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,960
and they want the people back.

297
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,200
- Drive them away.
- Yes.

298
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,280
My Lord.

299
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,410
How's it going?

300
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,680
The Ministry of Works is fine,

301
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,160
but Guangxiao has a problem.

302
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,310
Let's go.

303
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,710
Let's go.

304
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,560
(Ministry of Justice)
We're on a case.

305
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,960
Whoever trespasses

306
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,460
and interferes with the investigation

307
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,630
shall be killed.

308
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,160
This is a restricted area.

309
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,120
Unrelated personnel,

310
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,230
get off your horses!

311
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,710
Anyone who trespasses

312
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,550
will die.

313
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,480
One

314
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,310
Chop

315
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,950
to

316
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,650
Kill

317
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,390
All.

318
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,960
The Guardians are on a case.

319
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,400
Anyone who obstructs it

320
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,200
will be killed without mercy.

321
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,710
How dare you attack here

322
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,920
as an official?

323
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,960
Won't this cause trouble?

324
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,990
Should I be afraid of trouble now?

325
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,620
For me, progress is life.

326
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,710
If I don't assert my authority,
they won't fear me.

327
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,990
They'll continue obstructing us.

328
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,380
Pull yourself together.

329
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,720
Let's go.

330
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,200
Report.

331
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,630
Mr. Sun.

332
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,440
What's going on now?

333
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,510
The Guardians broke in

334
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,200
and injured our people.

335
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,750
Who's so bold?

336
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,550
I am Xu Qi'an.

337
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,550
My Lord.

338
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,470
Greetings, My Lords.

339
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,750
I heard you detained many officials
from the Ministry of Rites

340
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,750
and obstructed our investigation.

341
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,070
Mr. Sun,

342
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,790
may I ask what you mean by this?

343
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,280
Xu Qi'an,

344
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,400
you trespassed into my ministry

345
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,160
and injured my men.

346
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,680
What do you mean by this?

347
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,750
The Guardians are on a case.

348
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,950
Why should we report
to the Ministry of Justice?

349
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,200
You're simply lawless.

350
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,910
Guards!

351
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,070
Take him down.

352
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,640
I am here under imperial orders.

353
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,470
I suspect the Ministry of Justice
is colluding with the culprit

354
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,550
and blew up the Ancestral Temple.

355
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:52,640
Guardians!

356
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,230
Escort Mr. Sun
back to the yamen for tea.

357
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,200
Yes!

358
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,600
How dare you draw your sabers
in my ministry?

359
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,230
How many lives
do you think you have?

360
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,600
I will handle the cases you can't

361
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,640
and kill the people you don't dare to.

362
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
Also,

363
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,120
if your ministry dares
to obstruct my investigation,

364
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:30,200
I'll take down your ministry as well.

365
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,920
Is that clear enough?

366
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,960
Xu Qi'an.

367
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,710
Good.

368
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,840
Good.

369
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,310
You're indeed young and brash.

370
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,920
Your arrogance truly stands out.

371
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,400
Perfect timing.

372
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,510
Let me introduce

373
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,310
this Copper Gong Xu Qi'an in the middle.

374
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,640
He was recommended by the Crown Prince

375
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:57,400
and appointed by His Majesty
as the Guardians' Lead Investigator.

376
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,790
A few days ago,

377
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,990
he injured a superior

378
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,550
and was sentenced to a waist chop.

379
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,470
His Majesty is wise

380
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,400
and merciful

381
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,030
and allows him to atone for his crimes.

382
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,220
The appointed Lead Investigator
by His Majesty?

383
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,400
Good, you Guardians

384
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,440
have come

385
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,160
at the right time.

386
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,160
I don't have to make another trip

387
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,680
to talk to you.

388
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,920
Everyone, please sit.

389
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,240
Xu Qi'an,

390
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,680
you sit too.

391
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,110
My Lord,

392
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,550
your Gold Badge.

393
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,270
I'm too angry to eat this.

394
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,790
But it's so sweet.

395
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,990
I'm really angry today.

396
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,470
This is so delicious. Eat some.

397
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,310
Go.

398
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,790
Record it carefully.

399
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,640
My life is difficult now.

400
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,960
If I don't handle this case well,
I'll die here.

401
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
Investigator Xu.

402
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,760
Are you done?

403
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,620
(Hid a large amount of gunpowder
near Sangbo Lake.)

404
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
The Guardians

405
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,310
sent a mere Copper Gong
to investigate the case.

406
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,400
It's truly laughable.

407
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,240
Exactly.

408
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,030
Since you've done speaking,

409
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,990
I'll just comment

410
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,310
on what you've said.

411
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,400
Based on Mr. Sun's deduction,

412
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,470
I have a few questions.

413
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,790
I visited Sangbo Lake this morning.

414
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,680
The amount of gunpowder required

415
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,750
to blow up the Ancestral Temple
is enormous.

416
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,960
Yes.

417
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,120
Is there a problem?

418
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,750
Here's the issue.

419
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,960
As Mr. Sun just mentioned,

420
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,310
the security measures
for the gunpowder are very strict.

421
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,070
It's already extremely hard
to steal such a large amount

422
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,880
from the Ministry of Works.

423
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,880
Let alone erase the relevant traces.

424
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,880
Who do you think
could pull off such a thing?

425
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,880
The Minister of Works

426
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,000
or

427
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,920
the two Vice Ministers.

428
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,790
So, it was the Minister
and two Vice Ministers.

429
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,880
Now, everything makes sense.

430
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,840
But

431
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,360
isn't it too reckless?

432
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,640
What do you mean?

433
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,920
To steal such a large amount
of gunpowder,

434
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,920
no matter how careful they were,

435
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,840
there would still be traces left behind.

436
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,190
An investigation would find out.

437
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,710
In my humble opinion,

438
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,440
this is just a trick by the culprit,

439
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,790
making us believe the gunpowder
came from the Ministry of Works,

440
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,710
thus shifting the focus
of the investigation,

441
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,680
and giving the real culprit time
to escape the capital.

442
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,600
Apart from the Ministry of Works,

443
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,710
where else could such a large amount
of gunpowder come from?

444
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,310
Is it possible

445
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,710
it was transported
from outside the city?

446
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,030
Gunpowder is obvious.

447
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,320
How could it be smuggled in?

448
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,850
Let's put aside the Outer City.

449
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,500
The soldiers in the Inner City

450
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,030
inspect all incoming and outgoing goods.

451
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,510
The Imperial City is even stricter.

452
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,790
Smuggling it in

453
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,880
is simply impossible.

454
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,040
If the gunpowder can't be
brought into the city,

455
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,680
what about the raw materials?

456
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,110
That's right.

457
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:15,680
If it was just the raw materials,

458
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,230
the soldiers guarding the city
wouldn't know its use,

459
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,160
and there would be no contraband.

460
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,200
If you ask me, I'll let it pass.

461
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,750
Mr. Chen, how wise of you.

462
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,590
Look.

463
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,920
The raw materials...

464
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,030
Among the raw materials for gunpowder,

465
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,440
charcoal and sulfur are common items.

466
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,310
But there's one more thing
that the Dafeng strictly controls:

467
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,270
Saltpeter.

468
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:41,920
Saltpeter mines.

469
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,120
Mount Dahuang.

470
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,920
Mount Dahuang.

471
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,710
Breaking down the route.

472
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,750
We analyzed it earlier.

473
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,640
They went from Mount Dahuang
to the Outer City and Inner City.

474
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,920
They were only
transporting raw materials,

475
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,120
so they could easily pass the gate.

476
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,510
Next was the most crucial checkpoint
of the Imperial City.

477
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,200
Eunuch Yang.

478
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,270
My Lords.

479
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
I have other matters in the yamen.

480
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,160
I will take my leave now.

481
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,030
Caiwei,

482
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,870
shall we go together?

483
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,390
Everyone,

484
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,510
goodbye.

485
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,680
Wait...

486
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,310
Caiwei...

487
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,750
What about me?

488
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,080
My Lord, where are we going?

489
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,840
The Kui drove out the miners

490
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,960
to get the saltpeter mines
inside Mount Dahuang

491
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,310
to make gunpowder
to destroy the Ancestral Temple

492
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,990
and release the seal under the lake.

493
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,930
The inside man who helped them
smuggle the gunpowder into Sangbo

494
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,600
should be someone who can freely
enter and leave the Imperial City.

495
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Someone who can move freely
in the Imperial City?

496
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,540
The Insignia Guards?

497
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,400
The day before the worshiping ceremony,

498
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,750
a small Flag Officer died.

499
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,440
Before Flag Officer Liu Han died,

500
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,600
he was on duty.

501
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,600
Liu Han was just a small Flag Officer.

502
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,070
He wouldn't be able

503
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,550
to deceive his superiors
and smuggle gunpowder.

504
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,750
Unless his superior

505
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,400
instructed him to do so.

506
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,070
After the task was completed,

507
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,900
his superior killed him to silence him.

508
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,400
Your words reminded me.

509
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,200
His superior is...

510
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,790
Baihu Zhou.

511
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,070
Let me ask you.

512
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,640
Was Liu Han one of your subordinates?

513
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,270
Yes.

514
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,230
Had he been acting strangely lately?

515
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,070
No.

516
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,510
He was just as usual.

517
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,270
Had anything suspicious

518
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,120
entered the Imperial City
while he was on duty?

519
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,800
No.

520
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,070
Baihu Zhou Chixiong
from the Insignia Guards.

521
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,790
Wait.

522
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,270
I've gazed at his aura.

523
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,360
He wasn't lying.

524
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,880
He might have used some trick.

525
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,440
In any case, we need to find him first.

526
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,030
Chief, take my Gold Badge,

527
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,870
hurry to the East Gate
of the Imperial City,

528
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,030
and arrest Zhou Chixiong.

529
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,650
Get there
before the Ministry of Justice.

530
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,490
Yes.

531
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,880
You all come with me.

532
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,830
Let's go.

533
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,310
The rest of you,

534
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,560
follow me to the Zhou Mansion

535
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,310
to arrest him.

536
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,240
Yes.

537
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,910
Mr. Chen,

538
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
where did they go?

539
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,160
What Mount Dahuang?

540
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,710
What saltpeter mines?

541
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,720
Mr. Chen,

542
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,550
do you know what they're talking about?

543
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,390
I know.

544
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,640
The case
from the Municipal Office earlier.

545
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,070
The metal sodium

546
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,470
explodes.

547
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,550
Anyway, I don't remember it clearly.

548
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,200
The case files.

549
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,470
Hurry and bring out the case files.

550
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,400
Alright, alright.

551
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,600
Pig Brain, come here.

552
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,350
My Lord.

553
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,960
Go get the files.

554
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,360
Take your time.

555
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,960
Yes.

556
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,790
Are you crazy?

557
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,510
Hurry up.

558
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,200
Be patient.

559
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,810
The files will be here soon.

560
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,300
(Zhou Mansion)

561
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,910
Open the door!

562
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,120
The Guardians are on a case.

563
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,680
The Baihu is sick.

564
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,750
He's not seeing anyone.

565
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,160
My Lords, please leave.

566
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,680
Two men guard the gate.

567
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
The rest of you, rush in.

568
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,910
- Yes.
- Yes.

569
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,030
Mr. Lead Investigator,

570
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,570
why aren't you charging in?

571
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,680
In the Battle of Linyuan Pass,

572
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
did you see His Majesty
charging into battle?

573
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,880
You weren't like this earlier
at the Ministry of Justice.

574
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,070
That's called a persona.

575
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,680
A persona?

576
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,310
I'm trying to leave an impression

577
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,960
of a tough guy who'll attack
at the slightest provocation.

578
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,230
With such a persona,

579
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,470
if they want to take credit,

580
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,680
they'll have to think twice.

581
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,160
Mr. Xu, we've searched the house.
There's no one.

582
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,880
All the valuables have been taken,

583
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,430
but the other furnishings are intact.

584
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,340
Where is Zhou Chixiong?

585
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,640
The Baihu and his wife,

586
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,270
along with the young masters,

587
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,510
went to visit their relatives.

588
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,840
Didn't you just say he was sick?

589
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,400
The Baihu said so himself.

590
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,160
I just followed orders.

591
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,030
When was this?

592
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,310
A few days ago.

593
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,980
On the day
the worshiping ceremony ended.

594
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,150
My Lord,

595
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,840
what crime did the Baihu commit?

596
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,440
I don't know.

597
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,280
I really don't know.

598
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,590
Go.

599
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,880
Baihu Zhou has escaped.

600
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
It's too early

601
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,960
to say that now.

602
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
There's no corpse in the house,

603
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,470
and no one has died here recently.

604
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
It might be covered up with some trick.

605
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,260
Why don't you dig into the ground
and search?

606
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,390
My Lord,

607
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,790
Baihu Zhou isn't
at the Imperial City gate.

608
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,890
After the worshiping ceremony,
he took a long leave.

609
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,280
He's escaped?

610
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,510
Whether he's dead

611
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,680
or alive,

612
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,750
this lead is cut off.

613
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,640
Come on, search!

614
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,750
Brothers, pack up.

615
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,640
Yes.

616
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,790
Move.

617
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,550
Where's Uncle?

618
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,680
He hasn't come back?

619
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,850
Mother has gone out to look for him.

620
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,710
I heard His Majesty

621
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,900
ordered you
to investigate the Sangbo Case.

622
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,630
Yes.

623
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,590
What's wrong?

624
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,960
You can't afford

625
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,360
to get involved in this.

626
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,990
I'm just investigating.

627
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,270
I won't track down
the big shots behind it.

628
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,640
I have to try.

629
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,070
After all, I was sentenced to die.

630
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,710
So, have you found anything?

631
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,030
The culprit have been found,

632
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,550
but he managed to escape.

633
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,840
He ran away?

634
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,440
Then you...

635
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,750
If you can't handle it,

636
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,550
you should run too.

637
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,310
I've just come out of the death row.

638
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,880
I haven't even warmed up my bed.

639
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,740
Besides,

640
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,160
our family doesn't have
any allies outside.

641
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,200
Where can I escape to?

642
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,300
If the worst comes to the worst,

643
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,680
you can go to Yunzhou.

644
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,800
Yunzhou?

645
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,200
It's full of bandits,

646
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,510
far from the Emperor's reach.

647
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,070
Even if you're wanted,

648
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,540
the court can't do anything to you.

649
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,990
If you're really ruthless,

650
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,470
you can become a bandit

651
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,790
to practice martial arts and gain power.

652
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,920
Many of the criminals
wanted by the court

653
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,880
and those desperate men
from the underworld

654
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,270
all gather in Yunzhou.

655
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,550
That's right.

656
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,550
The more chaotic the place,
the safer it is.

657
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,480
Wait.

658
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,200
Collaborating with the Kui

659
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,750
and blowing up Sangbo

660
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,310
is a capital offense,

661
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
punishable by exterminating
his three families.

662
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,920
No matter where he runs,

663
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,640
the court won't let him off.

664
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,270
If you were Baihu Zhou,

665
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,700
where would you escape to?

666
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,600
Ningyan, are you sure about this?

667
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,070
It's Yunzhou.

668
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Slow down.

669
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,840
What happened?

670
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,550
Why were you locked up
in the Guardians' prison?

671
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,160
It's for Ningyan.

672
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,880
For Ningyan?

673
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,870
Yes.

674
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,360
It's for Ningyan.

675
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,840
As long as I can save him,

676
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,840
my life

677
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,360
is worth nothing.

678
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,870
Dear,

679
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,440
bring me my saber.

680
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,840
I promised his father

681
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,760
to protect him.

682
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,080
- Uncle?
- Father.

683
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,960
Ningyan,

684
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,280
why are you here?

685
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,320
I got off work, so I came back.

686
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,510
You're fine now?

687
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,800
His Majesty issued an order

688
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,090
and reinstated Ningyan,

689
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,270
allowing him to make amends.

690
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,190
Everything's fine now.

691
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,960
Yes, everything's fine now.

692
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,920
But you

693
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,630
should take this

694
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,440
to get rid of the bad luck.

695
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,760
Alright,
you all should rest early tonight.

696
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
I'm glad you're fine.

697
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,920
I'm glad you're fine.

698
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,880
Alright.

699
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,400
I'm fine now.

700
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,510
I'm glad you're fine.

701
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,120
Your Majesty,

702
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,760
the culprit broke into Sangbo

703
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,190
and blew up the Ancestral Temple.

704
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,320
It is truly a shame for our Dafeng.

705
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,390
Wei Yuan

706
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,340
is the leader of the Guardians.

707
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,920
He failed to protect the Imperial City.

708
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,190
He can't avoid responsibility.

709
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,720
Your Majesty,

710
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,330
(Wang Zhenwen, Cabinet Prime Minister)
please dismiss him

711
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,670
to calm the public anger.

712
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,630
Seconded.

713
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,420
(State Duke Cao)
Seconded.

714
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,400
Wei Yuan

715
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,380
has always been diligent in his duties.

716
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,320
The incident at Sangbo was unexpected,

717
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,430
so

718
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,140
the Guardians should not

719
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,660
bear this responsibility.

720
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,940
Rejected.

721
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:00,860
Your Majesty,

722
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,780
Guardian Xu Qi'an

723
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,380
injured the guards and disrespected

724
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,700
imperial authority
at the Ministry of Justice's gate.

725
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,060
Your Majesty, please punish him severely

726
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,700
and exterminate his entire family.

727
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,060
Your Majesty,

728
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,600
the Ministry of Justice had the guards

729
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,260
obstruct the Guardians
from case-solving.

730
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,900
They have ill intentions.

731
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,980
I suspect

732
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,580
that Mr. Sun colluded with the culprit

733
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,780
to blow up Sangbo.

734
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,140
Your Majesty,
please dismiss and imprison him,

735
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,100
so I can interrogate him.

736
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,060
Seconded.

737
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,660
Seconded too.

738
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,060
Seconded.

739
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,380
Seconded too.

740
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,390
Seconded.

741
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,460
Seconded.

742
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,540
Wei Yuan,

743
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,820
you are slandering me.

744
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,440
You should die for this.

745
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,840
Your Majesty, something's off
with the Ministry of Justice.

746
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,740
We all second it.

747
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,390
(Yuan Xiong, Left Censor)
Please dismiss

748
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,540
all the Justice officials.

749
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,100
Stop slandering me.

750
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,940
Mr. Sun, do you still deny your crime?

751
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,380
How dare you twist the truth
in the court?

752
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,980
You deceived His Majesty.

753
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,380
You obstructed the investigation.

754
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,070
- Quiet!
- What are your intentions?

755
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,940
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an

756
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,180
is bearing a crime.

757
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,020
To redeem himself,

758
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,140
his actions

759
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,180
are bound to be extreme.

760
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,500
You all

761
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,860
should work together on the case,

762
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,700
instead of obstructing each other.

763
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,740
If it happens again,

764
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,020
I will

765
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,940
punish you severely.

766
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,860
From today on,

767
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,660
the city gates will be unsealed.

768
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,500
Officials with positions
of 6th Rank or above

769
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,740
are prohibited from leaving the capital.

770
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,900
Dismiss the court.

771
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,260
Dismiss the court!

772
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,940
Your Majesty, farewell.

773
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,300
Lord Wei.

774
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,300
Lord Wei.

775
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Please stay for a moment.

776
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,500
Lord Wei.

777
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,340
This is what we've transcribed.

778
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,180
Take it back and review it first.

779
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,180
Thank you, Eunuch Yang.

780
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,620
Another day,

781
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,540
I'll surely invite you for a drink.

782
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,700
Father.

783
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,780
Father.

784
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,380
Why are you smiling?

785
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,620
I thought His Majesty would act today,

786
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
but unexpectedly,

787
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,180
we passed smoothly.

788
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,540
We passed smoothly?

789
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,300
No one used the chance
to attack you?

790
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,500
(The Ministry of Justice shall work
with the yamen.)

791
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,980
In just one day,

792
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,580
we've made such progress.

793
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,700
He's really good at solving cases.

794
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,380
Good at solving cases?

795
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,360
Are you talking about Xu Qi'an?

796
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,700
You're lucky

797
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,700
to find such a good talent.

798
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,340
It's a pity you were too late.

799
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,420
I've interrogated
the Taikang County Governor.

800
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,580
The report has been submitted.

801
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,220
He said he didn't collude with the Kui.

802
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,060
I gazed at his aura.

803
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,940
He was lying.

804
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Did you uncover
the mastermind behind this?

805
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,140
The Gazing Spell

806
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,520
can only tell if someone is lying.

807
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,600
He didn't answer this question
no matter what,

808
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,880
so I had no way to proceed.

809
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,740
It's alright.

810
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,060
I'm here.

811
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,180
I'll make him speak the truth.

812
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,780
Please come with me.

813
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,380
Old man, what's your name?

814
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,220
I...

815
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,740
I am Zhang Shen from Yunlu Academy.

816
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,680
Alright.

817
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,780
Then I'll tell my master

818
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,220
that the old man Zhang Shen
from Yunlu Academy

819
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,580
said that the Heart Spell
was better than the Gazing Spell.

820
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,620
I'll ask my master
to talk to your Dean.

821
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,460
No need.

822
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,340
We all

823
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,580
have our strengths.

824
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,500
This is it.

825
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,180
Wake up.

826
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,560
Officials have questions for you.

827
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,100
Hey, you.

828
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:46,980
Are you deaf?

829
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,340
It's okay.

830
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,940
Whether he cooperates or not,

831
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,260
the result

832
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,940
will be the same.

833
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,260
The sage has read it.

834
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,780
(Heart Spell)
A gentleman must be sincere,

835
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,780
and so must an ordinary person.

836
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,020
Wow, so impressive.

837
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,620
Something's off.

838
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,620
Open the door.

839
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,380
He's dead.
