It's a gift from Supervisor.

42
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,920
Thanks for teaching my students.

43
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,550
You

44
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,590
deserve a gift.

Thank my teacher.

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,800

Thanks.

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,640
He's needed elsewhere.

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,110
- Did he hear it?
- Yes.

53
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,920
I heard it. So did he.

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,990
Come on. Grab them.

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,920
Sure.

56
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,360
(This is alchemy, huh?)

57
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,590
(Supervisor showed his power)

58
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,670
(not just to give me a gift, right?)

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,760
No.

60
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,480
He was flexing his muscles!

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Wait...

62
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,550
Hey...

63
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,760
No...

64
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,830
I'm sorry!

65
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,620
(Wei Yuan, Chief of the Guardians)

66
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,470
(Nangong Qianrou)
Swords can kill.

67
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,310
(4th Rank)
Careful.

68
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,000
That must be

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,880
a big fish.

70
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,190
Run!

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,500
(The Codex of Alchemy)

72
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,960
Lord Wei.

73
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,390
My teacher is occupied right now.

74
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,440
Please wait a minute.

75
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,320
Just now, I saw

76
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,960
someone downstairs.

77
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,470
He doesn't look like your member.

78
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,200
Do you mean Xu Qi'an?

79
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,790
You know who I mean.

80
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,960
Did he solve the Tax Silver Case?

81
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,630
Yes.

82
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,790
He's special.

83
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,910
Special?

84
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,910
How so?

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Xu Qi'an

86
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,440
is a genius,

87
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,830
a talented alchemist!

88
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,670
Lord Wei,

89
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,560
hadn't he taken the wrong path,

90
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,830
or had he joined us,

91
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,440
his name would come down in history.

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
He seems ordinary.

93
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,960
It was so generous of your bureau

94
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,470
to give him a magic weapon.

95
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,000
No, it was

96
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
(Codex)
an equivalent exchange.

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,320
Equivalent exchange?

98
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Interesting.

99
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,080
On my way up,

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,320
I heard your student's poem.

101
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,760
"Fear not you've no admirers.

102
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,320
There's someone who loves your song."

103
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,260
(Huaiqing, Grand Princess)
Beautiful.

104
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,270
It's a delight to hear it.

105
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,720
I wonder

106
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,710
which scholar wrote it.

107
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,180
(Zhao Shou, Dean of Yunlu Academy)
Actually,

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440
(3rd Rank)
he isn't a scholar,

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,350
but a constable from Changle.

110
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,270
Three years ago,

111
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,230
Kui in the north invaded our border

112
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,440
against the treaty.

113
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,200
Wushen in the south

114
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,560
ruined our post roads

115
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,830
and raided military towns.

116
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,270
Other kingdoms did nothing

117
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,350
but take this chance

118
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,640
to attack the Central Plains.

119
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,440
Yet the court was divided

120
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,790
by those parties.

121
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,680
Most officials are

122
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,910
all talk and no deed.

123
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,230
You should act now.

124
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,120
Isn't it perfect timing?

125
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,080
Currently,

126
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,960
Lord Wei is in charge.

127
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,270
He's the best fixer

128
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,000
for the empire.

129
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,260
(Fang Wanshan, Censor)
Wang Zhenwen's man.

130
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,880
He's always been against us.

131
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,830
We've found dirt on him

132
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,710
to bring him down.

133
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,470
No.

134
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,030
(Fang Wanshan)
Be nice.

135
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,760
Take care of him.

136
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Yes.

137
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,500
(Xiao Simiao, Ministry of War)

138
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Cijiu,

139
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,030
you shouldn't have come.

140
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,790
Have you done copying sages' sayings?

141
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,440
You're a fighter.

142
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,200
You've never been to my academy.

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,520
If you offend the teachers,

144
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,000
I can mediate things

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,440
before you make enemies.

146
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,880
Come on.

147
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,440
You're thinking too much.

148
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,640
Look, Mount Qingyun is huge.

149
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,830
If we ride like this,

150
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,440
when will we arrive?

151
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,830
Hop down, will you?

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
You do it.

153
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,880
- You won't?
- No.

154
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,720
Sit tight.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,880
Wrong move.

156
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,470
No regrets.

157
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,790
The rule is the rule.

158
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,150
The sage said,

159
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,230
"Nothing is better

160
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,320
than correcting mistakes."

161
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,200
The sage?

162
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,080
Did you quote the sage?

163
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
Mubai,

164
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,280
speaking of which,

165
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,590
few at the Academy

166
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,110
are talking about sages' sayings.

167
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Too bad.

168
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,920
It's a waste of time.

169
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,750
You old geezer!

170
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,400
Sore loser!

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,240
Sir,

172
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,230
(Yunlu Academy)
Xu Xinnian is outside.

173
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,400
Why is he back?

174
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,280
Let him go.

175
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,200
He came with

176
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,510
his cousin.

177
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,800
Xu Qi'an!

178
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,710
Send them in!

179
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,970
- Go, go, go!
- Yes.

180
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,990
He must've had new masterpieces.

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Student Xu Qi'an

182
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,560
greets you, Masters.

183
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,280
Student Xu Xinnian greets you, too.

184
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,200
Have you copied sages' 300 poems?

185
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,400
No, I'm going to.

186
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,280
Forget it.

187
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,200
Make a pot of tea.

188
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,560
You heard him. Go make tea.

189
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,630
He can do it.

190
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,710
Don't drag your feet.

191
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,830
Get a move on. Go.

192
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,920
Yes.

193
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Yesterday,

194
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,830
you said you wrote many poems.

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,440
Mind if I take a look?

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,280
Yes, that's right.

197
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,960
Good ones are many,

198
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,350
but now, I'm in no mood

199
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,080
for poetry.

200
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,190
Why?

201
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,080
Actually,

202
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,750
I'm here for a favor.

203
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,350
What is it?

204
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,470
You also have a cousin

205
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,920
who's pretty.

206
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,400
She can go to the Imperial Office of Music!

207
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,870
I'll find a way out for the Xu Clan.

208
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,080
Well,

209
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,350
it is rather tricky.

210
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,990
Our dorms are for students only.

211
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,680
The Dean made that rule.

212
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,400
Even royalty couldn't...

213
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,830
Couldn't stay the night here.

214
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,230
Yes. True.

215
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
I know it's too much to ask.

216
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,230
Good day, Masters.

217
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,160
Hold it.

218
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,990
Is there anything else?

219
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Well...

220
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,710
Did you say

221
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,080
your relatives want to study here?

222
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,680
Yes, it's my cousin.

223
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,590
- See?
- So studious!

224
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,040
So diligent!

225
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,080
We can't let such a student down!

226
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,960
No way!

227
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,080
We cannot do that!

228
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,160
How about

229
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,960
we'll see what we can do?

230
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,400
Appreciated.

231
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,670
Mubai.

232
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Mubai,

233
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,040
I remember

234
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,510
the Dean will

235
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,320
- give a lecture tomorrow.
- Yes.

236
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,920
He'll need

237
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,350
a poem to encourage students

238
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,630
to learn, right?

239
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,470
Too bad, it hasn't been

240
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,040
written yet.

241
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,640
Qi'an,

242
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,500
if

243
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,470
you can provide a perfect poem,

244
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,110
I'll vouch for you.

245
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,990
And the Dean

246
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,200
will grant your request.

247
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,040
Yes.

248
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,830
I see.

249
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,830
- One poem...
- Wait!

250
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,110
One isn't enough.

251
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,230
Think about it.

252
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,920
One for the Dean for tomorrow's lecture.

253
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,590
One for mine the day after.

254
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,440
Mubai, you need one, too, right?

255
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,510
- Yes.
- So, together, we need

256
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,920
1, 5, 15, 18, 17...

257
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,630
20!

258
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,470
Yes.

259
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,520
20 it is.

260
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,120
I know

261
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,590
poems

262
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,680
- take time to write.
- Of course.

263
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
20 poems are indeed a lot,

264
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,320
but try to be understanding.

265
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,680
Your request is unusual.

266
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,710
If we don't make everyone happy,

267
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,510
it can't be done, right?

268
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,440
Yes.

269
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,590
Sure, I know.

270
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,960
Can you offer me a quiet room?

271
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,920
I need

272
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,160
a few minutes.

273
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,830
A few minutes?

274
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,280
- Qi'an,
- Qi'an,

275
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,280
- please!
- please!

276
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,920
Masters,

277
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
here's your tea.

278
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,230
20 poems?

279
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,830
You let them exploit you like that?

280
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,670
No!

281
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,590
They've gone too far.

282
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,830
I need to talk to them.

283
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,080
"There's no royal road to learning;

284
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,470
no shortcut to the mastery of any art."

285
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
Terrific!

286
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,960
Why aren't you moving?

287
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,040
Write it down!

288
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,710
"Studying can lead to success,

289
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,080
and happiness will follow."

290
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,280
Write.

291
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,590
"Those slacking off in their studies

292
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,560
will regret it when they become old."

293
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,080
"Inch of time, inch of gold,

294
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,560
but gold can't buy time."

295
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,230
- Write.
- Done.

296
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,590
In...

297
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,830
In the moonlight, she's dancing,

298
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,560
so light and beautiful.

299
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,220
Baby, I love...

300
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,320
Wait, wait, wait, not that.

301
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,220
That's not it.

302
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,870
"Be diligent, not lazy.

303
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,920
Be a thinker, not a follower."

304
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,990
- Write.
- Yes!

305
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,580
"The road ahead will be long."

306
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,420
(Learn and Practice)

307
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,830
(Encouraging Learning)
All done.

308
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,510
He did finish soon.

309
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,900
(There's no royal road to learning...)

310
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,740
(Studying can...)

311
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,460
(Those slacking off...)

312
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,630
They're good.

313
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,470
But...

314
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,280
Why is there only half

315
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,830
of each poem?

316
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,350
Or there's only a title.

317
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,750
The rest is blank.

318
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,470
Qi'an...

319
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
you...

320
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,880
Why...?

321
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,110
I did my utmost.

322
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,510
That's the best

323
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,110
I can do for now.

324
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,630
Please be lenient,

325
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,800
Masters.

326
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,400
Never mind.

327
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:54,880
Go ahead.

328
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,710
About my request...

329
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,550
Trust me.

330
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,400
I'll do my best.

331
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,320
Once I'm free,

332
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,590
I'll get more inspiration.

333
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,800
Be careful.

334
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Travel safe.

335
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Thank you, sir.

336
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,070
Off you go.

337
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,070
Cijiu.

338
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,710
Let's go!

339
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,760
See you.

340
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,230
Unfinished poems, however good,

341
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,830
are useless.

342
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,400
What a shame.

343
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,750
Where are you going?

344
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,590
What do you think?

345
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,510
This is trash.

346
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,560
I'm throwing it away.

347
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,510
Don't think

348
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,320
I don't know what you're up to.

349
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,920
With the half you've got,

350
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,400
you'll finish the rest

351
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,080
and make a name for yourself.

352
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,400
- I...
- You thief!

353
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,750
I'm a scholar,

354
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,040
not a thief.

355
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,120
You're noble.

356
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,320
You aren't after anything.

357
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,920
Why not let me go?

358
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,800
I won't.

359
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,710
- What are you doing?
- I won't!

360
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,230
I won't let you go either!

361
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,350
I won't.

362
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,350
I won't.

363
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,470
Sorry, Dean,

364
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,040
this is bad!

365
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,560
Zhang Shen and Li Mubai are fighting.

366
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,800
For what?

367
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,880
Enough.

368
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,550
Come on.

369
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,190
Break it off.

370
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,600
Stop it.

371
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,760
Stop.

372
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,240
Zhang Shen,

373
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,590
shame on you!

374
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,080
Stealing my student is one thing.

375
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,440
Now, you've done worse!

376
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,960
You've betrayed sages' teachings!

377
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,110
As a teacher,

378
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,800
I can polish students' writings.

379
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,160
Is it wrong?

380
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,630
I used to let you have your way

381
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,920
for old times' sake.

382
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,870
Don't push me,

383
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,440
or I'll be merciless!

384
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,350
You old fart!

385
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,560
Listen,

386
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,560
I indulged you,

387
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,830
not the other way around.

388
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,200
You have skills.

389
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,280
So do I!

390
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,030
You can't scare me!

391
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,600
- Come on!
- Go ahead!

392
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,750
Come on!

393
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,040
Come on!

394
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,960
Come on!

395
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,080
I...

396
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,640
Internal fights are banned here.

397
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,310
Greetings, Dean.

398
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,400
Dean.

399
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,070
Your Highness.

400
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Your Highness.

401
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,960
What's going on?

402
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,470
It's fine, really.

403
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,960
Mubai and I

404
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,400
were at odds over teaching.

405
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,160
We couldn't convince each other, yes?

406
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Right.

407
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
So we chose another way.

408
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,030
A friendly fight.

409
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,550
- A friendly fight.
- Yes.

410
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,390
Dean,

411
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,710
they were fighting over Xu Qi'an's poems.

412
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,270
Who wrote this?

413
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
It was my student.

414
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,880
Seeing

415
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,230
Yang Gong off to Qingzhou
at Mianyang Pavilion

416
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,270
is also his work.

417
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,360
That constable from Changle?

418
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,120
Yes. He's Xu Qi'an.

419
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,600
He's my student, too.

420
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,990
(Even if he can only write,)

421
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,840
(he can be an aide)

422
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,070
(in my mansion.)

423
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,510
Fighting over a few poems

424
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,550
is way beneath elders like you.

425
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,920
You've become

426
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,120
4th Rank Gents

427
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,750
yet haven't overcome greed

428
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,270
which is the basic.

429
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,510
How can you teach others?

430
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,310
Alright.

431
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,310
You may leave.

432
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,150
Remember,

433
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,470
you're elders of the Yunlu Academy.

434
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,440
Yes.

435
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,390
Good day.

436
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,310
Good day.

437
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,300
(Encouraging Learning)

438
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,680
Ningyan,

439
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,440
you're a genius.

440
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,470
Your half-written poems

441
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,640
can't be used by others,

442
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,120
and the girls are safe.

443
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,240
It's win-win.

444
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,550
Cijiu,

445
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm not judging you,

446
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,070
but again, you're

447
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,960
thinking too much.

448
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,360
So you didn't mean

449
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,270
to leave them unfinished?

450
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,880
I'll be honest with you.

451
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,230
I didn't write those poems.

452
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,470
I read them in an old book.

453
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,640
I gave them half as that's all I remember.

454
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,230
Now, I'm regretting it.

455
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,840
Had I known this,

456
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,030
I should've memorized everything.

457
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,070
An old book?

458
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Ningyan,

459
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,710
are you hiding the truth from me?

460
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,310
Relax.

461
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,550
I can't care less about your poems.

462
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,160
Finally, I can relieve.

463
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,070
When the girls come tomorrow,

464
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,400
we can focus on Zhou Li.

465
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,120
I need to remind you

466
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,600
to keep our action from the girls.

467
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Or they'll be worried.

468
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,880
Need you tell me?

469
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,470
I know.

470
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,920
Fine, whatever.

471
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,480
Hey,

472
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,200
you've done

473
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,990
too much lately.

474
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,710
I thought about it yesterday.

475
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,120
Without you,

476
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,640
Father might've been killed.

477
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,710
The girls might've suffered.

478
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,070
Without you,

479
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,200
Lingyue would've been in danger

480
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,790
and assaulted by Zhou Li.

481
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,230
Without you,

482
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,120
we would've indulged in luck

483
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,920
until all of us

484
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,200
met our doom.

485
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,960
Thanks.

486
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,280
Sit.

487
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,630
Sit.

488
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,240
Hand.

489
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,760
Hand.

490
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,990
You can't do it?

491
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,310
Did you hear what I said?

492
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,270
I did.

493
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,650
No, you didn't.

494
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,610
Look at this lazy horse.

495
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,830
Pull the rein with me.

496
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm still mad.

497
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,840
Greetings, Supervisor.

498
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,310
There you are.

499
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,640
The Bureau

500
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,600
has been watching the capital for 500 years.

501
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:53,880
Is it boring?

502
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,310
Boring?

503
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,400
Yes, indeed.

504
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,840
If so,

505
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,640
why not consider my offer?

506
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,160
25 years ago,

507
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,030
I said the same thing to you.

508
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,840
Sorry,

509
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm not

510
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,790
into your practice.

511
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,990
And Confucianism?

512
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,880
Being with those of the Academy

513
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,440
is as boring, isn't it?

514
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,710
When you chose martial arts,

515
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,470
I said you'd become a 2nd Rank Fighter.

516
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,640
But you

517
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,510
gave up your skills.

518
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,600
Making me come back

519
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,070
or recovering your skills

520
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,640
isn't too hard.

521
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,920
If you want...

522
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,160
I know what I want.

523
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,550
25 years ago,

524
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,070
when we first met,

525
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,990
I thought you could guard the Dafeng.

526
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,470
Lifelong glory was at your fingertips.

527
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,030
But you flicked it away,

528
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,310
leaving me

529
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,550
waiting and waiting here.

530
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,640
If I could go back to that day,

531
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,230
I'd make the same choice.

532
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,280
However,

533
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,070
at this point,

534
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,880
I finally know

535
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,600
how you felt back then.

536
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,480
You're

537
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,550
waiting for someone, too?

538
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,990
Right now, we don't need a fixer,

539
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,750
but one who can change everything

540
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,920
and make a difference.

541
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,160
However,

542
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,790
that person

543
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,360
hasn't shown up.

544
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,440
Had I known it,

545
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
I would've left you there.

546
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,360
I would've gone by horse.

547
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,920
Stop nagging.

548
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,200
What are we going to eat?

549
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,440
Whatever Mother made.

550
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,270
Don't be picky.

551
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,840
(We're being followed.)

552
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,400
(Zhou Li?)

553
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,840
How dare you get in my way!

554
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,840
- Finish him!
- Yes.

555
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,310
What's wrong, Ningyan?

556
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,600
We're being followed.

557
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,310
By Zhou Li's men?

558
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,310
It was wise to go to the Academy.

559
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,030
The three of us can protect ourselves.

560
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:10,310
I'm worried about the girls.

561
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,400
Open up. It's me!

562
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,830
Come in!

563
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Why lock it in the day?

564
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,640
Zhou Li's men are stalking us.

565
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,230
- Already?
- Keep it down.

566
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,960
We've talked to the Academy.

567
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,070
Mother and the girls can go there tomorrow.

568
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,470
Thank you.

569
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,710
I knew it.

570
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,120
The best thing I ever did was

571
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,550
send you there to study.

572
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,070
Thank Ningyan.

573
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,440
I did nothing.

574
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:44,870
Ningyan?

575
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,470
Ningyan,

576
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,960
the worst thing I ever did was

577
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,600
send you to learn martial arts.

578
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Enough, Uncle.

579
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,310
Tell your men to step up

580
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,840
patrols in this area.

581
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,120
Say there's a thief.

582
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,270
Don't mention Zhou Li.

583
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,880
Sure. I'm going now.

584
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,640
Use the back door.

585
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,680
Oh, right. The back door.

586
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,520
Be careful!

587
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,270
Let's eat.

588
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,390
Lingyue,

589
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,310
here you go.

590
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Thank you.

591
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,400
Eat now.

592
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,920
Open your mouth.

593
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,600
But Ningyan,

594
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,550
our family needs money, too.

595
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,750
Don't waste it on such flashy things.

596
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:53,630
Open it.

597
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,870
Aunt,

598
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,990
this is for you.

599
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,440
Take a look.

600
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,070
Eat yourself.

601
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,960
It's real?

602
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Where did you get the money?

603
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,550
Gambl...

604
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,270
Got it from the government.

605
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,200
Look at you!

606
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,920
You aren't too bad.

607
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,040
Mother,

608
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,360
my teacher said

609
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,840
the Academy meant

610
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
to admit more students.

611
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,680
I got two spots for the girls

612
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,200
to learn there.

613
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,750
That's great.

614
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,520
Aunt,

615
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,630
I think

616
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,360
this is a great opportunity.

617
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,160
The girls can learn things.

618
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,030
Maybe they'll be scholars, too.

619
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,160
With so many talents in our clan,

620
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,710
you'll also be proud.

621
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
He has a point.

622
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,270
The thing is

623
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,070
it's not safe for them

624
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,710
to go there alone.

625
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,870
You can

626
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,710
go with them

627
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,750
and look after them.

628
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,270
That's better.

629
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,990
No, Mother!

630
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,790
I'm not going!

631
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,110
Lingyue,

632
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,440
take her inside.

633
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,270
No...

634
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,110
Come on.

635
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,400
Let the adults talk.

636
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,310
Wake up.

637
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,600
Wipe them.

638
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,440
Is it Zhou Li?

639
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,960
Yes.

640
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,710
Is it bad?

641
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,680
Not at all.

642
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
It's fine.

643
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,200
Rest in the principal room lately.

644
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,270
Stay close to your uncle

645
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,390
for safety.

646
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,360
There are vegetables in the cellar

647
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,790
for you.

648
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,030
I've left you money, too,

649
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,920
in case you

650
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,230
need more.

651
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,000
Don't worry.

652
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,310
I will take care

653
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,840
of the girls.

654
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,790
Please watch

655
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,990
the boys.

656
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,310
They'll be fine, Aunt.

657
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,960
Patrols have been stepped up here.

658
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
There's nothing strange.

659
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,710
Are we being

660
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,440
too paranoid?

661
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,640
If the stalkers just now were

662
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,120
sent by the Zhous,

663
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,200
they missed the best chance to act.

664
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,360
Or

665
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,920
Vice Minister Zhou

666
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,990
thinks he can have us killed anytime.

667
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
He's in no rush.

668
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,840
There's one thing for sure.

669
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,230
Between him and us,

670
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,960
only one side can live.

671
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,590
Uncle.

672
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,290
What did you find today?

673
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,200
I

674
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,360
followed Zhou Li all day.

675
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,030
He did

676
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,750
nothing unusual.

677
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,960
Perhaps his father had warned him.

678
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
However, I noticed

679
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,630
he went in

680
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,840
and out of a house repeatedly.

681
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,270
It has

682
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,550
no plaque.

683
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,920
Might be his secret house.

684
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,920
I saw a young and old maids,

685
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,510
an old doorman,

686
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,840
and a woman there.

687
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
That woman

688
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,640
must be his mistress.

689
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,800
In the afternoon,

690
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,120
he went to see his father before going to

691
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,680
the Imperial Office of Music.

692
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,960
I asked around.

693
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,990
Lately, Zhou Li's been interested

694
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,120
in their top harlot, Miss Fuxiang.

695
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,270
He's paid a fortune to please her,

696
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,920
but Miss Fuxiang

697
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,470
doesn't like him at all.

698
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,440
Who is

699
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,600
that girl?

700
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,230
You don't know her?

701
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,920
She's the fairest there,

702
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,710
excelling in poetry and music.

703
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,230
She's famous!

704
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,070
And she's into

705
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,960
brilliant scholars the most.

706
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,110
Wait.

707
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,680
Why do you know her so well?

708
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,310
I heard from others.

709
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,270
I think we can

710
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,790
use her liking.

711
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,360
Do you mean

712
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,120
we can use her to get Zhou Li?

713
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,110
Yes.

714
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,680
Men are the weakest

715
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,360
in front of drinks and girls.

716
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,440
How about

717
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,640
we pay

718
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,550
Miss Fuxiang a visit

719
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,600
to gather information?

720
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,470
Don't look at me.

721
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,070
I'm a student.

722
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,750
I don't go to brothels.

723
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,310
Why look at me?

724
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,440
Do I look like that kind of man?

725
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,070
Besides, she likes scholars.

726
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,440
I can barely read.

727
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,030
I'd rather not embarrass myself.

728
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,110
Also,

729
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,030
you know I've always been loyal

730
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,120
to your mother.

731
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:30,600
I'd never go to such a place!

732
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Don't look at me!

733
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,550
I'm

734
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,070
a constable.

735
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,640
I can't go to that kind of place.

736
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,960
And I'm upright and honest.

737
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,710
Everyone in the office knows.

738
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,790
If they knew I went there,

739
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,990
my name would be ruined.

740
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,200
Could I still work with them?

741
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,440
Alright. Enough.

742
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,680
Let's put a pin

743
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,790
in this plan.

744
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,630
Sure.

745
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,580
(Imperial Office of Music)

746
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,270
(Prettier Than Flowers)

747
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,360
Good. Nice.

748
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,360
Let's have fun.

749
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,890
(Plum House)

750
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,770
Next time.

751
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,840
Come on.

752
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,230
Ground floor or upstairs?

753
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Thanks.

754
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,510
30 liang of silver!

755
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,230
A private room upstairs!

756
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,510
Please.

757
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,030
Hold on.

758
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,030
I'm a scholar from Changle,

759
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,960
Yang Ling.

760
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,990
I'm here to see Miss Fuxiang.

761
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,510
Look at all of them.

762
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,550
Sorry, I'll wait in line.

763
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,750
My bad. Sorry.

764
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
- Here.
- 20 liang of silver!

765
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,160
A ground-floor table.

766
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,000
Please.

767
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,750
Mr. Zhang, it's been a while.

768
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,070
Where would you like to sit?

769
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,030
How generous!

770
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,030
30 liang of silver!

771
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,750
A private room upstairs!

772
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,400
Good luck, Mr. Zhang!

773
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,070
Mr. Li,

774
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,840
20 liang of silver.

775
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,670
A ground-floor table.

776
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,630
May you succeed, sir.

777
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,150
Mr. Wang,

778
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,070
10 liang of silver.

779
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,280
A ground-floor seat.

780
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,560
Share a table.

781
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
This way, please.

782
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I didn't get to

783
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:33,990
bring enough money.

784
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,110
Just give me a folding stool.

785
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,400
I won't stay for too long.

786
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,240
Next.

787
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,350
Wait...

788
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,720
Next!

789
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,190
10 liang of silver.

790
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,110
A ground-floor seat.

791
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,950
Please.

792
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,720
10 liang of silver.

793
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,760
A ground-floor seat.

794
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,440
They aren't offering entertainment.

795
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,550
They're ripping people off.

796
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,800
10 liang!

797
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,030
If I find one qian per day,

798
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,160
I need months to get that much.

799
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,510
Two qian?

800
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,880
Why am I getting more money?

801
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,070
Left, left, left. Go in!

802
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,760
(Pitch-pot)
Can you do it?

803
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,300
(Two Arrows, Three Arrows, One Arrow)

804
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,670
Go in!

805
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,190
- Go in!
- Last one.

806
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,070
Go in!

807
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,910
Hey, you,

808
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,360
my master will pay

809
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,550
600 liang of silver

810
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,630
for everything your stall offers.

811
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,150
The rule is the rule.

812
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:37,990
You...

813
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,990
Let's go.

814
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,200
Hey,

815
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,280
how much is one game?

816
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,880
Two qian.

817
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,360
Can't look.

818
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,760
Turn around.

819
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,960
Good!

820
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,800
Nice!

821
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,060
(Pitch-pot)
Great!

822
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,630
(Three for three!)

823
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,920
(I got lucky.)

824
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,670
(Could it be my buff in this world?)

825
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,150
All in, sir. Give me the prize.

826
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,070
Hold on.

827
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,350
Sir,

828
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,720
this is yours.

829
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,590
Wait, hold on.

830
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,550
I meant the gold and silver.

831
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,680
What's this?

832
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Silver for one arrow.

833
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,240
Gold for two.

834
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,990
This is for

835
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,800
three in a row.

836
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,640
No.

837
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,630
I don't need this.

838
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,920
I want gold and silver.

839
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,800
Pretend my last arrow didn't get in.

840
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,920
- How about that?
- The rule is the rule.

841
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,630
This is the Jade Mirror,

842
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,550
a rare treasure.

843
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,400
Its value is unmatched by money.

844
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,390
Sir,

845
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,190
don't be blinded

846
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,630
by gold and silver.

847
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,670
Jade Mirror?

848
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,880
(Looks like a cellphone.)

849
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,240
What's it for?

850
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,200
Don't know.

851
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
All I know is

852
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,990
it's been waiting for its owner.

853
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,590
Take it back.

854
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,800
First, I'm not its owner.

855
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,960
I just want money.

856
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,630
This isn't funny.

857
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,240
Are you calling me funny?

858
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,190
Are you playing tricks with me?

859
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,280
- I'll get...
- No...

860
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,120
What are you doing?

861
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,190
- The rule...
- Get them.

862
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,780
- What rule?
- You can't get in.

863
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:36,670
Three for three, yes?

864
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,880
- The rule...
- I want money.

865
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,190
- Three arrows...
- Can't I?

866
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,110
Excuse me.

867
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,470
My master needs a favor.

868
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:43,990
If you can

869
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,590
get a prize for him,

870
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,720
he will

871
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,650
offer you

872
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,720
600 liang of silver.

873
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,510
How...

874
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,680
how much?

875
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,320
600 liang of silver.

876
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,240
He added that

877
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,070
you could keep trying.

878
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,400
We'll pay for you.

879
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,150
It's fine even if you fail.

880
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,030
Which... which prize?

881
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,310
That one.

882
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,320
Bodhi beads.

883
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,340
(Bodhi Beads)

884
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,110
Throw in five arrows...

885
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,670
Step back!

886
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,590
For the beads.

887
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,420
One, two...

888
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,380
(Pitch-pot)

889
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,590
Yes!

890
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,630
Good!

891
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,280
Wow!

892
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,280
Well done.

893
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,680
This one.

894
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,470
I made it.

895
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,030
Can you

896
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,030
give me banknotes instead?

897
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,960
That's too heavy to carry.

898
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,720
Here you go, sir.

899
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,500
(100 Liang)

900
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,600
Thanks.

901
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,550
Come to me again next time.

902
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,120
(Where's he?)

903
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,550
Excuse me.

904
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Just now, I said

905
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,320
I didn't

906
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
bring enough money.

907
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,670
Sorry.

908
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,150
What's the best...?

909
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,470
Wait...

910
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,760
Where...?

911
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,630
Next.

912
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,030
Wait, hold on.

913
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,110
I had it just now.

914
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,950
Really.

915
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,320
Next!

916
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,080
Please.

917
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,070
Ground floor.

918
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,920
I'll join Mr. Li.

919
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,030
Ground floor, too.

920
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,440
(100 Liang)
Please.

921
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,280
You took it!

922
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,950
You...

923
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,030
Spit it out.

924
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,640
Alohomora.

925
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,440
Hocus pocus.

926
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,880
Spit it out!

927
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,680
Come on! Let it out!

928
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,720
Out...

929
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,940
(100 Liang)

930
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,960
Do you still need a table?

931
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,190
Show Mr. Yang to his seat.

932
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,510
Please, Mr. Yang.

933
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,950
- It's wonderful!
- Excuse me.

934
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:43,790
Greetings.

935
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,280
Gentlemen,

936
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,960
I'm Yang Ling from Changle.

937
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,760
Nice to meet you.

938
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,920
Hello. Same here.

939
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,960
Cool liquor,

940
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,670
one drop,

941
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,820
two drops,

942
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,590
three drops.

943
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,240
Wintersweet,

944
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,630
hundreds,

945
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,840
thousands,

946
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,070
millions.

947
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,990
Spot on!

948
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,550
Nice!

949
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,960
That's terrific!

950
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,720
Thanks.

951
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,110
You see,

952
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,440
I'm new to this place and the rules.

953
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,590
When will

954
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,070
the top harlot,

955
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:32,960
Miss Fuxiang,

956
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,880
come out?

957
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,440
Do you want to see her?

958
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,350
You'll

959
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,630
need some luck.

960
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,240
You might have a chance

961
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,190
if you win the games.

962
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,310
But

963
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,360
we always see people

964
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,840
playing the games for days.

965
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,190
No one gets to

966
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,920
see her.

967
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,030
Excuse me.

968
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:05,870
It's you.

969
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,110
Hello.

970
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,760
You know each other?

971
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,150
Not just that.

972
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,190
He's my...

973
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,400
buddy.

974
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,680
Mr. Xu,

975
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,110
I'm Yang Ling.

976
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,990
We met in Changle.

977
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,030
I'm Xu...

978
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,920
Ping'an,

979
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,550
a student from Changle.

980
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:33,830
Greetings.

981
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,720
Greetings.

982
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,800
(He mixed)

983
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,550
(my name and Uncle's.)

984
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,430
Let's

985
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,390
switch places.

986
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,920
Why are you here?

987
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,110
Didn't you go to escort the girls?

988
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,800
You're one to talk.

989
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:51,630
You said you'd make a plan.

990
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,320
I'm working on it.

991
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,920
By coming here?

992
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,550
Mr. Li.

993
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,630
Greetings.

994
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,190
10 liang of silver. Take a seat.

995
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:01,110
Mr. Li,

996
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:01,960
please.

997
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,510
There you are, Mr. Deng!

998
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,880
I know it's you by your voice.

999
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,960
Yanliang.

1000
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,320
Long time no see, Congkai.

1001
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,030
You haven't come for a long time.

1002
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:14,470
I went on a trip earlier.

1003
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,670
I came here

1004
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,590
to see you as soon as I returned.

1005
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,760
Let's get hammered tonight.

1006
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,440
It's you.

1007
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,030
