=Episode 36=

40
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,080
But I met several soldiers
from Chuzhou City before,

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,160
and I asked them.

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,640
None of them knew
about Duke Zhenbei's massacre.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,240
Their memories might've been altered,

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,550
or they might not even know

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
what they did.

46
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,910
But in any case,

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,110
this is not something
a Fighter could do.

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,150
So,

49
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,030
Duke Zhenbei must have

50
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,080
top-level powerhouses
from other factions helping him.

51
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,510
The Witcher's Sect?

52
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,390
Yes.

53
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,990
Back in the capital,

54
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,080
they worked with Kui.

55
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,240
I don't know what happened,

56
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,390
but I think their cooperation has terminated.

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,480
After all,

58
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,990
Kui wouldn't let Duke Zhenbei
break through his limits.

59
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Otherwise,

60
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,830
they wouldn't have tried to kill the Duchess.

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,110
What do you suggest?

62
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,710
Miaozhen,

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,830
I need you to get the word out

64
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,270
to Kui.

65
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,430
No problem.

66
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,870
My men are best at spreading news.

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,080
I'll stay and protect Mr. Zheng.

68
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,390
When you come back,

69
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,080
we'll go to Chuzhou together.

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
Sure.

71
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,380
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

72
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,230
Scouts reported back

73
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,340
that the core is in Chuzhou.

74
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,670
Good.

75
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
Pass my order.

76
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,960
(Mighty Bone)
Gather all Kui troops.

77
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,780
(Lord Qingyan of Kui,
3rd-Rank Overlord)

78
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,080
Attack Chuzhou.

79
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,830
Attack Chuzhou!

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,710
Attack Chuzhou!

81
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,300
(Duke Zhenbei, Marshal of Chuzhou,
3rd Rank Fighter)

82
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,080
They've found out.

83
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,830
As expected.

84
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
We kept the bloodshed in Chuzhou for months.

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,270
That was good enough.

86
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,760
How much longer will it take to work?

87
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,640
Six hours.

88
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,270
Without Mu Nanzhi,

89
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,430
even if you take the core,

90
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,390
you can't reach the 2nd Rank.

91
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,240
We've found a remedy, haven't we?

92
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
Rest assured.

93
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,430
A promise is a promise.

94
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,520
I won't go back on my word.

95
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:08,570
Together,

96
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,750
it's win-win...

97
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:12,950
Your Grace.

98
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,520
The Mighty Bone, General of Kui, is

99
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,520
marching to Chuzhou with his troops.

100
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,830
However,

101
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,050
Zheng Xinghuai's whereabouts remain unknown.

102
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,470
After this war,

103
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,680
if I reach the 2nd Rank,

104
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,000
I can't care less about him.

105
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,150
Even if I fail, you'll still be safe.

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
Don't worry.

107
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,590
Are you confident

108
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,440
of winning, Your Grace?

109
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,080
It's time for the Dafeng
to have a 2nd-Rank Fighter.

110
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,560
Over the years,

111
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
Kui and The Witcher's Sect
have been too wild.

112
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,830
They don't give a hoot about us!

113
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
After this war,

114
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,880
Mount Tuotian will be leveled.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,760
That chief of Kui will be butchered

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,350
for our soldiers to have a bite.

117
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,100
(Chuzhou)

118
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,000
How many times has that girl fallen?

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,910
That's the 8th.

120
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,470
How many times has that woman

121
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,030
visited that stall?

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,320
The same, the 8th.

123
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,150
How many times has that senior passed here?

124
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,310
Also the 8th.

125
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,310
The 8th.

126
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,760
They've all come eight times.

127
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,350
Excuse me.

128
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,440
Would you like some noodles?

129
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,150
The 8th, too!

130
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,030
Charge!

131
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,200
Kui's in sight!

132
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,790
2,000 steps away!

133
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,200
800 steps!

134
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,200
Fire!

135
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,150
Duke Zhenbei!

136
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,200
The invincible!

137
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,470
Duke Zhenbei!

138
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,440
The invincible!

139
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,390
Duke Zhenbei!

140
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,230
The invincible!

141
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,230
Duke Zhenbei!

142
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,200
The invincible!

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,120
Duke Zhenbei!

144
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,080
The invincible!

145
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,760
The invincible?

146
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,080
You're invincible, huh?

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
But not anymore

148
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,200
after I kill you!

149
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,110
How absurd.

150
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:50,920
Duke Zhenbei! The invincible!

151
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,520
What's going on?

152
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,870
Is Kui attacking Chuzhou?

153
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,040
How dare they invade Chuzhou!

154
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,140
Are they provoking an all-out war against us?

155
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,080
It's a hallucination!

156
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,680
The bloodshed!

157
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,710
The bloodshed!

158
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,200
Those animals!

159
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,830
380,000 people lived in Chuzhou!

160
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,160
All of them were killed!

161
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,560
The Dafeng has ruled the state for 600 years

162
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,280
but never witnessed such atrocities!

163
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,870
I'm going back to impeach Duke Huai.

164
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,750
I won't stop until death!

165
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,830
As a duke of the state,

166
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,960
how could he harm innocent civilians?

167
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,040
He deserves more than death.

168
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,320
More than death!

169
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,680
The bloodshed happened

170
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,870
in Chuzhou.

171
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,200
The core.

172
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,590
Attack!

173
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,350
How fragile!

174
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,200
Once my core is formed,

175
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,960
you'll all be as weak as ants.

176
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,310
Chuzhou

177
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,750
will enjoy forever peace!

178
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,070
Who is it?

179
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,830
How come?

180
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,280
This is

181
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,200
the core forged

182
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,630
by the people of Chuzhou.

183
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
Very well.

184
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,750
I can also command this sword.

185
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,470
Impossible.

186
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,040
Whoever you are,

187
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,040
the master of the Supreme Sword

188
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,230
can only be the Dafeng royalty.

189
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,080
Kui from the North

190
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,560
keeps invading our border

191
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,990
and harming our people.

192
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,520
This is

193
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,230
a once-in-a-lifetime chance to destroy them.

194
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,440
So

195
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,040
you massacred the civilians in Chuzhou?

196
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,800
They were worthless ants.

197
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,400
Blood will be shed to achieve greatness.

198
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,320
How about we join hands

199
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,110
and crush Kui?

200
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,230
After this war,

201
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,470
Chuzhou

202
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,920
will enjoy forever peace!

203
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,880
Pass.

204
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,800
I'm here to kill you.

205
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
Who exactly is he?

206
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,080
No idea.

207
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,800
Who is that?

208
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,640
Can't see it clearly.

209
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,030
Duke Zhenbei,

210
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,810
you shall die.

211
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,320
Duke Zhenbei,

212
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,080
in order to reach the 2nd Rank,

213
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,710
you killed 380,000 people of Chuzhou.

214
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,870
They all died because of you.

215
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,470
All of them respected you

216
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,400
and saw you as a hero
for guarding the border.

217
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,710
But you had them trampled by the cavalry.

218
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,350
You colluded with The Witcher's Sect

219
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,470
and used their dark spell

220
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,990
to refine your Qi energy

221
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,800
and take others' lives.

222
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,590
Such extreme brutalities

223
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,160
are unforgivable.

224
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,520
Duke Zhenbei,

225
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,710
do you deserve your troops' support?

226
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,630
Do you deserve 380,000 people's respect?

227
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,560
Shut up!

228
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,960
You cold-blood animal!

229
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,320
Who are you?

230
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,750
How dare you defame me

231
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,830
and ruin my name!

232
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,510
Is... what he just said true?

233
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,920
Soldiers,

234
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,800
this is Kui's scheme!

235
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,990
They're trying to frame Duke Zhenbei!

236
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,350
To guard the border, he hasn't
returned to the capital for decades.

237
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,590
He's a national hero!

238
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,310
Duke Zhenbei cannot die.

239
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,960
He's the soul of the Dafeng army.

240
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,120
The state needs him!

241
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,510
The people

242
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,200
need him!

243
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,920
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

244
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,640
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

245
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,510
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

246
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,310
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

247
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,070
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

248
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,840
Follow Duke Zhenbei to death!

249
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,120
The soul of the Supreme Sword

250
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,230
can judge people's characters

251
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
and read their minds.

252
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,640
If you have a clear conscience,

253
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,200
ask the sword

254
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,440
if it'll choose you.

255
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,040
I...

256
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
What am I seeing?

257
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,030
I must be hallucinated.

258
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,230
The Supreme Sword has left Duke Zhenbei.

259
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,480
Tell me.

260
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,400
Did he kill all the people of Chuzhou?

261
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,180
Did he slaughter all of them?

262
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,270
Impossible!

263
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,600
No way!

264
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,070
The evil will be

265
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,600
punished by heaven.

266
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,600
Duke Zhenbei,

267
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,160
you murdered all of them.

268
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,120
Did it ever cross your mind that...?

269
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,550
Shut up and act!

270
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,800
I can't hold it

271
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,750
for too long!

272
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,120
Your life ends now!

273
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,750
Now, I remember!

274
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,640
Duke Huai used us.

275
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:06,840
We did it.

276
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,550
We killed all those people!

277
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,270
We did it!

278
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,200
Kill him...

279
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,680
Kill Duke Zhenbei!

280
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
Kill Duke Zhenbei!

281
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,550
Kill him...!

282
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,880
Kill Duke Zhenbei!

283
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
Poor people of Chuzhou!

284
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,790
All of you

285
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,640
shouldn't have died!

286
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,590
Let's go!

287
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,360
How ironic.

288
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,030
We're fighting to the death

289
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,470
for a bunch of worthless ants.

290
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,510
Ironic?

291
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Is it ironic to fight for ordinary people?

292
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,030
Without them,

293
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,200
how could you be a duke?

294
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,960
Whose duke would you be?

295
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,400
If you kill me,

296
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,960
Chuzhou will never regain peace.

297
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,070
I'll teach you something for the deceased.

298
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,440
You...

299
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,750
are also an ant.

300
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,680
Duke Zhenbei's energy is gone.

301
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,440
Enter the city first.

302
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,960
What happened in Chuzhou?

303
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,590
Let's go.

304
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Let's go.

305
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,980
(No.)

306
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,740
(That chief of Kui can't be spared.)

307
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,540
(Or Chuzhou will never be safe.)

308
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,580
Wait here for me.

309
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,540
Xu Qi'an...

310
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,900
The chief of Kui?

311
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,340
Who is it?

312
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,780
Xu Qi'an?

313
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,740
Mr. Zheng,

314
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,370
thank you

315
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,500
for all that you did for Chuzhou.

316
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,660
Xu Qi'an!

317
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,860
Duke Zhenbei was killed!

318
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,460
Guardian Yang Yan is here

319
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,860
to escort Commissioner Zheng back

320
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
to lead Chuzhou!

321
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,260
Mr. Zheng.

322
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,860
Duke Zhenbei

323
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,740
is dead?

324
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,740
He was killed.

325
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,580
His body remains in Chuzhou.

326
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,100
Yes! Great!

327
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,020
Finally, he's dead!

328
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,100
We can go back!

329
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,820
We can go home!

330
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,900
Yes!

331
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
Gentlemen,

332
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,940
let's

333
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,660
go back.

334
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,820
Mr. Zheng,

335
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,860
let's go.

336
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
Sir...

337
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,860
I need

338
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,340
a minute of alone time.

339
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,020
Yes.

340
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,940
(Seven Days Later)

341
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,260
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

342
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,980
(The Lost in the Wilderness)

343
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,540
(Master,)

344
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,380
(are you still there?)

345
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,150
(Master?)

346
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,980
Mr. Xu,

347
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,220
you can't move.

348
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,700
Your veins and Qi were damaged.

349
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,980
You survived by sheer luck.

350
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,060
Without your two colleagues

351
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,380
transferring Qi forces to you day and night,

352
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,700
who knows if you'd survive?

353
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,100
My two colleagues?

354
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,140
Who are they?

355
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,820
They...

356
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,300
- Ningyan!
- Ningyan!

357
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,500
- Ningyan!
- Ningyan!

358
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,820
Thanks, guys.

359
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,420
Thanks for your work today.

360
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,980
I'll have to trouble you again
to repair houses

361
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,020
on the west side tomorrow.

362
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,890
Sure. No problem.

363
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,020
It's our honor to participate

364
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,340
in rebuilding Chuzhou.

365
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,180
We'll

366
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,020
follow Winged Woman to death!

367
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,100
Master.

368
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,340
Didn't I tell you

369
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,700
not to come?

370
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,260
You'd hold back the work here.

371
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,740
Focus!

372
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,220
What's up?

373
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,180
Was that Copper Gong mean to you again?

374
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,220
Mr. Xu woke up.

375
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,940
The South?

376
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,580
So this Golden Silkworm...

377
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,060
Golden Gu.

378
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,900
Golden Gu.

379
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,620
Didn't you go to destroy
The Witcher's Sect in Yunzhou?

380
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,540
Why turn to the South to rear the Golden Gu?

381
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,100
Long story.

382
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,900
On the day of your funeral,

383
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,340
we were overwhelmed with grief.

384
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,580
Some came up with this idea,

385
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,340
and others agreed.

386
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,680
On the spur of the moment,

387
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,780
we set out with no way

388
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,900
of coming back.

389
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,060
To avenge your death,

390
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,100
originally,

391
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,500
we meant to go to Yunzhou

392
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,860
to wipe out The Witcher's Sect.

393
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,340
Unexpectedly,

394
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,660
a tsunami struck,

395
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,740
plunging us

396
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,660
into the sea.

397
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,780
A vicious fish coveted our flesh

398
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,940
and attacked us fiercely.

399
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,860
The three of us

400
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,660
protected Mr. Yang with our lives

401
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,260
and fought back bravely.

402
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,340
Thanks to our superb skills,

403
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,980
we made a narrow escape.

404
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,700
After that,

405
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,180
we floated for one day...

406
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,140
two days...

407
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,980
three days...

408
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,020
and arrived at an unknown island.

409
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,140
Despite the tough environment,

410
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,430
we remained optimistic

411
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,220
and tried various ways to seek help.

412
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,100
We made smoke.

413
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,380
We banged gongs.

414
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,780
We used a carrier pigeon.

415
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,900
To gain food,

416
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,940
we battled with nature.

417
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,620
It was really hard

418
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
to survive on that island.

419
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,420
Finally,

420
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,140
two weeks later,

421
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,380
a fishing boat passed by.

422
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,700
It took us

423
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,380
to Yunzhou.

424
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,580
However,

425
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,340
when we got off,

426
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,780
(Yunzhou)
we didn't end up in Yunzhou

427
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,020
(South)
but in the South!

428
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,380
Somehow, we annoyed a local Gu Master

429
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,740
who went after us

430
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,420
for one day...

431
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
two days...

432
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,500
three days...

433
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,180
Unexpectedly,

434
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,900
the Gu led us back to our capital.

435
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,860
(Capital of the Dafeng)

436
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,700
But

437
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,100
as soon as we arrived,

438
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,300
Lord Wei said,

439
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,740
"Now that you're back,

440
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,260
there's no time to rest.

441
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,500
Go on to Chuzhou in the north.

442
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,100
Xu Qi'an is there waiting for you."

443
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,910
Ningyan is still alive!

444
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,060
We're sworn brothers

445
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,750
forever!

446
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:37,780
Let's go!

447
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,420
We're sworn brothers.

448
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,020
Forever!

449
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:01,420
(Chuzhou)

450
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,580
(Guangliang)

451
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,460
Sir.

452
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Chuzhou was

453
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,460
barren and cold,

454
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,340
facing Kui's constant invasions.

455
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:28,780
But the locals were honest and kind.

456
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,060
I'm over 50 years old.

457
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,620
I spent half of my life guarding Chuzhou.

458
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,010
But now...

459
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,470
♪Out of fury, I wield my saber♪

460
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:48,060
♪To cut down injustice and triumph over evil♪

461
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,340
♪Across eternity, this realm
feels like an endless night♪

462
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,990
♪Only my steadfast heart remains unchanged♪

463
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,390
♪Stars and constellations
scattered like murky smoke♪

464
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,100
"Fame and wealth

465
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,860
are like a piece of paper

466
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,860
to turn to dust eventually."

467
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,160
♪Darkness disintegrates before me♪

468
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,060
History will

469
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,140
record this to warn future generations.

470
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,700
Also,

471
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,180
it'll write down Duke Zhenbei's atrocities,

472
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,780
leaving him to be condemned forever.

473
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,980
Will the court

474
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,140
convict Duke Zhenbei?

475
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,780
He might've been

476
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,580
a member of royalty

477
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,820
and a war hero,

478
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,100
but...

479
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,580
We have to fight for victory.

480
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,660
Mr. Xu.

481
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,860
It's not easy to convict Duke Zhenbei,

482
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,660
but there's a way we can try.

483
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,780
What way?

484
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,080
Return to the capital now

485
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,780
to seize the initiative.

486
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,140
Gain the majority's support

487
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,620
to conclude this case.

488
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,060
Chuzhou suffered huge losses.

489
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,900
It takes time for the city to recover.

490
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,700
It's too soon to go back.

491
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,100
Duke Zhenbei is dead,

492
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,100
but his crimes haven't been made public.

493
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,820
I heard Que Yongxiu had fled
to avoid punishment.

494
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,340
He was Duke Huai's deputy

495
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,700
and one of the prime culprits
in the bloodshed.

496
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,180
If he beats us to it to see His Majesty

497
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,340
and twists the facts,

498
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,420
trouble might arise.

499
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,380
As for the details of our plan,

500
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,460
we can discuss them

501
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,540
on the way back.

502
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,940
Commissioner Zheng is the main witness.

503
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,660
He has to go back with us.

504
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
But Chuzhou

505
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,180
can't be left unsupervised.

506
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,700
Someone has to take charge.

507
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,020
I can recommend a person.

508
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,420
Li Yuanhua.

509
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,560
He was Duke Zhenbei's right-hand man

510
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,980
and took part in the bloodshed, too.

511
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,080
He was controlled
by The Witcher's Sect's dark spell

512
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,020
against his will.

513
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
Based on my observation,

514
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,060
he's honest and upright,

515
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,140
calm and collected.

516
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,620
More importantly,

517
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,300
he's led the troops here for years

518
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,660
and gained high prestige.

519
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,140
The truth dealt the army a heavy blow,

520
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,060
shaking the morale.

521
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,180
He stepped forward

522
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,460
to appease everyone

523
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,460
and deal with everything.

524
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,540
Also, he's the one

525
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,060
who's repairing the city with the troops

526
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,080
and restoring the morale.

527
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,140
General Li and I aren't close,

528
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,780
but I've heard of his integrity, kindness,

529
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,780
and prestige in the army.

530
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,060
He's suitable.

531
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,420
Guards.

532
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,940
Tell General Li to come here.

533
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,100
Yes.

534
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,900
Take care of the things

535
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
of the Breeze Hall.

536
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,780
Yes.

537
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,500
How's your condition?

538
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,580
I'm fine. I survived by luck.

539
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,100
You were severely injured.

540
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,660
You need to rest for three months.

541
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,060
Lord Wei sent us

542
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,460
to protect

543
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,940
the mission covertly.

544
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,780
Gold Gong Nangong said

545
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,940
during this trip,

546
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,540
you killed a chief of Kui on your own.

547
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,140
He looked like those being killed

548
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,300
by that thing in...

549
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,940
That evil object once sealed in Sangbo

550
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
is now inside me.

551
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,100
Don't worry.

552
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,380
He's fallen asleep.

553
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,940
He's not evil by nature.

554
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,340
He won't mess up my mind.

555
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,180
Does

556
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,510
Lord Wei know?

557
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,340
Yes.

558
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,180
Good.

559
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,100
Yan.

560
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,740
I'll reconfirm it with Lord Wei
when I get back.

561
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,540
Tread carefully in the future.

562
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,700
Remember,

563
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,700
do not keep anything from us.

564
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,140
If you have doubts,

565
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,180
ask Lord Wei first.

566
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,100
Yes.

567
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,180
Sir,

568
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,700
bad news! Sir!

569
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,500
Sir, bad news!

570
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,580
What happened?

571
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,860
General Li

572
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,380
gave away all his properties

573
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,800
and killed himself in the army!

574
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,780
He only left this note.

575
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,420
(I'm guilty.)

576
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,540
"I'm guilty."

577
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,300
(10 Days Later)

578
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,020
(Wharf, Capital)
There's a little fox

579
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,500
sitting on a slope.

580
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,740
As the swing swings,

581
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,260
petals fall like snow.

582
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,180
(Peace and Prosperity)
April was always frostless.

583
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,900
Why are people heartbroken?

584
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,460
Farmers are busy with spring plowing.

585
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,900
We've arrived. You may come out.

586
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,740
Sighs and wails linger.

587
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,140
Deceased soldiers are coming home.

588
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:51,980
Silver Gong Xu,

589
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,850
I understand we have to go fast and light

590
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,860
without telling the court we're back,

591
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,860
but this is too tough.

592
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,100
Go ashore, sir.

593
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:09,490
Mr. Zheng.

594
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,570
Be careful.

595
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,780
(Peace and Prosperity)

596
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,460
Who are those people?

597
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,980
Why are there Guardians?

598
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,340
Did something bad happen in the capital?

599
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,220
As the swing swings,

600
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,620
petals fall like snow.

601
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,180
April was always frostless.

602
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,060
Why are people heartbroken?

603
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,900
Farmers are busy with spring plowing.

604
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,500
Sighs and wails linger.

605
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,820
Deceased soldiers are coming home.

606
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,780
(Shiqian Gate)

607
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,540
Go report to His Majesty.

608
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,340
The mission to investigate
the case in Chuzhou

609
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,980
is back in the capital.
