2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,440
Okay, bro.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,670
Don't worry.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,800
See you tomorrow.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,350
Alright, bye.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,260
(Yang Ling,
Salesperson)

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,320
Why are you only here now?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,600
I just sent off a client.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,870
Mr. Zhu, do you need some water?

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,760
- Coming.
- Coming.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,720
Mr. Zhao.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,240
I didn't expect you to visit.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,220
Sorry, I just said goodbye
to a major client.

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,750
I'll drink three cups as punishment.

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,030
Alright, sit down.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,150
Today,

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,750
I organized this gathering

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
(Mr. Zhao, General Manager)
to announce

19
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,070
Yang Ling's promotion
to Northern Region Manager

20
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,960
to assist Mr. Zhu.

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,430
I hope you both will cooperate well

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,480
and achieve even greater success.

23
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,880
He secured the recent
office building contract

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,640
with Mr. Wang.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,790
This young man is capable.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,870
He's also this year's sales champion
for the new store.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,860
Thank you for giving me
this opportunity, Mr. Zhao.

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,070
I won't let you down.

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,840
Keep working hard.

30
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,700
(Mr. Zhu, Southern Region Manager)

31
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,760
You're Yang, right?

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,550
Yang Ling.

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,560
I've heard

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,710
your name before.

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,120
Mr. Zhu,

36
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,310
you flatter me.

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
You're the senior.

38
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,840
Juniors like us

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,920
should...

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,150
I'm not a senior.

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,070
I'm just a wave before you.

42
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,200
The wave

43
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,000
always dies on the shore.

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,920
Mr. Zhu,

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,590
Yang

46
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,350
is a latecomer to this field.

47
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,790
He once studied for the police exam.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,120
He's sharp and knows
how to handle things.

49
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,000
You went to a police academy?

50
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,870
Why didn't you become a police officer?

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,950
Why are you here selling houses?

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,710
I didn't get in.

53
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,570
The industry is different,

54
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,960
but the logic is the same, right?

55
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,150
In the end,
aren't we all working for a living?

56
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,630
- Exactly.
- Right.

57
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,360
Mr. Zhu,

58
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,470
I'll toast to you.

59
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,080
I hope you'll look out for me.

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,470
It's a shame.

61
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,040
You're too good to be here.

62
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,190
Today,

63
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,560
let me give you a few words.

64
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,150
Your Northern Region

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,430
is full of overseas returnees.

66
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,910
You don't have to pass the police exam,

67
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,240
but you must pass the Mandarin exam.

68
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,590
Your pronunciation must be correct.

69
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,680
Practice more when you have time.

70
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,400
Salespeople who don't speak
proper Mandarin

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,590
aren't professional.

72
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,960
How can you do sales without Mandarin?

73
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
Mr. Zhao,

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,800
I'm right, aren't I?

75
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,520
Mr. Zhu, the meat is done.

76
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,360
Oh, it's done?

77
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,310
Here.

78
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, yes.

79
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,080
Mr. Zhu,

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
you're absolutely right.

81
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,800
I'll definitely practice more

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,710
to correct my accent.

83
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,150
I'll drink this bottle for you.

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,190
Thank you for your guidance

85
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,120
which made me realize my shortcomings.

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,490
Mr. Zhu,

87
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,630
drink this.
Then let's toast to Mr. Zhao together.

88
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,120
- How about it?
- Exactly.

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,800
Mr. Zhu, drink it.

90
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,640
- Come on.
- Cheers.

91
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,870
Cheers, Mr. Zhao.

92
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,110
I toast to you.

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Mr. Zhu,

94
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,960
let's toast to everyone here.

95
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,120
Come on.

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,150
Cheers to everyone.

97
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,800
Later,

98
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,360
I'll treat you all.

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,340
How about we go play
a murder mystery game later?

100
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,560
Drink.

101
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,840
Cheers, bro.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,430
Cheers, bro, let's cross our arms.

103
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,310
Let's cross our arms.

104
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,300
I'll drink with Mr. Zhu
with our arms crossed.

105
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,330
Good.

106
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,850
Good.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,840
Mr. Zhu.

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
- Slow down.
- Let me.

109
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,040
Mr. Zhu, are you okay?

110
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,560
We're in sales,

111
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,040
yet you can't drink?

112
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,430
That's unprofessional.

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,870
Yeah.

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,160
You really scared me just now.

115
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,160
I thought you were going to hit Zhu

116
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,630
with that bottle.

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,430
Don't talk nonsense.

118
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,630
Hitting someone is against the law.

119
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,950
I only took a taxi to send him back.

120
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,920
He's a leader

121
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,800
and a senior.

122
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,070
We have to show respect.

123
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,240
We've arrived.

124
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,800

to tell you all this,

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,480
Do you want it or not?

192
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,690
I'll feed it to the dog.

193
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,550
Wait, sir.

194
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,150
Come back. Let's keep talking.

195
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,270
No, I was wrong.
I didn't mean to say you're dumb.

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
You can understand it.

197
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,440
I can explain it clearly soon.

198
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,080
You'll get it soon.
You have to trust me.

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,720
You must trust yourself.

200
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,560
Come on.

201
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
Didn't I draw it clear enough?

202
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,500
(Supervisor, 1st Rank Fate Reader,
Head of Astronomical Bureau)

203
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,320
The Nine Stars align.

204
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,870
If I say it this way,

205
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,050
he should be able to understand, right?

206
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,440
When the Nine Stars align,

207
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,200
a celestial anomaly will appear,

208
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,540
and strange events will unfold.

209
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,790
To put it in our terms,

210
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,510
it's a magnetic shock,

211
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,360
creating ripples,

212
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,320
and causing this time-space rift.

213
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,550
I was sucked into this rift.

214
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,910
No, I mean

215
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm traveling through this rift.

216
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,460
I don't even understand myself.

217
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,030
What on earth is going on?

218
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,630
Xu Qi'an, someone wants to see you.

219
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,630
You have only
half an incense stick of time.

220
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,080
Come closer.

221
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
Who are you?

222
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,580
(Xu Xinnian,
Second Young Master of the Xu Family)

223
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,750
It's me.

224
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,510
Come closer.

225
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,600
Time's tight.

226
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,460
The soldiers escorting you
to the frontier

227
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,500
took 300 liang from me.

228
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,120
It's all the money we have left.

229
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,670
Go in peace.

230
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
Don't panic.

231
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,360
This is all I can help with.

232
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,840
If you manage to escape,

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,030
head north.

234
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,120
Never return

235
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,320
to the Dafeng.

236
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,630
Who

237
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,040
are you?

238
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,280
What are you talking about, Ningyan?

239
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,280
Ningyan?

240
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,960
If fate hadn't let Xu Xinnian be born,

241
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,220
(Learning Without Weariness)
the Dafeng would still be in the dark.

242
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,750
Xu

243
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,200
Xinnian?

244
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,250
Ningyan.

245
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,720
This is Dafeng's Municipal Office.

246
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,510
Playing dumb here won't work.

247
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,040
Dafeng?

248
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,480
Where is that?

249
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,440
Wait, what dynasty is this?

250
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,500
Forget it. Just tell me.

251
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,510
What crime did I commit

252
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,750
to deserve being exiled?
What kind of crime is this?

253
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,680
It's not you.

254
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,910
It's my father.

255
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,150
Three days ago,

256
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,920
my father was delivering the tax silver
to the Ministry of Revenue,

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,120
but there was an accident.

258
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,420
A full 150,000 liang
of tax silver disappeared.

259
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,030
There is a demon.

260
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,620
The court and the people were shocked.

261
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,920
His Majesty became furious

262
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,070
and personally ordered

263
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,360
that my father be executed in five days.

264
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,030
Three generations of the family
will be executed together.

265
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,070
Male relatives are to be exiled
to the frontier,

266
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,960
and the women are to be

267
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,510
sent to the Imperial Office of Music.

268
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,030
This is like hell.

269
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
What happened?

270
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
My legs got numb.

271
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,560
Wait a second.

272
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,240
Your father did this.

273
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,600
Why should I be exiled?

274
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,040
What about you?

275
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,360
The headmaster of Yunlu Academy
is protecting me,

276
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,630
so

277
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,120
I don't need to be exiled.

278
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,670
But even so,

279
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
I've been stripped of my title

280
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,440
and reduced to the rabble.

281
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,120
You're right.

282
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,200
The Xu Family now

283
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,240
is like hell.

284
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,080
I have to go now.

285
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,390
If you can't escape,

286
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,320
just cherish all the time

287
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,440
you have.

288
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,270
Wait.

289
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,870
What now?

290
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,040
Come here.

291
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,750
Can you get the case files?

292
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,200
Case files?

293
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,960
The case files for the lost tax silver.

294
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,040
Ningyan,

295
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,870
why do you need the case files?

296
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,710
I've tried everything

297
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,080
but nothing worked. Why do you...

298
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,270
Just think of it as me trying
to know it before I die,

299
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,350
or I won't feel at peace.

300
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:06,870
Alright.

301
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,750
I've seen the case files.
I can tell you.

302
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,600
Go write it down.

303
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,320
You can only fight.
Can you even read?

304
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,870
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up.

305
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,350
Alright.

306
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,840
Let go.

307
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,560
Hurry up.

308
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,000
Give me.

309
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,080
Ningyan,

310
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,100
don't tell anyone
I gave you the case files.

311
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,600
Alright, I won't.

312
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,870
This time, I really have to go.

313
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,840
Take care of yourself.

314
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,720
Give me your hand.

315
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,390
Give me your hand.

316
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,440
Here, here.

317
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,960
Survive.

318
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm leaving.

319
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,480
Whether I live or die,

320
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,430
it all depends on what happens next.

321
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,300
(Demon)

322
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,750
A demon is behind this?

323
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,960
Are there demons in this Dafeng?

324
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,460
(Guangnan Street)

325
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,720
Are you an idiot?

326
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,320
- Go check over there.
- Yes.

327
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,500
(Chen Hanguang,
Magistrate of the Municipal Office)

328
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,420
I've had people investigate it.

329
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,460
Along the way for 20 li,

330
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,270
no demon aura was detected in the river.

331
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,030
No traces were found
on the shore either.

332
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,120
No traces?

333
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,390
(Yang Yan, Guardian, 4th Rank Fighter)
This case is very strange.

334
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,630
Maybe we're going
in the wrong direction.

335
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,710
Well.

336
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,400
How about we go to Yunlu Academy

337
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,910
and ask an expert for a Heart Spell?

338
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,150
Mr. Chen, what do you mean by that?

339
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,720
Are you looking down
on our Gazing Spell?

340
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,960
Caiwei,

341
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,600
I was just anxious.

342
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,390
I didn't mean to offend your bureau.

343
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,000
But we have only two days left.

344
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,590
His Majesty has ordered us

345
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,880
to recover the lost tax silver

346
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,120
before Xu Pingzhi's execution.

347
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,790
You must hurry, Mr. Yang.

348
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,800
Mr. Yang,

349
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,510
this is the Year of Geng Zi,

350
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,030
the Year of Capital Inspection
that occurs every three years.

351
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,960
During this event, everyone is on edge.

352
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Countless officials will be dismissed.

353
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,680
Look, this case has fallen
on my shoulders.

354
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,310
If it drags on unresolved,

355
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,500
I'm afraid I can't explain it

356
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,200
to His Majesty.

357
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,640
Come on, why did you leave again?

358
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,640
You civil officials have inspections,

359
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,510
but we Guardians also have our trials.

360
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,000
Let me be honest with you.

361
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,240
This case

362
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,590
is a test from Lord Wei.

363
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,720
Understood.

364
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,000
Is there anything new with Xu Pingzhi?

365
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,550
He's just a Fighter.

366
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,960
He just claimed he was innocent.

367
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,500
He doesn't even know
how the tax silver was lost.

368
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,790
As for the Fighter Xu Pingzhi,

369
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,030
I've already gazed at his aura.

370
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,080
He's not lying.

371
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,240
He's not lying?

372
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,830
Xu Pingzhi decided the route

373
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,830
for escorting the tax silver
at the last minute.

374
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,440
What kind of demon is behind this?

375
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,350
I've carefully gazed at everything.

376
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,500
There are no traces in the river
or on the riverbank.

377
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,880
Where does this demon come from?

378
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,310
It even blocked our Gazing Spell.

379
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,480
This demon is too powerful.

380
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
No, it's impossible.

381
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,000
There can't be a demon.

382
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,160
The idea of a demon behind it
is just a guess.

383
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,920
It's the Municipal Office's guess.

384
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,480
I can't be influenced.

385
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,720
I have to analyze it myself.

386
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
There's still hope.

387
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,430
There's still hope.

388
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,590
Why would demons steal tax silver?

389
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,200
Do they use silver too?

390
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,590
No.

391
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,510
Demons are transformed from animals.

392
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,910
Isn't cat food and dog food
good enough for them?

393
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,350
That's off track.

394
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,550
Let me start over.

395
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,790
The tax silver fell into the river
and exploded.

396
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,640
Exploded?

397
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,200
Exploded?

398
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,240
Why would silver explode?

399
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,940
(It seems a demon is behind this.)

400
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,510
Exploded...

401
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,550
Someone!

402
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,240
Anyone? Anyone here?

403
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,880
What are you shouting for?

404
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,790
Why shout?

405
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,640
Do you want to die?

406
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,340
Sir, I need to see your boss.

407
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,550
I need to see your superior.

408
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,790
See our superior?

409
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,700
You're a prisoner.

410
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,920
Why need to see our superior?

411
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,200
Look at yourself in your pee.

412
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,550
Who are you to see our superior?

413
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,870
How dare you dodge?

414
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,410
I might as well break your legs!

415
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,650
I have an important clue
about the tax silver case.

416
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,190
Can you be responsible for the delay?

417
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,910
My Lords,

418
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,310
the prisoner Xu Qi'an is here.

419
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,510
Greetings,

420
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,750
distinguished lords.

421
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,920
Xu Qi'an,

422
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,110
when you were imprisoned three days ago,

423
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,110
you didn't say

424
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,680
you had any clues.

425
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,160
Then where

426
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,070
did this clue come from today?

427
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,210
Don't tell anyone
I gave you the case files.

428
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,750
Alright, I won't.

429
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,240
Just now, Xu Xinnian came to see me.

430
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,750
He gave me the case files.

431
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,920
Xu Xinnian?

432
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,110
Yes.

433
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,240
(First, I need to be honest.)

434
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,440
(Honesty makes people)

435
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,240
(want to listen to me.)

436
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,920
What happened next?

437
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,240
- My Lord.
- Kneel.

438
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,110
Who told you to get up?

439
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,400
I've solved the case.

440
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,750
Get up and speak.

441
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,000
Alright.

442
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,510
Tell me what happened.

443
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,030
No demon robbed

444
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,680
the tax silver.

445
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,330
Someone made it look
like a demon's doing

446
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,480
and committed this crime.

447
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,640
You better explain it clearly.

448
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,510
Actually, this case isn't complicated.

449
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,840
According to the guard's testimony,

450
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,830
my uncle left Guangnan Street
at two quarters of Mao hour.

451
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,620
(Mao)

452
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,570
(Guangnan Street)
A celestial anomaly appeared

453
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:26,680
as if a demon had shown up.

454
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,720
Something's going on up ahead.

455
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,570
Go!

456
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,450
Quick!

457
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,800
Yah!

458
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,350
My Lords,

459
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,480
have you noticed any clues?

460
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,960
What clues?

461
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,550
My Lords,

462
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
how heavy is 150,000 liang

463
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,070
of silver?

464
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,790
Enough talk.

465
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,830
Hurry and tell us.

466
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,590
One jin is 16 liang.

467
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:31,000
150,000 liang of silver is

468
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,030
9,375 jin.

469
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,750
My Lord, you are truly exceptional.

470
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,270
You've calculated it exactly.

471
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,350
Impressive.

472
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,430
So?

473
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
What does this show?

474
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,260
It shows that the timing doesn't add up.

475
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,000
Are you saying

476
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,920
9,375 jin of silver

477
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,880
couldn't have arrived
at Guangnan Street at that time?

478
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,000
That's right.

479
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,900
Guangnan Street is 30 li away
from the city gate.

480
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,650
They had to pass
through four busy markets.

481
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,960
With a slow horse's speed,

482
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,080
how could it carry 9,375 jin of silver

483
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,080
(South Gate)
and leave the city at the Mao hour

484
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,960
(Chen)
and arrive at Guangnan Street

485
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,480
at one quarter of Chen hour?

486
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,740
(Guangnan Street)

487
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,110
But the tax silver did arrive
at Guangnan Street at Chen hour.

488
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
That's because

489
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,110
the tax silver

490
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,510
was fake.

491
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,760
Absurd.

492
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,270
The case file records the testimonies
of the people present.

493
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,720
The cart fell into the river,

494
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,000
and so did the silver.

495
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,550
How could it be fake?

496
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,070
What you see is not always the truth.

497
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,830
As far as I know, there's something

498
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,400
that looks just like silver

499
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,400
but weighs

500
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
completely differently.

501
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,390
What is it?

502
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,350
The metal sodium.

503
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,240
What sodium?

504
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,510
The metal sodium.

505
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
Give me.

506
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,130
Give it to her.

507
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,350
Give it to her.

508
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
I've never seen this thing before.

509
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Why don't you show me today?

510
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,960
Take out

511
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,590
your whatever sodium.

512
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,670
Take it out.

513
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,070
The metal sodium

514
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,400
is extremely hard to refine.

515
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,270
Where can I get it for you?

516
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,110
It's hard?

517
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,880
What's hard about it?

518
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,960
It needs electricity

519
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,480
and extremely high temperatures,

520
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,560
both of which

521
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,590
are indispensable.

522
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,440
You go and refine it.

523
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,720
I'll take care of the rest.

524
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,460
(Fire)

525
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,750
My Lords, please wait a moment.

526
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,510
This step will take some time.

527
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,820
(Four hours later)

528
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,030
My Lords, please wait a little longer.

529
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,960
This step

530
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,070
also needs some time.

531
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,880
My Lord, could you light this for me?

532
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,720
Next, it needs to be electrified.

533
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,030
This step will release some toxic gases.

534
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,370
Let's put on the protective gear.

535
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,950
Stop.

536
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,070
This thing

537
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,000
looks very similar to silver,

538
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
but its weight

539
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,790
is much lighter than silver.

540
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,310
If someone used this
to pass off as silver,

541
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,720
could it fool people?

542
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,000
If this was what was transported,

543
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,350
it'd make much more sense.

544
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,240
Even if the silver

545
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,110
was swapped with this sodium,

546
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,030
why would this silver

547
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,680
explode?

548
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,720
My Lords, please step back.

549
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,040
Not enough.

550
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,030
Step back a bit more.

551
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,800
Still not enough.

552
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,720
Go much further.

553
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,310
Step back, step back.

554
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,790
Good, that's enough.

555
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,790
This...

556
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,750
The metal sodium explodes

557
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,510
when it comes into contact with water.

558
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,920
No wonder

559
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,680
the Astronomical Bureau's Gazing Spell
couldn't detect the demon.

560
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,780
The mastermind behind this

561
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,270
placed real silver on top

562
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,310
to deceive people,

563
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,590
while the bottom

564
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,160
was all sodium.

565
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,160
You're Xu Qi'an?

566
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,670
Good.

567
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,270
You're

568
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,590
very good.

569
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,480
Even if the silver was fake,

570
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,590
where did the real silver go?

571
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,830
This sodium has another property.

572
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,790
It easily degrades over time.

573
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,200
So, there's only one possibility.

574
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,880
The tax silver was swapped
when the Imperial Guards took over.

575
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
This way,

576
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
we have a direction to investigate.

577
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,860
Come on! Prepare the palanquin!

578
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,160
Quickly! Prepare the palanquin!

579
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,000
I am going

580
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,600
to the Palace to meet His Majesty.

581
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,350
No need for all this trouble, Mr. Chen.

582
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,000
I'll go with you.

583
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,440
No, no, no need to trouble you.

584
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,310
Stay steady.

585
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,960
- My Lord!
- Help!

586
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,800
My Lord!

587
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Don't forget your promise to me!

588
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,640
My Lord!

589
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,790
What? People can even fly here?

590
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,400
I'll just wait here.

591
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,160
I'm afraid the lord can't find me
when he returns.

592
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,440
Don't stand there.

593
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,880
Sit down.

594
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,200
You guys must've been exhausted
from these days.

595
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,000
How about

596
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,640
having some tea?

597
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,000
No, no, no.

598
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Tea's not good enough.

599
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,040
Look.

600
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,480
I'm about to be pardoned.

601
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,880
Once I'm out,

602
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,110
I'll treat everyone to a drink.

603
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,720
Alright.

604
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,790
I can wait at home.

605
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,300
Anyway, there's nowhere to sit here.

606
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,400
Here, take this.

607
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,640
Thank you.

608
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,720
Why can salt turn into sodium?

609
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,680
I once saw an alchemical secret

610
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,960
that turns salt into

611
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,070
sodium metal

612
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,400
in an ancient book.

613
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,510
Which ancient book?

614
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,680
High School Chemistry,

615
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,030
published

616
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,440
by People's Education Press.

617
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,440
But that secret

618
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,350
has long been lost.

619
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,030
However,

620
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,160
I still remember

621
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,400
the contents of the book.

622
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,790
Hurry and tell me!

623
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,160
Well.

624
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,310
I'm in danger right now,

625
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,180
so I can't recall it at the moment.

626
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
You're quite slippery.

627
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,440
Waiting for the best price

628
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,510
is pointless.

629
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
How about this?

630
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,780
You take me as your apprentice.

631
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,720
With your position,

632
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,270
taking in a convicted person

633
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,510
shouldn't be an issue, right?

634
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,310
You look like a Fighter.

635
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,740
Do you want to be a sorcerer?

636
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,590
A sorcerer?

637
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,510
Being a sorcerer

638
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,000
has always been my dream.

639
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,750
I admire people like you

640
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:48,030
with such rare skills.

641
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,750
Then tell me the alchemical secret.

642
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,920
The contents of this secret

643
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,720
are very complicated and profound.

644
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,720
Explaining it orally

645
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,240
might be hard for you to understand.

646
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,110
How bold!

647
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,550
In the entire world,

648
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,070
when it comes to alchemy,

649
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,510
our bureau's sorcerers are the best.

650
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,990
H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne,

651
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,510
Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca.

652
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,880
Are you fooling me?

653
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,790
No, this is the secret chant.

654
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,120
Stop eating. Give it back to me.

655
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,240
I've already bitten it.

656
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,830
Wait, My Lord,

657
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,240
won't you reconsider?

658
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,240
We only take virgins as apprentices
in the bureau.

659
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,640
How do you know I'm not one?

660
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,480
Come on. Forget it.

661
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,900
(Shichao Hall)

662
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,160
So what if I drink?

663
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,120
Even my mother didn't discipline me
like this.

664
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,090
Mind your own business.

665
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,740
Cijiu.

666
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,300
- How are things at home?
- Right.

667
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,400
- Cijiu's back.
- Your...

668
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,240
How's it going?

669
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,200
- How is it?
- Speak.

670
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,480
Thanks for everyone's concern,

671
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,200
but don't ask more.

672
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,270
What happened to Xinnian?

673
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,960
Why does he look so down?

674
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,750
He's not talking to us.

675
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,980
I think it's okay to tell us.

676
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,880
This must be complicated.

677
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,660
(Sealed by the Dafeng's
Ministry of Justice)

678
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,390
Xu Qi'an,

679
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,790
you've helped Mr. Chen
solve the tax silver case.

680
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,830
Now you can leave.

681
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,200
Thank Mr. Chen for his sharp eyes

682
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,750
and for clearing my name.

683
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,590
Get lost.

684
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,160
Wait.

685
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:27,880
Why am I the only one leaving?

686
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,570
Aren't my family members
supposed to be with me?

687
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,590
My Lord,

688
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,680
where's my uncle?

689
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,110
Honey.

690
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,310
(Li Ru, wife of Xu Pingzhi)

691
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,680
Even if I die,

692
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,480
I won't go

693
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,310
to the Imperial Office of Music.

694
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,510
Dear,

695
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:59,030
I've failed you.

696
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,560
(Xu Pingzhi, 7th Rank Imperial Guard)

697
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,790
Today,

698
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,030
you and I

699
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,510
will die together.

700
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,110
In the next life,
I'll do everything to repay you.

701
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,110
Unfortunately, our kids have to suffer.

702
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,350
(Xu Lingyin, Xu Lingyue, daughters)
And my nephew too.

703
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,110
Mother,

704
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,640
when can we go home?

705
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,830
Soon.

706
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,000
We'll go together

707
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,790
with your father.

708
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,920
Dear.

709
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:48,400
Honey.

710
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,640
Xu Pingzhi, come out.

711
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,230
Sign the documents and you can go home.

712
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,070
Honey...

713
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,400
I, Xu Pingzhi, have always been

714
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,720
loyal to the country and the Emperor.

715
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,590
My family is full of patriots.

716
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,440
Today,

717
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,960
even if I die,

718
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,840
I...

719
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,480
Who opened the door?

720
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,190
What does this mean?

721
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,530
Are you leaving or not?

722
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,550
If not, I'll close it.

723
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
I'll go.

724
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,440
Dear,

725
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,320
come out. We're leaving.

726
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,760
Mother.

727
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,510
Which way?

728
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,120
This way.

729
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:54,880
It's the wrong way.

730
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,680
Uncle!

731
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,670
I'm too young to be your uncle.

732
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,550
Go away.

733
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,320
Sorry.

734
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,510
Uncle.

735
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,550
You're crazy.

736
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,390
Go further away.

737
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,550
Sorry, sorry.

738
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,110
What does my uncle look like?

739
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,180
(Xu Pingzhi)

740
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,630
This is it?

741
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,440
We can leave now?

742
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,910
Yes.

743
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,740
(Municipal Jail)

744
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,340
(Noble Character)

745
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,590
This case is really hard.

746
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,680
Yeah.

747
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,810
It's also my first time.

748
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,550
Honey,

749
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,000
are they deceiving us?

750
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,110
This is quite suspicious.

751
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,480
We'd better leave
this place of strife now.

752
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,470
Wait.

753
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,470
My Lord.

754
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,670
My Lord, what's your command?

755
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,550
Mr. Xu,

756
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,630
this is your official robe.

757
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,760
Please take it.

758
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,840
I've been reinstated?

759
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,320
My Lord,

760
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,440
could you please

761
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,760
clear my confusion?

762
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,320
Dear, please stand up.

763
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,030
According to the law of the Dafeng,

764
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,800
if a family elder

765
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,110
breaks the law,

766
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,110
their children

767
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,360
can redeem their crime
by good service.

768
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,630
Our Xinnian...

769
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,610
- Xinnian...
- My son.

770
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,600
It's Xinnian.

771
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,960
It's our good son.

772
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,440
It's your nephew,

773
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,630
Xu Qi'an.

774
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,670
He helped Mr. Chen
solve the tax silver case,

775
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,810
and he's just been released.

776
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,510
He should be right outside now.

777
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,110
Go and reunite with him.

778
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,800
Ningyan?

779
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,320
Mr. Xu.

780
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,400
Goodbye.

781
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,510
Xu

782
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,150
Qi'an?

783
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,280
My foolish nephew?

784
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,110
Do you guys want to stay?

785
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,720
Hurry up and leave.

786
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,800
Don't just sit there.

787
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,440
Sir, goodbye forever.

788
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,580
(Municipal Office)

789
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,440
Why is it so hot even in ancient times?

790
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Ningyan.

791
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,740
(Maintain Integrity)

792
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,550
Ningyan!

793
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,150
Well done.

794
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,670
Oh, I forgot.

795
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,480
You're still at the Essence Stage.

796
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,480
I must've hit you hard.

797
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,190
Uncle...

798
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,280
Ningyan, take the money
and buy some food.

799
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,760
Don't tell your aunt

800
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,030
that I have some secret money.

801
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,720
Take it.

802
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,710
Ningyan.

803
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,510
Ningyan.

804
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,710
Did you bring any candy for me?

805
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:27,630
Ningyan just got out.

806
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,000
How could he have candy for you?

807
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,840
I just like Ningyan.

808
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,710
Ningyan,

809
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,510
you haven't paid your allowance
this month.

810
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,230
Mother will scold you again.

811
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,280
(She's Xu Lingyue,
Xu Family's eldest daughter.)

812
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,070
Ningyan,

813
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
this time,

814
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,120
thank you.

815
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,320
You little rascal.

816
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,650
From now on,

817
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,030
you'll stay in the side yard.

818
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,620
Without my permission,

819
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,660
you're not allowed
to step into our house.

820
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,260
Not even half a step. Do you understand?

821
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,840
Don't bully the young
when they're poor.

822
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,980
Things change.

823
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,980
Don't regret it.

824
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,060
You little brat.

825
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,420
Come out.
You're quite good at talking, huh?

826
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,500
You little rascal.

827
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,340
Come out!

828
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,760
Aunt, you must've suffered.

829
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,060
Sufferings do bring out sincerity.

830
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,620
We are family, after all.

831
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,260
Today, I'll make the decision...

832
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,180
From now on, Ningyan will

833
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,580
eat with us.

834
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,500
It's not far anyway.

835
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,140
Just a matter of extra chopsticks.

836
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,740
Dear, what do you think?

837
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,940
You're truly sensible.

838
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,020
Ningyan, hurry up.

839
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Thank you, Aunt.

840
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,260
Ningyan is also very sensible.

841
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,200
Today, I'll make the decision again.

842
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,260
Our family has survived the disaster.

843
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,500
Let's go have a good meal together.

844
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,780
Let's eat!

845
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,660
Good.

846
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,420
- Let's go home.
- Aunt, let me.

847
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,340
You've suffered, Aunt.

848
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,340
It's been hard. Come on.

849
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,220
Let's go.

Lu,

872
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,900
I've lost my home,

873
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,300
but you still have yours.

874
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,700
May you and Yun,

875
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,620
as well as other chickens,

876
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,220
live freely.

877
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,860
Go.

878
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,500
I, Xu Xinnian,

879
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,420
learned to read at three,

880
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,340
recited poems at five,

881
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,540
understood the classics at ten,

882
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,420
entered Yunlu Academy at fourteen,

883
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,380
and passed the imperial examination
at eighteen.

884
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,820
The world

885
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,980
praised me

886
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,740
for my extraordinary talent

887
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,460
and profound knowledge.

888
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,380
Father,

889
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,460
Mother,

890
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,980
I have failed you.

891
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,220
I'll ascend to paradise now.

892
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,660
We're back!

893
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,140
Mrs. Ma.

894
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,700
It's alright now.

895
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,580
Our family is safe.

896
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,460
- It's for you.
- This is for you.

897
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,340
It's all fine now.

898
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,950
They're amazing!

Xu Pingzhi!

901
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,190
- Are you deaf?
- It's for you.

902
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,060
Thank you.

903
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,500
Aren't they our Yun and Lu?

904
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,020
Yes.

905
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,660
Why did the door open?

906
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,140
Xinnian.

907
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,500
It's Xinnian.

908
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,020
I knew Xinnian wouldn't abandon us.

909
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,340
He'll definitely take care of us.

Xinnian.

912
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,620
let Xu Xinnian be born,

Xinnian.

916
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,340

- Give me a chick, okay?

917
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,340
