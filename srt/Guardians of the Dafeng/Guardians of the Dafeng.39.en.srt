45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,390
I am carrying out an imperial edict

46
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,550
to arrest the criminal Zheng Xinghuai.

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,630

Everyone.

50
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,640
Hear me out.

51
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,240
Hear me out.

52
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,520
I never

53
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,080
colluded with the Kui.

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,670
Nor have I ever deceived His Majesty.

55
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,800
I'll go with you.

56
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,960
I have a clear conscience.

57
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,230
Mr. Zheng,

58
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,320
they're coming at you.

59
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,920
There will be danger if you go.

60
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
My Lord,

61
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,150
I understand.

62
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,760
But

63
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,670
this concerns only me.

64
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,590
Thank you, Lord Wei.

65
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,990
Thank you all

66
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,520
for your efforts on my behalf.

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,390
I don't deserve

68
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,040
such kindness.

69
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,830
There will always be justice
in the world.

70
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,960
Right and wrong will be clear
in the end.

71
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,670
I'll be back soon.

72
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,550
Wise choice.

73
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Take him away.

74
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
Xu Qi'an,

75
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,320
State Duke Cao took away

76
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,780
the old man you asked me to treat.

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,680
Before he left,

78
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,270
he asked me to give you this.

79
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,100
(Take things slow)

80
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,580
(Court of Judicial Review)

81
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,320
What a beast.

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,230
That's right.

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,030
I am a beast.

84
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,790
I am the one

85
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,790
who killed your entire family.

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,830
But now,

87
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,350
you are the criminal
who's committed treason

88
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,390
and colluded with the Kui.

89
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,150
Are you going to admit it?

90
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,710
You want to pin this on me,

91
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,560
but I'll never surrender.

92
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,250
Aren't you so high and mighty?

93
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
Kneel.

94
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,830
Mr. Zheng.

95
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,030
You are just a dog.

96
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,560
Old man.

97
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,270
How dare you get up?

98
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,590
Do not rise.

99
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,110
Hit him.

100
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,470
You want to move, huh?

101
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,150
Mr. Zheng.

102
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,230
Sorry.

103
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,460
Enough.

104
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,900
Finish what you need to do and leave.

105
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,180
Delays will cause complications.

106
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,080
Wake him up.

107
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,760
Old man.

108
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,880
Old fool,

109
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,590
I'll tell you the truth before you die.

110
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,030
The mess you caused these days

111
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,320
has extremely upset His Majesty.

112
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,590
If not for your remaining use,

113
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,150
you'd already have died quietly.

114
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,030
Zheng Xinghuai,

115
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,320
you're not smart enough.

116
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,830
If you had thought carefully

117
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,990
about everything
that happened in Chuzhou,

118
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,230
you would've known

119
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,040
who you were

120
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,110
really facing.

121
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
Come on.

122
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,830
Mr. Zheng,

123
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,080
the time has come.

124
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,080
It's time to die.

125
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,630
Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner of Chuzhou,

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,590
colluded with the Kui

127
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,920
and slaughtered 380,000 commoners.

128
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,280
After being exposed by Que Yongxiu,
State Duke of Protection,

129
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,440
he hanged himself

130
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,750
in prison.

131
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,280
Mr. Zheng,

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,160
are you satisfied

133
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,870
with this outcome?

134
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,610
He only sought political achievements

135
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,350
but witnessed both the decay

136
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,080
and vibrancy

137
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
of people's lives.

138
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,870
He once loved to frequent a street

139
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,320
because of a bowl
of plain noodles there.

140
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,440
(Plain Noodles)
Mr. Zheng,

141
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,350
long time no see.

142
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,560
Have some noodles.

143
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,280
The broth today is especially good.

144
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,920
Later,

145
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
(Plain Buns)
- he discovered - Mr. Zheng, hello.

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,060
- the plain buns there
- Have some fresh plain buns.

147
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,680
were also tasty.

148
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,160
- It's so delicious.
- Really?

149
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,660
He saw the widow in the west

150
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,250
remarry.

151
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,590
He saw the kids wiping their noses
growing up.

152
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,910
(Barbecue)
How about some lamb?

153
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:58,990
He helped his father
run a lamb skewer stand.

154
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,280
For over twenty years,

155
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,040
he met many people there.

156
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,680
He walked
through every street and alley.

157
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,440
There was no lingering romance
of Jiangnan

158
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,350
or prosperity of the capital.

159
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,470
- But in time,
- Mr. Zheng, hello.

160
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,400
that place became his home.

161
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,500
(Zheng Xinghuai's mother)

162
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,710

I'm back.

Hurry and eat.

165
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,510
He decided

166
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,860

into the capital.

you paid with your own life.

190
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,830
Didn't I already tell you?

191
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,990
Take things slow.

192
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,470
Xu Qi'an is truly lawless,

193
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
breaking into the dungeon.

194
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,470
I should arrest him right now.

195
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,630
Hand over Mr. Zheng to us first.

196
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,990
After our investigation,

197
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,030
we'll trial him together.

198
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
Xu Qi'an,

199
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,320
how dare you

200
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,350
break into our dungeon!

201
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,110
Even if I kill you here,

202
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,830
Wei Yuan won't say anything.

203
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,350
Take him down!

204
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,350
Who dares to do so?

205
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,560
Everyone, stop!

206
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,280
Xu Qi'an,

207
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,800
what are you doing here?

208
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,280
Such a big case is

209
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
beyond the control
of a Silver Gong like you.

210
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,710
Leave now.

211
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
Your Majesty,

212
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
Zheng Xinghuai is dead.

213
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,800
This case can be closed.

214
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,230
But

215
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,440
how should we explain it

216
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
to the officials?

217
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,710
I will send a group of imperial guards

218
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,320
to your mansion

219
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,040
to protect you.

220
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,800
You don't need to worry
about assassination.

221
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,710
Also,

222
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,990
the secret spies you brought back

223
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,830
can be temporarily under your command

224
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,560
and stay at your mansion.

225
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,800
Your Majesty,

226
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,280
how wise and mighty of you.

227
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,750
With a smooth strike,

228
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,560
you'd shaken the civil officials.

229
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,080
While they hesitated,

230
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,750
you resolved the mess swiftly

231
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,590
and made Zheng Xinghuai
commit suicide out of guilt,

232
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,160
leaving no way out for the officials.

233
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Now,

234
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,710
they can only accept it.

235
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,080
But

236
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,630
the Supreme Sword was lost.

237
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,230
And we don't know
where that mysterious man is.

238
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,070
If we can find him again,

239
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,160
retrieve the sword,

240
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,640
and avenge Duke Huai,

241
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
this matter

242
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,360
can be resolved completely.

243
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,990
Tomorrow, I'll convene a court meeting

244
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,790
to finalize the Chuzhou Case.

245
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,160
Before that,

246
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,790
spread the news that Zheng Xinghuai

247
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,600
committed suicide out of guilt.

248
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,800
Understood.

249
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,540
(Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner
of Chuzhou, died in prison.)

250
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,960
So,

251
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,920
this was Father's backup plan.

252
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,870
Huaiqing.

253
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,360
Why do you look like this?

254
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,440
I heard

255
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,680
Mr. Zheng is dead. Is it true?

256
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,710
I'm scared.

257
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,350
Scared of what?

258
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,310
I'm scared that Xu Qi'an will...

259
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,710
Who's there? It's so late.

260
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,040
Mother.

261
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,280
Cijiu.

262
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,230
What's wrong?

263
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,310
Has Ningyan come back?

264
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,240
Not yet.

265
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,390
What's wrong?

266
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,550
Mr. Zheng was killed.

267
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,550
Mr. Zheng?

268
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,440
We must find him quickly.

269
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,750
Have you seen a man wearing a crown?

270
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,440
Thank you.

271
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,480
Mr. Chu.

272
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,040
Did you find him?

273
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,910
No.

274
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,680
Keep looking.

275
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,440
Ningyan!

276
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,120
Have you seen someone

277
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,440
about my height in Guardian clothes?

278
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,440
We've gone to the Bureau and the yamen.

279
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,710
Where could Xu Qi'an have gone?

280
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,150
Sir,

281
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,270
you've been playing all night.

282
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,440
My small business

283
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,030
has nothing more to offer.

284
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,760
Xu Qi'an.

285
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,390
Mr. Xu.

286
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,610
We've been searching for you all night.

287
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,520
Where did you go?

288
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,440
To avoid the rain

289
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,350
and to think.

290
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,640
How did it go?

291
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,160
I've figured it out.

292
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,510
Now, I'll go back to sleep

293
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,840
and have a good meal.

294
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,350
Let's go.

295
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
By the way, Mr. Chu,

296
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,310
I remembered the two lines.

297
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,400
Do you still want them?

298
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,400
Little one,

299
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,200
eat more.

300
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,440
Thank you, Ningyan.

301
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,110
Sis,

302
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,390
have some too.

303
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,550
Eat meat.

304
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,070
Why are you all staring at me?

305
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,120
Eat.

306
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,400
Sure.

307
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,550
Where did you go last night?

308
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,870
Playing ring toss.

309
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,200
Playing ring toss?

310
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,240
Yeah.

311
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,350
I'm full.

312
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,280
Cijiu,

313
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,190
I won't compete with you.

314
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,040
Where are you going?

315
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,400
Going to take a bath in my room.

Your Majesty,

340
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,990
I have something to report.

341
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,520
Speak.

342
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,520
Your Majesty,

343
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,960
Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner of Chuzhou,

344
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,470
committed suicide in prison

345
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,710
at noon yesterday

346
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,400
out of guilt.

347
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,470
Out of guilt?

348
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,990
What does everyone think?

349
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,360
How should this case be concluded?

350
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,630
Your Majesty,

351
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,190
since Zheng Xinghuai has
committed suicide out of guilt,

352
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,440
this case can be closed.

353
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,360
Zheng Xinghuai, Commissioner of Chuzhou,

354
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,790
from Zhangzhou,

355
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,160
an A-II Presented Scholar
in Yuanjing Year 19,

356
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,200
colluded with the Kui
to murder Duke Zhenbei

357
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,640
and 380,000 commoners of Chuzhou.

358
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,990
His crimes are heinous.

359
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,510
Nine families of him shall be executed.

360
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,920
Does he have any relatives left?

361
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,470
This man is alone.

362
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,070
His family is gone.

363
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
Is this conclusion

364
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,120
acceptable to everyone?

365
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,360
Dismiss the court.

366
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,120
Your Majesty, farewell.

367
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,840
Who is it?

368
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,310
Xu Qi'an.

369
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,370
You cannot enter without being summoned.

370
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,640
Mr. Xu,

371
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,710
what brings you here?

372
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,140
To seek justice.

373
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,120
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

374
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,280
Lord Wei.

375
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,890
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

376
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,630
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

377
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,030
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

378
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
May Mr. Zheng rest in peace.

379
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,470
A wise strategist

380
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,790
must know patience.

381
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,920
Reckless courage,

382
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,790
though it's satisfying for a moment,

383
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,440
can cost you much more.

384
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,640
The time is not right.

385
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,550
Go back.

386
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,880
Lord Wei and I

387
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,550
are fundamentally different.

388
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,840
You serve in the imperial court,

389
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
overseeing the bigger picture.

390
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,960
You're skilled in patience

391
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,680
and adept at compromise.

392
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,520
But I

393
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,270
am just a Fighter.

394
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,680
I cannot manage the bigger picture

395
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,680
or do anything else.

396
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,160
All I can do is strike decisively,

397
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,920
clearing my conscience

398
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,780
and staying true to my heart.

399
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,270
Mr. Zheng gave me this before,

400
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,880
but I believe

401
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,440
it suits you better.

402
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,940
(Take things slow.)

403
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,840
State Duke Cao,

404
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,960
shall we go to the Imperial Office
of Music tonight?

405
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,400
After all these years in Chuzhou,

406
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,880
I've forgotten
how pretty the music girls are.

407
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,600
These days, don't leave your house.

408
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,230
Just stay at your mansion.

409
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,360
Xu Qi'an?

410
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,590
Xu Qi'an,

411
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,160
this is the Imperial Palace.

412
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,920
What do you need a knife for?

413
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:05,910
Xu Qi'an,

414
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,880
do you know what crime you've committed

415
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,990
by carrying a weapon
and trespassing into the Palace?

416
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,790
Xu Qi'an,

417
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,990
don't ruin yourself.

418
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,270
You can't fight here.

419
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,790
You can't afford the consequences.

420
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,920
Is he Xu Qi'an, who investigated

421
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,070
the Bloodshed Case?

422
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,390
Yes,

423
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,400
it's him.

424
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,550
Que Yongxiu,

425
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:27,030
State Duke Cao,

426
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,710
come here.

427
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,880
If I kill him here,

428
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,880
will His Majesty blame me?

429
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,200
His cultivation is too great
to be underestimated.

430
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,230
I am the one you're looking for.

431
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,310
What do you want to do?

432
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,400
Lord Wei,

433
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,880
your teaching skills are insufficient.

434
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,070
Look at this lawless young man.

435
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,440
How dare he carry a weapon
in the Palace?

436
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,400
If you can't teach him,

437
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,920
I'll teach him for you.

438
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,540
(Restraining Spell)

439
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,310
Someone broke into the Palace!

440
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,040
Close the gates
and protect His Majesty!

441
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,170
Let's go.

442
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,910
Don't go!

443
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,030
Come back! Don't leave!

444
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,110
Lord Wei,

445
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,840
as a fellow official,

446
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,440
you can't ignore this.

447
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,640
Xu Qi'an,

448
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,790
don't come over! Calm down!

449
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,910
Xu Qi'an!

450
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,120
Imperial Guards.

451
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,330
Where are the Imperial Guards?

452
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,440
Take him down!

453
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,660
The Imperial Guards
only follow His Majesty's orders.

454
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,630
Turn around.

455
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,040
Imperial Guards,

456
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,440
you can't ignore this!

457
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,710
Xu Qi'an, you...

458
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,710
Don't, Mr. Xu.

459
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,070
Mr. Xu.

460
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,000
Lord Wei!

461
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,750
Lord Wei!

462
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,640
Help me!

463
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:04,880
Help me!

464
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,550
Xu Qi'an, stop!

465
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,440
I am the State Duke of Protection!

466
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,400
Lord Wei!

467
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,750
- Help me!
- Lord Wei, help me!

468
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,120
Where are the Imperial Guards?

469
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,960
Imperial Guards!

470
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,790
Lord Wei!

471
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,550
They're just paying

472
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,920
for their grave sins.

473
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,550
Help me!

474
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,510
Your Majesty!

475
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,590
Your Majesty!

476
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,070
Your Majesty!

477
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,310
This is terrible!

478
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,030
Xu Qi'an captured State Duke Cao

479
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,370
and the State Duke of Protection
at the Meridian Gate.

480
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,600
He even talked

481
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,030
about killing them!

482
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,030
Is he planning to rebel?

483
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,310
How are things with State Duke Cao

484
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,010
and the State Duke of Protection now?

485
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,610
They've been taken out of the Palace.

486
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,360
Hurry and stop him!

487
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,030
If anyone resists,

488
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,550
kill them on the spot!

489
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,480
Yes!

490
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,840
How dare he defy me!

491
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,030
How rebellious!

492
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,400
How rebellious!

493
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,390
Mr. Xu,

494
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,630
how about

495
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,930
I treat you to a bowl of plain noodles?

496
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,970
I'm over fifty,

497
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,120
reaching the age of knowing my fate.

498
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,120
I've never had grand ambitions.

499
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,230
I just wanted to take care of my mother,

500
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,030
spend time with my kids and grandkids,

501
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,440
and keep Chuzhou peaceful.

502
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,990
But overnight,

503
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,600
Chuzhou was lost,

504
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,830
and those people

505
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,960
were all dead.

506
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,710
Maybe Lord Wei is right

507
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,160
about taking things slow.

508
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,270
But

509
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,270
I can't stop.

510
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,070
Chu Yuanzhen,

511
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,470
are you planning to rebel

512
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,850
and become a wanted criminal?

513
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,120
I spent ten years

514
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,510
sharpening my sword.

515
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,230
Its edge

516
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,960
has never been tested.

517
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,470
Today,

518
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,070
it's shown to the world.

519
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,030
Who

520
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,560
needs

521
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,360
help

522
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,720
with grievances?

523
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,470
His Majesty has ordered

524
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,920
that anyone who resists

525
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,030
be killed on the spot.

526
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,400
Try me!

527
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,590
This time,

528
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,400
we've really stirred up a hornet's nest.

529
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,840
Leave if you're afraid.

530
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,550
I'm here.

531
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,550
How could I

532
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,800
not be part of this?

533
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,960
Isn't this Mr. Xu?

534
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,800
Yeah.

535
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,280
Who are those two?

536
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,350
The one-eyed man is

537
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,320
Que Yongxiu, State Duke of Protection.

538
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:41,430
Look.

539
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,540
With so many people here,

540
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,510
your death will be worth it.

541
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,360
He accused Zheng Xinghuai,
Commissioner of Chuzhou,

542
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,320
of colluding with the Kui
to murder Duke Zhenbei.

543
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,760
Yeah, how could they do this?

544
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,590
What's happening?

545
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:58,190
It's probably about the Chuzhou Case.

546
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,630
I'm a Tier I Duke,

547
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,240
a descendant of a founding hero.

548
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,630
If you kill me,

549
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,150
you won't have a place
in the Dafeng anymore.

550
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,240
When I meet His Majesty,

551
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
I will surely beg him

552
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,470
to forgive you.

553
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,320
Mr. Xu,

554
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
please spare me.

555
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,070
It was Duke Zhenbei
and the State Duke of Protection.

556
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,800
They slaughtered the city.

557
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,840
They did it.

558
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,030
It has nothing to do with me!

559
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,110
- Nonsense!
- You're the one talking nonsense!

560
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,190
You weren't in the capital.

561
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,720
You don't know him.

562
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,560
He's a madman.

563
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,190
He really will kill us.

564
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,720
Please don't!

565
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,080
Speak louder.

566
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,240
Tell the people.

567
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,470
Who was it

568
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,630
that massacred Chuzhou?

569
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,280
It was Duke Zhenbei

570
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,670
and the State Duke of Protection
who massacred the city!

571
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,030
It was them!

572
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,880
Who would've thought of that?

573
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,830
That's not enough.

574
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
Zheng Xinghuai...

575
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,150
He was innocent.

576
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,320
Everything he said was the truth.

577
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,800
I've said it. Please don't kill me!

578
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
So, it was Duke Zhenbei and Que Yongxiu

579
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,670
who slaughtered the Chuzhou people!

580
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,510
No wonder Mr. Zheng died.

581
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,360
It was you two who caused it.

582
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,760
Que Yongxiu

583
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,470
is trying to cover up the truth.

584
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,280
Kill him!

585
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,110
- Don't!
- Kill him!

586
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,030
Kill him!

587
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,720
Avenge Mr. Zheng!

588
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Kill him!

589
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,600
Help!

590
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,640
Help me!

591
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,190
Come and save me!

592
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,240
His Majesty has ordered

593
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,840
to capture Xu Qi'an!

594
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:07,150
Come and save me!

595
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,960
Come and save me!

596
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,240
Take him down!

597
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,150
Save me...

598
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,920
Xu Qi'an,

599
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,360
what do you want to do?

600
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,720
Seize him!
