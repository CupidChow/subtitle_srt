The meaning of life is

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,750
a broad concept.

42
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,160
Life is meaningful per se.

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,670
I came.

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,720
I did.

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,190
I had.

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,520
Whether you succeed or fail,

47
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,190
isn't your life

48
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,870
meaningful per se?

49
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,110
Also...

50
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,710
Who are you?

51
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,390
This is my life.

52
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,760
Who are you to interfere?

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,240
Who are you to judge it?

54
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,360
People's lives are different.

55
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,760
We live in our own ways.

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,270
If everyone copies yours,

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,320
all living in the same way,

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,590
that kind of life is meaningless.

59
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,870
We define our own lives.

60
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,230
Listen,

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,830
don't think you're so good by asking me

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,800
pretentious questions with a long face.

63
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,430
If you really are good,

64
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,270
then tell me,

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,150
what's the meaning of your life?

66
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,360
You don't know, do you?

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,590
So shut up and listen.

68
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,670
I'm so sick of your...

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,320
Hold on.

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,640

71
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,550

Don't leave.

75
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,550
We'll continue

76
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,760

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
- Director!
- Do CPR!

78
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,390
- Got it.
- Yes.

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,430
- Mr. Yang, stay put.
- Don't go!

80
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,550
- Sir, lie down.
- Carry on in my next life!

81
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,590
Hey, Ku,

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,520
where was I?

83
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,800
The meaning of life.

84
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Yes, right.

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,320
I've figured it out.

86
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
The meaning of my life is to come here

87
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,990
to scold you!

88
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,430
Did you have nothing to do in Tianyu
that you came

89
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,150
to the Dafeng to find the meaning of life?

90
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,960
Go back to find it in Tianyu.

91
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,670
You asked me about the meaning of life.

92
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,970
I want to ask you something.

93
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,870
What's the meaning of work?

94
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,710
What's the meaning of eating?

95
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,520
What's the meaning of love?

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,480
Think it over.

97
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm dying again.

98
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640

99
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,560

100
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,200
- Mr. Yang,
- Don't go.

101
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,000
- stay put.
- Carry on in my next life.

103
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,350
have you figured it out?

104
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,270
What's the meaning of love?

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Answer me.

106
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,350
Wait. Have you never been in love?

107
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,760
Oh, Ku,

108
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,830
you really are a poor boy!

109
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080

110
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,230

111
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,560

112
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,200
Also no?

113
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,000
I feel bad for you two.

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,960
You have a nice mustache.

115
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,320
Girls don't like you?

116
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,910
You don't even know love.

117
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,200
Forget about life!

118
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,830
You know nothing!

119
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,520

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,270

deal with our own sorrow and regrets.

186

Just take things as they come.

Whether we smile or cry,

188
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,350
we'll have to face it.

189
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,030

lost.

227
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,040
We won.

228
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,830
We won, Father!

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,830
We won!

Ningyan won!

236
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,200
I knew it. That's my nephew,

237
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
right?

238
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,200

200 liang of silver a year,

Pingzhi!

241
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,200
Ningyan is an extraordinary talent.

242
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,960
My nephew is the best!

243
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,080
When can I be as great as him?

244
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,230
Calm down.

245
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,800
My nephew is brilliant.

246
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,160
Wei Yuan has gained another warrior.

247
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
He was always mediocre,

248
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,830
but he made it this time.

249
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,320
I knew Ningyan was able to win.

250
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,830
Still, he's slightly

251
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,440
inferior to you.

252
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,040
Simu.

253
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,160
Xinnian.

254
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,960
Xu Qi'an

255
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,350
defeated Tianyu with a saber alone.

256
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,200
Did he win with Supervisor's help in secret?

257
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,960
This duel wasn't about cultivation.

258
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,560
An ordinary man's bravery

259
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,510
could take the enemy unawares.

260
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,110
Am I right?

261
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,400
Supervisor, you made the right choice.

262
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,680
Xu Qi'an!

263
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,560
Lin'an...

264
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,750
Help him, Loong!

265
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,160
You're awake.

266
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,800
Dean Zhao,

267
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,110
why am I...

268
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,640
Here?

269
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
The knife in your hand

270
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,560
is most cherished by the Academy.

271
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,200
You've been holding it.

272
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,110
No one could draw it out.

273
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,560
That's why you were

274
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,710
brought back here.

275
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,320
Thank you, Dean.

276
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,060
(Second Sage's Hall)

277
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,510
Did it belong to the Second Sage?

278
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,400
That's right.

279
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,750
Ever since he passed away,

280
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,230
his knife

281
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,990
has been quiet for over 1,000 years.

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,710
Is Mr. Xu awake?

283
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,470
His Majesty sent me to check on him.

284
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,200
Greetings, Dean Zhao.

285
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,830
Mr. Xu,

286
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,470
it's great to see you awake.

287
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,040
His Majesty needs to ask you something.

288
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,110
Zhao Shou?

289
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,560
Your Majesty,

290
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
Dean Zhao said

291
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,710
if the Yunlu Academy could

292
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,280
resist Tianyu 400 years ago,

293
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,960
so can it now.

294
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,990
Did he activate the Second Sage's Knife?

295
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
He said the masters joined hands

296
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,510
and activated it together.

297
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,870
As for the Loong,

298
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,470
the activated knife

299
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,680
brought back the Second Sage's energy,

300
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,920
so...

301
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,800
What did Supervisor say?

302
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,830
Your Majesty,

303
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,960
Supervisor

304
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,110
agreed with their sayings.

305
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,320
What about Xu Qi'an?

306
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,350
Did he say anything?

307
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,440
Mr. Xu said,

308
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,470
"I wouldn't dare take credit

309
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,830
for breaking the Dharma.

310
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,280
I'd appreciate it

311
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,230
if His Majesty

312
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,510
could grant me a reward."

313
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,680
I didn't know you helped me.

314
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,470
Tianyu was provoking our state.

315
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,750
The Academy couldn't sit and do nothing.

316
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,920
While the energy lingers,

317
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,710
I'm going to meditate
at the Second Sage's Hall.

318
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,080
Mr. Xu,

319
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,560
make yourself at home.

320
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,160
Dean,

321
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,680
I have one more question.

322
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,510
The Dafeng holds a galaxy of talents.

323
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,440
Wouldn't it be better if the Academy
and the Bureau fought together?

324
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,920
Why choose me of all people?

325
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,920
There are many talents,

326
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,470
but as for those

327
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,470
who're close to the two sides,

328
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,230
other than you,

329
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,070
is there anyone else?

330
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,440
Thanks for your appreciation.

331
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,880
How long did I sleep?

332
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,620
(Second Sage's Hall)

333
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,960
I see that you chose him.

334
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,230
So did the Second Sage, right?

335
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,470
He could awaken the knife

336
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,600
and command the Power of All.

337
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,840
Clearly, he owns the great fortune of humans.

338
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,200
No one would be better than him.

339
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,840
I chose him not for his great fortune.

340
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,360
The real reason that Xu Qi'an won

341
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,600
was because of his personality.

342
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
He's extraordinarily persistent,

343
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,440
but he's also an ordinary man.

344
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,200
This mission is vital.

345
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,160
However talented he is,

346
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,470
he remains inexperienced.

347
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,710
He doesn't know what lies ahead of him.

348
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,160
Can he take

349
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,710
this huge responsibility?

350
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,790
One lapse can

351
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,300
plunge the Yunlu Academy

352
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,980
and even the world

353
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,900
into dire straits.

354
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,780
When a storm comes,

355
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,380
heroes will rise from chaos.

356
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,260
That's the universal law.

357
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,060
Now that he's emerged,

358
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,180
I believe that day will come soon.

359
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,340
What we old geezers can do

360
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,660
is be his shield for now.

361
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,380
I'm concerned about his great fortune.

362
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
After all,

363
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,540
it belongs to the Dafeng royalty.

364
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,540
Now,

365
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,260
he's in the capital

366
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,500
and right under His Majesty's nose.

367
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,140
Are you sure he won't find out?

368
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,460
As you said,

369
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,140
we old geezers will be his shield.

370
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,780
If Yuanjing means to touch him,

371
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,180
he'll have to think it through.

372
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Master said

373
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,250
you were thinking too much.

374
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:39,540
If Xu Qi'an carried royalty's fortune,

375
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,780
she'd know instantly

376
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,620
and tell you about it.

377
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,140
What if someone

378
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,380
helped him conceal it?

379
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,660
Conceal fortune?

380
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,620
As far as I know,

381
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,340
those who can achieve that

382
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,620
are less than three in the Dafeng.

383
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,980
None of them

384
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,540
would dare defy you, Your Majesty.

385
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,820
You're supported by everyone.

386
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,100
You were chosen by heaven.

387
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,700
Why not

388
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,580
stop troubling yourself,

389
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,300
Your Majesty?

390
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,620
Maybe I was thinking too much.

391
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,540
Alright.

392
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,660
Enough of that.

393
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,940
The State Preceptor is watching

394
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,300
the Dafeng for me

395
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,660
even in closed cultivation.

396
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm pleased and grateful.

397
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,220
I'll relay your gratitude

398
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,660
to my master.

399
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,980
Am I thinking too much,

400
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,620
or is the State Preceptor

401
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,940
lying to me as well?

402
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,620
Your Majesty,

403
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,580
you've had a long day.

404
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,140
Don't exhaust yourself.

405
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,460
Why not take a break?

406
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,540
What reward did Xu Qi'an want?

407
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,700
He wanted

408
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,300
the rank of viscount.

409
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,500
Although he won the duel,

410
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,340
he wouldn't have had this chance

411
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,980
without your appreciation.

412
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,940
Rewarding him with some valuables

413
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,460
is already

414
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,820
too great an honor to him.

415
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,380
The rank of nobility

416
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,820
can't be granted easily.

417
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,420
He did

418
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,500
overreach himself.

419
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,060
Grant his wish.

420
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,180
Yes.

421
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,780
Summon

422
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
the tri-ministries to the Palace.

423
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,900
Tell them

424
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,980
I've selected

425
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,340
the Lead Investigator

426
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,700
of the bloodshed.

427
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,140
Yes.

428
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,300
(Even if I'm paranoid,)

429
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,380
(I can't keep you alive,)

430
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,340
(Xu Qi'an.)

431
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,660
Lord Wei,

432
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,860
Dean Zhao said

433
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,220
I was chosen

434
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,060
because

435
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,620
I was the only one close to the Yunlu Academy

436
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,660
and the Bureau.

437
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,180
There was no one else.

438
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,300
What do you think?

439
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,460
If you ask me,

440
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,780
Supervisor was sure

441
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,460
that we'd win the duel.

442
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,580
Whoever was there to fight

443
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,820
would gain merits.

444
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,500
I serve under you.

445
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,900
He recommended me

446
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,180
to do you a favor as a friendly gesture.

447
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,380
Serve tea.

448
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,180
(Shaoyin Palace)

449
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,340
How did it go?

450
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,940
Your Highness, your mother said your action

451
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,340
of breaking into the Academy

452
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,850
provoked much discussion in the Palace.

453
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,340
To prevent more rumors, you're grounded.

454
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,180
No negotiation.

455
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,580
Not even a walk outside?

456
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,340
Everyone knows that's not what you'd do.

457
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,260
You want to see Mr. Xu.

458
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,100
I...

459
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Yes, so what?

460
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,060
My guest adviser won honor for the state,

461
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,180
but I'm not sure if he's still alive.

462
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,860
Can't I be worried?

463
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,980
Come.

464
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,660
The guards are watching me closely.

465
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,620
I can't get out,

466
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,700
but you're free.

467
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,180
From now on,

468
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,540
you're Princess Lin'an

469
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,620
while I'm Gang.

470
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,220
Let's swap our clothes
and disguise ourselves.

471
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,660
When the guards change shifts,

472
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,020
I can sneak out from the back door.

473
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,620
No, Your Highness.

474
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,380
It's too risky.

475
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,180
I'll only take a quick peek from afar.

476
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,860
Just one peek!

477
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,340
Once I'm sure he's fine,

478
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,210
I'll come back.

479
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:26,180
No one will find out.

480
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,860
But if someone finds out

481
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,220
and reports it to your mother,

482
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,060
I'll be severely punished.

483
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,940
You say no to everything.

484
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,380
What else can I do?

485
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,740
Am I nice to you?

486
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,220
Yes...

487
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,110
No...

488
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,580
- Yes!
- Good.

489
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,540
Play me for a few days.

490
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,020
No, just half a day.

491
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,580
A few hours are enough.

492
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,780
I'll be quick.

493
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,980
Your Highness! Your Highness!

494
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,140
News came in from the outside.

495
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,620
Mr. Xu has woken up!

496
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,660
Really?

497
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,300
A fine Tianyu saber

498
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,460
made by Zhu Maogong.

499
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,860
Worth at least 800 liang.

500
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,620
(Wang Simu)

501
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,380
From the new Minister of Rites.

502
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,580
An emerald hairpin.

503
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,300
Given its quality,

504
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,740
it's only worth...

505
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,860
about 200 liang.

506
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,740
But there are 12 of them,

507
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,900
worth at least 2,000 liang.

508
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,740
Let me see.

509
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,140
From the Minister of War's wife.

510
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,020
This drawing...

511
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,260
is a treasure.

512
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,780
It should be a real masterpiece
by the late artist Gu Yunzhi,

513
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,500
the top of the Four Dafeng Artists.

514
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,700
It must be priceless.

515
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,940
Easy. Simu gave it to me.

516
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,460
It's different from those gifts.

517
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,300
Good.

518
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,660
Very good.

519
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,260
Very well!

520
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,140
Excellent.

521
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,540
While I was away in the last few days,

522
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,300
our family

523
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,820
underwent great changes.

524
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,100
Who gave you that screen?

525
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,220
The Minister of Works had it made earlier.

526
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,020
Ever since I broke the Dharma,

527
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,020
you all have more or less benefited from it.

528
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,020
That's true.

529
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,820
Thanks to you, Ningyan,

530
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,380
the Xu Clan has gained great honor.

531
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,660
You're our hero!

532
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,220
Father, not just our hero.

533
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,140
He's also the hero of the Dafeng.

534
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,140
- Right.
- Of course.

535
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,020
Ningyan has made me proud, too.

536
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,500
I could sit with others.

537
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,780
Great job, Ningyan.

538
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,380
All of you took it for granted

539
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,900
that you deserved those gifts

540
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,420
and completely forgot about your "hero".

541
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,700
When I woke up,

542
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,900
none of you was there.

543
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,020
Lingyue,

544
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,620
is the chicken stew still on the stove?

545
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,380
Yes, to welcome Ningyan back home.

546
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,940
Hold on!

547
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,540
Aunt and Lingyue

548
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,660
couldn't visit

549
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,100
a man alone.

550
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,860
I forgive you two.

551
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,820
As for you guys...

552
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,940
Uncle,

553
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,540
I'm your nephew by blood!

554
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,980
And you, Cijiu.

555
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
You study at the Yunlu Academy.

556
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,660
I was there, unconscious, for days.

557
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,300
How could you leave me there alone?

558
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,700
Are we still family?

559
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,740
Ningyan,

560
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,980
you were wrong about us.

561
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,340
After you fainted, we were worried.

562
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,980
We followed Dean Zhao to the Academy

563
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,020
to look after you,

564
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,980
but someone else beat us to it.

565
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,980
When we arrived,

566
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,420
Princess Lin'an

567
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,420
was right behind us.

568
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,820
Dean Zhao, Dean Zhao,

569
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,100
you brought him back,

570
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,020
so you could save his life, right?

571
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

572
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,020
Mr. Xu fainted

573
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,380
simply because

574
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,740
he exhausted his energy.

575
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,980
He'll be fine

576
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,340
after a few days of rest.

577
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,700
Please follow me.

578
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,180
After you.

579
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,100
She couldn't stop worrying

580
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,420
until she heard you'd be fine.

581
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,380
Then we went to check on you.

582
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,460
Allow me.

583
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,570
♪Thousands of words♪

584
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:12,000

Allow me.

591
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,340
It is a bit hot.

592
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,140
Allow me.

593
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,860
Sure.

594
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,700
It was like that.

595
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,420
We meant to take care of you,

596
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,180
but with Princess Lin'an there,

597
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,820
there was nothing we could do.

598
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,580
Later,

599
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,900
she sent us away, saying she could

600
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,720
look after you alone.

601
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
So,

602
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,660
Lin'an was there.

603
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,980
How come I didn't see her?

604
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,300
She looked after you for two days and nights,

605
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,300
but that was

606
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,860
improper after all.

607
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,740
That's right.

608
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,660
Get out.

609
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,140
- Mother...
- Lin'an!

610
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,100
Ouch!

611
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,820
Lin'an,

612
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,780
you're a princess,

613
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,020
an unmarried princess.

614
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,260
Here you're looking after a single man,

615
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,100
and you...

616
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,300
were lying next to him.

617
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,460
That was indecent.

618
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,140
If words get out, who will marry you?

619
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,260
Mother,

620
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,180
he's my guest adviser

621
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,420
and a national hero.

622
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,340
As a princess,

623
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,500
I should wait for him

624
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,780
to wake up and make sure he's fine

625
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,500
for our relationship and his merits.

626
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,340
Mother,

627
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,580
Lin'an,

628
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,380
I'll have others stay with him.

629
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,420
Don't worry.

630
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,780
But you shouldn't be here.

631
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,380
Mother,

632
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,540
I'll take her back.

633
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,900
How is he?

634
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,460
Dean Zhao said

635
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,780
he'd be fine.

636
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,420
I see.

637
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,980
I heard she was brought back and rounded.

638
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,980
I wonder how she's doing.

639
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,060
Ningyan,

640
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,220
that was all because of you!

641
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,260
(Shaoyin Palace)

642
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,940
- Really?
- Absolutely.

643
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,460
Our men said Mr. Xu was in fine fig.

644
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,820
He went to the Guardian Yamen

645
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,980
and then headed home.

646
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,980
And

647
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,300
there's better news.

648
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,060
Better news?

649
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,940
On my way back just now,

650
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,300
I saw Eunuch Yang

651
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,740
rushing to the Hanlin Academy.

652
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,020
Turns out, he went there

653
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,780
to have them draft an edict to reward Mr. Xu.

654
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,940
It's

655
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,140
a big reward!

656
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,940
What is it? Say it!

657
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,380
You may take a guess.

658
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,340
Don't leave me hanging.

659
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,820
I heard he asked for it himself,

660
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,140
the rank of viscount.

661
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,780
The rank of viscount?

662
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,860
Yes.

663
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,340
His Majesty has granted it.

664
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,500
Good choice.

665
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,740
Smart choice.

666
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,580
I'm not blabbering.

667
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,980
Actually,

668
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,780
I asked for this rank for you, Cijiu.

669
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,860
For me?

670
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,900
At first,

671
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,220
I also didn't understand

672
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,180
until Princess Lin'an enlightened me.

673
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,060
If our family wants to keep a foothold,

674
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:37,180
my relationship with the two princesses

675
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,820
is not enough.

676
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,580
The rank of viscount

677
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,900
isn't about power.

678
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,740
Do you know what it's about?

679
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,060
It's about...

680
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,740
honor and social status.

681
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,860
Wrong.

682
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,660
You silly boy.

683
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,260
With that rank, you and Simu

684
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,700
will be matched in terms of status.

685
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,260
Ningyan...

686
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,420
That's the best I can do for you.

687
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,100
But you guys

688
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,100
are a disappointment,

689
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,540
taking so many gifts from others.

690
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,860
Give me that.

691
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,660
The saber.

692
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,620
You were happy,

693
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,020
but you forgot I'm a Guardian.

694
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,380
These gifts are too expensive.

695
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,940
What should I tell Lord Wei?

696
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,700
Did you consider I'd be impeached?

697
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
Now, I have to go to the Haoqi Tower

698
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,220
to register all of them.

699
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,580
Forget about the rank

700
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,900
or the impeachment.

701
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,660
It doesn't matter.

702
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,420
Father embarrassed

703
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,980
our entire family at the Star Tower.

704
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,980
What's that supposed to mean?

705
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,660
How did I embarrass our family?

706
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,700
Other than greeting Lord Wei briefly,

707
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,580
I was watching you battling the Dharma.

708
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,180
What did I do wrong?

709
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,140
Do you know who sat next to you?

710
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,100
Who was it?

711
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,180
I saw an old man.

712
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,460
An old man?

713
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,180
That was Simu's father,

714
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,740
Prime Minister Wang Zhenwen!

715
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,780
You know what?

716
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,820
Prime Minister Wang is

717
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,620
my future in-law.

718
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,500
Are you alright?

719
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,420
Slow down. Don't choke on it.

720
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,500
Can you hear

721
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,980
what they're saying?

722
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,140
Sounds like a girl took good care

723
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,620
of Ningyan at the Academy.

724
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,900
A girl?

725
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,260
The one who brought him herbs
before the duel?

726
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,420
What a shame.

727
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,540
We missed her.

728
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,980
She must be from a prominent family, too.

729
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,700
Otherwise, she couldn't have

730
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,420
been so generous.

731
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,380
You're so sharp, Mother.

732
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,140
Her family is indeed prominent.

733
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,820
What does her father do?

734
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,380
Is he also an official?

735
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,180
Yes.

736
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,340
His rank must also

737
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,580
be high.

738
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,140
Quite high.

739
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,300
How high is quite high?

740
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,060
Let me put it this way.

741
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,740
Father is an Imperial Guard

742
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,900
of the 7th Rank.

743
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,860
You know that, right?

744
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,860
Of course.

745
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,780
Her father is above him

746
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,860
by seven ranks.

747
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,220
By seven ranks?

748
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
By seven ranks?

749
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,220
By seven ranks!

750
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,060
A princess!

751
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,900
Well...

752
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,100
I... I didn't know who he was.

753
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,460
You can't punish me for ignorance.

754
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,580
That old man didn't seem to be petty, anyway.

755
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,700
How about this?

756
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,820
I'll explain it to him.

757
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,020
No, Father.

758
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,260
You cannot go.

759
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,380
You'll be helping me if you don't do worse.

760
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,180
I won't do worse!

761
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,380
Maybe we'll have a good chat.

762
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,740
No discord, no concord.

763
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,740
Do you know what you are?

764
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,140
You're old and ignorant.

765
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,780
Old and ignorant, you say?

766
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
Is that how you should talk to your father?

767
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,060
- Come here!
- No.

768
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,700
We need to talk. Come here!

769
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,570
- Wait...
- Let's go!

770
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,140
How does it make a different?

771
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,620
One Chop to Kill...

772
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,700
All!

773
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,740
Hey...

774
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,500
I find you quite familiar.

775
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,500
Can you tell me

776
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
who I am?

777
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,820
It's as it should be.

778
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,340
What...

779
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,180
what was...

780
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,340
what was that?

781
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,460
It was what you went through.

782
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,100
What I went through...

783
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,300
What I went through...

784
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,420
I seemed...

785
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,460
I seemed...

786
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,780
I seemed...

787
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,540
to be divided into many parts.

788
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,660
That girl...

789
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,740
Who was that girl?

790
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,500
The Sovereign.

791
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,700
The Sovereign, right?

792
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,580
She seemed so familiar.

793
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,820
Can you tell me

794
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,660
who I am?

795
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,500
Not now.

796
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,020
Your primordial spirit is incomplete.

797
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,060
Once it's fully recovered,

798
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,540
you'll remember everything.

799
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,820
Recover...

800
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,420
Incomplete...

801
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,260
Where am I?

802
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Did I make myself clear?

803
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,100
Yes.

804
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,620
How did you know

805
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,060
Shen Shu was inside me?

806
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,140
Do you mean

807
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,700
Shen Shu is

808
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,620
living in a man called Xu Qi'an?

809
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,340
But even so,

810
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,100
why did you come to tell us?

811
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,140
There's something else in him

812
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,860
that belongs to me.

813
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,140
A trade?

814
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,860
Yes.

815
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,260
Shen Shu is yours.

816
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,460
Xu Qi'an

817
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,140
is mine.

818
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,340
Master,

819
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,780
who was that man in black?

820
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,220
He's formidable.

821
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,500
What we know for sure is that

822
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,500
he's a Hypnotizer of The Witcher's Sect.

823
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,780
He told us about Shen Shu

824
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
to

825
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,420
force us to battle Supervisor

826
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,660
so that he could take you away.

827
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,940
We'll entrust

828
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,140
Shen Shu to you.

829
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:15,420
To me?

830
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,940
He's well recovered,

831
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,500
and he'll reappear soon.

832
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:20,860
He'll

833
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,260
fulfill his duty.

834
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,180
That's all

835
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,860
thanks to your fortune.

836
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,420
It nourished him.

837
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,020
So is that man in black

838
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,060
coveting my fortune?

839
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,300
Here's a friendly reminder.

840
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,020
Before Shen Shu reemerges,

841
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,220
do not set foot outside the Dafeng.
