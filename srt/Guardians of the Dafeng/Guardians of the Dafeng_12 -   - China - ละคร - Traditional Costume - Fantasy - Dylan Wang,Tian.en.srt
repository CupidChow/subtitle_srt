I have bandits to kill
in the mountains tomorrow.

43
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,740

No, 3,

44
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,190
we've been here for so long.

45
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,640

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,960
your name?

47

I go

48
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,310

52
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,110
Did you draw this table?

53
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,270
Yes.

54
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,200
It looks creative.

55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,800
Tell me about it.

56
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,320
As you can see,

57
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,990
the Realm Sect holds nine core members.

58
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,200
They're holders of the Jade Mirrors, too,

59
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,430
and sorted by their mirror numbers.

60
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,430
No. 1 is in the capital

61
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,360
with powerful figures behind, I believe.

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,710
He's likely to work for the court.

63
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,390
No. 6 seems

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,920
straightforward

65
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,080
and easygoing.

66
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,390
We can use him to our advantage.

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,710
As for No. 3,

68
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,040
he's charming,

69
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,870
fun to hang out with,

70
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,800
faithful,

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,830
and upright.

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Yes, that's me.

74

As for No. 5, No. 7, No. 8,

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,670
we haven't talked.

76
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,920
It's hard to say.

77
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,080
No. 2, Li Miaozhen,

78
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,520
is in Yunzhou,

79
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,710
devoted to killing bandits.

80
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,670
People call her Winged Woman.

81
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,760
No. 4, Chu Yuanzhen, is

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,550
the Chief Disciple of the Treasure Sect.

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,640
Those two have been hostile

84
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,320
to each other for a long time.

85
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,320
He's also

86
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,390
the Saint of Men.

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,520
Do you know him, Lord Wei?

88
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,640
Li Miaozhen must be the Saintess of Heaven.

89
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,320
Heaven and Men

90
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,870
have never ceased fighting.

91
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,640
Those two will battle someday.

92
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,390
Have you found out why Jinlian

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,320
founded the Realm Sect?

94
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,550
He said after the Head

95
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,920
of Earth was demonized,

96
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,080
he founded the Realm Sect.

97
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,040
He gave the Jade Mirrors

98
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,390
to the best talents all over the world

99
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,800
and supported them

100
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,270
to gain their help

101
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,390
when he cleaned house.

102
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,080
The Earth Sect is traceless.

103
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,920
The Guardians still don't know everything

104
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,240
about the Sect Head's demonetization.

105
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,360
He knew you were a Guardian

106
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,640
but didn't hide anything.

107
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,320
Do you know why?

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Are you saying

109
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,790
he meant to form an alliance

110
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,320
with you secretly through me?

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,280
You'll

112
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,350
be the Guardians' spy in the Realm Sect

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,150
to watch the Earth Sect's every move.

Li Yuchun'll help you select a manual
from the Sutra Library.

121
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,680
Do you use a saber or a sword?

122
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
Both are fine.

123
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,230

129
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,910
unlike other cultivators,

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,830
barely have any super power.

131
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,150
They rely on strength.

132
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,160
That's why

133
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,080
the simplest is the best.

134
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,760
When you reach even higher stages,

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,350
you'll know better.

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
One Chop?

191
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,390
"Nothing in the world can survive this chop.

192
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,440
If there is,

193
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,000
my advice is

194
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,880
run."

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,760
Fighters

196
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,320
must not panic in battle.

197
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,230
We can't run away!

198
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,270
"Chop once

199
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,910
with a clear conscience.

200
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,120
It can reshape the universe."

201
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Can one really reshape the universe?

202
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,320
Impossible.

203
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,320
Even Duke Zhenbei

204
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,280
cannot reshape the universe.

205
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,040
This manual is

206
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,080
(One Chop to Kill All)
a game of bluff.

207
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,680
It's worthless.

208
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,400
It doesn't suit you.

209
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,750
Choose something else.

210
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,750
But I think

211
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,280
it's perfect.

212
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,440
Do you have a weapon?

213
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,000
No.

214
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,560
But I might get one in the future.

215
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
I can keep this manual for now.

216
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,440
This is your only chance.

217
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,510
Think twice.

218
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
No need.

219
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,070
I'll take it.

220
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,060
(One Chop to Kill All)

221
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
One Chop to Kill All?

222
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,710
Yes.

223
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,680
I told him

224
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,440
it'd require a weapon.

225
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,350
Don't waste such a good chance.

226
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,350
But Copper Gong Xu took it anyway.

227
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,110
I see.

228
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,110
You may leave.

229
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,430
What's wrong?

230
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,470
Anything else?

231
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,280
Hearing that he had to pay 300 liang for it,

232
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,590
he said he didn't bring that much,

233
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,510
and he'd pay later.

234
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,710
But given his tone,

235
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,040
I don't think he will.

236
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,470
Deduct it from his salary.

237
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

238
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,110
The Bureau.

239
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,000
Master,

240
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,590
Lord Wei is wise.

241
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,990
After all that we've done,

242
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,710
he must be alerted.

243
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,590
It's fine.

244
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,160
Anyway,

245
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,080
he'd find out sooner or later.

246
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
You found out, huh?

247
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,590
It was your order, wasn't it?

248
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,750
I knew

249
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,160
the manual came too easily.

250
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,470
When I visited the Bureau earlier,

251
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,230
I told Supervisor

252
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,040
to look after you covertly.

253
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,830
Although you've found out,

254
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,680
do keep a low profile.

255
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,510
Do not tell others

256
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,590
about today's incident.

257
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,440
You aren't their member.

258
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,750
Such special treatment might ruin

259
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,320
Supervisor's name.

260
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,470
Today's incident?

261
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,590
What happened today?

262
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,640
I...

263
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,440
lost my memory.

264
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,710
I don't remember

265
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,120
what happened.

266
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,320
Clever!

267
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,080
You deserve a drink

268
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,080
(Liquor)
for your cleverness.

269
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,310
Sit.

270
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,710
Sit with us, Gang.

271
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,550
Thanks.

272
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,780
(Liquor)

273
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,110
Princess Huaiqing, benevolent

274
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,280
and kind masters like you are rare.

275
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,510
I'm so fortunate

276
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,110
to be able to serve you.

277
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,230
Alright.

278
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,470
I'll make toasts.

279
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,200
A toast to you, Your Highness.

280
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,080
Thank you for cultivating me.

281
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,110
I'll drink up.

282
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,400
Next, I toast you, Gang.

283
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,200
You're above me in terms of seniority.

284
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,320
- Thanks.
- You're humble.

285
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
I'll drink up.

286
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,040
Do you mean

287
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,160
you chose me because I appreciated you

288
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,830
and treated you well?

289
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,830
Of course.

290
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,510
If someone

291
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,880
appreciates you more

292
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,040
and treats you better,

293
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,750
even if it's not Huaiqing,

294
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,190
will you

295
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,230
serve her?

296
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,400
Of course not.

297
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,750
I might not be highly educated,

298
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,230
but I'm grateful.

299
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,470
I'd never betray my master

300
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,040
for personal gain.

301
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,280
Don't be nervous.

302
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,590
I was joking.

303
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,590
What if I let you go?

304
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,160
You let me go?

305
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,470
Yes, that's right.

306
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,470
That way, you won't betray anyone.

307
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,400
Then will you serve

308
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,350
someone else?

309
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,670
I'll rephrase it.

310
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,590
In what condition

311
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,350
will you leave Huaiqing

312
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
for someone else?

313
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,630
I get it.

314
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,280
You can't leave!

315
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,750
Now that you've found someone better,

316
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,440
no need to make me stay.

317
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,800
Don't worry.

318
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,400
I'll keep in mind all that you've done

319
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,750
for me these days.

320
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,920
I'll leave quietly.

321
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,470
Take care.

322
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,160
I...

323
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,560
I didn't mean that.

324
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,680
Xu Qi'an! What's wrong with you?

325
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,320
I said you got it all wrong.

326
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,470
So what did you mean?

327
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,350
That was a joke.

328
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,440
A joke?

329
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,510
Didn't you let me go

330
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,320
because you detest me,

331
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,040
and you meant to let me leave with dignity?

332
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,350
♪Breakups should♪

333
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,470
The liquor I had made me sing.

334
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,280
I swear

335
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,870
if I detest you,

336
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
I'll be struck by thunder

337
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,110
and condemned!

338
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,750
I, Xu Qi'an, swear

339
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,680
I'll serve Grand Princess wholeheartedly.

340
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,280
No matter where I am,

341
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,160
in weal or woe,

342
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,510
I will remain faithful

343
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,510
to Grand Princess forever!

344
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
Good.

345
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,880
Great.

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,400
If I ever

347
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
betray Princess Huaiqing

348
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,400
for others,

349
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,990
I, Xu Qi'an, will be killed by lightning...

350
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,990
Alright. Enough!

351
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,110
I heard you.

352
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,440
Get up.

353
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,040
Your Highness,

354
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,160
I've been greatly inspired

355
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,110
and written more poems.

356
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,990
I look forward to your comments.

357
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,830
Not today.

358
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,400
You're free to go.

359
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,400
We haven't finished the drink.

360
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,350
Get lost!

361
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,110
Yes. I'll take my leave then.

362
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,080
Huaiqing this, Huaiqing that.

363
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,960
He brings up her name all the time.

364
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,670
Princess,

365
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,080
we need another plan.

366
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,110
His admiration
for Grand Princess is like fire.

367
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,510
He won't yield to you.

368
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,960
Fire, you say?

369
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,630
Put it out!

370
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,740
Here you go.

371
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,700
- Do you know
- Next.

372
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,040
- how to build
- Whitening Cream.

373
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,470
- unbreakable trust between people?
- You'll be fair.

374
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,630
That's easy.

375
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,590
Go to the Imperial Office of Music and drink.

376
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,800
Your bond will be unbreakable.

377
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,080
That person is powerful.

378
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,220
We can't be drinking buddies.

379
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,040
Do whatever that person wants

380
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,400
to bond step by step.

381
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
I've been like a slave.

382
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
Is that not enough?

383
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm still being tested constantly.

384
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,680
See, Zhu Guangxiao?

385
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,800
He's thinking

386
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,920
about his future even while eating.

387
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,040
We've

388
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,750
fallen far behind.

389
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,870
No wonder

390
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,870
he went to the Haoqi Tower.

391
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,940
(No Pain, No Gain, Minced Pork Rice)

392
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,160
- Sir.
- Thanks for coming.

393
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,000
Keep the change.

394
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,110
Thank you, sir.

395
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,870
You owed me two liang
in the last game.

396
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,470
So familiar!

397
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,160
What's familiar?

398
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,630
The silver in Ningyan's hand

399
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
looks like mine.

400
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,110
I've lost money over and over.

401
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,830
It's about two qian.

402
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,400
You think this is yours?

403
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,830
Is your name on it?

404
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,670
Let me check.

405
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,440
I said it looked familiar.

406
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,320
It is mine!

407
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:29,960
- Yes.
- Ningyan,

408
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,440
where did you find the silver?

409
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,160
What's going on?

410
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,680
It's a red alert

411
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,830
to track down or arrest someone.

412
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,440
Maybe our members found a suspect

413
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,560
who ran away.

414
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,110
The signal is right over there.

415
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,280
It's close to us.

416
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,800
What's going on?

417
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,870
Earl Pingyuan was killed.

418
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,230
Two of our men in that area were injured.

419
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
The killer escaped mysteriously.

420
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,830
His whereabouts are unknown.

421
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,960
Earl Pingyuan?

422
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,270
An earl was killed.

423
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,030
Move it!

424
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,880
Come on!

425
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,070
Let's go, guys.

426
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,020
(Fruit Shop)

427
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,680
Guys,

428
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,760
this is No. 6.

429
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,120
I'm in trouble in the capital.

430
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,230
Can anyone help me?

431
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,520
No. 6,

432
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,710
what's wrong?

433
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,510
I'm stuck in the Inner City

434
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,440
and hunted by the Guardians.

435
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,230
What?

436
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,790
The Guardians haven't found me,

437
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,400
but those of the Bureau

438
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,160
will arrive in less than two hours.

439
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,220
(Heng Yuan, No. 6)
Then I won't

440
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,480
(8th Rank of Tianyu)
get away.

441
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,370
(No. 4)
I'm too far away from you

442
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,670
to help out.

443
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,220
(No. 3, No. 5, No. 6)
No. 6,

444
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,400
can you find a way to get out

445
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,200
by force?

446
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,360
I can't. I'm far away from the gate.

447
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,360
The Guardians and Imperial Guards
are patrolling.

448
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,390
Even if I got out

449
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,550
of the Inner City,

450
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,120
I couldn't leave the Outer City.

451
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,470
Do you have energy-concealing weapons?

452
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,630
No.

453
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,400
(No. 6)
I have one,

454
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,470
but I can't send it to you.

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,790
Don't worry.

456
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,510
If I can't survive,

457
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,680
I'll leave the Mirror at my spot.

458
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,440
You may follow the energy

459
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,790
to recover it tomorrow.

460
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,030
(No. 6)
Don't curse yourself, No. 6.

461
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,310
Ask No. 1.

462
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,240
He's in the capital.

463
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,070
No. 1,

464
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,160
can you help me?

465
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,940
(No. 1)

466
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,070
What did you do?

467
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,270
I killed Earl Pingyuan.

468
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,920
Sorry,

469
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,400
my hands are tied.

470
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,960
No. 1,

471
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
we fellows should help each other.

472
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,580
No. 6 must've killed him for a reason.

473
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,460
(No. 1)

474
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,800
No. 6,

475
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,120
you've helped me once.

476
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,470
I might return the favor

477
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,880
if you tell me

478
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,510
why you killed him.

479
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,920
(If No. 6 is a good man,)

480
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,400
(I'll help him)

481
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,470
(and establish credibility in this sect.)

482
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,470
(If he's bad,)

483
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,960
(I'll gain his trust,)

484
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,840
(get his exact location,)

485
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,440
(and tell the Guardians.)

486
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,710
(I'll be rewarded.)

487
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,200
(Either way, it benefits me.)

488
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,840
You may remain silent,

489
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,640
but think carefully.

490
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,230
Right now, only I can

491
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,360
help you out.

492
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,200
No. 6,

493
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,470
(No. 6)
he's agreed to give you a hand.

494
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,680
Tell us everything.

495
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,520
Yes.

496
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,990
Killing an earl is huge.

497
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,400
You should at least be honest to get help.

498
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,880
Last year,

499
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,470
my junior fellow went missing.

500
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,840
I believe he was abducted

501
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,310
and secretly sent out of the capital.

502
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,840
After a lot of digging and checking,

503
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,230
I found a group of human traffickers.

504
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,030
The one behind them was

505
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,680
Earl Pingyuan.

506
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,710
So you killed him for revenge?

507
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,550
I sneaked into his mansion to ask him

508
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,710
where my fellow was but got nothing,

509
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,160
so I killed him

510
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,400
for his sins.

511
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,920
(Some vigilante he is.)

512
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,200
(He could've reported that earl.)

513
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,470
(Killing him is so not wise.)

514
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,920
You broke the law, too.

515
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,960
Why not report him?

516
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,840
(See?)

517
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,990
(No. 1 seems more sensible.)

518
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,640
Report him?

519
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,200
Had that worked,

520
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,840
he would've been executed already.

521
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,510
Officials shield each other.

522
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,230
If they can't uphold justice,

523
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,160
I'll get it by force!

524
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,750
(No. 2 seems)

525
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
(more hotheaded than No. 6)

526
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,470
I did it for a reason.

527
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,040
Over the past year,

528
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,510
I've rescued tons of children.

529
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,160
Most of them

530
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,880
had handicaps

531
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,200
and little food to eat.

532
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,550
They suffered tremendously.

533
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,790
They groveled to beg for money.

534
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,270
If they got a few coins,

535
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,750
they'd have cold food to eat.

536
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,030
Otherwise,

537
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,990
they'd end up dead in the wild.

538
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,500
(1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
So,

539
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,120
where are those children now?

540
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,230
I brought them to a shelter,

541
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,600
the Anji House.

542
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,510
Later, I found out

543
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,710
all of them were abducted by that group

544
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,600
from all over the state.

545
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,120
(No. 1)
No. 6, is that true?

546
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,550
Absolutely.

547
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,030
Earl Pingyuan secretly supported traffickers

548
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,550
to sell people in the capital
to rake in money.

549
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,590
They

550
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,310
sold abducted children and women

551
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,920
to brothels

552
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,680
and sweatshops.

553
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,750
They became thieves and even...

554
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,270
lost their limbs to satisfy

555
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,640
others' sick fetishes.

556
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,240
So,

557
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,030
(No. 6)
even if my junior fellow were fine,

558
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,550
I wouldn't let Earl Pingyuan go.

559
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,200
Only if he died

560
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,880
could that group be cracked

561
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,710
and more people

562
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,960
be safe.

563
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,920
Yes! Great job!

564
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,680
That scum deserves death!

565
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,980
(No. 2)
Agreed.

566
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,070
No. 6 is

567
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,440
admirable for what he did.

568
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,480
No. 3,

569
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,600
if you can help No. 6 out,

570
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,640
I'll owe you one

571
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,800
and pay you back when we meet.

572
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,990
Count me in!

573
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,350
No. 3,

574
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,710
I hope you'll lend a hand.

575
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
(No. 1)
I understand what he did,

576
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,790
but killing an earl is a felony.

577
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,120
Rescuing him under the Guardians' noses

578
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,120
is almost impossible.

579
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,640
Whoever makes the move,

580
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,840
they'll get into trouble.

581
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,820
(No. 4)

582
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,300
(1, 3, 4, 5, 6)

583
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,780
(No. 3, No. 6)

584
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,820
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

585
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,100
(No. 3)

586
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,160
I never meant to

587
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,070
trouble all of you.

588
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,800
I will

589
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,550
take responsibility

590
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,680
for my actions.

591
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,220
(No. 6)

592
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,630
No. 6,

593
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,980
where are you now?

594
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,100
(No. 6)

595
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,310
You guys, go this way.

596
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,440
You two, that way!

597
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,300
You guys follow me!

598
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,710
Check every corner.

599
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,990
Leave no stone unturned!

600
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,960
Yes.

601
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,960
"A scholar's robe

602
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,640
carrying the great spirit

603
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,360
can conceal murderous energy."

604
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,600
No. 3 is

605
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,710
from the Yunlu Academy!

606
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,070
(Buddhist Staff?)

607
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,440
(He's from Tianyu.)

608
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,780
(Jiang Lyuzhong, Guardian, 4th Rank Fighter)

609
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,720
It's odd.

610
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,030
The crimson light is gone.

611
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,630
Song Tingfeng of the Breeze Hall.

612
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,160
Zhu Guangxiao of the Breeze Hall.

613
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,750
Greetings, Gold Gong Jiang.

614
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,790
Did you find any traces of the killer?

615
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,790
We searched the streets.

616
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,710
There's no sign of him.

617
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,880
I found nothing either.

618
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,550
Officers,

619
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,600
was the crimson light here?

620
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,160
Are you questioning us?

621
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,550
I wouldn't dare.

622
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,750
Did you search down there?

623
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,790
Uh... no.

624
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,760
No.

625
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,710
Are you people of the Breeze Hall

626
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,160
always so reckless?

627
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,310
Mr. Jiang,

628
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,380
we found this.

629
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:54,960
Chief.

630
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,390
Looks like

631
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,030
some kind of weapon.

632
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,360
Why was it in the ditch?

633
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,840
Did the killer leave it there?

634
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,960
Report it to the high-ups.

635
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,040
Yes.

636
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,070
Hold on!

637
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,480
Mr. Xu.

638
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,310
It really is him.

639
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,630
Mr. Xu, you haven't

640
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,200
gone to the Bureau for a while.

641
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,680
Senior Song keeps bringing you up.

642
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,960
Yes, Mr. Xu.

643
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,920
Do come for tea when you're free.

644
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,470
We're eager to learn
more alchemy skills from you.

645
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:40,750
- Alchemy?
- Not today.

646
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm on duty now.

647
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,840
Yes, sure.

648
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,200
Sir, that's my device.

649
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:50,960
It's yours?

650
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,160
Who are you? Which hall are you in?

651
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,960
He's one of us of the Breeze Hall.

652
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,160
He's Xu Qi'an.

653
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,680
Sir, Lord Wei gave that to me.

654
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,510
May I have it back?

655
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,920
Why was it in the ditch?

656
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,710
I had the runs just now.

657
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,960
Perhaps

658
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,990
when I relieved myself,

659
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,750
it slipped out.

660
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,550
If you don't believe me,

661
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,270
check with Lord Wei.

662
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,160
You're something else.

663
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,000
Yes.

664
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,920
Ignore him.

665
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,630
Officers,

666
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,750
do you know that Guardian

667
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:39,920
in our office?

668
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,750
We know him,

669
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,160
but he might not know us.

670
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,630
How come?

671
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,360
You know Senior Song Qing, right?

672
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,640
Supervisor called him

673
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,880
a once-in-a-century genius in alchemy.

674
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,990
But Senior Song keeps saying this lately.

675
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:56,200
Do you know what it is?

676
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,030
"Xu Ningyan

677
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,310
is indeed my master."

678
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,680
Go to the Breeze Hall tomorrow

679
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,230
and bring him to our hall.

680
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,070
Yes.

681
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,640
Hey, Ningyan,

682
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,710
you were amazing.

683
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,990
You won for our hall.

684
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,200
Shut up.

685
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,470
They can still hear us.

686
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,790
So what?

687
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,990
We're with Ningyan.

688
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,120
What can a mere Gold Gong do to us?

689
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,360
Look at them just now.

690
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:26,920
"Alchemy!"

691
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,270
You're good.

692
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,920
I'm scared. I'm off.

693
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,030
- What's so funny?
- Chief.

694
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,070
Stop slacking off.

695
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,350
Go find the killer!

696
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,680
Yes, on it!

697
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
Stop laughing. Go!

698
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,960
No. 3,

699
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,310
why did you send me to a chicken coop?

700
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,220
(South Gate)

701
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,550
Go.

702
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,150
What's on the cart?

703
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,570
- Search it.
- Just some supplies.

704
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,730
We made them.

705
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,450
They're fine.

706
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,060
(Zhang's Plain and Meat Buns)

707
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,160
We looked all night

708
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,310
but found nothing.

709
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,000
We caught two thieves, though.

710
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,640
Not bad.

711
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,990
We'll get at least five qian.

712
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,030
(How's No. 6 doing now?)

713
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,270
We'll go back to report it to Chief.

714
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,350
Ningyan,

715
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,230
will you join us?

716
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,750
I'm needed elsewhere. Go without me.

717
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,680
See you this afternoon.

718
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,000
That man...

719
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,120
(No. 6!)

720
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,110
What about him?

721
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,360
He's just a scholar, isn't he?

722
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,520
No.

723
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,790
He is not.

724
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,070
The robe he's wearing

725
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,310
is someone else's.

726
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,600
It doesn't fit at all.

727
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,400
He's walking

728
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,640
with weak steps

729
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,070
as if he's out of strength.

730
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,550
Besides,

731
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,270
he came from the Inner City.

732
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,550
Do you mean...?

733
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,800
That's right.

734
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
He must've gone to the...

735
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,960
Imperial Office of Music.

736
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,960
I want to go there, too.

737
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,120
Shall we go there tonight?

738
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,160
I'm exhausted!

739
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,020
I want to have fun.

740
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,440
Come on. Go back to rest.

741
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,680
I won't be tired at all in front of girls.

742
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,460
(Breeze Hall)

743
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,440
Look at the time, guys.

744
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,830
Aren't you going to

745
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,990
report it to Chief?

746
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,270
Already done.

747
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,750
Why not keep searching for the killer?

748
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,200
No rush. We haven't received the order.

749
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,160
How strange.

750
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,120
This is a high-profile case.

751
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,640
It's not strange at all.

752
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,600
Earl Pingyuan was a scum anyway.

753
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Lord Wei must be glad

754
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,640
that pest is dead.

755
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,510
Is that what he's like?

756
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,470
Put that away if your peanuts are baked.

757
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,470
It's burning my behind.

758
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,840
We searched the area
around Earl Pingyuan's Mansion overnight.

759
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,200
There's no sign of the killer in the houses

760
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,070
or the inns in the Inner City.

761
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,470
Those in white of the Bureau

762
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,710
didn't sense the murderous energy either.

763
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,880
I'm sorry.

764
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,800
Please

765
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,920
punish me, Lord Wei.

766
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,840
Look at you, Mr. Jiang.

767
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,960
You let the killer get away

768
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
even with the Bureau's help.

769
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,880
Do you know those ill-willed court officials

770
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,790
are waiting to laugh at our office?

771
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,440
I'll send in more people to search

772
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,710
in a wider area.

773
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,600
I promise to

774
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,600
catch the killer

775
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,960
before tomorrow.

776
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,800
Relax.

777
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
You worked all night.

778
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,030
You must be tired.

779
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,270
Go back and rest.

780
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,110
Yes.

781
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,550
Lord Wei,

782
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,030
did you give anyone weapons lately?

783
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,270
What's your point?

784
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,120
I have something else to report to you.

785
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,720
Father,

786
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,070
the Ministry of Justice is

787
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,790
looking for the killer, too, in secret.

788
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,070
I think they want to beat us to it

789
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,270
and accuse the Guardians of inability.

790
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,440
If we couldn't find anything,

791
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,310
what could those losers do?

792
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,470
Lord Wei,

793
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,710
Copper Gong Xu is here.

794
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,880
I have important things to report.

795
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,200
Speak.

796
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,110
Lord Wei,

797
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,070
it's sensitive.

798
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,470
Can we speak in private?

799
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,310
What?

800
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,790
Are you, a mere Copper Gong,
asking us to leave?

801
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,840
You may go.

802
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,030
Go.

803
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
Come up here.

804
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,310
Yes.

805
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,630
Is it about the Realm Sect?

806
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,030
It's about Earl Pingyuan.

807
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,920
The one who killed him

808
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,880
is No. 6 of the Realm Sect.

809
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,840
The motive?

810
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,030
Letting a killer go

811
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,840
is as guilty as murder!

812
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Are you insane?

813
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,400
I'm sorry.

814
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm guilty beyond forgiveness.

815
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,880
I struggled overnight but couldn't

816
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,840
live with a guilty conscience.

817
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,190
I have to tell you the truth.

818
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,440
However you'll punish me,

819
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,630
I'll accept it.

820
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,840
Earlier today,

821
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,840
when I chatted with others,

822
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,590
I learned

823
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,760
that you were rebuked by His Majesty.

824
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,470
Other court officials ganged up on you

825
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,720
to bring you down.

826
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,990
I owe you more than I can repay.

827
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,030
- I...
- Enough.

828
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,400
You don't

829
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,720
owe me.

830
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
Get to the point.

831
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,510
Earl Pingyuan secretly supported traffickers

832
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,400
to sell people

833
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,590
to rake in money!

834
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,280
They sold children and women

835
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
to brothels and sweatshops.

836
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,070
They became thieves

837
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,800
and even lost their limbs
to satisfy others' fetishes.

838
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,470
Hearing such inhumanity,

839
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,190
I'd rather kill those animals myself.

840
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,920
Get up.

841
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,510
Yes.

842
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,320
Xu Qi'an,

843
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,030
how well do you know

844
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,630
the Realm Sect?

845
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,440
How well do you know Jinlian

846
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,920
of the Earth Sect?

847
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,470
Investigation shows

848
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,920
the Earl did keep a group of traffickers.

849
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,110
But did No. 6

850
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,550
kill him for his junior fellow

851
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,840
without any hidden agenda?

852
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,510
Maybe

853
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,440
the Earl was involved in other things, too.

854
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,720
Maybe

855
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,990
those traffickers did something else

856
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,240
that led to their doom.

857
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,510
Did you consider

858
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,030
all those possibilities?

859
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,360
(He's teaching me.)

860
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,190
(He's helping me grow.)

861
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,240
I was reckless.

862
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,510
Never mind.

863
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,550
You stay

864
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,760
out of this case.

865
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,150
I'll assign it to others.

866
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,550
Keep your cover in the Realm Sect.

867
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,110
Your priority

868
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,280
is to check out

869
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,920
the identity of everyone there.

870
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,600
And...

871
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,280
Stay safe.

872
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,670
I'll give it my all, sir.

873
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,100
(Peace)

874
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,240
That's absurd!

875
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,070
You're a Gold Gong.

876
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,990
That Cooper Gong overreached himself.

877
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,670
Clearly, he has no respect for you.

878
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,320
I'm sowing discord. Say something.

879
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,030
You know how good he is

880
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,590
and how much Lord Wei values him.

881
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,990
What do you expect me to say?

882
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,440
He doesn't respect you at all.

883
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,670
You know that, too, right?

884
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,070
That doesn't change the fact

885
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,360
that he serves under me.

886
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,190
Wait and see, Yang Yan.

887
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,030
This isn't over.

888
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,390
Good day.

889
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,460
(Anji House)

890
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,870
Be careful.

891
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,760
Master Heng Yuan,

892
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,280
you're finally back.

893
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,990
Why are you dressed like this?

894
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,920
I had work to do.

895
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,720
We can't afford to buy more food.

896
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
I'll find a way

897
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,720
to raise money.

898
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:11,990
No. 6.

899
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,950
No. 6!

900
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,360
Are you safe now?

901
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,380
(Anji House)

902
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,660
(No. 4)

903
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,510
How are you?

904
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,550
Are you safe?

905
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,110
(No. 6)
I heard nothing overnight

906
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,800
but wouldn't dare ask.

907
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,140
Thanks for your concern.

908
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,590
I'm safe for now.

909
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,370
(No. 6)
So

910
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,670
did No. 3 help you out?

911
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,240
Yes.

912
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,320
Thanks to him,

913
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,400
I made it out.

914
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,660
(No. 3)

915
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,190
Where is No. 3?

916
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,470
Is he in trouble?

917
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,590
He's blessed by the heavens.

918
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,070
I'm sure he's fine.

919
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,660
(No. 3)

920
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,030
- No. 3!
- No. 6.

921
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,240
I heard the news.

922
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,550
(No. 6, No. 4, No. 2)
My office got anonymous tips.

923
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,760
They'll keep going after you.

924
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,630
Be prepared

925
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,550
and stay alert.

926
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,800
Thanks for the heads-up.

927
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,320
No. 3 has helped No. 6 out

928
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,070
and infiltrated into the Guardians.

929
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,510
I knew he was capable.

930
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,630
No. 6, now that No. 3 is here,

931
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,840
can you tell us how you got out?

932
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,640
No. 3,

933
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,240
can I...

934
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,350
I say it?

935
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,320
Why not?

936
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,760
I have nothing to hide.

937
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,760
Go ahead.

938
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,830
Sure.

939
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,240
Here's the thing.

940
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,720
No. 3

941
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,590
gave me a scholar's robe

942
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,110
to conceal my murderous energy.

943
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,990
Yes.

944
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,800
But that wasn't enough.

945
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,470
Then I brought him to an inn that no one knew

946
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,360
to hide.

947
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,670
Even so,

948
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,610
(No. 1)
the Guardians were everywhere.

949
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,350
How did you hide from them?

950
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,190
He couldn't.

951
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,880
After a while, they found traces of him.

952
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,800
Thanks to my Plan B,

953
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,880
he made a narrow escape.

954
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:57,880
What did you do?

955
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,960
I put on the robe I had got

956
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,030
from No. 6

957
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,360
and jumped out of the window,

958
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,760
drawing the attention of the Guardians

959
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,070
and those of the Bureau to me.

960
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,590
Then No. 6 spent the rest of the night

961
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,920
in the mirror safely.

962
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,420
(No. 6)

963
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,400
Am I right,

964
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,840
No. 6?

965
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,590
Yes,

966
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,990
I guess.

967
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,670
(Looks like No. 6 isn't too dumb.)

968
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,960
(He can be my friend.)

969
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:29,950
Nice!

970
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Creating a distraction is smart.

971
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,260
(No. 1)
No. 3,

972
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,320
how did you avoid their search?

973
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,550
The truth is

974
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,070
I'm still in hot water.

975
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,630
They've searched all night,

976
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,190
and they're still chasing after me.

977
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,400
Do you have more energy-concealing weapons?

978
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,470
Master only gave me one scholar's robe.

979
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,880
No. 6 used it.

980
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,670
I'll have to wait
until the murderous energy is gone.

981
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,030
If I get caught before that,

982
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,190
I promise

983
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,960
I won't sell No. 6 out

984
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,470
or any of you here.

985
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,670
No. 3,

986
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,590
to protect No. 6,

987
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,360
- you'd rather...
- I'll die for my friends!

988
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,110
What No. 6 said earlier

989
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,440
is touching

990
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,720
and enlightening.

991
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,720
A righteous hero like him

992
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,240
cannot be caught,

993
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,630
let alone be tortured by the Guardians!

994
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,440
As No. 6's fellow,

995
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,240
I shall protect him.

996
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,080
Worry not.

997
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,990
Even if I meet my doom,

998
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,400
I'll die a worthy death!
