You haven't come for a long time.

45
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,360
I went on a trip earlier.

46
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,550
I came here

47
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,470
to see you as soon as I returned.

Let's get hammered tonight.

It's you.

50
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,080
You know each other?

52
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,520
Not just that.

53
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,040
He's also my buddy.

54
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,430
Li, right?

55
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,360
I'm Yang.

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
We met

57
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,200
at the Academy.

58
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,800
Yang...

59
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,870
Ling.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Yes, Ling!

61
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,590
(Weren't those two brats busy?)

62
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,920
(I know Cijiu.)

63
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,760
(He seldom says what he means.)

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
(But Ningyan never goes to brothels.)

65
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,150
(Last night, Uncle said he was loyal.)

66
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,110
(I'll tell Aunt.)

67
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,920
(Maybe I can get hush money.)

68
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,710
(Ningyan said he never went to brothels.)

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,590
(Shameless!)

70
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,270
(So is Father.)

71
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,990
(No wonder my school robe is gone.)

72
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,830
So, Mr. Xu,

73
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
Mr. Li,

74
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,960
you could've told me

75
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,870
you wanted to come here.

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,550
We could've come together.

77
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,670
We're close,

78
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,110
so close as family.

79
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,430
And a family

80
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,430
should be together,

81
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
right?

82
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,640
- My bad.
- My bad.

83
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,660

84

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,590

88
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,640

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,710

92
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,670
Where's she?

93
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,680
It's magical!

94
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,200
Control yourself.

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800

96
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,030
Here's the line.

97
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,190
Yes.

98
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,520
Here's Miss Fuxiang's first line.

(Pine leaves)
You have an incense stick of time

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,790
(and bamboo leaves are green.)
to write.

101
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,830
Begin.

102
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,080
"Pine leaves and bamboo leaves are green."

103
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,030
Two "leaves".

104
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,390
How smart.

105
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
Nice!

106
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,190
Mr. Yang,

107
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
you first?

108
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,830
I didn't know it'd be couplets.

109
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,830
Not my strong suit.

110
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,000
I need more time to think.

111
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,150
You first, Mr. Li.

112
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,710
Let Mr. Xu do it.

113
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,350
Yes, you first, Mr. Xu.

114
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,470
The ink isn't well ground.

115
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,790
It needs more work.

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,680
I'll write later.

117
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,200
Don't be shy.

118
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,680
I'll go first.

119
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,680
No!

120
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,830
Come on! Think!

121
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,000
Use your brain!

122
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
Autumn sounds and goose sounds are cold.

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,590
This one it is.

124
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,590
It's not perfect,

125
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,440
but its format is fine.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,320
Miss Fuxiang invites Mr. Zhao in for tea.

127
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,760
Good job!

128
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,830
Congratulations!

129
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,520
Well,

130
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,440
thank you.

131
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,680
Yunlu Academy?

132
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,270
Do something, son!

133
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,230
Ningyan is a poet.

134
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,320
Please do something!

135
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,790
I told you my poems

136
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,200
were from an old book.

137
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I didn't write them.

138
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,470
Why don't you believe me?

139
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,070
Father,

140
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,710
you can't even read.
Why play an old scholar?

141
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,550
Yes!

142
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,880
You shouldn't be here.

143
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,680
This isn't the time to judge me.

144
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,080
He's going to her room.

145
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,010
(So not worth it.)

146
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,270
(I've paid so much)

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,470
(but found nothing useful.)

148
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,350
(She's the fairest here,)

149
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,030
(excelled in poetry and music.)

150
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
Cijiu,

151
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,830
write this down.

152
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,270
"Shadows slant across shallow water.

153
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,320
Faint scent floats in dim moonlight."

154
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,630
It has my name.

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,830
Come in.

156
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,230
Who wrote this poem?

157
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,230
Who was it?

158
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,590
Where's he now?

159
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,080
Sorry, Mr. Zhao.

160
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,280
Miss Fuxiang

161
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,680
has chosen someone else.

162
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,560
What?

163
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,710
Mr. Yang,

164
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,960
she wants to see you.

165
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,590
Please follow me.

166
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,830
He's going in, too?

167
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,200
That's against the rule!

168
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,800
Mr. Zhao.

169
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,280
Greetings, Mr. Yang.

170
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,710
Please have a seat.

171
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,560
I appreciate your talent.

172
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,960
It's unmatched.

173
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,320
It takes years of hard work

174
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,990
to come this far, right?

175
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,830
Not exactly.

176
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,920
Thanks to the wisdom of the old,

177
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,400
I can...

178
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,470
use their masterpieces.

179
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,200
Why hasn't he come out?

180
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,240
Well,

181
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,800
I need fresh air.

182
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,350
We've paid for this.

183
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,310
Father...

184
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,430
Miss,

185
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,200
with all due respect,

186
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,800
you're a rare beauty.

187
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,040
Did no one offer to free you from here?

188
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,510
Those in charge of here

189
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,320
won't let go of girls

190
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,710
like me easily.

191
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,280
Wait.

192
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,710
You have tons of wooers,

193
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,920
including the rich and powerful,

194
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,400
such as

195
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,280
Vice Minister of Revenue's son,

196
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,120
Zhou Li.

197
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,510
He's obsessed with you.

198
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,440
He's wild, lascivious,

199
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,630
and ignorant.

200
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,870
I dislike him.

201
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,830
Whether he comes to play games

202
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,080
or offers me gifts,

203
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,200
I always ignore him.

204
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,800
We're under the Ministry of Rites.

205
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
He's Vice Minister of Revenue's son.

206
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,590
Although I'm not his match,

207
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm not afraid of him.

208
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,160
How's he wild

209
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,320
and lascivious?

210
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,110
It's common

211
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,510
for rich men like him to cat around.

212
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,040
This is

213
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,960
sensitive in the official circles.

214
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm simply curious.

215
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,230
I won't tell others.

216
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,960
It goes back to the last Lantern Festival.

217
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,510
Zhou Li is ridiculous.

218
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,510
At the Festival,

219
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,040
he was attracted to a girl

220
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
and harassed her

221
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,800
in the crowd.

222
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Zhang Yunying,

223
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,470
Weiwu Marquis's concubine's son,

224
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,230
was there, too.

225
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,350
He also

226
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,280
laid eyes on that girl.

227
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,280
The two of them

228
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,750
became so jealous

229
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,280
that they fought

230
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,920
over her.

231
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,280
(Plum House)
Students don't

232
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
have fighters' full beards like you.

233
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,510
Your disguise is terrible.

234
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,560
What do you know?

235
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
I think I fit in perfectly.

236
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,440
Yes, Mr. Li.

237
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,630
No wonder Mother never

238
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,990
gets your full salary.

239
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,040
You used it here, huh?

240
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,750
I borrowed it.

241
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680
I came to gather information

242
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,320
against our enemy.

243
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,230
Liar.

244
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,680
You can't fool me.

245
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,750
You're good.

246
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,230
Who keeps saying to study sages' sayings,

247
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,400
be a gentleman,

248
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
and never come to such places?

249
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,470
I play by ear.

250
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,920
It depends.

251
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,990
Liar!

252
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,830
- What did she say?
- Yes.

253
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,870
Let's go home first.

254
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,710
Wait!

255
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,080
Go back like this?

256
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,160
Or?

257
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,080
So naive.

258
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,430
Zhang.

259
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,350
Three Plan As.

260
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,550
Got it.

261
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,550
Take it.

262
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,550
On my tab.

263
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,520
Sure.

264
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,710
Did you not send the girls away?

265
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,680
We did.

266
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,990
Then what's this for?

267
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,400
Your aunt's sharp-nosed.

268
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,960
Better safe than sorry.

269
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,470
What if she suddenly returns?

270
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,800
The old are indeed wise.

271
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,470
No wonder you always smell like citrus.

272
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,710
Zip it.

273
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,590
Rub it on me.

274
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,830
Alright. Enough.

275
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,230
- Here.
- Shoes...

276
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,440
Armpit.

277
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,920
His concubine's son,

278
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Zhang Yunying?

279
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,350
Yes.

280
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,630
That man

281
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,200
hates Zhou Li's guts.

282
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,830
Hot-headed brats like him

283
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,630
can be our pawns.

284
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,990
What's your plan?

285
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,230
Watch him

286
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,110
and act at the right time.

287
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,440
A setup?

288
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,510
Given his status,

289
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,400
he goes out with attendants,

290
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,560
but not too many.

291
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,830
He isn't the heir after all.

292
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,160
We can make a mess

293
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,710
and then

294
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
abduct him.

295
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,920
If we do it in the day,

296
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,680
how can we kidnap someone in public?

297
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,590
Our plan is likely to backfire.

298
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,630
If we do it at night,

299
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,590
how can the three of us

300
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,440
break into his mansion?

301
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,400
What if

302
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,350
I've figured that out?

303
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,320
Uncle!

304
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,320
Uncle!

305
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,400
Father.

306
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,230
- Why are you sleeping here?
- Father.

307
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,400
Wake up.

308
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,160
- Are you alright?
- Wake up.

309
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,960
Where am I?

310
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,680
How did I get here?

311
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,230
How would

312
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,590
I know?

313
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,080
Just now, I meant to bathe.

314
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,710
Didn't you go get me hot water?

315
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
And?

316
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,310
Ningyan,

317
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,630
is there hot water?

318
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,310
Uncle,

319
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
I'm sorry.

320
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,440
- A mirror?
- I'm not sure.

321
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,320
It reflected light.

322
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,350
You've reached the Qi Stage.

323
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,680
How did someone bring you here

324
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,040
without alerting anyone?

325
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,590
You'll know tomorrow.

326
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,670
Ningyan,

327
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,590
did you bring me here?

328
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Forget it.

329
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,990
It's cold. Go freshen up and sleep.

330
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,110
Let's discuss some details

331
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,950
in your room.

332
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,200
Like what?

333
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,630
May I join you?

334
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,990
I said forget it.

335
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,830
Just abduct Weiwu Marquis's son.

336
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,040
The Marquis's son?

337
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,280
What are you up to?

338
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,080
Don't make a fuss.

339
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,680
Abduct him!

340
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,400
- Stop.
- Whitening cream.

341
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,780
(Whitening Cream)
You'll be fair.

342
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,640
Take a look.

343
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,750
- Smells nice.
- Yes.

344
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,120
That girl.

345
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,210
(Zhang Yunying)
Yes.

346
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,510
It'll brighten your skin.

347
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,350
What are you doing?

348
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,160
- Let go!
- Who are you?

349
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,320
- Help!
- Help me!

350
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,230
What's going on?

351
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,730
- Help!
- Let go!

352
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,700
Let go!

353
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,990
Let go of me!

354
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,990
Move! Move!

355
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,920
Go help them.

356
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,760
Yes.

357
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,750
Move!

358
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,960
Go away!

359
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,680
I stepped on you!

360
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,470
Who are you?

361
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,510
What do you want?

362
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,860
(Autumn)

363
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,360
He's filthy rich.

364
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,600
He wears a white jade thumb ring.

365
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,310
Cut off that thumb!

366
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,360
You can't.

367
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,900
(Autumn)

368
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,920
He's Weiwu Marquis's son.

369
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,750
Who are you

370
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,400
to touch him, rascal?

371
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,470
(They know who I am.)

372
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,200
(How dare they kidnap me!)

373
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,680
How's Master

374
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,400
going to deal with him?

375
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,550
Put him in the yard.

376
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,680
Torture him.

377
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,990
Give him no food.

378
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,360
Break his ankles.

379
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,200
Hang him upside down.

380
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Whip him

381
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,710
hundreds of times a day.

382
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,230
His father is a marquis.

383
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,310
Is Master not afraid of him?

384
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,270
A marquis is nothing.

385
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,360
Master's father is

386
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,270
the Vice Minister of Revenue!

387
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,920
Fear not.

388
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,470
(Vice Minister Zhou's son?)

389
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,920
(Zhou Li?)

390
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,790
Fine. Master is on his way.

391
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,440
Let's pick up drinks for him to enjoy.

392
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,870
No.

393
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,030
We're ordered to watch him.

394
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,680
We'll be back soon.

395
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,520
Let's go.

396
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,680
Did you use this mirror

397
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,840
to seize Zhang Yunying?

398
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,070
Not just him.

399
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,310
The maids, the doorman,

400
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,070
and Zhou Li's mistress,

401
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,920
all four of them

402
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,310
are in it now.

403
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,270
In here?

404
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,880
Don't touch it,

405
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
or you'll be sucked in.

406
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,000
Here you go.

407
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,310
What if he can't get out?

408
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,550
Why lock the door?

409
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,550
It has to look convincing.

410
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,310
The strong urge to live

411
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,510
will bring out one's potential.

412
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,830
Trust me, he'll get out.

413
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,160
Jump over the wall.

414
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
He's out.

415
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,440
Help!

416
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,160
Help!

417
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,710
Help me! I was kidnapped!

418
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,510
I'm Weiwu Marquis's son.

419
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,710
They... they abducted me!

420
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,520
Yunying!

421
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,750
Are you hurt, son?

422
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,350
Mother, Father!

423
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,590
Son,

424
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,710
what happened?

425
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,310
It was... Zhou Li.

426
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,680
He kidnapped me!

427
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,400
He... meant to torture me

428
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,080
before killing me!

429
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,710
What took you so long?

430
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,710
How's he now?

431
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,270
Goodness.

432
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,230
I'm exhausted.

433
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,440
I tailed Zhou Li all day.

434
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:09,710
First,

435
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,750
he was taken to the Censorate.

436
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,200
When I meant to ask around
about the situation,

437
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,990
someone else came

438
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,270
from the Ministry of Justice.

439
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,200
Then I followed them there.

440
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,640
Not even

441
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,310
an hour later,

442
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,310
he was moved to

443
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,750
the Court of Judicial Review.

444
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,230
There

445
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,270
those of the Censorate

446
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,920
were waiting for him as I expected.

447
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,160
They took him away.

448
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,200
I followed them to the Censorate.

449
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,750
I went here and there.

450
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,200
So

451
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,790
what's the status now?

452
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,640
How would I know?

453
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,840
I ran after him all day.

454
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,440
I didn't get to ask around.

455
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,990
He's the son of Vice Minister of Revenue.

456
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
It's hard to ruin him.

457
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,680
I know.

458
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,750
Armored in court?

459
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,600
Yes.

460
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,550
Besides,

461
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,640
Weiwu Marquis stated his ancestors' merits.

462
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,790
He accused Mr. Zhou

463
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,510
in tears of conniving in the kidnapping

464
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,160
of his son by Zhou Li

465
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,680
in front of His Majesty

466
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,310
and demanded justice

467
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,310
to not disappoint all the soldiers.

468
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,230
What was that to do with them?

469
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,310
He simply needed a pretext.

470
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,030
What did Father say?

471
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,600
His Majesty fumed.

472
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,200
He ordered Judicial Review,

473
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,880
Justice, and Censorate

474
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,920
to solve the case in two days.

475
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,510
Be gentle,

476
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,350
old fart!

477
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,470
Get out!

478
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,310
Go away!

479
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,310
When will Father come?

480
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,200
Well,

481
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,200
he's still at the Judicial Review.

482
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,790
He'll go to the Censorate later,

483
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,470
so he can't come today.

484
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,840
How dare the Judicial Review

485
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,440
and the Censorate

486
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,550
torture me!

487
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,920
Once I'm out,

488
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,510
I'll impeach them!

489
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,310
Don't worry.

490
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
His Majesty gave them two days.

491
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,920
If your statement

492
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,640
matches our ministry's

493
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,640
and you deny it,

494
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,160
when the time is up,

495
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,440
we'll turn things around.

496
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,230
The other two departments

497
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
can't do anything else.

498
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,350
Then

499
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,270
all we need is a scapegoat

500
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,200
to end everything.

501
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,070
I did not do it!

502
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,150
That's it!

503
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,070
Yes. Right.

504
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,750
Scapegoat?

505
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,800
Yes.

506
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
I know a person.

507
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,960
Xu Qi'an.

508
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,230
We had a fight earlier.

509
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,750
It makes sense if we say

510
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,510
he did it.

511
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,590
Senior Song!

512
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,680
What's the rush?

513
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,550
That genius,

514
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,550
Xu Qi'an, is here

515
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,640
to see you!

516
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,750
(Man-Horse Graft)
Check out my latest work.

517
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
You said

518
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,270
plants and animals can't be grafted.

519
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,750
It made me think

520
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,990
about animals and animals.

521
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,040
Look,

522
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,640
this is my theory.

523
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,400
It's been put into practice.

524
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
Look.

525
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,230
See?

526
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,160
Grafting soldiers onto horses

527
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,550
can solve the shortage of war-horses.

528
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,480
Then

529
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,750
a soldier is

530
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,880
also a horse,

531
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,160
able to go far and fast

532
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,470
and fight bravely.

533
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,710
Our combat ability will grow significantly!

534
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,160
What do you think?

535
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,230
Have a try.

536
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,830
Come on.

537
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,760
Hop on.

538
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,840
- I...
- Try it.

539
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,310
- Come on.
- Wait...

540
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,200
- Try it.
- I...

541
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
Don't be shy.

542
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,550
See? Isn't it great?

543
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,150
Have a ride.

544
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,470
No, thanks.

545
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,680
Look,

546
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,200
I came for a favor.

547
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,800
Go back.

548
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,310
What is it?

549
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,400
Senior Song,

550
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,840
here's the thing.

551
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,160
I annoyed Mr. Zhou.

552
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,510
You know that.

553
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,960
Yes. Caiwei told me.

554
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,310
I'm sorry.

555
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,030
We don't interfere in court affairs.

556
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,040
Besides,

557
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,790
Vice Minister Zhou of Revenue

558
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,750
is way beyond a humble alchemist like me.

559
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,160
Hear me out.

560
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,550
What you need to do is simple.

561
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,360
Gazing Spell?

562
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,270
No way.

563
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,990
I'm upright and honest.

564
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,310
I'd never do such things.

565
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,030
Sorry, I'm abrupt.

566
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Well then,

567
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,960
let's go back

568
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,990
to talk about your graft.

569
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,070
(Fish-Beast Graft)
Honestly,

570
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,840
(Man-Fish Graft)
these theories

571
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,400
won't work.

572
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,120
Why is that?

573
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,070
Did my teacher tell you the same thing?

574
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,230
You still don't know

575
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,470
why he disapproved of you

576
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,440
or the real reason behind it.

577
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,680
Do you?

578
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,710
I've never done any research,

579
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,710
but I can tell you

580
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,640
the rationale.

581
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
Do you know

582
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,360
reproductive isolation?

583
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,880
Reproduction, yes.

584
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,920
Isolation...?

585
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,440
What about it?

586
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,600
What's it to do with my work?

587
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,440
They...

588
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,920
Do you still remember

589
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,790
the principle of alchemy is...?

590
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,400
Equivalent exchange!

591
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,040
Right.

592
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,680
Don't let them in.

593
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,200
Go. Stop them.

594
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,120
Don't let them in!

595
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,160
What are you doing?

596
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,710
Isn't the questioning tomorrow?

597
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,270
His Majesty ordered me

598
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,680
to join the questioning.

599
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,630
Let go of me!

600
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,710
Hands off!

601
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,390
Zhou Li,

602
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,270
did you kidnap Weiwu Marquis's son?

603
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,280
No, sir.

604
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,990
I'm innocent.

605
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,360
I didn't do it.

606
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,920
It wasn't me. Let me go!

607
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,880
(Notice)

608
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,680
In the 36th year of Yuanjing,

609
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,510
Vice Minister Zhou of Revenue

610
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,470
is sent into exile

611
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,640
for corruption

612
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,270
and connivance.

613
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,160
So is his son

614
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,030
Zhou Li, for kidnapping the son

615
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
of Weiwu Marquis.

616
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
So you

617
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,510
bribed an alchemist of the Bureau?

618
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,680
How rude.

619
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,840
Alchemists

620
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,310
can't be bribed.

621
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,350
It's an

622
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,550
equivalent exchange.

623
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,360
Wait.

624
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,160
Did we cross the line?

625
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,400
Cijiu,

626
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,840
you're such a nerd.

627
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,470
Don't you know

628
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,120
the weak will be bullied?

629
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,440
Where are you going?

630
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,160
Backwardness

631
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,510
leaves us vulnerable.

632
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,360
With our backs to the wall,

633
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,270
we don't have a choice.

634
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,030
We fighting Zhou Li

635
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,680
is like an ant

636
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,990
shaking a tree.

637
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,640
But he's an ant

638
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,510
in front of the Bureau.

639
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,440
I didn't do it!

640
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,710
I didn't do it!

641
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,880
Hands off!

642
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,230
I swear, sir!

643
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,310
I'm innocent.

644
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,310
Really!

645
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,840
You aren't.

646
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,510
You're lying.

647
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,030
Are you also wondering why

648
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,270
the Marquis

649
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,070
and other officials

650
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,790
didn't see through

651
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,640
such a lame setup?

652
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,920
I've figured out part of it.

653
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,440
For Mr. Zhou's rivals,

654
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,600
it doesn't matter if Zhou Li

655
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,710
was wronged.

656
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,960
They just wanted to use him

657
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,030
to destroy his father.

658
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,840
As for the Marquis,

659
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,960
he could take revenge.

660
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,640
He had lost to Mr. Zhou

661
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,030
for the lack of help.

662
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,120
But this was a heaven-sent chance.

663
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,270
So that day, he showed up, armored,

664
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,790
provoking discussion in court.

665
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,440
He wasn't sure if his son

666
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,680
was taken by Zhou Li,

667
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,400
but before gathering evidence,

668
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,440
bringing down his rival was

669
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,960
his top priority.

670
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,200
You're a Prime Minister material.

671
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,030
We got lucky this time.

672
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,750
Next time,

673
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,680
anything can happen.

674
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,710
Cheer up.

675
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,760
Look,

676
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,470
as a student at the Yunlu Academy,

677
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,640
you have a bright future.

678
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,550
With your talent,

679
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,360
you might climb up the ladder

680
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,200
in a few years.

681
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,110
Then

682
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,310
no one can harm the Xu Clan again.

683
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,710
And you?

684
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,070
What are you going to do?

685
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,480
I...

686
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,350
I...

687
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:37,790
I'm leaving.

688
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,270
(Xu Residence)
Where to?

689
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,710
No idea.

690
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:43,070
I can't stay here any longer.

691
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,880
I've been in jail twice

692
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,360
over the last few months.

693
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,440
The future of the Xu Clan

694
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,440
depends on you.

695
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,040
Cijiu,

696
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,070
how about I go to the south?

697
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,030
"Green tiles cover red buildings.

698
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,990
Green grass fills riverbanks."

699
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,310
Nice. It's settled.

700
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,230
Wait until my parents come back.

701
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,200
I hate to say goodbye.

702
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,720
Look,

703
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,510
give them these letters.

704
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,990
(To Uncle)
I wrote everything.

705
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,310
It's time to leave.

706
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,360
When I settle down,

707
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,710
I'll write to you.

708
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,070
Cousin,

709
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,590
take care.

710
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,990
When will you come back?

711
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,030
When you become powerful,

712
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,640
I'll return in glory.

713
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,990
(After I leave,)

714
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,270
(the Xu Clan will be safe.)

715
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,630
Ningyan,

716
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,960
play with me.

717
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm trying to be sad.

718
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,790
Drop the act...

719
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,750
Leave me alone!

720
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,440
Wash the bottles

721
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,790
and jars again.

722
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,310
Senior Song,

723
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,640
thanks for your help.

724
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,110
You're welcome.

725
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,120
What's up?

726
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,230
Grand Princess wants to learn alchemy.

727
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,120
We're ordered to get prepared.

728
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,680
Grand Princess?

729
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,750
Is she also interested in alchemy?

730
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,470
She learns widely from others.

731
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,320
She comes to

732
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,710
talk with us every month on the 15th.

733
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,160
But it's two days early this time.

734
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,990
So we're in a rush.

735
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,790
I won't hold you back.

736
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,360
I'm here to say goodbye

737
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,880
to you and Caiwei.

738
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,870
What?

739
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,070
Are you leaving?

740
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,000
Yes.

741
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,680
You know

742
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,120
the Xu Clan has been through a lot.

743
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,230
I'm a bit

744
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
tired.

745
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,360
"People part.

746
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,270
People reunite."

747
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,400
Senior Song,

748
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,590
thanks.

749
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,520
Take care.

750
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,760
And

751
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,600
here's something for you.

752
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,530
♪Time goes by♪

753
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,550
I promised you this.

754
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,160
(Codex)
It has what you need.

755
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,880
Alchemy takes

756
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,990
time and effort.

757
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,790
Only talents like you

758
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,360
can carry forward

759
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,750
what's in this book.

760
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,510
You're flattering me!

761
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,510
Trust me.

762
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,680
I'll read it carefully

763
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,510
and won't let you down.

764
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,400
It's 10 liang.

765
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,960
You want me to pay?

766
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,310
Yes.

767
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,710
Dear friends of the Bureau,

768
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,750
welcome to

769
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,790
the launch of the alchemy book.

770
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,760
Yes!

771
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,360
So, Senior Caiwei,

772
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,710
studying alchemy is hard,

773
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,680
isn't it?

774
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,680
Yes.

775
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,990
You're always worried

776
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,360
about the effects.

777
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,160
You lose a lot of hair every day.

778
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,310
Stress eating makes you fat.

779
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,880
If there's a book

780
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,310
that can take your skills

781
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,070
to the next level at least,

782
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,840
- do you want it?
- Yes!

783
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,750
The one Senior Caiwei holds is called

784
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,360
How to Better Fake Tax Silver.

785
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,510
What's the market price?

786
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,710
It's in high demand.

787
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,070
The current market price is

788
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,600
25 liang each.

789
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,470
What?

790
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,440
25 liang!

791
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,990
No, that's a lot.

792
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,470
That's too much

793
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,710
for our dear friends.

794
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,160
I have to give them a discount.

795
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,990
I'll sell directly to them.

796
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:43,120
Cut out the middleman.

797
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,470
I'll bring down

798
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,590
the price!

799
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,880
Hadn't it been for the snacks,

800
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,160
I wouldn't have turned my elbow out.

801
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,880
It can only be turned out.

802
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,720
Here.

803
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,960
Thanks, partner.

804
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,670
Knowledge is wealth.

805
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,450
Princess has arrived!

806
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,860
(Lin'an, Second Princess)

807
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,550
Who is this?

808
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,440
(Gang, Maid)
How dare you stare at her! Bow!

809
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,070
I apologize.

810
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,870
Gang,

811
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,800
be nice.

812
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,400
Please.

813
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,080
No.

814
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:11,960
After you.

815
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,800
(She)

816
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,400
(must be Princess Huaiqing,)

817
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,280
(the wisest lady in the Dafeng.)

818
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,400
(She's as perfect as they say,)

819
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,150
(so elegant)

820
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,070
(and graceful.)

821
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,400
I didn't know you'd come.

822
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,070
Hold on. I'll report to Supervisor.

823
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,070
No need.

824
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,280
We've been here before.

825
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,120
Gang,

826
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,400
how many times have I told you?

827
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,670
This is the Bureau.

828
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,760
We're here for business.

829
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,400
Be polite and smile, yes?

830
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,920
Princess Lin'an.

831
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,070
What... what brings you here?

832
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,720
Nothing. I came myself.

833
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,760
I learned a lot

834
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,880
from our last discussion

835
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,280
about alchemy.

836
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,190
I'm here to learn more.

837
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,680
Wait!

838
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,110
Let me report to my teacher.

839
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,200
No need.

840
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,550
Don't bother Supervisor.

841
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,630
I know this place well.

842
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,510
Let's head to the Pill Room.

843
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,510
Sure.

844
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,320
Empty the Pill Room.

845
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,880
Careful, Your Highness.

846
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,440
Watch your step.

847
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,320
Careful.

848
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,400
It's empty?

849
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,590
How come?

850
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
I almost forgot.

851
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:47,760
Yesterday, a thief broke in

852
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,670
and took away everything.

853
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,960
Don't worry.

854
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,110
We're investigating it.

855
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,510
No clues have been found yet.

856
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,990
You can come

857
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,990
another day.

858
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,920
No need.

859
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,400
Come in.

860
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,280
Just now, I bought these

861
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,510
from the merchants

862
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,960
in the East Market.

863
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,350
Well,

864
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,150
you bought everything.

865
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,070
Fine. I'll show you

866
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,070
how to forge

867
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,170
a mirror.

868
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,360
Don't brush me off.

869
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,960
They say you've

870
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,070
figured out how to fake tax silver.

871
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,110
Huaiqing came to learn, too.

872
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,880
Yes. Right.

873
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,720
Even a talent

874
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,800
like her

875
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,630
can't make it easily,

876
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,240
let alone you.

877
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,960
Oh, Your Highness, I...

878
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,150
I didn't mean that.

879
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,960
I'm saying

880
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,240
you're

881
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,190
even more talented.

882
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,840
Doing such an easy experiment

883
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,510
is beneath you, right?

884
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,360
That's nice of you.

885
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,960
I want to have a try

886
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,590
and see if I'm

887
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,240
as skilled as Huaiqing.

888
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,470
Begin.

889
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,760
Step one,

890
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,400
melt the salt.

891
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,280
And filter it.

892
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,400
What's next?

893
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,320
Senior Song,

894
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,070
come here.

895
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,720
I forgot the next step.

896
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,190
Just...

897
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,590
put it on that stove.

898
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,400
The heat will

899
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,670
crystallize it.

900
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,800
I know step three.

901
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
Melt the crystals.

902
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,990
I brought a weapon with me.

903
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:01,990
Weapon?

904
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,280
Your bureau made it.

905
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,760
I've never seen it before.

906
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Calm down.

907
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,920
I know the spell.

908
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,800
H, He, Li, Be, B,

909
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,320
C, N, O, F, Ne,

910
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,070
Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, right?

911
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,030
Wait!

912
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,760
Senior Song!

913
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,090
- Are you hurt?
- Are you hurt?

914
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,960
Your Highness,

915
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,720
faking tax silver is dangerous.

916
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,070
One lapse ruins everything.

917
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,720
That weapon of yours

918
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,920
wasn't made by us!

919
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,470
How about this?

920
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,840
When the tools arrive,

921
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,280
we can continue.

922
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,070
I know what I did wrong.

923
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,840
Let's try again!

924
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,400
Help!

925
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,280
Help!

926
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,400
It worked.

927
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,320
Crystals melted.

928
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,550
Watch the voltage.

929
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,050
- What's that?
- The force of thunder.

930
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,570
Watch out!

931
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,240
Princess!

932
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,470
Again!

933
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,470
Do no wrong.

934
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,110
And fear no Guardians.

935
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,470
Guardians?

936
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,510
Hand off.

937
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,350
Be serious.

938
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Are you Xu Qi'an?

939
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,760
Speak.

940
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,720
Yes, I am.

941
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,760
Good.

942
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,630
Come with us.

943
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,120
Wait...

944
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,080
Sirs,

945
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,550
I'm innocent.

946
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,110
Do no wrong,

947
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,670
and fear no Guardians.
