Wait.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,200
Unlock it.

42
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:03,950
He's dead.

43
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,640
What?

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,870
He died?

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,360
The Governor of Taikang was
involved in the Sangbo Case.

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,710
I was one step too late when I

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,150
went to question him earlier.

48
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,990
He had been killed.

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,550
Lord Wei said he was important.

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,850
What's the cause of death?

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,040
It's unknown yet.

52
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,800
The coroner is doing an autopsy.

53
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,390
The prime suspect in the case
died in our prison,

54
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,800
but I have nothing to do with his death.

55
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,430
Sir,

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,960
our office will assist you with the case.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,360
You can command

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,920
the Three Branches and Six Boards.

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
The Governor of Taikang's death in jail

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,600
is an accident.

61
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,800
It's not your fault.

62
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,320
Thank you, sir.

63
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,240
You're welcome.

64
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,110
Caiwei said yesterday,

65
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,240
you also did me a huge favor

66
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,960
in the Ministry of Justice.

67
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,150
That was nothing.

68
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,550
So is this now.

69
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,270
Alright then.

70
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,670
I shall

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,870
take my leave.

72
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,240
Thank you for coming.

73
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,480
Sorry for troubling you.

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,320
I'll walk you out.

75
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,860
(Noble Character)

76
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,080
Thanks for coming all the way here.

77
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,360
No need.

78
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,040
I barely did anything.

79
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,550
So, the poems...

80
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,430
You'll receive them as promised.

81
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,110
When you cast the Heart Spell,

82
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,360
I saw you burn a page.

83
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,320
Forgive my ignorance.

84
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,240
I've never seen such a divine spell before.

85
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,430
How does it work?

86
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,150
Our academy made this spell book.

87
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,080
It records the spells unique to the Academy.

88
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,710
It's a rarity.

89
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,480
Burn it

90
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,670
and you can use

91
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,830
the spell on each page.

92
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,430
I see.

93
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,270
I didn't know there was such a thing.

94
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm sorry,

95
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:18,200
but I can't give you the poems anytime soon.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,320
I have a case to solve,

97
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,710
and my rank is low.

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,270
I'm afraid I can't write poems

99
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,910
for a long while.

100
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,910
How about I make you a spell book

101
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,750
to help you

102
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,320
improve your skills?

103
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,680
That'd be perfect.

104
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,160
And

105
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,470
the poems?

106
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
No problem.

107
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,990
Of course.

108
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,830
Take care, Master.

109
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,870
Chief.

110
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,030
I heard the Governor of Taikang died in jail.

111
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,230
What did Chen Hanguang say?

112
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,090
Read the autopsy report.

113
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
No trauma or poison.

114
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,270
He died quietly and mysteriously.

115
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,150
Caiwei questioned those
guarding the jail at night.

116
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,270
All of them are clean.

117
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,710
It further confirmed

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,230
that the Governor did die

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,440
in his sleep that night.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,680
He was killed in sleep.

121
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
What's on your mind?

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,390
I heard the Yin Spirit

123
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,350
of the Three Sects could do that.

124
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,750
The Three Sects?

125
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,560
(If they did it,)

126
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,760
(Mr. Jinlian would've been tipped off.)

127
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,520
Or

128
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,030
only that race could do so.

129
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,830
Wizards.

130
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,270
Wizards?

131
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,310
Follow me.

132
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you know The Witcher's Sect?

133
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,560
Uncle Pingzhi told me about it,

134
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,710
saying The Witcher was beyond all ranks.

135
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,030
Did he

136
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,440
build this sect?

137
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,960
The Witcher is worshiped
by all the northern states.

138
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,470
His sect holds supreme power in the North,

139
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,390
just like the Tianyu Sect in the West.

140
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,120
15 years ago,

141
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,000
scuffles broke out
between General Zhenxi and that sect.

142
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,910
2,000 elite troops

143
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,910
died quietly in the barracks overnight.

144
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,390
No wounds were found on them.

145
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,000
They all died in their sleep,

146
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,270
including General Zhenxi.

147
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,470
Since then,

148
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,590
Yunzhou has become no-man's land.

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,590
Bandits are everywhere.

150
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,270
Disasters never end.

151
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,390
According to the information from our scouts,

152
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,120
it's likely to have become

153
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
that sect's stronghold in the Dafeng.

154
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,910
If Yunzhou is also involved in this case,

155
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,830
the situation will be more complicated.

156
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,440
I have a feeling.

157
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,120
The end of the Gengzi Year

158
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,080
will be the start of chaos!

159
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,270
Alright. That's enough.

160
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,450
You're making me confused.

161
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,470
Our job is to solve cases.

162
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,590
Don't be so dramatic.

163
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,520
Where are you going, Ningyan?

164
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,710
Seize Zhou Chixiong.

165
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,220
(Yunzhou, Command Office)

166
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,230
Yang Gong is in town.

167
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,270
I see.

168
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,910
What to do?

169
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,910
(Yang Chuannan, Commander of Yunzhou)

170
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,440
What do you mean?

171
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,260
(Li Miaozhen)
You know that.

172
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
(No. 2 of Realm Sect)

173
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,230
(4th Rank of Heaven)
He'll take away your power.

174
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,760
The rule is the rule.

175
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,030
I'll follow it.

176
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,390
Can't you see

177
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,200
the Emperor appointed him
Commissioner of Qingzhou

178
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,960
in case you take all power into your hands?

179
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,750
Qingzhou and Yunzhou are governed together.

180
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,590
The Commissioner of Qingzhou
manages Yunzhou, too.

181
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,440
Yang Gong,

182
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,440
well, I heard he was

183
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,590
from the Yunlu Academy.

184
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,120
He took his student's poem before leaving.

185
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,470
I bet he's also of the greedy sort,

186
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,920
coming here for merits and power.

187
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
The Dafeng is

188
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,830
full of such pests.

189
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,320
What's your plan then?

190
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,870
Just say the word.

191
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,320
I'll finish him.

192
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,080
We can't act rashly.

193
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,560
I'm sick of your cowardice!

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,920
Emperor Yuanjing should die!

195
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Miaozhen!

196
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,430
What's wrong?

197
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,990
I'm not his official.

198
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,870
Miss Winged Woman,

199
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,880
your actions

200
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,280
of suppressing bandits

201
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,440
and exterminating evil

202
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,080
have made Yunzhou safe.

203
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,630
I thank you on behalf of the locals.

204
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,590
However,

205
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,750
rules are rules.

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,470
I'm a court official after all.

207
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,070
I shall

208
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,990
abide by them.

209
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,960
Where are you going?

210
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,040
This room reeks of bureaucracy.

211
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
I need fresh air.

212
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,420
(Just and Stern)

213
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,400
- General Li.
- Yes?

214
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,920
Another chief is rising

215
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,990
in the 80-li Bandits' Lair.

216
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,470
They're looting and robbing

217
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,440
even more rampantly.

218
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,870
Keep gathering information.

219
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,800
Once the time's ripe,

220
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,040
gather our troops to wipe them out.

221
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,880
Yes!

222
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,730
- Go.
- Let's go.

223
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,710
You're out so soon, Master.

224
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,700
(Su Su, Heaven Sect)

225
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,190
I'm mad.

226
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,400
Look at you

227
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,680
coughing again.

228
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,280
This is a mountainous area.

229
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't catch a cold.

230
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,340
(Cold Medicine)

231
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,470
I know.

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,400
Are you mad at Yang Chuannan again?

233
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,800
Court officials are too cautious.

234
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,830
You only serve under him as a Calvary General

235
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
for your friendship.

236
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,590
If he makes you mad,

237
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,160
just quit.

238
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,320
But in all of Yunzhou,

239
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,560
he's the only official who supports us

240
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,590
to exterminate bandits.

241
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,350
It's all that stupid emperor's fault.

242
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,310
Guys,

243
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,110
more bad news from the capital.

244
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
(No. 2)
What happened?

245
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,040
Did Emperor Yuanjing die?

246
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,870
When the Inner and Outer Cities

247
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,200
were put on lockdown,

248
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,040
I knew something bad happened.

249
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,120
No. 1,

250
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,680
did you hear anything?

251
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,590
(Interesting.)

252
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,630
(Mr. Jinlian)

253
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,990
(isn't asking me, a Guardian,)

254
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,960
(but asking No. 1 instead.)

255
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,590
The explosion at Sangbo

256
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,830
destroyed the Ancestral Temple.

257
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,200
The thing sealed in the lake

258
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,740
(No. 1)
is missing.

259
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,590
No. 3,

260
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,960
do you know anything?

261
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
I do.

262
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,440
The Academy got some leads

263
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
via their private channels,

264
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,560
enough to put together the situation.

265
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,700
(No. 7, No. 8, No. 9, No. 1, No. 3)

266
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,620
(No. 6, No. 7, No. 8, No. 1)

267
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,660
(No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 5)

268
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,710
Kui did it?

269
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,040
No way.

270
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,230
How did they blow up that place?

271
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,750
Investigation shows

272
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,510
Kui got Yanxiao from Mount Dahuang,

273
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,920
turned it into gunpowder,

274
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,280
and smuggled it into the Inner City
with Zhou Chixiong's help

275
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,630
to explode Sangbo.

276
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,920
After the explosion,

277
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,870
Zhou fled with his family.

278
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,830
(No. 1)
So that's a dead end.

279
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,920
Not exactly.

280
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,110
I believe

281
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,350
the court will make him a wanted man soon.

282
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,040
Either he'll leave the Dafeng,

283
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
or he'll hide in a safe place.

284
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,230
Where do you think he'll go?

285
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,400
Obviously,

286
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,830
he'll go to Yunzhou.

287
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,000
No. 2,

288
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,040
(No. 1)
you're well-connected there.

289
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,160
Can you help me find Zhou Chixiong?

290
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,630
(Nice!)

291
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,830
(Looks like No. 1 trusts No. 2)

292
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,990
(more than the government.)

293
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,280
I won't.

294
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,750
I'll pay you.

295
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,830
No.

296
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,350
You serve the court.

297
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,510
I will not help you.

298
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,140
(No. 1)

299
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,400
(This is bad.)

300
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,920
(Without No. 2's help)

301
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,400
(how can we)

302
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,680
(find Zhou Chixiong in the vast Yunzhou?)

303
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,190
No. 2,

304
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,630
you owe me for helping No. 6 out.

305
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,590
Does your promise stand?

306
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,680
Of course.

307
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,400
I, Li Miaozhen, is a woman of my word.

308
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,240
Fine.

309
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,280
Keep an eye on Zhou if he's in Yunzhou.

310
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,040
Then we're even.

311
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,280
As for No. 1,

312
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,160
(No. 1)
you owe me now.

313
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,510
What do you say?

314
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,470
Deal.

315
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,430
(No. 1)
Deal.

316
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,460
(Haoqi Tower)

317
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,540
(Rule With Virtue)

318
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,500
(The Witcher's Sect...)

319
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,620
(General Zhenxi died in his sleep, too.)

320
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,920
Lord Wei, Xu Qi'an is here.

321
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,560
Greetings, Lord Wei.

322
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,350
Yesterday morning, in court,

323
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,630
I caught sight of the progress you made.

324
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,960
You're doing well in the case.

325
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,750
You're too busy to be disturbed.

326
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
I didn't want to trouble you.

327
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,820
Zhou Chixiong is wanted by the court now.

328
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:32,990
(Insignia Guard, Baihu)

329
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,830
(Zhou Chixiong)
But

330
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,470
it's hard to find him in 15 days.

331
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,400
Do you have other ideas?

332
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,750
I believe

333
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,560
he's likely to flee to Yunzhou,

334
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,400
so

335
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,080
I've asked No. 2 there to seize him.

336
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,510
Yunzhou?

337
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,470
It's worth trying.

338
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,440
But the water there is deeper than you think.

339
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,630
It takes time to find him.

340
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,510
You have a point, sir.

341
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,080
Have you considered tracking down

342
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,230
his weapon?

343
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,710
His weapon?

344
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,320
His energy was concealed.

345
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,800
Even those of the Bureau didn't sense it.

346
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
That means two things.

347
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,710
First,

348
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,470
the one who cast the spell is high-ranking.

349
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,040
Second,

350
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,080
Zhou must have

351
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,470
an energy-concealing weapon.

352
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,400
Check his household registration.

353
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,040
He's merely 8th Rank.

354
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,830

♪Neither joy nor sorrow lingers♪

376
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,700
♪Flowers fall; their fragrance fades♪

377
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,190
♪I pledge my life to you♪

378
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,120
Father, the carriage is outside.

379
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,990
I'm going to the Palace.

380
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,240
Xu Qi'an,

381
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,440
come along?

382
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,270
Leave the court

383
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,600
for the outside world?

384
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,760
Yes.

385
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,160
You don't belong to the court

386
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,470
but to the outside world.

387
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,360
Hadn't it been for the Sangbo Case,

388
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
you would've

389
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,680
left the capital by now as I planned.

390
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,030
If you fail to solve this case,

391
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,720
you

392
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,400
can be the Guardians' informer

393
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,400
and my weapon

394
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,600
in the shadow.

395
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,310
How about that?

396
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,990
Do you find it unfair?

397
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,030
As long as I can live on,

398
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,440
I'll be a slave,

399
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,960
not to mention a weapon.

400
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,400
Being in the shadow is tough.

401
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,840
Informers have to hide their identities

402
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,030
and leave their families.

403
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,680
Even if

404
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,990
they die,

405
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,680
no one will know.

406
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,440
I don't want to leave yet.

407
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,640
I'll do my utmost

408
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
to find out the truth.

409
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,470
You're

410
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,990
sophisticated yet upright.

411
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,640
You can be stubborn sometimes.

412
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,990
I like and dislike

413
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,070
all those sides of yours.

414
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
I know

415
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,510
the Guardian Yamen has

416
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,600
long-standing issues.

417
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,710
I'm well aware of that.

418
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,440
But this is human nature,

419
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
partly bright, partly dark.

420
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,750
How many people are like Li Yuchun?

421
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
Were all the Guardians

422
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,440
like him,

423
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,790
how could we hold court officials down?

424
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,750
I understand that.

425
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,880
But when I see

426
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,160
what's unjust,

427
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,710
I can't turn a blind eye to it.

428
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,640
Long-standing issues

429
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,640
can't be solved overnight.

430
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,680
In the world of politics,

431
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
you must tread carefully.

432
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,160
Remember,

433
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,920
clear water has few fish.

434
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
Haste makes waste.

435
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,470
It's better

436
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,960
to take one step at a time

437
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,030
to divide

438
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,400
and conquer.

439
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
I understand.

440
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,060
(Palace of the Dafeng)

441
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,840
Greetings, Lord Wei.

442
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,120
Greetings.

443
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,880
This is

444
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
the handler of the Sangbo Case, Xu Qi'an.

445
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,790
I have to trouble you

446
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,070
to take him to greet the Grand Princess.

447
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,790
No trouble at all.

448
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,200
Grand Princess?

449
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,200
The Imperial Library in the Palace

450
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,640
keeps records of various weapons.

451
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Grand Princess can

452
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,120
grant you access to them.

453
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,590
Yes.

454
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,680
The contest is today.

455
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,270
Did you sleep well last night, Princess?

456
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,310
I slept soundly.

457
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,230
When we came to the lake before,

458
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,440
the Loong would surface to play with us.

459
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,640
Where is it now?

460
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,360
I've been watching the lake for a while.

461
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
It's been utterly quiet.

462
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,680
You probably don't know.

463
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,160
Since the Sangbo Ceremony,

464
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,030
the Loong has been uneasy.

465
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,990
That day,

466
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,600
it surfaced and roared

467
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,200
and then dived into the water.

468
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,880
However hard Father tried,

469
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,840
it refused to resurface

470
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,550
or go anywhere near royalty again.

471
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,120
Without the Loong,

472
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,790
why hold the contest here?

473
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,200
It's far from my place.

474
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,360
What a bummer!

475
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,960
Have you memorized them all?

476
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,110
Don't worry.

477
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,200
I've memorized the poems

478
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,710
and the stories behind them.

479
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,990
I can't wait to shine at the contest

480
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
and bring Huaiqing down...

481
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,550
Greetings, Princes.

482
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
Your Highness.

483
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,640
The Poetry Contest is coming.

484
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,880
We're having a rehearsal today.

485
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,310
Thanks for coming from the Directorate
of Education to host it.

486
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,280
It's my honor.

487
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,440
My pleasure.

488
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,230
I'm eager to see the elegant Dafeng royalty.

489
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,360
So

490
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,310
you're Princess Huaiqing's private eunuch.

491
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,750
Why have I never seen you before?

492
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,510
I've always been in the Palace,

493
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,120
and I seldom go out.

494
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,150
Well,

495
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,510
I manage the affairs for Her Highness

496
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,710
in the Palace.

497
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,550
Forgive me

498
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,600
if I overstep the line

499
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,960
by asking you this.

500
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,960
Aren't you Princess Lin'an's kept...?

501
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,520
What?

502
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,200
I mean

503
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,750
as Princess Lin'an's trusted man,

504
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,640
you remain

505
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,270
close to Princess Huaiqing.

506
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,240
What if

507
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,070
Princess Lin'an finds out?

508
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,840
So what if she knows?

509
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,710
Ningyan,

510
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,120
you really are bold.

511
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,600
But how are you going to explain to her?

512
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,790
Explain what?

513
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,160
Come on!

514
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,790
Why should I explain to her?

515
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,270
I knew she meant to recruit me,

516
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,200
but I'm a man of loyalty.

517
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
I only serve Princess Huaiqing.

518
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,070
Lin'an

519
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,030
should know that.

520
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,480
Please.

521
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,990
You really are extraordinary.

522
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,310
Thanks. I'm flattered.

523
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,440
"Moon".

524
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,830
Round one,

525
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,440
a relay.

526
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,510
Say lines with the word "moon"

527
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,510
in turn.

528
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,960
Whoever fails

529
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,710
has to drink one cup.

530
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,400
Who'd like

531
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,880
to go first?

532
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,550
I'll start

533
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,200
with my humble lines.

534
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,600
"The moon sets, rooks caw,

535
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,710
frost fills the sky.

536
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,550
Maples and fishing boat lights

537
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,920
make me too sad to sleep."

538
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,040
Good!

539
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,240
Nice!

540
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,770
- Beautiful!
- Good!

541
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,270
Spot on!

542
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,310
Excellent indeed!

543
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,030
Princess Lin'an,

544
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,710
long time no see.

545
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,270
I should

546
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,960
look at you with new eyes.

547
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,720
May I ask

548
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,550
what they're...?

549
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,640
You probably don't know.

550
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,160
The Princes and Princesses

551
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,990
are discussing poems

552
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,030
to prepare for the upcoming Poetry Contest.

553
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,510
Grand Princess has been working hard for it.

554
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,160
If all that I've done

555
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,440
can be of some help,

556
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,990
I'll be content.

557
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,470
Is he that kept man?

558
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,120
Please hold on, sir.

559
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,920
Do you want to die?

560
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,230
Don't you know the rules?

561
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,030
We're really sorry.

562
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,160
This is the first time we've seen Mr. Xu.

563
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,920
We can't help but look at him.

564
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,990
(Even those in the Palace know me.)

565
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,160
What's there to look at?

566
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,400
Have you never seen a man?

567
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,470
We've seen men,

568
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,310
but not

569
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,480
a kept man.

570
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,360
Yes.

571
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,200
He's Princess Lin'an's kept man, no less.

572
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,230
(Lin'an's telling everyone I'm her kept man.)

573
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,160
(Is that to sow discord
between me and Grand Princess?)

574
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,790
(Grand Princess must've
heard such rumors, too.)

575
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,850
(It's bad.)

576
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,430
(I must make her give up today.)

577
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,510
The shore is shrouded in mist in spring.

578
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,790
The cloudy sky is reflected in waves.

579
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,750
Gang.

580
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Good work.

581
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
It sounds

582
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,120
great and majestic.

583
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,840
Agreed.

584
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,880
- Good.
- Great.

585
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,840
Well done.

586
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,150
Carry on.

587
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,600
The long march of time never ends.

588
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,030
The clear flow of water runs ceaselessly.

589
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,870
What's going on?

590
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,230
Shall I kneel to you, too?

591
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,310
No.

592
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,310
Copper Gong Xu,

593
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,270
what brings you here?

594
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,510
I came with Lord Wei

595
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,720
to see Grand Princess for work.

596
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,360
Is that so?

597
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,750
Never mind.

598
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,070
How's Her Highness doing?

599
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,030
So far, so good.

600
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,600
All thanks to your poems.

601
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,310
I'm not asking about the contest.

602
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,200
Do you not know

603
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,240
right now,

604
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,750
rumors are spreading in the Palace

605
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,310
that I'm Princess Lin'an's...

606
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,360
I'm Princess Lin'an's kept man?

607
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,920
But that's a sheer lie.

608
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,580
I'd never go so low.

609
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,440
It must be Princess...

610
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,880
It must be Princess Lin'an's trick

611
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,230
to sow discord.

612
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,920
Grand Princess wouldn't believe it.

613
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,070
I'm relieved.

614
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,360
I thought...

615
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,400
Don't worry.

616
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,270
Her Highness didn't blame you.

617
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,200
She felt bad for you, actually.

618
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,750
She knows you're faithful

619
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,120
and trustworthy.

620
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,360
It's so wise of her!

621
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,480
Your Highness!

622
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:40,960
Your turn.

623
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
I'll give it a try.

624
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,450
Your Highness, I...

625
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,600
Passing crows wade into the water to drink.

626
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,840
Returned swallows find wrong families.

627
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,230
What's that attitude?

628
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,360
Is she avoiding me?

629
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,600
She's far away from you.

630
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
She can't see you.

631
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,640
She did see me.

632
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,960
- She didn't.
- Our eyes met.

633
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,160
I said she didn't!

634
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,470
Gang, explain it for me.

635
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,840
Get him out of here. Go!

636
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,300
- Wait. I just came...
- Go!

637
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,880
Did she believe the rumors?

638
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,840
- Gang!
- She'll summon you another day!

639
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,310
Explain it for me!

640
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,960
Why did he come?

641
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,880
He said it was for some work.

642
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,160
Don't worry.

643
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,510
I've let him go.

644
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,470
Luckily, you acted in time.

645
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,200
Xu Qi'an is a strong rival.

646
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,920
Don't you think

647
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,510
Father favors him too much?

648
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,900
How long did it take you
to get in his carriage?

649
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,120
Three years.

650
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,880
Even I had to wait one year and four months.

651
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,160
But it's only been three months

652
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,400
since he joined us.

653
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,270
He's to Lord Wei's taste.

654
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,440
I'm not surprised.

655
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,310
So is Li Yuchun.

656
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,760
No.

657
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,790
There must be other reasons.

658
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,470
Where's Xu Qi'an from?

659
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,520
Why ask?

660
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,310
Do you still want to be Lord Wei's relative?

661
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,600
Tell me now.

662
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,230
Say it.

663
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,710
Xu's from the capital,

664
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,120
far away from Lord Wei's hometown.

665
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,230
They aren't fellow townsmen.

666
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,030
Are you sure they aren't?

667
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,750
Yes, I'm sure.

668
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,120
Are you tired?

669
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,200
Here comes the golden boy.

670
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,200
Yan?

671
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,960
Guys, my friend is here.

672
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,880
Let me down, please.

673
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,070
Come on.

674
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,200
Thank you.

675
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,310
Thanks a lot.

676
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,840
You may leave.

677
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,960
Go back. It's fine.

678
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,070
Xu Qi'an,

679
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,550
you're from the capital, right?

680
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,790
Yes or no?

681
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,120
Yes, I guess.

682
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,810
Did you go to the Imperial Library?

683
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,200
Not yet.

684
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,640
Did you see the Grand Princess?

685
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
Yes, sort of.

686
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,840
You saw her but didn't go to the Library.

687
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,470
Why did you come out?

688
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,070
I have no idea either.

689
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,920
As soon as I saw her

690
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,710
and said a few words,

691
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,120
they carried me out

692
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,030
as you saw.

693
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,920
I'll tell you what's this.

694
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,990
It's called karma.

695
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
Don't think you're a golden boy

696
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,840
that everyone likes.

697
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,150
Hey,

698
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,840
why the sarcasm?

699
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,210
Ningyan!

700
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,480
Greetings.

701
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,830
Ningyan,

702
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,360
Grand Princess asked to see you.

703
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,870
Lead the way.

704
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,040
Your Highness,

705
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,200
it's your turn.

706
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,600
The last word of the line should

707
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,070
be "water".

708
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,020
It can be a bit tricky.

709
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,500
What's wrong, Your Highness?

710
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,270
None of the lines from Xu Qi'an

711
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,750
end with the word "water".

712
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,390
Then

713
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
what to do?

714
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,630
Brother,

715
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,230
I think she'll

716
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:36,510
have to drink up.

717
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,880
Among all of us,

718
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,270
only Huaiqing hasn't had to drink.

719
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,750
No wonder she's the wisest lady in our state.

720
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,160
Fill her cup!

721
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,130
- Drink.
- Fill it.

722
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,360
Lin'an is still waiting.

723
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,200
Right, Brother?

724
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,160
Drink. Drink up!

725
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
Drink.

726
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,210
Yes, she has to drink.

727
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,160
"Drunk, I can't see the sky in the water.

728
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,470
Sweet dreams weigh down the Milky Way."

729
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,680
You...

730
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,310
"Drunk, I can't see the sky in the water.

731
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:06,200
Sweet dreams weigh down

732
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,750
the Milky Way."

733
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,280
Brilliant!

734
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,070
The lines are ethereal and vivid

735
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,990
with perfectly matching words.

736
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,360
May I ask you're...?

737
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,790
I'm Xu Qi'an,

738
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,440
Princess Huaiqing's guest advisor.

739
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,440
Xu Qi'an? That name sounds familiar.

740
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,070
Isn't he Lin'an's kept man?

741
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,790
I came to see you, Your Highness.

742
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,790
I'm confused.

743
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,030
Which princess

744
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,790
do you serve as a guest advisor?

745
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,160
Sir, sir.

746
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,880
Over here.

747
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,840
A bosom friend is rare to find in life.

748
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,270
A confidant is hard to meet in all times.

749
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,440
I don't deserve

750
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,270
two princesses' appreciation.

751
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,640
I'm feeling both scared

752
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,750
and more than grateful.

753
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,910
However,

754
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,680
a horse doesn't carry two saddles.

755
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,440
The loyal don't serve two masters.

756
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,120
As humble as I am,

757
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,030
I have my own principles.

758
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,710
Princess Huaiqing,

759
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,510
you appreciate my ability.

760
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,510
Without your help,

761
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,880
who knows where I'd end up?

762
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,400
I could be the meat

763
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,750
on others' chopping block.

764
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,880
Princess Lin'an,

765
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,680
as a princess of our state,

766
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,790
you should be able to understand

767
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,400
my eagerness to repay others' kindness.

768
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,030
I'm extremely flattered and grateful

769
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,470
for your offer,

770
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,750
but I have to turn it down.

771
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,310
Please let me go

772
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,550
and respect my decision.

773
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,040
Princess Huaiqing,

774
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,790
I'm not a kept man.

775
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,840
Could you let go of the rumors

776
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,680
and trust me again?

777
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,160
I...

778
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,720
I...

779
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,400
Are you still doubting me?

780
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,070
I, Xu Qi'an, swear solemnly

781
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,100
that I'll devote my life to you

782
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,310
and spare no effort in my duty.

783
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,270
I'll only

784
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,440
serve Princess Huaiqing to the end!

785
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,750
H-H-He...

786
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,270
Did he make a mistake?

787
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,840
You made a mistake.

788
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,360
- There...
- That's enough.

789
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,630
Princess Huaiqing is over there.

790
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,470
Princess Lin'an,

791
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,550
can you stop playing such silly games?

792
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,670
- Princess!
- Lin'an!

793
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,440
- Call imperial physicians!
- Are you dizzy?

794
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,400
Princess!

795
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,030
Go get imperial physicians! Hurry!

796
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,510
No need.

797
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,150
Go to the Bureau.

798
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,800
Lin'an once fainted there.

799
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,680
They have the right medicine.

800
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,800
Yes. Right.

801
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,590
Go to the Bureau.

802
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,920
She'll be fine.

803
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,730
Let's go to the Bureau.

804
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,820
Sure.

805
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,070
Call imperial physicians!

806
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,910
Don't worry.

807
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,470
He'll wake up in a minute.

808
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,800
Let's go.

809
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,590
- Go to my place.
- Join us, Master.

810
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,150
- Let's go.
- Sure, let's go.

811
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,760
Why are they talking so happily?

812
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,110
Are they talking?

813
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,990
I didn't know the truth until just now.

814
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,030
That's about the whole thing.

815
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,920
Sorry, I offended you repeatedly.

816
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,190
Please forgive me.

817
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,760
It's a clear day today.

818
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,030
Let's take a walk.

819
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,390
Yes.

820
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,630
- Are they leaving?
- Don't know.

821
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,070
- Where to?
- Don't know.

822
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,580
(Cultivate the Mind)

823
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,070
Yesterday,

824
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,400
the Treasure Sect made new Golden Pills.

825
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,150
I'll

826
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,190
have them send one to you.

827
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

828
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,280
One Golden Pill

829
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
for one of your pawns.

830
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
Fair enough, huh?

831
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,800
Of course.

832
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,360
Your side seems a bit messy.

833
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,190
I'll clean house

834
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,150
for you.

835
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,360
How clever.

836
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,550
Over the years,

837
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,550
you've become

838
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,590
my most trusted aide.

839
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,720
I keep thinking

840
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,110
hadn't you

841
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,440
entered the Palace

842
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,800
but taken the Imperial Examination,

843
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,920
wouldn't our state have one more fixer,

844
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,840
and I

845
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,440
wouldn't be troubled by those trifles?

846
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,760
Your Majesty,

847
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,240
I'm still

848
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,550
serving you, right?

849
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,680
Wrong!

850
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,720
Can't you see

851
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,440
that's a trap?

852
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,280
Sorry, Father.

853
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,030
My skills are poor.

854
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,190
If it stays,

855
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,550
crisis will arise.

856
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,320
Where are we on the Sangbo Case?

857
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:40,550
Files from the Municipal Office
and Justice are a mess.

858
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,360
As I recall,

859
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,990
the handler of the case is a criminal,

860
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,150
a Copper Gong Guardian named Xu.

861
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,200
Yes.

862
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,920
It's Xu Qi'an.

863
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,110
He's quite skilled.

864
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
He solved the Flag Officer's case

865
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,510
and Zhou Chixiong's case.

866
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,550
He also found

867
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:02,720
where the gunpowder came from.

868
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,320
I heard of it.

869
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,670
He has a clear mind

870
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,470
and a great gift for investigation.

871
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,840
Found anything so far?

872
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,960
As a matter of fact, yes.

873
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,360
Governor Zhao of Taikang

874
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,960
was found dead in jail

875
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,320
before dawn yesterday.

876
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,920
Magistrate Chen has reported it to me.

877
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
The cause of death

878
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,510
isn't trauma,

879
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,880
poison,

880
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,800
suffocation, or other human causes.

881
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,120
Either

882
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,990
the Yin Spirit of the Three Sects

883
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
or

884
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,150
the northern wizards did it.

885
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,670
So

886
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,760
what's the status now?

887
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,120
Your Highness,

888
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,190
Zhou Chixiong fooled the Gazing Spell

889
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,280
and fled out of the capital.

890
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,320
He must've used some kind of weapon.

891
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,440
That's why I'm thinking

892
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,070
by tracking down his weapon...

893
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,030
I know all that.

894
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,600
What else?

895
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,240
Is that all you've found?

896
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,320
What would you like to know?

897
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,280
I checked your investigation records.

898
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,030
You found the Bureau's seal in Sangbo.

899
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,880
Tianyu Language was carved
on the pillar in it.

900
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,400
Have you pursued that lead?

901
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,550
Your Highness,

902
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,440
Lord Wei told me specifically

903
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,320
not to dig into whatever that was in Sangbo.

904
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,510
I wouldn't dare defy him.

905
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,030
Also,

906
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,630
why Kui blew up the Ancestral Temple

907
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,800
remains unknown.

908
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,630
Their motive might lead to the truth, too.

909
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,960
Someone or something powerful

910
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,990
was sealed under the Ancestral Temple.

911
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,630
However,

912
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,240
only Father knows that secret.

913
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,880
Lord Wei told you not to dig into it

914
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,190
to protect you.

915
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,470
(She knows that, too.)

916
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,840
Go on

917
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,960
with your theory.

918
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,800
A mere 8th-Rank Fighter like Zhou

919
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,990
pulled off such a shocking scheme

920
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,720
and ran away with his weapon.

921
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,380
I believe

922
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,150
someone in the court is covering for him.

923
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,110
That person is

924
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,030
likely to be involved in the Yanxiao Case

925
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,510
and the Missing Tax Silver Case, too.

926
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,590
Or a huge organization is behind Zhou.

927
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,400
As for their goal...

928
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,920
Do you mean...?

929
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,670
I dare not make assumptions,

930
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,110
but as Kui is involved,

931
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,110
and they meant to lift the seal in the lake,

932
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,360
the mastermind wants more than power.

933
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:50,920
Among the powerful officials,

934
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,190
those who could secretly collude with Kui...
