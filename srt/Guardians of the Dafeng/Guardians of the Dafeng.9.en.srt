Slow down.

41
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,640
Why is this earthen kiln so deep?

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,550
It's been a cup of tea's time,

43
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,000
but we haven't reached the bottom.

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,270
Perhaps they're excavating something.

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,560
Slow down.

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,830
Where exactly are you?

47
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,710
Where exactly are you?

What are you doing?

51
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,870
Sorry.

52
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,710
I misheard it.

53
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,520
Wait a moment.

54
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,320
Limestone.

55
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,600
As expected,

56
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,240
it's saltpeter.

57
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,480
Saltpeter?

58
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,810
To put it in another way,

59
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,950
it's Yanxiao,

60
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,910
the main material for making gunpowder.

61
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,280
With so much gunpowder found
on Mount Dahuang,

62
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,820
someone must've been mining it.

63
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,160
We must immediately return
to the capital

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,530
and report this matter.

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,990
Watch out!

66
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,480
Xu Qi'an!

67
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,680
- Let's go!
- Go!

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,520

at the Spirit Stage.

No wonder I can't sense demon aura.

75
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,860
The Kui Beast was born
with steel-like bones.

76
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,190
Its eyes, jaw,

77
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,370
and mouth are weak points.

78
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,870
Got it.

79
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,150
Great, Xu Qi'an. You're not dead!

80
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,760
Almost.

81
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,300
The Kui Beast has steel-like bones.

82
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,390
Be extra careful.

83
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,270

Annoying.

120
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,710
I can't go on.

121
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,920
Stay back.

122
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,470
Why did you cut off its bone armor?

123
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,680
As the Guardians are on missions,

124
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,520
we often face extreme dangers.

125
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,590
Sometimes we can't return.

126
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,590
I thought

127
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,510
if anything happened to me,

128
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,230
this could be a keepsake

129
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,110

130
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,160
Seeing this bone armor

131
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,830
would be like seeing me.

132
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,660
- What's wrong?
- Stop being so dramatic.

133
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,470
This is for getting rewards
at the yamen.

134
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,710
Zhu, when the time comes,
I'll help you get your reward.

135
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,960
Why expose my plan?

136
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
- No need.
- Give it to me.

137
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,990
Go cut it yourself.

138
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,400
Xu Qi'an.

139
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,760
What's this?

140
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:52,200
This is the Healing Pill I refined.

141
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,990
I only brought one in a rush.

142
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Take it quickly.

143
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,080
It'll help with your recovery.

144
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,470
Should I just eat it?

145
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,430
Of course.

146
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,310
Thank you.

147
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,400
Bro.

148
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,230
A pill from the Astronomical Bureau.

149
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,080
How does

150
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,920
this pill taste?

151
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,760
Delicious.

152
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,260
Do you want to try it?

153
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
Here.

154
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,560
Thank you, bro.

155
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,470
Is it so good?

156
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,320
The pill from the Astronomical Bureau

157
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,710
is incredibly delicious.

158
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,590
It's the Healing Pill?

159
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,560
I'm injured too.

160
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,870
No, this pill

161
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,590
is not for anyone
who just wants to eat it.

162
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,190
Guangxiao,

163
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,710
we're brothers who've been
through danger together.

164
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,160
Since we're brothers,

165
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
things should be shared.

166
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,990
Thank you, good brother.

167
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,440
Don't waste it. Swallow it.

168
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,520
Don't waste it.

169
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,780
Swallow it.

170
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,640
Did you eat it?

171
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,710
It's so awful I almost threw up.

172
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,120
The Astronomical Bureau's pills

173
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,280
are treasures.

174
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
How dare you spit it out?

175
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
Delicious.

176
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,350
Delicious.

177
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,390
It has a sweet aftertaste.

178
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,360
I feel reinvigorated.

179
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,230
By the way, Xu Qi'an,

180
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,760
I've been wanting to ask you.

181
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,750
Your saber is unusual,

182
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,100
not like the ones from the yamen.

183
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,960
Is it a magic weapon?

184
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,160
Of course not.

185
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,560
My uncle commissioned it
specifically for me.

186
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,590
My Lords,

187
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,450
I've brought a local.

188
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm Zhang,

189
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,590
Village Head of Waigou Village
of Mount Dahuang.

190
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,800
Stand up and speak.

191
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,940
I dare not.

192
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,380
I told you to stand up, so stand up.

193
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,720
Do you understand human language?

194
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,780
Sir, we just want
to ask a few questions.

195
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
Please stand up.

196
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,420
May I ask

197
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,540
when this earthen kiln was mined?

198
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,580
This is an old kiln from the past.

199
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,100
The limestone here

200
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,340
was almost fully mined out.

201
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,380
It's been abandoned for years.

202
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,740
I heard the last group of people
who entered the mountain went south.

203
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,020
Are there kilns over there too?

204
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,380
There are abandoned kilns there as well,

205
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,580
but more than here.

206
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,180
My Lords.

207
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,860
My Lords,
you did a great service for us.

208
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,940
You must've worked hard for these eggs.

209
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,380
Please, keep them for yourself.

210
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,200
It's just a small token
of gratitude from us.

211
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,500
We appreciate your kindness.

212
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,740
We can't take things
from the common people.

213
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,660
- My Lords.
- Please, go back.

214
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,220
Village Head, please stay.

215
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,980
It's a small gift. Please accept it.

216
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,820
- Village Head, no need.
- Really.

217
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,780
If you don't accept it, we'll feel bad.

218
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,980
This thing doesn't have a mouth.

219
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,340
How could it talk?

220
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,940
Take a closer look.

221
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
Since yesterday,

222
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,660
I've been hearing strange sounds.

223
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,140
At first, I thought I misheard it.

224
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,580
But when we went up the mountain,

225
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,900
I confirmed the strange sound
was from this mirror.

226
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,300
Sorry,

227
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,900
I'm just an astrologer.

228
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,100
For this kind of problem,

229
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,780
you'd better ask Senior Song.

230
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,460
That's exactly what I intended.

231
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,940
I was planning to go
to the Astronomical Bureau,

232
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
but since you're here,

233
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,740
could you deliver it for me?

234
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,100
So,

235
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,540
you were planning
to have me deliver it all along?

236
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,060
Why should I?

237
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,080
It's an equivalent exchange.

238
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,060
Just take this.

239
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,260
- I can't.
- I really can't. Hurry.

240
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,540
Please.

241
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,910
I have no other choice, My Lords.

242
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,610
Guangxiao, help me hold this.

243
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,980
Do you want one?

244
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,780
Later,

245
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,660
report this honestly to the chief.

246
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,060
Of course.

247
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,020
Everyone from the Astronomical Bureau
and Municipal Office is here.

248
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,900
How could we hide it?

249
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,540
Right, Caiwei?

250
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,900
Caiwei already left.

251
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,020
Ms. Chu said
she didn't want to report back,

252
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,180
so she left first.

253
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,340
She's learning fast.

254
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,620
Ningyan, Tingfeng is right.

255
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,860
When you see the chief,

256
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,900
just report the case.

257
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,060
Don't mention

258
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
anything unrelated.

259
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,300
Got it.

260
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,060
Do you really not want one?

261
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,180
They're local eggs

262
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,220
with high-quality protein.

263
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,940
Oh, you don't know what protein is.

264
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,300
Fine, I'll have one.

265
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,100
Here.

266
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,820
It's raw.

267
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,060
Didn't you have a cooked one?

268
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,420
So dumb.

269
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,460
You're bullying me too?

270
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,620
Let's go.

271
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,260
(Breeze Hall)

272
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,620
It really is the Kui.

273
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
What do you think?

274
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,220
The Kui

275
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,740
is deliberately driving out miners.

276
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,100
Through our investigation,

277
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,560
we found saltpeter in the mountains.

278
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,680
This is no coincidence.

279
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,980
Is there any more specific
or compelling analysis?

280
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,540
Chief, solving cases

281
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,620
isn't my expertise.

282
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,580
Let me add something.

283
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,860
It's now confirmed

284
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,580
that the Kui is here for the saltpeter.

285
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,020
Saltpeter is the main material
for making gunpowder.

286
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,820
Chief,

287
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,220
are there any upcoming gatherings

288
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,620
or celebrations

289
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,780
in the capital?

290
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,280
This is serious.

291
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,420
I'll report it to Lord Wei.

292
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,380
Hold on.

293
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,220
- Ningyan.
- Ningyan.

294
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,420
There's one more thing

295
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,540
that Lord Wei needs to know.

296
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,500
What is it?

297
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,660
The Kui?

298
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,580
How many of them have come?

299
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,420
That's still unclear.

300
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,220
But Xu Qi'an asked
the local Village Head,

301
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,140
and there are many abandoned kilns
in the south of Mount Dahuang.

302
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,720
Based on preliminary estimates,

303
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,320
there must be quite a few people.

304
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,380
- Yang Yan.
- Yes.

305
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,680
Take some men and check it out.

306
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,580
Yes.

307
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,100
Rou,

308
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,180
ask the spies in Chuzhou

309
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,420
if anything's wrong with the Kui.

310
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,820
Understood.

311
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,060
What else do you want to say?

312
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,520
Yes, there's one more thing.

313
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,780
According to Xu Qi'an,

314
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,380
after the Kui incident,

315
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,260
the government will seal off the kilns.

316
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,700
But Mount Dahuang

317
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,940
has heavy taxes.

318
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,080
If the mountain is sealed,

319
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,140
the local miners

320
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,260
will lose their livelihood.

321
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,540
According to the villagers,

322
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,100
that's why the local government

323
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,180
covered this up.

324
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,900
The law must consider human feelings.

325
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,140
This is during the inspection,

326
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,900
but please have Lord Wei
handle it leniently

327
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,300
with reason to convince everyone.

328
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,580
Taxes and corvée are decided
by the Emperor.

329
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,420
The law is unyielding

330
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,020
to uphold the court's authority.

331
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,660
Yes.

332
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,940
You understand that

333
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,980
yet still agree with him?

334
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,780
Yes.

335
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,340
What did you say to him?

336
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,540
I scolded him.

337
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,580
Why?

338
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,940
Don't you agree with him?

339
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,620
I agree with him on the matter itself,

340
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,620
but I don't believe he meant it.

341
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,340
Why do you think so?

342
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,700
Based on my observations,

343
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,500
he's articulate

344
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,140
and skilled at winning people over.

345
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,900
Reporting this to me

346
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,220
wasn't purely out of concern.

347
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,580
He was trying to gain my favor.

348
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,460
So, I reprimanded him.

349
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,620
Time to get off work.

350
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,620
Sirs,

351
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,820
it's still early today.

352
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,420
Why don't I treat you both to a drink?

353
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,100
We can talk
about our chief's preferences,

354
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,580
so I can better cater to his tastes

355
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,820
and read fewer case files.

356
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,940
But regarding Mount Dahuang,

357
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,700
Xu Qi'an made a good point.

358
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,420
So,

359
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,540
I still need to report to you.

360
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,260
I understand.

361
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,580
Leave the Mount Dahung
County Governor to me.

362
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,540
As for you and Xu Qi'an,

363
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
you know

364
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,180
I gave him an A+.

365
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
Lord Wei, I believe

366
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,020
you have a reason.

367
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,180
Xu Qi'an wrote this

368
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,980
for the heart test.

369
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,220
Take a look.

370
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,420
(Haoqi Tower)

371
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,700
You're paid as a court official.

372
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,240
You live off the people's resources.

373
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,100
You can easily oppress
the common people,

374
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
but you can't fool the heavens.

375
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,460
The human minds are hard to read.

376
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,180
Judging hearts is like solving cases.

377
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,060
One must not make hasty conclusions

378
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,660
based on temporary biases.

379
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,380
(You can easily oppress
the common people)

380
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,620
(Occupied)

381
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,380
Have you done?

382
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,580
Not yet.

383
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,580
What are you looking at?

384
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,380
Hurry up and go.

385
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,020
You've made such a mess.

386
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,060
Do you have any manners?

387
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,900
(Spare)

388
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,100
It's been an hour already.

389
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,580
You can't hog a position
in the outhouse.

390
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,740
This outhouse is already a mess.

391
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,580
Do you think it'll smell like flowers?

392
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,820
In my opinion,
you've got a great mindset.

393
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,940
Come on.

394
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,400
You know the chief doesn't like you,

395
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,780
but instead of using this case
to improve your relationship,

396
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,820
you insist on pleading
for that County Governor.

397
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,580
Now look at you.

398
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,960
You still have case files to read,

399
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,360
and you're stuck in the outhouse.

400
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,600
It's an equivalent exchange.

401
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,860
I accepted their eggs.

402
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,660
Should I return them then?

403
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,340
The chief doesn't like me anyway.

404
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,500
I've got nothing to lose.

405
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,080
Stop rambling and get on with it.

406
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,020
An equivalent exchange?

407
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,860
Is a basket of eggs worth this?

408
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,340
You should count yourself lucky.

409
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,420
If this were in the past,

410
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,100
the chief would've held you accountable.

411
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,780
You...

412
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,630
You...

413
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,140
You talk too much.

414
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,340
Is it done?

415
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,260
No.

416
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,380
Then go back to work.

417
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,180
Fifty liang of silver as a reward,

418
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,240
and three days of leave.

419
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,620
Ningyan did the most

420
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,580
and deserves half.

421
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,260
The rest can be split between us.

422
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,580
No need.

423
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,660
Let's just split it evenly.

424
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,820
The reward is here,

425
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,140
and we've got three days off.

426
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,260
We've got both time and money now.

427
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
All that's left is

428
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,020
to find a place to drink and celebrate.

429
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,860
Your treat.

430
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,540
What?

431
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,420
Why me?

432
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,540
We've got the reward money.

433
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,860
That's our money.

434
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,700
That's nonsense.

435
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,020
The three of us

436
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,540
have faced
life-threatening danger together.

437
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,420
What's yours is mine.

438
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,580
It's settled.

439
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,940
Ningyan, pick a place.

440
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,780
Tonight,

441
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
we drink until we drop.

442
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:15,980
I'll pass.

443
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,060
I've still got work to do.

444
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,820
The chief will find fault with me again.

445
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,140
You guys have fun.

446
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,820
Do we still have any nose masks?

447
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,860
Find it yourself.

448
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,820
Lift your foot.

449
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,300
Put it there and get back to work.

450
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,780
I heard a new game restaurant opened
in the west of the city.

451
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,820
How about we check it out?

452
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,820
Not interested.

453
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,180
Why are you so high maintenance?

454
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,340
Ningyan, you decide.

455
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,020
You make the call.

456
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,860
Alright.

457
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,820
Let's do this.

458
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,780
It's settled.

459
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,660
Tonight,

460
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,820
I'll broaden your horizons.

461
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,500
Twenty liang of silver for a table
on the first floor.

462
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,340
Please.

463
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,700
This way, please.

464
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,660
How is it?

465
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,100
Do the clothes fit?

466
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,380
Wait.

467
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,020
Where did you get
the Yunlu Academy scholar's robes?

468
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,980
We had them custom-made
at a fabric shop.

469
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,180
The academy's robes are blessed
with righteous energy.

470
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,460
They're not so easy to find.

471
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,020
Red.

472
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,100
Purple.

473
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,180
Ze, why do you have acne?

474
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,700
It's from traveling far.

475
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,620
Ze?

476
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,260
You look nervous.

477
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,400
Is it your first time here?

478
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,260
Are you called Lun?

479
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,140
How did you guess?

480
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,940
Don't worry.

481
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,520
I was the same when I first came here.

482
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,820
With you two here for me,

483
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,700
I'm not nervous.

484
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,940
Sirs, what table do you want today?

485
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,660
Someone's first time.

486
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,180
Arrange something nice.

487
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,980
Thirty liang of silver

488
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,540
for a seat on the first floor.

489
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,700
Three seats.

490
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,910
- Come in.
- Three seats.

491
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,160
This way, please.

492
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,820
I haven't seen you in a while.

493
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,630
Are you two together?

494
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,580
Ten liang each.

495
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,740
I wanted to show you something new,

496
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,060
but alas, my money...

497
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,820
The most famous top harlot at Plum House

498
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,780
is Fuxiang.

499
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,140
She's not seeing anyone today.

500
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,820
It's still early.

501
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,900
How do you know
she won't see anyone?

502
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,740
You don't understand.

503
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,820
In drinking games,

504
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,060
time is limited.

505
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,780
Usually,

506
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,300
one group of guests

507
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,780
can stay for no more than two hours.

508
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,880
You either extend your time

509
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,740
or leave.

510
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,780
If you want to play wine games,

511
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
you'll need at least two hours.

512
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,700
It means

513
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,540
as we don't play wine games today,

514
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,270
Miss Fuxiang won't appear.

515
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,740
It's your first day here.

516
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,060
Let Ze and Lun

517
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,660
show you a good time.

518
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,500
What a shame.

519
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,620
Are you students of Yunlu Academy?

520
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,860
Indeed.

521
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,720
- What's the matter, sir?
- That's great.

522
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,320
Do you know Yang Ling,

523
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,220
Mr. Yang?

524
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,100
No, who's that?

525
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,260
Sorry to bother you.

526
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,060
Who dares block the way?

527
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,520
How dare you
look directly at the princess?

528
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,360
Bow immediately.

529
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,860
(Why is it her?)

530
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,260
(Why is she here?)

531
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,540
What do you mean?

532
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,580
Who is Yang Ling?

533
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,780
Why must I know him?

534
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,540
Shadows slant across shallow water.

535
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,540
Faint scent floats in dim moonlight.

536
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,540
Have you heard it?

537
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,580
Sounds familiar.

538
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,260
Once this poem is released,

539
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,120
it's been praised by scholars
across the land

540
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,500
as the ultimate ode to plum blossoms.

541
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,540
This timeless masterpiece

542
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,940
originated here in Plum House.

543
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,700
Its author is Yang Ling.

544
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,220
No wonder.

545
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,780
Miss Fuxiang normally comes out
at this hour,

546
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,940
but because of Yang Ling,

547
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,180
she's not coming out.

548
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,140
What a shame, Ningyan.

549
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,860
You're good at solving cases,

550
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,380
but poetry is clearly not your thing.

551
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Otherwise...

552
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,500
Ningyan.

553
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,620
What are you doing there?

554
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,420
I'm going to see
if I can meet Miss Fuxiang.

555
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,260
Come on.

556
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,970
It's pointless.

557
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,060
We already analyzed this.

558
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,300
Miss Fuxiang

559
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,780
won't come out

560
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,340
unless Yang Ling shows up.

561
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,720
Otherwise, she won't appear.

562
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,340
Miss Fuxiang is coming out.

563
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,670
♪Enjoy music to kill time♪

564
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,880
She's Miss Fuxiang.

565
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,360
♪The wind♪

566
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,360
♪Blew away worries♪

567
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,260
Miss Fuxiang is looking at me.

568
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,180
She's looking at me.

569
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,530
♪Blew away worries♪

570
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,980
Why is she coming here?

571
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,650
Wait, wait.

572
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,860
- Is she coming for you?
- No.

573
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,400
- She's coming for you?
- Calm down.

574
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,400
She's coming for you.

575
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,420
No, she's coming for you.

576
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,200
- She's coming for you.
- I don't know her.

577
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,180
I know her in my dreams.

578
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,980
- What does she want?
- She's looking at you.

579
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,020
Sir,

580
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,540
why are you here?

581
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,700
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

582
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,900
I could've prepared ahead of time

583
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,340
to properly entertain you.

584
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,880
I happened to be passing by

585
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,400
and thought I'd stop in for a drink

586
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,440
and seek some inspiration.

587
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,500
No need to entertain me.

588
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,500
Why not join us?

589
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,380
Mr. Yang, please feel free.

590
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,300
Thank you.

591
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,940
Mr. Yang?

592
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,940
You are Yang Ling.

593
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,460
Yes, he is Yang Ling.

594
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,660
I am Du Ying.

595
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,300
I traveled a long distance

596
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,920
just to meet you.

597
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,100
Mr. Yang.

598
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,960
Mr. Yang.

599
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,180
I've heard much about you.

600
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,580
Everyone, nice to meet you.

601
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,660
Since everyone is here for me,

602
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,980
I'll compose an essay now

603
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,740
to amuse everyone.

604
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,100
Great.

605
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,700
Large Lake

606
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,340
is very large.

607
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,660
There are lotuses in Large Lake.

608
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,220
On the lotuses, there are frogs

609
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,580
who jump at every poke.

610
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,140
Who wrote this?

611
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,460
I did.

612
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,780
What's jumping for?

613
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,620
Waking up, I laugh at the sky.

614
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,900
After laughing, I go back to sleep.

615
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,040
Waking up, I laugh at the sky again.

616
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,940
After that, I go take a nap.

617
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,100
Who wrote this?

618
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,860
Your Highness,

619
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,460
I wrote it.

620
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,340
I also want to sleep.

621
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,860
You had three days and nights.

622
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,870
Is this what you came up with?

623
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,980
Get out.

624
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,460
Go, go, go.

625
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,820
Go.

626
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:19,900
Your Highness.

627
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,460
Did you find Yang Ling?

628
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,340
Your Highness, please look.

629
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,620
This is Yang Ling's new work.

630
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,060
The world loves peonies,

631
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,000
but I alone love the lotus
for rising from the mud unstained

632
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,740
and shining with purity
yet not seductive.

633
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,500
Sparkling.

634
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,540
Sparkling with purity
yet not seductive.

635
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,820
His handwriting is really poor.

636
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,420
Sparkling with purity
yet not seductive.

637
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,180
It's hollow inside yet upright outside,

638
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,760
uninterrupted by tendrils or branches;

639
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,140
its fragrance grows fresher
as it drifts afar;

640
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,860
its stem is straight and unsoiled;

641
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,820
it can be admired from afar
but cannot be played with.

642
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,580
This essay...

643
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,180
This essay...

644
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,740
Good.

645
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,100
Very good.

646
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,700
It's better than anything.

647
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,620
Everyone in the Imperial Office of Music
even stood up

648
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:22,900
and applauded.

649
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,100
I think it's good, too.

650
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,740
Yang Ling is truly impressive.

651
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,220
If he can write poems for me,

652
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:36,420
how can I not shine
at the poetry contest?

653
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,180
How can I not overshadow

654
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,740
Princess Huaiqing?

655
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,060
Where is he now?

656
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,740
Did you tell him I want to recruit him?

657
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,060
I...

658
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,940
I was going to tell him,

659
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,980
but...

660
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,300
But what?

661
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,860
Your Highness, look

662
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,100
at the ending.

663
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,540
(To Princess Huaiqing)

664
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,260
Princess Huaiqing?

665
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,460
Huaiqing?

666
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,980
Ningyan, did you get it wrong?

667
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,700
The Grand Princess is of high status.

668
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,780
How could she go
to the Imperial Office of Music?

669
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,360
It's not Princess Huaiqing.

670
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,780
It's her maid,

671
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,580
disguised as a man
in the Imperial Office of Music.

672
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,700
Besides the Imperial Office of Music,

673
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,740
where else has Yang Ling appeared?

674
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,500
We haven't seen any trace of him.

675
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,700
Let's just keep waiting.

676
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
If we can't recruit him for our master,

677
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,580
none of us can explain it.

678
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,580
(So,)

679
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,620
(the Grand Princess wants me)

680
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,060
(to write poems for her.)

681
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,820
I see now.

682
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,500
That's why you composed an essay

683
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,860
and added at the end

684
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,540
"To Princess Huaiqing"

685
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,220
to win her favor?

686
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,380
Exactly.

687
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,940
Ningyan, you're always

688
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,100
good at scheming,

689
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,280
and calculating every detail.

690
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,420
Sometimes,

691
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,380
I really don't understand

692
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,980
whether you're the same man as before.

693
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,220
Scheming?

694
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,700
Scheming about what?

695
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,860
It's just an essay.

696
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,100
Father, you don't understand.

697
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,780
This is not just a simple essay.

698
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,620
The Grand Princess is known
for being proud,

699
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,180
so Ningyan likened her to the lotus

700
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,160
to boost her reputation.

701
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,580
That's one of his schemes.

702
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,300
And then,

703
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,220
Ningyan added in the end

704
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,980
"To Princess Huaiqing".

705
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,340
That's his second scheme.

706
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,660
What does this mean?

707
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,900
The Grand Princess recommended
Ningyan to be a Guardian.

708
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,980
If she intends to recruit him,

709
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,340
why not start
from the Guardian Yamen?

710
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,060
It shows...

711
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:34,980
It shows

712
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,300
that the Grand Princess knows Ningyan,

713
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,060
but she doesn't know much about him.

714
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,320
At least she doesn't know

715
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,880
that Yang Ling
who writes great lines

716
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,800
in the Imperial Office of Music
is Ningyan.

717
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,220
How well Cijiu knows me.

718
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,900
So, Ningyan's line,

719
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,180
"To Princess Huaiqing",

720
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,860
makes perfect sense.

721
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,180
Whether Ningyan
truly respects her or not,

722
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,860
the princess will be at least pleased,

723
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,060
as from the princess's perspective,

724
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,380
this is not an acquaintance's flattery,

725
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,260
but the sincere opinion of a stranger.

726
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,920
So, does this mean

727
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,220
you've connected with the Grand Princess

728
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,140
and become her guest adviser?

729
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,540
No.

730
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,820
Why not?

731
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,060
Yes.

732
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,980
Logically,

733
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,060
that maid should've
made her intention clear,

734
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,620
and you could have

735
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,660
just gone along with it.

736
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,500
I'm also

737
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,940
very confused about this.

738
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,900
Its fragrance grows fresher
as it drifts afar;

739
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,300
its stem is straight and unsoiled;

740
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
it can be admired from afar

741
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,660
but cannot be played with.

742
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,820
Good, good.

743
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,780
Wonderful, marvelous!

744
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,260
This essay compares the lotus
to a person

745
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,460
and expresses my compliments
to Princess Huaiqing.

746
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,540
All my true feelings are in the text.

747
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,420
To

748
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,220
Princess Huaiqing.

749
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,060
Good.

750
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,820
Wait.

751
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,540
It's such a fine piece of writing.

752
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,780
How could she spit?

753
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,700
She spat.

754
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,500
The Grand Princess is well-versed
in poetry and literature,

755
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,580
so her maid should've been

756
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:23,300
influenced by this as well.

757
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,780
How could she spit?

758
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,180
Cijiu,

759
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,460
what does this mean?

760
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,900
Because...

761
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,500
Because...

762
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,180
I understand now.

763
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,420
Do you think it's because...?

764
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,980
Tell us.

765
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,460
I don't think so.

766
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,300
Could it be because...?

767
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,140
What is it?

768
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:50,980
Tell us.

769
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,100
I don't think so.

770
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,180
What's wrong? What are you thinking?

771
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,140
Hurry and tell us.

772
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,940
Tell you what?

773
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,220
I'm just too cold.

774
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,580
I'll go inside and get a blanket.

775
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,540
I...

776
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,620
She spat.

777
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,960
- Bring me one, too.
- Why did she spit?

778
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,660
Why did she spit?

779
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,220
Xinnian.

780
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,980
I can't even lie down quietly here.

781
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,700
Who is it?

782
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,860
Always knocking.

783
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,500
What are you knocking for?

784
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,780
Who is it?

785
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,660
Mr. Yang,

786
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,980
my master requests your presence.

787
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:46,100
(Lake Villa)

788
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,260
I saw you earlier
in the Imperial Office of Music.

789
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,740
Unfortunately,
there were too many people,

790
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,300
so I sent someone to follow you

791
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,620
and came to invite you

792
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,780
after the crowd left.

793
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,580
I hope you can forgive me.

794
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,180
It's fine.

795
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,140
Earlier, you mentioned

796
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,900
your master wanted to recruit me.

797
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,020
May I ask who your master is?

798
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,940
- My master will tell you that.
- Alright.

799
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,460
Sir, please come inside.

800
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,860
Thank you.

801
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,700
Careful. This way.

802
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:17,620
(Warmth)

803
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,620
Master, Mr. Yang has arrived.

804
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,380
Mr. Yang,

805
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,040
I've heard so much about you.

806
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,500
(This voice...)

807
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,020
(It's indeed the Grand Princess.)

808
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,260
If one lives only off reputation

809
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,460
and lacks a good master,

810
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,940
everything

811
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,020
will vanish like a dream.

812
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,420
Sir, it seems

813
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,220
you intend to be an aide.

814
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,140
Of course.

815
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,100
Then may I ask

816
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,740
if I could be your good master?

817
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,660
You're...?

818
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,580
Though I am a woman,

819
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,420
I also have a love for talent.

820
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,700
In the Dafeng,
literary talent is dwindling,

821
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,460
but you stand alone.

822
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,100
I read your Love for the Lotus.

823
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,180
I really like it,

824
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,300
and I wish to invite you

825
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,180
to be my guest adviser.

826
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,620
I wonder

827
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,060
if you accept this to honor me?

828
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,780
You're too kind.

829
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,500
Unfortunately...

830
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,060
Unfortunately, I have already sworn

831
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,020
that in this life, I only wish to follow

832
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Grand Princess Huaiqing.

833
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,540
If Princess Huaiqing

834
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,740
can spare some time to meet me,

835
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,060
I'll immediately follow her

836
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,980
and swear loyalty.

837
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,620
(Come out now.)

838
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,860
(My dear Princess Huaiqing.)

839
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,620
What's so good about her?

840
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,860
Gang,

841
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,140
show him our sincerity.

842
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,100
Yes.

843
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,660
Sir, you speak plainly,

844
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,020
so I'll be straightforward too.

845
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,260
You can take all this gold and silver.

846
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,780
Consider it a gift

847
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,780
to become my guest adviser.

848
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
(She's testing me?)

849
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,940
Though I'm a poor scholar,

850
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,780
I understand what integrity is.

851
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,540
Money is but dust.

852
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,820
If I can serve the Grand Princess,

853
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,020
I don't care about anything else.

854
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,860
Goodbye.

855
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,660
Three, two, one.

856
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,540
Wait.

857
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,060
I was too hasty.

858
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,330
What's this?

859
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,660
It's a recommendation letter

860
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,300
for the Directorate of Education.

861
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,340
My master is a good friend

862
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,340
(To the Chancellor)
of the Chancellor.

863
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,140
With this recommendation letter,

864
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,660
you can join
the Directorate of Education.

865
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,660
You are a great talent.

866
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,020
With the Directorate
of Education's endorsement,

867
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,700
in time,

868
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
you'll be famous throughout the world.

869
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,980
This is a rare opportunity.

870
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,980
You should not...

871
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,260
This...

872
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,540
Fame and fortune are like clouds to me.

873
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,540
I've made it clear.

874
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,420
In this life, I only wish
to follow Princess Huaiqing.

875
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,340
The sun and moon
can witness my sincerity.

876
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,660
You truly underestimate me.

877
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,100
It seems you've made up your mind.

878
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,660
My resolve is as firm as a rock.

879
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,580
