He dropped it.

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,860
Let's go.

48
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,670

- Ningyan!

Ningyan!

50
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
Xu Qi'an...

52
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,760

- Ningyan!
- Ningyan!

56
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,640
It's confirmed the Commissioner
of Yunzhou, Song Changfu,

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,120
colluded with The Witcher's Sect

58
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,890
in stealing tax silver to fund rebels.

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,760
Silver Gong Xu Qi'an solved this case

60
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,240
single-handedly.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,960
He crushed the rebels with his team,

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,390
retrieved almost 150,000 liang of tax silver,

63
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,720
and destroyed The Witcher's Sect's scheme.

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,710
Unfortunately, he was ambushed and killed.

65
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,460
He devoted himself to our state

66
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,770
and safeguarded it with his life.

67
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,750
Xu Qi'an deserves
a posthumous title of nobility.

68
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,590
I, Wei Yuan,

69
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,520
beg you, Your Majesty.

70
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,360
Xu Qi'an was a rare talent.

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
What a shame.

72
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,920
Mr. Wei's asking for
a posthumous title for him.

73
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,670
What do you think?

74
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,710
Your Majesty,

75
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,520
he made the greatest contribution
to this case.

76
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,760
He should

77
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,390
be rewarded.

78
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,710
Your Majesty,

79
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,110
objection!

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,670
Although he solved this case,

81
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,110
it doesn't change the fact

82
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,920
that he was of humble birth.

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,080
Giving his family a higher pension is enough.

84
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,350
A title of nobility is too much.

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Please think twice, Your Majesty!

86
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
Your Majesty,

87
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,880
I agree with Vice Minister Xu.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Xu Qi'an was a mere Silver Gong.

89
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,150
Being killed in action was his honor.

90
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,960
Were he granted a posthumous title,

91
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,440
that'd make a nobody
as great as the nobility.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,470
We cannot

93
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,030
set such a precedent!

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,560
Don't you agree, gentlemen?

95
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,150
Yes.

96
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,230
That's right.

97
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,680
That's ridiculous.

98
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,560
Such a reward is over the top.

99
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,790
- Right?
- Of course.

100
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,590
We can't allow it.

101
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,040
Lord Wei,

102
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,230
Xu Qi'an was a lowly Silver Gong.

103
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,830
Just give his family more...

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
You...!

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
You...

106
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,230
You... You... You...

107
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,070
Your Majesty,

108
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,270
Wei Yuan slapped officials in public.

109
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,150
He insulted you and the law.

110
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,520
He must be executed,

111
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,590
Your Majesty!

112
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,200
Why are you laughing?

113
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,080
Your Majesty,

114
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
I saw you laugh,

115
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,120
so I followed.

116
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,800
Father.

117
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,070
Father.

118
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,710
Silver Gong's body had been brought back.

119
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,080
It was escorted

120
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,230
to his home as you asked.

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,750
stop playing dead.

189
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,630
Don't think we'll cry for you again.

190
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,590
Did Ningyan

191
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,560
leave any last words?

192
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
My condolences.

193
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,520
Ningyan

194
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,110
died too young.

195
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,880
What a shame.

196
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,960
What a pity.

197
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,510
His colleagues want you to have this.

198
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,800
Lord Wei said

199
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,320
if your family needs help in the future,

200
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,750
go to the Guardian Yamen.

201
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,040
No prior notice is needed.

202
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,470
I thank Lord Wei.

203
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,590
I can't believe he died.

204
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,040
Miss, what are you doing?

205
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,710
Just to double-check it.

206
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,830
He wrote to me from Yunzhou,

207
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,320
saying once he retrieved the tax silver,
I could leave the Municipal Office.

208
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,630
However,

209
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,510
the tax silver was back intact,

210
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,930
but he wasn't.

211
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
Everyone,

212
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,830
it's time

213
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,830
to let Ningyan

214
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,350
rest in peace.

215
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,870
Hang on a minute

216
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,640
Cijiu...

217
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,920
he hasn't come back.

218
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,280
Let's wait for him.

219
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,470
No need.

220
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,320
Bury Ningyan now.

221
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,350
Stop that cat in case

222
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,350
Ningyan becomes a zombie!

223
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,830
Xu Qi'an,

224
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,750
wake up.

225
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,960
(Where am I?)

226
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,680
(What's with the noise outside?)

227
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,280
(Who's calling my name?)

228
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,080
Lord Wei?

229
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,120
Follow me.

230
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,800
Yes.

231
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,680
Where exactly am I?

232
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,160
The Battle of Linyuan Pass.

233
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,470
Who...

234
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,120
are you?

235
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,180
(Shen Shu)

236
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160
Who am I?

237
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,920
Yes, who am I?

238
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,200
Why am I in the Battle of Linyuan Pass?

239
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,230
The Battle of Linyuan Pass.

240
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,810
The Battle of Linyuan Pass?

241
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,230
What's that?

242
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,600
Didn't you bring it up?

243
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,640
I did?

244
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,550
But who am I?

245
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,200
You're one big...

246
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,350
fool.

247
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,710
I remember now.

248
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,880
Uh, sorry.

249
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,440
I was joking with you.

250
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,070
What... what's this?

251
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,600
We're

252
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,360
in his memory.

253
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,550
He?

254
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,440
Who's he?

255
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,350
This

256
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,030
is him.

257
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,520
Get lost!

258
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Go away!

259
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,320
Get out! Out!

260
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,200
Get lost!

261
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,440
Go away!

262
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,000
Get out!

263
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,830
Over there...

264
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,440
Over here...

265
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,350
Get out!

266
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,310
He's moving.

267
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,750
He's a zombie!

268
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,590
A zombie!

269
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,700
(Peace and Happiness)

270
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,710
Water...

271
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,680
I need water.

272
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm parched!

273
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,230
Ning... Ningyan,

274
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,160
do you have more last words to say,

275
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,270
or do you have any regrets?

276
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,990
Last words?

277
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,910
He's not a zombie.

278
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,880
His heart is beating.

279
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,160
The Gazing Spell can see him.

280
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,310
He's alive.

281
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,230
But how...?

282
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
Xu Qi'an

283
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,310
is back alive!

284
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Ningyan!

285
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,120
Ningyan! Ningyan!

286
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Ningyan!

287
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,990
- Ningyan!
- Uncle!

288
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,270
I cried for nothing!

289
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,710
There, there. I'm fine.

290
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,200
Ningyan...!

291
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,900
(Haoqi Tower)

292
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,460
(The Witcher's Sect)

293
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,800
Father.

294
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,470
He floated in the canal for over 10 days.

295
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
Wait no more.

296
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,790
Have his family

297
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,550
bury him soon.

298
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,350
Father,

299
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,630
Xu Qi'an

300
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,720
is back alive.

301
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,160
Was that a dream?

302
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,960
But why did I have such a strange one?

303
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,200
Hello.

304
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,310
Xu Ningyan,

305
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,550
have you finished

306
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,120
the rest of the poem?

307
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,800
Soon.

308
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,750
Didn't you promise
to work on it after the case?

309
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,030
It's been 10 days. Where were you?

310
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,300
Why didn't you return my message?

311
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,240
I was dead.

312
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,840
Xu Ningyan?

313
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,200
Xu Ningyan?

314
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:24,970
Hey,

315
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,230
since when are you addicted to being a cat?

316
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,640
Such a trifle doesn't matter.

317
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,440
What brings you here?

318
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,680
I heard you were
killed in action earlier today.

319
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,680
I didn't believe it

320
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,120
and came to see for myself.

321
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,750
I knew it.

322
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,510
You were dead physically,

323
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,790
but I sensed subtle movements
of your primordial spirit.

324
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,070
Then I gave you a hand

325
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,790
to bring it back to your body.

326
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,640
Thankfully, you came in time,

327
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,710
or I'd be buried alive.

328
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,990
I know, right?

329
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,150
Thank you

330
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,640
for saving my life.

331
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,710
It's an equivalent exchange.

332
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,920
You owe me one.

333
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,800
Yes, of course.

334
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,630
By the way,

335
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,230
did you see No. 2, Li Miaozhen, in Yunzhou?

336
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,750
She wasn't there.

337
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,840
When I asked,

338
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,230
she said she was on her way to the capital.

339
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,160
I had meant to ask her for help,

340
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,710
using her force to solve the case.

341
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,550
With her assistance,

342
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,920
I wouldn't have suffered so much.

343
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,160
Looks like you were doomed

344
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,030
to suffering.

345
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,120
I'll show myself out.

346
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,350
One more thing.

347
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,440
What is it?

348
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,840
Nice body.

349
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,820
(Guardians)

350
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,640
Summon Silver Gong Xu at once.

351
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,510
Lord Wei asks for him.

352
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,680
Yes.

353
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:12,990
There you are.

354
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,990
Others might think

355
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,230
Father has adopted another son.

356
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,310
Don't get in my way.

357
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,640
You should've died in Yunzhou.

358
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,200
He dodged my punch!

359
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,550
How come?

360
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,800
Lord Wei!

361
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,270
Greetings, Lord Wei.

362
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,630
Come.

363
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,310
I read Song Tingfeng's report,

364
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,070
saying you went missing
after capturing the rebels.

365
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,920
You might've been killed.

366
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,310
But I know how skilled you are.

367
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
Most people can't kill you.

368
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,160
I wasn't sure what that was,

369
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,230
but it wasn't any rebel.

370
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,230
Xu Qi'an...

371
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,680
Xu Qi'an,

372
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,990
any last words?

373
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,390
Lord Wei,

374
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,030
I'm confused.

375
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Was it Zhu Yang who killed me?

376
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,640
He's sorting evidence against
the Guardians at the Ministry of War.

377
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,780
How could he have killed you?

378
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,350
Father,

379
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,840
His Majesty summoned you urgently.

380
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,880
The Ministry of War?

381
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,830
Zhu Yang?

382
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,660
Yes.

383
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,710
When you were in Yunzhou
in the last three months,

384
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,120
he switched sides and joined them.

385
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,360
He, as a Gold Gong, accused us of corruption

386
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,070
and bending the law before His Majesty.

387
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,120
His Majesty ordered a thorough investigation.

388
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,440
Two Gold Gongs and a dozen Copper Gongs

389
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,980
were jailed by the Ministry of Justice.

390
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,680
That was to retaliate against me.

391
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,600
Are you affected, Lord Wei?

392
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,760
No.

393
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,510
That's a relief.

394
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,270
Father's playing along.

395
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,840
He's using Zhu Yang's attack

396
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,750
to clean house in the Guardian Yamen.

397
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,680
If that wasn't Zhu Yang,

398
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,270
what exactly did I see?

399
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,270
Hallucination.

400
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,680
Hallucination?

401
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,750
The 3rd-Rank Hypnotizer

402
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
of The Witcher's Sect

403
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,310
uses hallucination to kill.

404
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,120
Once hypnotized,

405
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,750
you'll be haunted by all the obsessions

406
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,600
and fears you had,

407
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,070
falling at his disposal.

408
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,200
Hypnotizer?

409
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,040
Lord Wei,

410
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,750
I'm a nobody.

411
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,440
It was beneath a 3rd-Rank Hypnotizer

412
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,880
to kill me. Why did he do that?

413
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,750
Had he meant to kill you,

414
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,750
could you sit here with me now?

415
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Lord Wei,

416
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,920
I still don't understand.

417
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,550
Don't think too much.

418
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,310
As a Guardian,

419
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,230
just fulfill your duty.

420
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,310
Remember,

421
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
should the sky fall,

422
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,790
I'll hold it for you.

423
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,680
Yes.

424
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,960
Wait,

425
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,070
how did you come back to life?

426
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,310
Jinlian of the Realm Sect...

427
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,230
The Elixir of Life.

428
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,840
You took the Elixir of Life
of the Astronomical Bureau.

429
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,550
If someone asks,

430
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,230
just say so,

431
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,000
understand?

432
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,070
Yes.

433
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,310
Good day, Lord Wei.

434
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,590
Wei Yuan,

435
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,470
stop lying.

436
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,470
Xu Qi'an couldn't have been

437
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,750
brought back to life by the Elixir of Life.

438
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,710
It's invaluable.

439
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,680
Even His Majesty failed to obtain one.

440
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,710
Never would the Bureau give it to Xu.

441
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,600
Whether or not that's true,

442
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,200
you may check with the Bureau,

443
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,710
Your Majesty.

444
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,070
Sure.

445
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,360
Have someone go there to confirm it.

446
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,640
Besides,

447
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,230
the title of nobility

448
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,270
is put on hold

449
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,960
for the time being.

450
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,440
Where's everyone?

451
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,200
They used to act like my buddies

452
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,750
but didn't come to my funeral.

453
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,790
Let's drink after work.

454
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,150
Go to the brothel!

455
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
Yes, of course!

456
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,360
You know what?

457
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,310
Someone saw Xu Qi'an just now.

458
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,960
- Saw him? No way.
- Impossible!

459
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,230
His burial is today.

460
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,600
Could that be his ghost?

461
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,400
Ghosts can't come here.

462
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,070
- Hey, I...
- Later. We aren't done yet.

463
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,520
Truth be told,

464
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,680
I never liked Xu Qi'an.

465
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,710
He beat me at gambling,

466
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,710
drinking,

467
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,310
and work.

468
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,470
I'm glad he died.

469
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,990
-Yes!
- That's right.

470
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,750
Who is this?

471
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,710
Save your trick.

472
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,990
Who is this?

473
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,750
Xu...

474
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,360
Mr. Xu!

475
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,960
Mr. Xu's become a zombie!

476
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,800
Run!

477
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,790
A zombie!

478
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,550
Who was glad I died?

479
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,840
Him!

480
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,790
Was it you?

481
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:19,960
I'm sorry.

482
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,960
Alright, alright.

483
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,190
Mr. Xu...

484
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,510
Didn't you

485
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,680
die earlier?

486
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
Yes.

487
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,840
I forgot to introduce myself.

488
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm Xu Qi'an's twin brother,

489
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,480
Xu Ba'an.

490
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,270
I'll take over his post by Lord Wei's order.

491
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,440
I have a question.

492
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,840
Where are those of the Breeze Hall?

493
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,200
They... they went to

494
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,880
Yunzhou.

495
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,960
Yunzhou?

496
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,470
Why did they go there?

497
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,640
Hearing your brother died there,
Gold Gong Yang and Silver Gong Li

498
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,920
were grieved and furious.

499
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,990
They blamed themselves.

500
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,710
They gathered all their members before dawn

501
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,120
to go to Yunzhou.

502
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,070
They meant to avenge your brother's death

503
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,070
on all the rebels

504
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,840
and The Witcher's Sect.

505
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,710
It's all set.

506
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,030
Ningyan,

507
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,510
rest in peace!

508
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,640
We're going to Yunzhou

509
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,310
to wipe out the remnants
of The Witcher's Sect

510
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,640
to avenge your death.

511
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,280
Mr. Yang,

512
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
we're ready.

513
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,200
Set sail.

514
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,550
You robbed others, huh?

515
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,240
You bullied others, huh?

516
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,070
You abused others, huh?

517
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,190
You assaulted others, huh?

518
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,110
Listen carefully.

519
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,670
If you do that again,

520
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,550
I'll break your legs.

521
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,280
We won't do it again.

522
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,960
Please spare us, Miss.

523
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,720
Get lost.

524
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,870
Yes, Miss.

525
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,150
Aren't you bold

526
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,190
to carry a saber again?

527
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,350
No, no.

528
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,200
It's yours.

529
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,060
All yours.

530
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,240
Master,

531
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,110
you're amazing!

532
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,080
You bet.

533
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,990
Let's go.

534
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,510
Good job. You've stopped injustice 88 times.

535
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,110
Be accurate.

536
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,630
It's 89 times.

537
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,190
I acted twice when passing by Mount Wushan.

538
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,320
You're the best!

539
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,840
However,

540
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,800
you're fighting constantly on the way.

541
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,720
When can we get to the Dafeng?

542
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,920
We could've arrived in three days by mount.

543
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,840
As of now,

544
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,670
we've wasted over three months.

545
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,840
Waste?

546
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,800
We didn't waste our time.

547
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,070
This trip is to see the world
and train ourselves.

548
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,470
See the world?

549
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,470
I thought it was to solve my problem.

550
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,880
Yes, that too.

551
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,440
Your problem matters the most.

552
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,560
No. 3?

553
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,960
Yes, that's right. Four of my friends

554
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,670
sailed to Yunzhou.

555
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,280
Please keep an eye on them.

556
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,630
I'll let you know their looks later.

557
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,440
Yunzhou has been unsafe lately.

558
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,800
It is, right?

559
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,190
They mean to raid The Witcher's Sect.

560
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,070
What are they thinking?

561
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,030
If you find them,

562
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,670
tell them Xu Qi'an didn't die.

563
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,510
Don't act rashly and return to

564
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,800
the capital at once.

565
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,840
But I'm right outside the capital.

566
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,110
Don't worry.

567
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,070
I'll relay your message by a carrier pigeon.

568
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
Alright.

569
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,980
Wait,

570
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,280
when I arrive, I need a favor from you.

571
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,120
Where can I find you?

572
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,920
Find me?

573
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,550
What's wrong? You won't help me?

574
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,960
Don't forget you still owe me one.

575
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,360
I... I know.

576
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,360
You see, the Spring Exam is near.

577
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,880
I've been too busy studying at school

578
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,720
to see you.

579
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,920
How about you go to see my brother?

580
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,280
Your brother?

581
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,510
My brother, Xu Qi'an,

582
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,510
is a Guardian.

583
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,280
He's much better than me.

584
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,440
He's extremely smart,

585
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,670
and sharp.

586
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,400
Also, he's good-looking

587
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,960
- charming...
- That's enough.

588
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,150
Where can I find him?

589
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,550
Just go to the Guardian Yamen.

590
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
Ningyan, Ningyan!

591
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,720
Caiwei is here to see you.

592
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,150
Sorry, I have to go.

593
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,590
Remember to relay my message.

594
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,910
No. 3?

595
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,440
No. 3?

596
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
He seems so unreliable.

597
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,240
We're doing our best to help him,

598
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,110
but look at him

599
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,510
pushing us to someone else.

600
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,280
How dare he brush me off!

601
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,880
Xu Qi'an, huh?

602
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,320
I'll show him what I'm capable of.

603
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,640
Let's go!

604
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,150
Beat more bag guys to vent my anger.

605
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,360
Make it 90 times then.

606
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,560
Caiwei,

607
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
what brings you here?

608
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,390
Taste it.

609
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,360
I'm here for two matters.

610
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,800
One,

611
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,370
don't go to the Bureau these days.

612
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,110
Hearing that you came back to life,

613
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,550
everyone at the Bureau was shocked.

614
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,800
They couldn't wait to see you,

615
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,030
but I stopped them.

616
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,360
So...

617
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,980
how did you come back to life?

618
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,880
I...

619
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,990
I took the Elixir of Life.

620
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,280
The Elixir of Life.

621
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,440
Do you even know what that is?

622
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,240
It takes the Bureau 60 years to make one.

623
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,190
If you're dying,

624
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,880
take that elixir and you'll live.

625
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,720
If those of the 7th Rank take it,

626
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,240
they'll reach higher ranks.

627
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,960
How could a humble Guardian like you

628
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,550
gain such an elixir?

629
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,880
Because

630
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,760
I...

631
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,190
Because I...

632
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,800
Because you

633
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,110
got it from me.

634
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,040
My master gave me this

635
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,190
when I first joined the Bureau.

636
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,720
It's been with me in this pouch

637
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,840
for 10 years.

638
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,360
So that's yours.

639
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,400
That leads to my second matter.

640
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,470
My Elixir of Life

641
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,590
is now yours.

642
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,870
I don't know why, but Master

643
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,840
had me bring it to you,

644
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,760
so here I am.

645
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,990
You have to pay me back.

646
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,440
If you invent other rarities

647
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,760
such as chicken powder,

648
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,610
you have to tell me.

649
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,710
It's an equivalent exchange.

650
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,600
You got it.

651
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,480
Thanks.

652
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,590
It's really good.

653
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,920
Give me the recipe later.

654
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,070
- No problem.
- See you.

655
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,430
Wait.

656
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,990
What's this?

657
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,920
After taking the Elixir of Life,

658
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,990
your body will go through minor changes.

659
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,880
Take this medicine

660
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,320
to make up for what you lose.

661
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:00,950
Goodbye.

662
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,800
What will I lose, an arm or a leg?

663
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,510
By telling His Majesty

664
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,760
the Bureau gave Xu Qi'an an Elixir of Life,

665
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,600
Lord Wei

666
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,880
meant to test you.

667
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,590
That's fine.

668
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,470
Give it to him if he wants.

669
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,360
Xu Qi'an's resurrection

670
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,190
needs to be justified anyway.

671
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,840
After the Sangbo Case,

672
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,240
you pleaded illness to stay indoors.

673
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,070
Then the evil object was sent to Yunzhou.

674
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,800
After all that happened,

675
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,190
Lord Wei must've figured out your goal.

676
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,880
Never mind.

677
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,030
He's

678
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
also waiting for someone.

679
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,400
Looks like great minds

680
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,440
like you two are alike.

681
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,030
Just now,

682
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,510
I saw Xu Qi'an going here and there

683
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:11,190
as if he had forgotten everything.

684
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,240
Well,

685
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,400
he'll recall it.

686
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
Xu Qi'an!

687
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,550
