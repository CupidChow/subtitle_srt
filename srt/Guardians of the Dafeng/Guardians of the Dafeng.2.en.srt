Wait.

Close the door first.

Don't worry. I'll be there soon.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,320
Ningyan, help me out.

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,600
One, two, go.

53
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,440
Step on my shoulders.

54
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,280
Step on it.

55
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,720
Xinnian.

56
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
Use this. Use this.

57
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,890
Come on!

58
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,650
Three! Keep going!

59
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,050
Three! Keep going!

60
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,240
Bro, you...

61
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,520
This way. Pull it up.

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,440
My hair is stuck.

63
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,480
His hair is stuck.

64
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,000
It's stuck. His hair is stuck.

65
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,970
Be gentle.

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
It's loose.

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,520
I'm out.

68
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,080
I'm feeling dizzy.

69
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,690
- You're falling!
- Keep your balance!

70
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,000
You're falling.

71
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
Mrs. Ma.

72
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,720
What's going on?

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,800
I heard clattering inside.

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
Is everything okay?

75
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,400
It's fine.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,320
The chair fell to the ground.

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,360
Goodbye.

78
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,000
What's the matter now?

79
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,440
You forgot your little one.

80
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,840
Just put her on the ground.

81
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,040
Goodbye.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,840
Son,

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,960
are you okay?

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,240
How did you guys come back?

85
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,040
Did the neighbors see me hanging myself?

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
No, no.

87
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,760
Then I'm relieved.

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,320
Xinnian,

89
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,280
the neighbors said

90
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,920
you hung yourself.

91
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,760
What's that? Is it something tasty?

92
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,520
(Xu Residence)
Physician,

93
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,200
please save my son.

94
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
He's been unconscious on this bed.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,360
You're back.

96
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
You're fine now?

97
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
What could happen to me?

98
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,760
Physician,

99
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,000
is someone in my family sick?

100
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,480
Well...

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,640
You're sick?

102
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Is it serious?

103
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Not very serious.

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
That's good.

105
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,040
That's good.

106
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,600
Then...

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,720
Let's go.

108
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,720
Your clothes are really dirty.

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,040
What's going on?

110
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,590
Oh, my.

111
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,760
The living conditions here
are too harsh.

112
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,880
How dare you sneak a bite?

113
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,040
Granny Bu will knock your teeth out.

114
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,320
Sister.

115
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,680
Hurry up and go call Father and Mother
to the table.

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,600
Father and Mother
are taking care of Xinnian.

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,840
Then, go call Ningyan for dinner.

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,960
(Why don't I have any memory
of the original owner's past?)

119
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,400
(But I can remember his family.)

120
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,560
I finally got promoted to manager,

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,600
but I ended up here now,

122
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,760
making things easier for Zhu.

123
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,240
I haven't used up the money on my card.

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,000
I haven't read a chapter
of the three novels

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
I just downloaded them from Qidian.

126
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,880
What kind of place is this?

127
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,320
What dynasty is this?

128
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,240
There are even magic spells?

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm not seriously stuck here, am I?

130
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,040
No.

131
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,040
I can't die
without figuring everything out.

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,560
Just have a bite.

133
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,480
No, I want food from Moon Resto.

134
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
I just want food from Moon Resto.

135
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,880
Don't move.

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,240
You always come at mealtime.

137
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,920
If I don't come, how can I eat?

138
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,520
Your cooking skills have improved.

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,580
This dish is really delicious.

140
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,180
Father, I want food from Moon Resto.

141
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,640
What's wrong with Xinnian?

142
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,160
He even hung himself just now.

143
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,360
This is called
transient neurogenic amnesia.

144
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,440
When the patient suffers a major blow

145
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,480
in certain situations,

146
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,440
their memory might completely disappear.

147
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,760
However, their basic skills

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,960
won't be affected,

149
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,200
and nothing will be wrong

150
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,740
with their behavior and actions.

151
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,240
No seat for me, huh?

152
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,440
Bro, move a bit.

153
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,840
Can you just have one bite?

154
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,760
I want food from Moon Resto.

155
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,840
I was wondering

156
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,880
why I still feel dizzy.

157
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,560
There's no cutlery for me either.

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,200
Can you lend me this?

159
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,440
Right, just rest well.

160
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
It's no big deal.

161
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,720
But don't bring up the past.

162
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,680
It could cause memory confusion

163
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
and cause sequelae.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,560
(Ningyan is being so kind today.)

165
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,200
(He actually helped me.)

166
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
Sis,

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,280
why do you keep staring at me?

168
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
I just feel like you're different now.

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
You speak and act differently.

170
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,880
The old you couldn't have solved cases.

171
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,920
Yeah.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
I'm also confused.

173
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
Ningyan,

174
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,240
how did you solve this case?

175
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
This is what happened.

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So, our family was released.

177
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,520
I see.

178
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,760
Why didn't I think of it?

179
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
You're a blockhead.

180
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,120
You can't even measure things properly.

181
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,760
Uncle Pingzhi,

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,840
weren't you there

183
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,040
when they counted the money?

184
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,160
Lu give me a pot
of osmanthus wine, right?

185
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
You guys know

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,320
my drinking capacity.

187
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
It's bottomless.

188
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,480
I just drank a few cups.

189
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,640
Why didn't you say so
in your confession?

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,200
I didn't think

191
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
such a trivial matter would be...

192
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
Trivial?

193
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,640
It almost killed our whole family.

194
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,740
And you think it's trivial?

195
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,360
I was foolish.

196
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,520
I'll never drink again.

197
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,080
Mother,

198
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,240
the stars look so beautiful tonight.

199
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
So many stars.

200
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,680
(Astronomical Bureau)
Failed again.

201
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,480
I told you it was the salt dosage.

202
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,200
I just saw Senior Wan boil the salt.

203
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,360
These people

204
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,040
are actually making fake silver.

205
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,400
Caiwei.

206
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,240
It's Senior Caiwei.

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,740
- Senior Caiwei.
- Senior Caiwei.

208
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,880
His Majesty ordered us
to make fake tax silver here.

209
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,270
We're told it's highly powerful.

210
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,700
It explodes when it touches water.

211
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,160
But we keep failing to make it.

212
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,080
We have no clue.

213
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,200
Senior Caiwei, please enlighten us.

214
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,520
Senior Caiwei,

215
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,560
you've seen the process
of making fake tax silver.

216
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,560
Why did we fail?

217
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,080
- Yeah.
- Right.

218
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,280
It looks alright.

219
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,720
That's how it was made back then.

220
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,520
This is an ancient alchemy.

221
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,480
It's deep and obscure.

222
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,600
It's not something you guys

223
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,360
can learn just by talking about it here.

224
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,640
It requires a higher level
of alchemical expertise

225
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,480
to succeed more efficiently.

226
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
Let me teach you a chant.

227
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,640
Remember it well.

228
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,320
H, He, Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne,

229
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,420
Na, Mg, Al, Si, P,

230
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,260
H, He...

231
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,160
What does this mean?

232
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,960
I don't know what it means either.

233
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,560
Anyway, Xu Qi'an told me this.

234
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,320
He's the nephew of Xu Pingzhi,
a Green Robe of the Imperial Guards.

235
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
You can ask him.

236
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,480
By the way,

237
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,400
he's the one

238
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,460
who made the fake silver.

239
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,960
Master.

240
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Caiwei, you're here.

241
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,040
Master.

242
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,640
What exactly

243
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,040
is the metal sodium?

244
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
I don't know.

245
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,640
Are there things in this world
that you don't know?

246
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,560
Oh, I don't know many things.

247
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't even know

248
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,480
where those little thieves

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,160
from 19 years ago went.

250
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,480
Here it comes again.

251
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,560
Master, you always say
those thieves are hateful,

252
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
but you never tell me who they are,

253
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
or what they stole.

254
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,160
They stole something very important.

255
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,200
Master,

256
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,960
you don't tell me what you know,

257
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,520
and instead, you cast a mist before me.

258
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,440
It's really annoying.

259
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,280
Well, Master,

260
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,620
with your cultivation,

261
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,440
you can see
through the past and the future,

262
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
know everything, and do anything.

263
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,600
You must know

264
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,160
why Xu Qi'an

265
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,400
can perform alchemy, right?

266
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,680
Well,

267
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,200
(Today,)

268
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,640
(it's the seventh day
since I came to this world.)

269
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,240
(I've gradually accepted)

270
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,840
(the reality that I can't go back.)

271
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,520
(I've passively accepted this place,)

272
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,080
(but I've actively
figured out my future.)

273
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
(Overall,)

274
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,440
(it's pretty much the same
as my previous team.)

275
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,960
(Everything is within range.)

276
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,320
(That way,)

277
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,440
(I can carry out my plan with ease.)

278
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,360
(As for the original owner's family,)

279
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,800
(they seem to treat me pretty well.)

280
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,600
(Uncle Pingzhi, of course,)

281
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
(treats me like his own son.)

282
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,080
- (He's a 7th Rank Imperial Guard.)
- Xu Pingzhi.

283
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,920
(He's actually a civil servant.)

284
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,400
(He may look impressive outside,)

285
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,280
(but at home,)

286
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,640
- (he's henpecked.)
- Coming.

287
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,840
To save us,

288
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,080
Cijiu has given away

289
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,400
all the money

290
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,400
in the house.

291
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,360
What

292
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,960
should we do now?

293
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah.

294
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,520
What now?

295
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,440
Get up.

296
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,320
Stretch out your right leg.

297
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
Lift it.

298
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,280
I was just about to give it to you.

299
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,440
(Eleven liang)
That'll be recorded

300
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,760
as the monthly salary from last month.

301
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,000
It's from this month.

302
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,280
Last month. Last month.

303
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,280
(Aunt...)

304
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,720
(She's not so easy to deal with.)

305
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,720
(She's like the financial director
who left.)

306
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,360
(As for the two sisters,)

307
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,360
(one is a kind and capable office lady.)

308
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,880
(She's organized,)

309
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
(clever, nimble,)

310
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
(and takes care of everything.)

311
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,960
(She may look mature for her age,)

312
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,760
(but she's still innocent.)

313
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,760
(Sentimental Guard Zhang Baiyu)
(She's at the age of first love.)

314
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,440
(As for the little sister,)

315
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,080
(she's more of a mascot.)

316
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
(Or rather,)

317
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,520
(she's a two-legged glutton.)

318
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,600
(By the way,)

319
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,440
(I almost forgot
about the younger brother.)

320
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,320
(He is a scholar,)

321
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,280
(but he looks like just a nerdy writer.)

322
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,480
A man's pen

323
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,480
is worth a thousand gold.

324
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,120
No, I need to observe more.

325
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
(He might be hiding
his great potential.)

326
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,120
(From today on,)

327
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,280
(I am not Yang Ling.)

328
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,040
(I)
(I am Xu Qi'an.)

329
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,080
(In my past life,)

330
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,360
(I gave up my dreams
for the sake of life.)

331
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,320
(But here,)

332
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,720
(with my advantages of nine-year
compulsory education)

333
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,680
(and all the practical knowledge
in my head,)

334
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,280
(I'm sure I can revive my dreams.)

335
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,580
(I'm going to make money)

336
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,240
How is it?

337
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,360
Did you all understand?

338
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
Anyway, this is my plan.

339
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm going to make money.

340
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,600
You all need to make money too.

341
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,200
I know my plan is still not perfect.

342
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,840
You won't understand things
like asset management,

343
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,080
joint ventures, and IPOs.

344
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,040
But don't worry.

345
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,640
Please believe that I can pull this off.

346
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,800
After all,
many famous people made their fortunes

347
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,440
when no one believed in them.

348
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,600
Lingyue,

349
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,960
rub the clothes clean.

350
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,800
Got it.

351
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,520
Xinnian,

352
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,720
I heard you're at some academy, right?

353
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,400
Yunlu Academy.

354
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,240
How about this?

355
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,160
Help me with the initial capital.

356
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,320
Once my business gets bigger,

357
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,340
you can just count the money
in your little house.

358
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,200
Uncle Pingzhi,

359
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,560
I heard you're some guard.

360
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,500
Is that a big position?

361
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,740
I'm an Imperial Guard.

362
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,600
Help me out,

363
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
and I'll make you a small shareholder.

364
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,440
Little one,
do you have any New Year money?

365
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,320
Give me a little.

366
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,280
When I make money,
I'll buy you a cart of pears.

367
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,040
No.

368
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,680
Sis,

369
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,320
you're managing the family money, right?

370
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,200
Give me a little,

371
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,120
and I'll give you ten percent
of the profits.

372
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,720
- How about it?
- Ten percent of what?

373
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,880
- Xu Ningyan.
- Aunt, quiet.

374
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,520
I'm just thinking of the family.

375
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Alright then.

376
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,240

377
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,120
Ningyan, your work clothes.

(Constable)

379
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,720
What does this mean?

380
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,840
You owe us decades of monthly payments,

381
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,520
plus the rent for your side house,

382
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,560
totaling 632 liang and five qian.

383
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,920
If you truly care for the family,

384
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,960
change into proper clothes,

385
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,960
and go back to the yamen

386
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,640
to work off your debt.

387
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,920
As a constable?

388
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,880
I'll never work as a constable.

389
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,680
In this life,
I'll never work as a constable.

390
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,600
Uncle, didn't I make myself clear?

391
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,480
Hurry and persuade your wife.

392
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,600
Hurry up.

393
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,200
If you're late for roll call,
you'll be fined.

394

You...

395
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,160
Sis, stop pretending you didn't hear it.

396
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,260
Help me out here.

397
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,480
When I make money,
I'll open a clothing store for you.

398
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,120
You won't have to wash the clothes.

399
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,780
- You'll wear...
- Lingyin.

400
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,360
Go play with the rocking horse.

402
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,840

403
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,400
She's going to kill me!

404
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,080
Don't run, you little brat!

405
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,240
Aunt, save me!

406
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,440
Stop her!

407
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,030

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,680
you're right.

512
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,440

relax at work.

524

who the killer is

He was a rich man on Kangping Street.

His first wife died early,
leaving a son.

535

00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,120
Why are you only pregnant now?

558
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,360
Come clean.

559
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,620
Did you sleep with your stepson

560
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,560
and kill your husband?

561
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:10,410
My Lord,

562
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,320
I'm innocent.

563
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,960
My health has been poor.

564
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,720
I've been treating myself every day.

565
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,920
Finally, I'm pregnant
with my husband's child.

566
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,070
How could you accuse me so unjustly?

567
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,800
You said you saw a shadow kill him
and climb over the wall to escape,

568
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,560
but when the constables
searched the garden today,

569
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,120
there were no footprints

570
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,920
or signs of disturbed plants. Why?

571
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,440
Well...

572
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,320
My Lord,

573
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,120
how would my mother know

574
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,080
the way for killer to enter the house?

575
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,220
The constables didn't find anything.

576
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,560
So, you want to blame

577
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,320
my mother and me?

578
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,520
(He's clear-minded.)

579
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,240
(He even turned the tables on us.)

580
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,520
(Zhang Xian looks
like a tough nut to crack.)

581
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,640
Still twisting things.

582
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,600
Someone?

583
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,480
Yes.

584
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,760
Prepare the caning.

585
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,760
Yes.

586
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,000
My Lord!

587
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,280
We're innocent!

588
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,120
My Lord,

589
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,680
are you going to torture us
for a confession?

590
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,160
My uncle is a Secretary
at the Ministry of Rites.

591
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,360
My Lord,

592
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,520
aren't you afraid of being impeached?

593
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
How dare you!

594
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,920
So what if your uncle's a Secretary?

595
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
A Secretary...

596
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,160
A Secretary's

597
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,240
nephew

598
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,920
can't act recklessly

599
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,560
in court.

600
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,200
You go back.

601
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,760
Mr. Zhu was about to force a confession.

602
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,720
Everyone saw it, right?

603
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,680
We saw it.

604
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,880
You can't force a confession!

605
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,080
Release them! Release them!

606
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:14,320
Release them! Release them!

607
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,060
We can't keep interrogating them
like this.

608
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,160
I have an idea.

609
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,400
Release them! Release them!

610
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,240
Alright.

611
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:28,560
Release them! Release them!

612
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
Relax.

613
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,480
I'm here to help you.

614
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,560
You can call me.

615
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,760
Mr. Xu.

616
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Mr. Xu.

617
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,240
On the night of the murder,

618
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,800
when Zhang Yourui went out of town
to collect rent,

619
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,480
you slept with your stepson.

620
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,040
But Zhang Yourui came back early

621
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,600
and caught you in the act.

622
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,000
I'll kill you, you shameless woman!

623
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,040
Father...

624
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,240
You killed Zhang Yourui

625
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,720
by accident.

626
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I didn't!

627
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,240
I'm innocent!

628
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,920
To cover up your crime,

629
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,240
you dragged the body to the courtyard.

630
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,520
Zhang Xian even left footprints,

631
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,040
so you could

632
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,440
cover it up

633
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,360
as a theft gone wrong,

634
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,680
then concoct a story,

635
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,480
and have your relative
smooth things over

636
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,200
and convince the constables.

637
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,560
Then you'd be at ease.

638
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,080
You thought you handled it perfectly,

639
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,280
but in fact,

640
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,600
there are flaws everywhere.

641
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,360
My Lord,

642
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,920
you can't talk nonsense like this.

643
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,040
Zhang Xian only left footprints
going out

644
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,880
but not coming in.

645
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,840
If the thief had decent footwork,

646
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,560
they'd have activated their potential

647
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,160
and wouldn't have left any footprints.

648
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,280
That's one point.

649
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,760
Secondly,

650
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,020
Zhang Yourui died
from a blunt instrument.

651
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,320
One strike killed him.

652
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,040
No weapon was found at the scene,

653
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,900
which means

654
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,600
the killer had the weapon with him.

655
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,480
Who would bring a blunt instrument

656
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,200
to commit theft?

657
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,680
It's just a hindrance.

658
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,040
You can't argue anymore, can you?

659
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,400
Thirdly,

660
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,040
after Zhang Yourui died,

661
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,520
his body was found in the courtyard,

662
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,600
lying face down,
with his feet pointing outward.

663
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,380
The fatal wound was
at the back of his head.

664
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,290
This suggests

665
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,040
the killer struck him from behind.

666
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,400
So, the thief
must've been in the courtyard

667
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,600
and behind Zhang Yourui.

668
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,320
If it really were a thief,

669
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,320
they'd either stay still

670
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,320
or flee.

671
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,400
But they moved around to the back

672
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,680
and attacked
when the victim was vulnerable.

673
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,120
They even killed him with one blow.

674
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,600
How could that be possible?

675
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
(I've scared her enough now.)

676
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,000
(The real key is coming up.)

677
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
Just now, when I came in,

678
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,920
the County Governor
gave me a confession.

679
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,180
(Suspect)
Zhang Xian's confession.

680
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320
Open it.

681
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,760
What's wrong?

682
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,610
Are you afraid?

683
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,400
It details everything I've just said.

684
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,880
Zhang Xian knows
there are too many flaws

685
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,400
and this time, he's doomed.

686
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,760
He's voluntarily confessed
to the County Governor.

687
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,600
By the way,

688
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,640
he said that he was innocent,

689
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,400
that you forced everything

690
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,400
upon him,

691
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,120
and that it was you

692
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,200
who killed him.

693
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,520
He's willing
to offer 500 liang of silver,

694
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
along with a favor

695
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,560
from Secretary Xu of his family.

696
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,040
We can use this confession as evidence

697
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,440
to close the case.

698
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,800
As I said,

699
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,720
I'm here

700
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,520
to help you.

701
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,960
As long as you confess honestly,

702
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,400
the County Governor has promised

703
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,080
to spare you

704
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,360
and your unborn child from death.

705
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
Really?

706
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,800
Really.

Jerk!

715
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,720
How dare he ask me to release him?

716
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,520
This is in my jurisdiction
of Changle County!

717
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,680
A Secretary has no right to intervene!

718
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,640
During the Year of Capital Inspection,

719
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,360
he dared to openly block
law enforcement.

720
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,880
He must have some backing.

721
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,800
I've heard

722
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,560
since Zhang Xian entered our yamen,

723
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,120
Secretary Xu

724
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,400
went to the Ministry of Justice.

725
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,520
He is

726
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,440
still there now.

727
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,600
To conclude,

728
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,240
we absolutely can't release him.

729
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,480
I think

730
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,240
if we release him first,

731
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,800
this matter will escalate.

732
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,970
Are you saying...?

733
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,400
I heard

734
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,680
Li Yuchun, Silver Gong of the Guardians,

735
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,040
is known for his integrity

736
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,060
and incorruptibility.

737
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
If he knew about this,

738
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,420
he might intervene.

739
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,100
Zhang Xian,

740
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,180
you can leave now.

741
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,620
Good poem.

742
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,530
Come on. Great.

743
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,140
- Let me toast to you.
- Come on.

744
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,940
Ningyan, try this.

745
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,420
The chief ordered this for you.

746
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,500
It's crab-stuffed orange.

747
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,360
Thank you.

748
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,460
- Everyone, eat.
- Try it.

749
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,100
The County Governor said

750
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,500
this case was

751
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,060
handled well,

752
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,740
and he would credit me

753
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,980
with a small merit.

754
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,940
I've worked here for many years,

755
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,940
but I've never heard him say this.

756
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,980
Fill the cups.

757
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:52,980
Brothers,

758
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,140
let's all toast

759
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,540
to Ningyan.

760
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,580
Ningyan,

761
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,180
you solved the case.

762
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,180
You deserve the main credit!

763
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,580
- Right.
- You're too kind.

764
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,180
- Great!
- Thank you!

765
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,740
Ningyan,

766
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,200
you usually kept a low profile.

767
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,720
I didn't expect you to be so capable.

768
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,020
Tell us how you solved the case.

769
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,860
Tell us.

770
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,820
Actually, it wasn't anything special.

771
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,460
That woman is gullible

772
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,420
and timid.

773
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
When she saw...

774
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,820
When she saw the confession
written by our chief,

775
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,220
she immediately confessed.

776
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,340
You're modest.

777
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,380
You're modest.

778
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,180
You're too modest.

779
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,180
Let's drink some more.

780
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,540
Chief,

781
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,660
I heard Zhang Xian was released.

782
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,660
Ningyan,

783
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,860
as Speeds,

784
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,940
our duty is done.

785
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,020
The rest is

786
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,820
up to the higher-ups.

787
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,660
Will they handle it?

788
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,260
Don't worry.

789
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,700
I'll toast to you again.

790
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,180
No, no, wait.

791
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,620
If this isn't handled well,

792
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,100
Mrs. Zhang is finished.

793
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,260
After all, she implicated Zhang Xian.

794
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,060
Don't worry.

795
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,020
Just keep your mind at ease.

796
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,540
I've seen it.

797
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,060
Registrar Xu has taken the confession

798
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,340
and is heading to Haoqi Tower.

799
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,550
Haoqi Tower?

800
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,340
Who are you?

801
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,780
I'm the Registrar of Changle County.

802
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,820
(Registrar)
I'm Xu Jiuzhi,

803
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,300
(Xu Jiuzhi)
here to meet Silver Gong Li.

804
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,080
Mr. Li is not here.

805
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,280
He's out on official business.

806
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,500
So, Mr. Xu went to find reinforcements.

807
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,020
We need to be cautious.

808
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,700
Our small yamen

809
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,060
is right next to the big capital,
full of powerful people.

810
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,860
We must be careful.

811
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,460
Who exactly resides in Haoqi Tower?

812
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,220
Could they bring Zhang Xian down?

813
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,020
Are you drunk?

814
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,820
They're Guardians.

815
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,180
Guard...

816
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,260
Guardians?

817
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,780
It's dry now.

818
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,100
Be careful with fire.

819
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,380
Did you drink fake wine?

820
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,300
It's not that Guardian.

821
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,500
Then what is it?

822
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,060
- You don't know the Guardian?
- Stop.

823
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,140
- Catch the thief!
- Chief!

824
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,050
Chief!

825
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,980
What a jerk!

826
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,140
Are you still stealing?

827
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,020
Stealing, huh?

828
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,140
Guardians are the ones

829
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,020
who supervise the officials

830
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,860
and guard the capital.

831
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,140
They're heroes

832
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,540
we all admire.

833
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,460
They're like immortal figures.

834
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,540
Especially Lord Wei Yuan.

835
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,140
Wait for me for the interrogation.

836
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,980
Alright.

837
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,960
You'll understand
once you get the chance to witness it.

838
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,220
The Governor praised
our good work on the case

839
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,100
and rewarded us with a day off

840
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,260
tomorrow.

841
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,460
Let's split the bill for the wine later.

842
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,180
What, Chief?

843
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Isn't this your rule?

844
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,840
But I haven't received
my monthly salary.

845
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,220
- Go Dutch.
- Go Dutch.

846
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,700
Yes, just like you said.

847
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,980
- Colleagues do this.
- Let's split it.

848
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,220
You're the leader here.

849
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,620
Sir,

850
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,660
I want a sweet drink.

851
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,620
Less sugar, please.

852
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,500
Please wait, sir.

853
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,820
Here, sir.

854
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,790
Take care.

855
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,700
Thank you, sir.

856
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,540
Why are you so nervous?

857
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,420
(A group of burly men
came to the sweet drink shop,)

858
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,620
(but none of them had the sweet drink.)

859
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,900
(Something must be wrong.)

860
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,900
(It's a Grade II Merit.)

861
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,380
Take your sweet drink

862
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,140
and leave.

863
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,820
Something's indeed wrong.

864
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,900
I'm Xu Qi'an,
Changle County Constable,

865
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,340
on a lawful patrol.

866
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,940
Thirty strokes of the cane

867
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,380
for carrying weapons illegally.

868
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,300
Close the door.

869
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,460
Fifty strokes of the cane

870
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,060
for gathering people to fight!

871
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,100
You're asking for death.

872
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,210
Oh, my.

873
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,940
Three years in prison
for beating a yamen worker.

874
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,220
Chief, the prisoner carriage is here.

875
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,060
Let's do it.

876
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,620
You'll be killed

877
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,140
for saving a prisoner.

878
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,880
They're trying to save the prisoner!

879
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,900
(Sipai Community)

880
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,460
Chief.

881
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,140
Retreat.

882
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,540
It's better to die.

883
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,660
If I die, maybe I can go back.

884
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,140
Kill him!

885
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,660
(Pure and Noble)

886
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,000
(Zhu Guangxiao, 8th Rank Guardian)
Do no wrong at night,

887
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,240
(Song Tingfeng, 8th Rank Guardian)
and fear no Guardians.

888
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,100
(Li Yuchun, 7th Rank Guardian)
Guardians on a case.

889
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,040
