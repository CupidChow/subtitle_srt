Today

41
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,270
is the 25th.

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,470
The Grand Princess will go study
at the Astronomical Bureau.

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,830
With Xu Qi'an,

44
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,030
I won't have to go
to the Bureau anymore.

45
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:56,880
Your Highness.

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,880
- Your Highness.
- This way.

47
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,800
Your Highness.

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,670
What is it?

49
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,110
Calm down before you speak.

50
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,440
Xu Qi'an

51
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,040
went to the Bureau.

52
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,040
What?

53
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,710
(Today, Huaiqing will go study
at the Bureau.)

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,800
(If they meet, my lie will be exposed.)

55
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,080
Do I always cause such a big scene
when I come here?

56
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,430
Senior Song,

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,150
if this happens again next time,

58
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,920
we should meet somewhere else.

59
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,670
I usually keep a low profile.

60
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,640
It's not about you.

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,360
The Grand Princess is coming.

62
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,320
Perfect.

63
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,240
I can meet the Grand Princess

64
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,080
and catch up.

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,040
You know the Grand Princess?

66
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,240
We have some acquaintance.

67
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,480
I've roughly understood this mirror.

68
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,920
It hides a mysterious
and complex formation.

69
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,960
Especially this broken jade piece.

70
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
From what I see,

71
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,370
it is the work of the Earth Sect.

72
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,270
The Earth Sect?

73
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,920
The Earth Sect was once famous,

74
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,550
but it disappeared

75
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,040
over a decade ago.

76
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,990
Move aside.

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,040
Yah!

78
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,110
Move aside.

79
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,520
This is your reward.

80
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,270
Yah!

81
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,830
Yah!

82
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,110
Huaiqing.

83
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,640
Huaiqing.

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,320
I...

85
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,460
I have something important
to tell you.

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,480
Say it.

87
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,920
The weather is so nice today.

88
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,590
Let's go boating.

89
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,110
Huaiqing.

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,160
Well.

91
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,830
The Sangbo Pageant is in a few days.

92
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,080
Our ceremonial attire
must be ready by now.

93
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,110
Let's go back to the Palace to check.

94
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,360
I dreamed last night

95
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,760
that the Bureau exploded.

96
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,030
I think we shouldn't go in.

97
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,120
Here we go again.

98
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,160
Fine.

99
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,560
Carry her to the Bureau

100
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,960
and have the physicians

101
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,200
check her properly.

102
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

103
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
(I can't go in.)

104
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,030
(I can't go in.)

105
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,120
(Xu Qi'an is in the Bureau.)

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,230
Princess Lin'an,

107
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,760
she seems stiff now.

108
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,710
Have two more people come to help.

109
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,460
(Xu Residence)

110
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,760
This mirror is yours. I can't claim it.

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,470
So, I can't delve deeper
into its mysteries.

112
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,670
Claim it?

113
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,790
Once you claim it,

114
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,200
you can enter the mirror

115
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,470
and explore.

116
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,220
(No. 7, No. 6)

117
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,580
(No. 7, No. 8)

118
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,940

119
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,140

125

No. 4.

126
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:40,880
No. 5.

127
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,980
(No. 2, No. 4)

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
Where is No. 3?

129
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,520
Am I No. 3?

130
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,960
Senior,

131
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,880
where are you?

132
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,270
(No. 9)

133
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,350
Answer me.

134
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,980
(No. 2, No. 3)

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,760
You're not Jinlian.

136
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,040
Where is Jinlian?

137
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,710
Is Jinlian alive?

138
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,790
How did you get this mirror?

139
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,590
Are you with the Realm Sect?

140
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,790
(Realm Sect?)

141
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,150
(Jinlian?)

142
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,790
(He must be the old man
who gave me the mirror.)

143
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,350
(This No. 9)

144
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,590
(calls him Senior.)

145
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,150
(No. 3)
(Could they)

146
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,880
(share a master?)

147
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,470
I'm not with the Realm Sect.

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,150
An old man gave me this mirror.

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,350
How can you prove
you're not with the Realm Sect?

150
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,880
State your name.

151
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm just a nobody.

152
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,270
(No. 6)
I am Zilian of the Earth Sect.

153
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,960
Not long ago,

154
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,150
I received a distress signal
from Senior Jinlian.

155
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,140
I learned he arrived
in the Dafeng's capital.

156
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,880
Only in the capital

157
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,080
could he escape
the Realm Sect's pursuit.

158
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,000
But when I arrived in the capital,

159
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,020
I lost contact with him.

160
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,350
He must be in grave danger,

161
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,640
which is why he gave you this mirror

162
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,520
to avoid their pursuit.

163
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,880
What do you mean?

164
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,320
Why give up the Jade Mirror?

165
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,230
Can the Realm Sect track its location?

166
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,200
Exactly.

167
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,270
(No. 2, No. 3)
Senior entrusted this mirror to you,

168
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,080
hoping you could divert disaster for him

169
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:24,320
and face the Realm Sect's wolves.

170
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,710
(So, he's dumping this mess on me?)

171
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,640
(I'm just a Speed.)

172
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,000
(No, no.)

173
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,320
(I'm just a small Guardian.)

174
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,510
I think

175
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,110
it's best for you not to get involved.

176
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,400
Can you return the mirror to me?

177
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,990
I will reward you handsomely.

178
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,080
Fine. How should I return it?

179
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,300
(No. 9)
I'm in the capital.

180
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,040
We can trade anytime.

181
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,990
What do you want?

182
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,160
There's no need to be polite.

183
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,800
Well.

184
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,750
This mirror belongs to you,
so it's my duty to return it.

185
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,920
However,

186
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,400
at the time, your senior

187
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,230
told me this was a supreme treasure.

188
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,040
He sold it to me for 500 liang of gold.

189
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm not asking for money,

190
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,960
but

191
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,470
since the treasure is being returned,

192
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,990
the gold should also be returned.

193
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,010
Wouldn't you agree?

194
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,160
It's an equivalent exchange.

195
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,800
Fine.

196
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,730
At dusk,

197
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,230
I'll be waiting for you

198
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,230
at the Harmony Room of Moon Resto

199
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,990
in the north of the city.

200
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,900
(No. 9)

201
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,190
Oh, no.

202
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,440
I'm losing out.

203
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,830
He agreed so easily.

204
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,800
I should've asked for 1,000 liang.

205
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,320
(No. 6)
No. 3, don't trust No. 9.

206
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Don't respond.

207
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,350
Don't respond.

208
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,230
Don't respond.

209
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,950
Yan,

210
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,520
I have something urgent to report.

211
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,360
Speak.

212
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,320
Today, you...

213
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,800
I know I look ugly today.

214
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,920
No, just not as free-spirited as usual.

215
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,470
That's still thanks to you.

216
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,710
What does it have to do with me?

217
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,680
Stop with the nonsense.

218
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,850
Tell me what you have to say.

219
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,050
What is this?

220
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,740
It looks like it contains another world.

221
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,110
This is the Jade Mirror,

222
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,500
a treasure of the Earth Sect.

223
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,310
The Earth Sect?

224
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,610
Are you sure it's the Earth Sect?

225
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,870
Absolutely.

226
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,080
This is serious.

227
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,350
Follow me to see Lord Wei.

228
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,960
See Lord Wei?

229
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,470
Remember.

230
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,960
Keep your words concise and truthful.

231
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,830
Don't hide anything.

232
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,430
Understood.

233
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,320
Subordinate Yang Yan.

234
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,750
Subordinate Xu Qi'an.

235
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,510
We have to report to Lord Wei.

236
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,050
He's a mere Copper Gong.

237
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,560
How can he meet with Lord Wei?

238
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
This is significant.

239
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,280
He is the direct reporter.

240
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,440
Let him in.

241
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,760
Lord Wei,

242
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,990
Copper Gong Xu Qi'an has to report.

243
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,670
Speak.

244
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,310
Lord Wei,

245
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,960
this mirror pertains to the Earth Sect.

246
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,230
Please inspect it.

247
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,710
The Earth Sect?

248
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,160
Where did it come from?

249
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,670
Your Highness.

250
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,440
Your Highness, what's wrong?

251
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,900
Call the imperial physician!

252
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,420
No need for imperial physicians.

253
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,740
The Bureau's physicians
nearly killed me.

254
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,420
You went to the Bureau?

255
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,820
Earlier, Huaiqing and I

256
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,580
argued at the Bureau's entrance
for an hour.

257
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,580
I got exhausted

258
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,740
and was carried into the Bureau.

259
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,780
You have no idea.

260
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,340
As soon as I entered,

261
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,940
Huaiqing summoned physicians

262
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,740
to transfer energy to me.

263
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,660
Princess Huaiqing

264
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,980
called physicians for you?

265
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,200
I think she did it on purpose
to get back at me.

266
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,460
As soon as I entered,

267
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,380
those physicians tormented me for hours

268
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,180
before I escaped.

269
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,380
Your Highness, you've had a hard time.

270
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,020
Fortunately,

271
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,340
pretending to be Huaiqing
wasn't exposed.

272
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,820
It wasn't exposed?

273
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Xu Qi'an wasn't at the Bureau.

274
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,500
He wasn't there?

275
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,420
Then wasn't this trip

276
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,780
a waste of your effort?

277
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:44,960
Slow down.

278
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,580
She's been acting strange lately.

279
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,100
Have someone keep an eye on her.

280
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,020
Yes.

281
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,540
(Haoqi Tower)

282
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,100
(It really is him.)

283
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,260
Five hundred liang of gold?

284
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,680
I was merely seeking

285
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,780
reasonable profit.

286
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,860
You didn't expose your identity.

287
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,380
Well done.

288
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,380
Thanks to the teachings
of the Guardian Yamen.

289
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,030
Since that's the case,

290
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,580
why not proceed with the trade?

291
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,420
This concerns the Earth Sect.

292
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,660
Their sudden appearance
in our Dafeng capital

293
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,860
might bring harm.

294
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,340
After careful thought,

295
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,700
personal gain is insignificant

296
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,180
compared to the Dafeng's safety.

297
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,900
So, I decided to report this matter.

298
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,120
Are you courting death?

299
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,720
Do not hide anything from Lord Wei.

300
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,380
Lord Wei, sorry.

301
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,700
In truth,

302
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,620
I was afraid of dying.

303
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,020
Speak.

304
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,660
I planned to trade with him
at Moon Resto.

305
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,300
Who knew...

306
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,740
(No. 6)
Who are you?

307
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,460
Why do you say No. 9 cannot be trusted?

308
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,700
Are you with the Realm Sect?

309
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,820
Yes.

310
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,260
Why do you claim No. 9 is insane?

311
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,940
No. 9 belongs to the Earth Sect.

312
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,660
They are a group of ruthless
and violent lunatics.

313
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,580
If you believe him,

314
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,260
your life will be in danger.

315
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,780
But No. 9 just said you're the lunatics.

316
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,020
Well...

317
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,500
He's lying to you.

318
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,060
How do I know you're not lying to me?

319
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,820
Besides,
why didn't you confront him earlier

320
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,900
when he was here?

321
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,620
(No. 3)
The No. 3 Mirror

322
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,860
was sealed by the Earth Sect,

323
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,300
cutting off our connection.

324
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,060
I used a secret technique

325
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,220
to contact you
when he wasn't paying attention.

326
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,500
My time is limited.

327
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,820
You should stay out of this mess.

328
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,740
If you return the Jade Mirror

329
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,060
to the Realm Sect,

330
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,740
I will do my best

331
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,940
to protect your life.

332
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,700
What do you mean

333
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,100
by "protect my life"?

334
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,540
(No. 3)
I've told you.

335
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,540
No. 9 is ruthless and violent.

336
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,100
Now that you know where he'll be,

337
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,660
he won't let you live.

338
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,900
Then I simply won't trade with him.

339
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,020
What can he do to me?

340
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,460
The Earth Sect

341
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,220
can use the Jade Mirror

342
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,940
to track your location.

343
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,460
Then I'll just throw the mirror away.

344
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,780
You...

345
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,660
The weapon has bonded with you.

346
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,540
Even if you discard it, the Earth Sect

347
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,060
can still find you and silence you.

348
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,340
So, you thought of us.

349
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,220
It concerns the Earth Sect,

350
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,140
so the Guardians would be interested.

351
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,620
If you asked for Lord Wei's help
to deal with them,

352
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,840
on one hand,

353
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,140
you'd ensure your safety.

354
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,580
On the other hand,

355
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,140
you'd gain credit for reporting it.

356
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,900
This is quite a clever deal.

357
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,060
I was merely seeking

358
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,900
reasonable profit.

359
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,260
Shameless.

360
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,780
Yang Yan.

361
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,500
Yes.

362
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,070
Go check

363
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,940
while there's daylight.

364
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,900
Yes.

365
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,660
(Zilian, Earth Sect,
4th Rank Yin Spirit)

366
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,340
Leader, I have fulfilled the mission.

367
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,900
You've brought back an enemy.

368
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,980
(Tea House)

369
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,140
Yang Yan.

370
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,940
Cyan Wei's hound.

371
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,340
Stay out of this.

372
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,660
What if I must interfere?

373
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,300
Then don't blame me
for being ruthless.

374
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,820
Xu Qi'an.

375
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,700
What are you still doing here?

376
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,540
Get out.

377
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,540
I feel this room is a bit chilly.

378
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,780
Let me tend to the brazier
before leaving.

379
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,460
No need. Put it down; I'll do it.

380
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,300
No, no.

381
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,700
Such menial tasks

382
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,740
should be left to me.

383
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,580
Let me.

384
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,060
Truly a natural fire-tender.

385
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,340
You flatter me.

386
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,500
Ghosts Formation.

387
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,940
My Ghosts Formation

388
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,220
ensures an easy entrance
but an impossible exit.

389
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Even as a 4th Rank Fighter,

390
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,700
you'll be drained to death inside.

391
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,740
The Guardians

392
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,460
are still mediocre.

393
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,660
The Guardians.

394
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,100
Gold Gong.

395
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,300
This

396
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:50,900
feels much better.

397
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,540
You have copper skin and iron bones.

398
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,780
Why not fight back?

399
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,460
I'm waiting

400
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,940
for my spear.

401
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
Here it comes.

402
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,740
Alright. Adjust it.

403
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,740
Come back.

404
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,900
Good.

405
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,900
Good.

406
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,620
Lord Wei.

407
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,740
These two are my colleagues
from Breeze Hall.

408
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,340
Copper Gong Song Tingfeng.

409
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,180
I am.

410
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,660
Copper Gong Zhu Guangxiao.

411
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,500
I am.

412
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,120
- Greetings, Lord Wei.
- Greetings, Lord Wei.

413
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,300
Thank you both for your efforts.

414
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,180
It's nothing.

415
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,140
We shall take our leave.

416
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,620
Go ahead.

417
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,540
Lord Wei,

418
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,780
I love tea.

419
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,020
In my leisure time,

420
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,620
I crafted this tea table.

421
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,940
Today, I present it for your appraisal.

422
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,420
What is unique

423
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,940
about this tea table?

424
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,670
This tea table is crafted
from Xuantian marble.

425
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,000
It combines squares and circles,

426
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,540
and it's understated yet luxurious.

427
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,580
It's carved with pine trees,

428
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,780
with space below for bonsai or incense.

429
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,580
It emphasizes an elegant atmosphere.

430
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,250
A stove is placed below,

431
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,700
allowing tea

432
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,740
to be brewed on top.

433
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,740
This small mechanism

434
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,820
was inspired

435
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,220
by techniques from the Bureau.

436
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,020
What use is this?

437
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,880
You still have to pour water
to brew tea.

438
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,780
Not quite.

439
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,700
Lord Wei.

440
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,780
Please press here lightly.

441
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,660
With this,

442
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,300
even if you're reading,

443
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,140
you can conveniently brew tea.

444
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,540
Isn't that quick and practical?

445
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,890
These are Fangshan Dew Bud,

446
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,900
Junshan Yinzhen,

447
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,300
Taiping Houkui,

448
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,170
and Dafeng Xiaoqinggan.

449
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,330
All are rare treasures.

450
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,670
I collected them

451
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,900
over some time.

452
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,220
Good.

453
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,980
Here are tea snacks prepared for you.

454
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,860
(The first rule of being a worker:)

455
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,820
(Understand the needs
of leaders and clients,)

456
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,260
(and appeal to their preferences.)

457
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,740
It does have some thoughtful design.

458
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,780
Hence, I named it

459
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,060
the Kung Fu Tea Table.

460
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,700
Good.

461
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,420
Experts from the Earth Sect

462
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,820
truly are formidable.

463
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,580
The tea aroma is strong,

464
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,220
delicate, intense,

465
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,980
and smooth,

466
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,820
with a lingering aftertaste.

467
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,140
Lord Wei,

468
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,700
where did this tea come from?

469
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,140
By comparison,

470
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,500
the teas I brought today

471
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,020
truly pale in comparison.

472
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,220
If you like it,

473
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,740
I'll have Rou pack some

474
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,540
for you to take back.

475
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,420
Thank you, Lord Wei.

476
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,740
How about this?

477
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,180
Let this tea table serve
as a token of gratitude

478
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,260
for Lord Wei.

479
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,220
Lord Wei wouldn't care
for your shabby thing.

480
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,300
Not so.

481
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,480
Ordinary people
may not recognize its value,

482
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,540
but to true tea connoisseurs,

483
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,100
it's like a treasured saber that shines

484
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,380
when it finds a worthy master.

485
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,900
This tea table,
placed in Lord Wei's tea room,

486
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,980
would truly shine.

487
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,310
Marvelous.

488
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180
Rou,

489
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,180
fetch some tea leaves.

490
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,700
Yes, Lord Wei.

491
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,860
You're injured.

492
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,620
Lord Wei, I'm back.

493
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,540
It's a wound from a Yin Spirit,

494
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,660
nothing serious.

495
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,860
Sorry for my incompetence.

496
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,380
I failed to capture the culprit.

497
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,020
The Earth Sect's Yin Spirits
are formless and shadowless.

498
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,340
It's not your fault.

499
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,660
The person who contacted you first

500
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,980
was indeed from the Earth Sect

501
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,540
and did want to kill you.

502
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,860
But I've driven him off.

503
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,780
You'll be safe for now.

504
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,660
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

505
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,340
For the coming days,

506
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,100
post some Guardians covert sentries
near the Xu Residence.

507
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,340
Understood.

508
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,820
Since the mirror has bonded with you,

509
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,340
you shall keep it for now.

510
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Thank you, Lord Wei.

511
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,860
Lord Wei,

512
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,620
the culprit is injured.

513
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,820
Please allow me
to gather my Silver Gongs

514
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,420
to search the capital.

515
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,020
I'm certain we can apprehend them.

516
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,660
No need.

517
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,340
Others will handle it.

518
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,700
Junior.

519
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,860
I hope you've been well.

520
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,640
Senior.

521
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,420
- Elder Xu!
- Elder Xu!

522
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,220
Elder Xu, you're finally out.

523
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,100
Both of you are older than me.

524
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,340
Is it okay to call me that?

525
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,660
Not at all.
The capable one is the elder.

526
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,660
Thanks to you,
we got to witness Lord Wei's grandeur.

527
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,600
Rest assured,

528
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,700
we won't forget this favor.

529
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,280
If you need anything,
just let us know.

530
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,140
Tell us.

531
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,620
How did you get into the Haoqi Tower?

532
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,560
In fact, it was simple.

533
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,680
Xu Qi'an.

534
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,700
When did you get here?

535
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,780
Why didn't anyone inform me?

536
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,860
Well.

537
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,140
Ningyan...

538
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,100
Were you just in the Haoqi Tower?

539
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,420
Me?

540
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,460
Of course not.

541
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,420
I wasn't.

542
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,660
I just

543
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,940
happened to pass by

544
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,380
and had an upset stomach.

545
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,660
So, I used the restroom.

546
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,980
You

547
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,660
used the restroom

548
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,380
in the Haoqi Tower?

549
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,260
Not only that,

550
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,220
but he also sat with Lord Wei,

551
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,620
enjoying tea and chatting merrily.

552
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,660
Ms. Nangong.

553
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,940
Li Yuchun,

554
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,440
your subordinate is clever
and resourceful.

555
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,260
He's only been here a few days,

556
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,660
yet he's formed a deep bond
with Lord Wei.

557
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,180
How about this?

558
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,800
Why don't you move Breeze Hall
into the Haoqi Tower?

559
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,380
That way,
Gold Gongs and Silver Gongs

560
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,560
won't need to overstep
by delivering messages for you.

561
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,900
That's just troublesome.

562
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,400
Keep up the good work.

563
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,540
Forget the Guardian system

564
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,020
or the Breeze Hall.

565
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,620
As long as Lord Wei favors you,

566
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,780
what can we do about it?

567
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
So sarcastic.

568
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,900
Chief.

569
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,420
Chief.

570
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,980
You must've noticed.

571
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,120
She's doing it on purpose.

572
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,700
Good.

573
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,900
Good.

574
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,260
This is tea from Lord Wei.

575
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,740
It's from Lord Wei.

576
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,540
It's expensive.

577
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,140
If the files aren't sorted out today,

578
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,740
none of you can go home.

579
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,180
Mr. Xu, let me.

580
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Don't tire yourself out.

581
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,300
Come on, let me.

582
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,740
You just have a seat.

583
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,940
We'll handle it.

584
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,900
Ignore the files. Come on.

585
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,060
This way.

586
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,140
The capable one is the elder.

587
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
Relax.

588
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,220
- Elder Xu.
- My elbow.

589
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,260
Five hundred fifty-three.

590
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,890
- How many tonics did she consume?
- 555.

591
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,960
- How much vital energy was infused?
- 556.

592
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,100
Xuan!

593
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,820
Useless fool.

594
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,780
Gang.

595
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,940
Catch this.

596
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,660
Is it too late for me to fall now?

597
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,540
Your Highness.

598
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,420
I truly can't go on.

599
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,940
Look at everyone.

600
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,780
They're all spent.

601
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,740
Your Highness,
how does your body feel now?

602
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,340
I feel

603
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,320
it's as if there's a blazing fire

604
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,500
surging in my chest.

605
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,300
It's roaring and unstoppable.

606
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,740
I'm brimming with boundless energy.

607
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,580
No, no.

608
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,940
Your Highness.

609
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,060
These days,

610
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,100
to avoid Xu Qi'an
from discovering anything amiss,

611
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,840
we've been waking early
and resting late,

612
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,900
rushing around constantly.

613
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,500
Besides, the ordeal at the Bureau today

614
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,300
was utterly nerve-wracking.

615
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,260
Your medication is long-acting,

616
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,340
but the entire Shaoyin Palace

617
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,420
is extremely exhausted.

618
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,420
I know you're all working hard.

619
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,300
I'm tired too.

620
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,300
Pretending to be Huaiqing these days,

621
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,860
I even find her a bit cute

622
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,580
after meeting her today.

623
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,100
But the poetry contest is still far off,

624
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
and giving up now

625
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,090
is not an option.

626
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,300
Come on, let's keep going.

627
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,340
Everyone, come on.

628
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,860
Your Highness!

629
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,300
Even so,

630
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,100
if we keep this up,

631
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,860
we might not even make it
to the poetry contest.

632
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,860
Besides,

633
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,260
we've had enough poems.

634
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,540
Why not just

635
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,580
let him go?

636
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,900
No.

637
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,380
If he helped us win this time,

638
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,220
what about next time?

639
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,520
And the time after that?

640
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,420
If Xu Qi'an ends up
siding with Huaiqing again

641
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,020
and writing great poems for her,

642
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,780
won't we just get overshadowed again?

643
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,580
All our efforts would've been
for nothing.

644
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,980
So, Your Highness, are you saying...?

645
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,820
I'm saying

646
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,220
we need to think of a way.

647
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,900
If we're going to act,

648
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,700
we should put an end to it.

649
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,980
Gang,

650
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,220
with your kind face,

651
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,860
how can you

652
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,500
have such a vicious heart?

653
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,500
- No, Your Highness...
- What I meant was

654
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,860
we should recruit him completely.

655
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,820
That way,
even if he discovers my true identity,

656
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,420
he'll still be loyal to me.

657
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,660
But

658
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,140
he's utterly devoted
to the Grand Princess.

659
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,060
So what?

660
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,020
Where there's a will, there's a way.

661
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,420
Everyone

662
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,620
has their weaknesses.

663
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,900
Come, let's continue.

664
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,500
No, no.

665
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,180
Are you mimicking me?

666
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,780
Gang, I saw it!

667
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,340
Where there's a will, there's a way.

668
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,500
Hurry up! Hurry!

669
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,420
(Peace and Prosperity)

670
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,180
I'm exhausted.

671
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,500
At least,

672
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,660
I managed to pry
Lord Wei's preferences from Cijiu,

673
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,380
which allowed me to connect with him.

674
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,820
In the future,

675
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,900
both Lord Wei

676
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,820
and the Grand Princess will protect me.

677
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,340
I'll be untouchable

678
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,860
in the capital of the Dafeng.

679
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,340
(Jinlian, Earth Sect,
4th Rank Yin Spirit)

680
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,340
Calm down.

681
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,780
It's me.

682
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,380
When I last saw you
at the Pitch-pot Stall,

683
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,620
you were only a 9th Rank Fighter
at the Essence Stage.

684
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,180
Now, you've reached the Qi Stage.

685
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,380
You are truly blessed
with great fortune.

686
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,900
Old man,

687
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,860
did you break into my home

688
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,460
just to congratulate me?

689
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,900
I'm here

690
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,900
to tell you something.

691
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,540
The soul of my junior, Zilian,

692
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,220
has already ascended to heaven.

693
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,060
You no longer need to worry about him.

694
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,420
Wait.

695
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,740
Are you here
to take back the Jade Mirror?

696
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,660
That's the No. 9 Mirror my junior held.

697
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,340
I've already reclaimed it.

698
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,140
As for the one you have,

699
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,060
consider it a gift to invite you

700
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,900
to join the Realm Sect.

701
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,740
The Realm Sect?

702
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,100
The Jade Mirror was originally one.

703
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,690
I split it into nine pieces,

704
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,540
connected by secret techniques,

705
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,000
enabling communication between them.

706
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,240
I've gifted them
to seven different individuals,

707
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,660
forming the Realm Sect.

708
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,580
Now, with you,

709
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,660
the Sect is complete.

710
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,580
Old man,

711
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,980
you're overestimating me.

712
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,700
I'm just a rookie Copper Gong
who's just stepped into the Qi Stage.

713
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,100
No need to be modest.

714
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,100
I've said it before

715
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,980
you're someone blessed by fortune.

716
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,180
Please enlighten me.

717
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,060
I've always said

718
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,380
you're a person of great destiny.

719
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
That's why I picked you back then.

720
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,100
However, I can't figure out

721
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,540
the source of this fortune,
no matter how I try.

722
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,860
On that day, though,

723
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,220
the aura of the woman

724
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,540
in the carriage was extraordinary.

725
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,860
She was radiant yet restrained,

726
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,300
a rarity in the world.

727
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,740
If you give her a bracelet,

728
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,980
something will definitely happen
between you two.

729
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,700
So, why hesitate?

730
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,580
Rest assured.

731
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,620
Joining the Realm Sect

732
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:17,420
won't restrict your actions.

733
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,700
Among the eight people

734
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,180
of the Realm Sect, including you,

735
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,500
none are ordinary.

736
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,860
Though you're scattered
across the land now,

737
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,500
the day will come when you all meet.

738
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,700
Why not join early

739
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,460
to form bonds of camaraderie?

740
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,340
It can avoid future conflicts
that could lead

741
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,500
to death or injury.

742
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,780
(If what this old man says is true,)

743
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,020
(and every member of the Sect
is extraordinary,)

744
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,260
(then by mingling with this circle,)

745
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,340
(won't I easily break)

746
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
(into high-level social networks?)

747
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,980
Fine.

748
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,060
I agree to join the Realm Sect.

749
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,700
If you need help in the future,

750
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,660
feel free to use the Jade Mirror
to reach out to me

751
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,060
or to the other members.

752
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,060
If they happen to be in the capital,

753
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,900
they'll surely...

754
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,660
By the way,

755
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,380
mutual aid is

756
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,460
the foundation of the Realm Sect.

757
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,500
Additionally,

758
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,020
mirror holders are addressed
by their mirror numbers.

759
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,380
(No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4,
No. 5, No. 6, No. 7, No. 8).

760
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,300
Is anyone there?

761
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,260
(No. 6, No. 8)

762
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,940
What's wrong?

763
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,540
Contacts should've been restored.

764
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,940
(No. 4)
Everyone, contact has been restored.

765
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,100
No. 3,

766
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,700
I reached out to Taoist Jinlian

767
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,080
through the mirror

768
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,460
and learned the general situation.

769
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,700
Thank you for helping

770
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,860
Mr. Jinlian resolve the crisis.

771
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,300
It was nothing.

772
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,460
No. 6,

773
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,260
thank you for warning me,

774
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,540
or I would've fallen into Zilian's trap.

775
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,940
(No. 2, No. 3)

776
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,780
No need to thank me.

777
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,420
It was just a small favor.

778
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,660
I haven't been keeping up
with mirror messages for a while.

779
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,820
Can someone tell me

780
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,410
what happened?

781
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,980
You must've been busy

782
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,540
(No. 2)
with cultivation, alchemy,

783
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,100
and serving that wicked Emperor.

784
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,220
No. 2, mind your words.

785
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,340
We agreed beforehand

786
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,780
(No. 2)
not to reveal our identities

787
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,540
in front of newcomers.

788
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,180
Oh, please.

789
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,720
When No. 6 joined,

790
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,340
you blurted out my identity right away.

791
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,820
I'm just returning the favor.

792
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,800
(No. 1, No. 2, No. 3)
That was an honest mistake,

793
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,040
but you're doing it on purpose.

794
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,580
(No. 3, No. 4)
Yes, I am.

795
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,160
What are you going to do? Hit me?

796
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,140
No. 3, let me tell you.

797
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,780
No. 4 is Chu Yuanzhen, Chief Disciple
of the Dafeng's Treasure Sect,

798
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,500
and the Saint of Men.

799
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,660
Keep that in mind.

800
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,420
No. 3, let me tell you.

801
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,080
No. 2 is the Winged Woman, Li Miaozhen,

802
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,700
known as the Saintess
of Heaven.

803
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:20,540
Remember this.

804
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,180
She's utterly shameless.

805
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,340
- These two
- You just wait.

806
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,580
must be crazy.

807
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,540
(No. 4)
I'll never let you return alive.

808
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,440
(No. 2)
Bring it on!

809
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,660
I'll surely kill you.

810
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,020
(No. 4)
Winged Woman? I'll clip your wings!

811
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,300
Come on, come and clip them.

812
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,860
- You're nothing!
- Come here then!

813
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,580
So noisy.

814
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,740
(No. 1)
No. 1 has appeared.

815
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,420
I thought you'd only hide
behind the mirror and spy on us.

816
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,940
(No. 1)
With all this noise,

817
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,940
I couldn't keep my peace
even if I wanted to.

818
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,980
Everyone.

819
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,140
Everyone.

820
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,730
(No. 6)

821
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,540
No. 3 has just joined us.

822
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,580
Don't scare him off.

823
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,240
(No. 1)
No. 3,

824
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,100
which yamen in the capital do you serve?

825
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,740
(I'm not like No. 2 and No. 4.)

826
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,580
(Living in the world,)

827
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,420
(of course, I need to hide my identity.)

828
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,580
Serve in a yamen?

829
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,940
The capital's yamens

830
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,700
are nothing more than seats for idlers.

831
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,540
So,

832
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,980
are you a scholar?

833
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,020
No. 3,

834
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,140
though Mr. Jinlian
has allowed you to join us,

835
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,140
(No. 4)
you'll still need to earn our trust.

836
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,900
The Realm Sect has one rule:

837
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,740
What happens today

838
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,780
ends here.

839
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,460
No information here,

840
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,140
(No. 2, No. 3)
including our identities,

841
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,660
can be leaked to outsiders.

842
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
This is our consensus.

843
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,300
Rest assured.

844
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,500
I'm tight-lipped.

845
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,340
By the way, No. 1,

846
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,140
how are things in the capital lately?

847
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,840
Vice Minister Zhou has fallen,

848
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,300
and the political strife has begun.

849
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,550
However, his dismissal

850
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,300
was absurd.

851
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,580
It stemmed from a personal grudge
involving Weiwu Marquis' son,

852
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,870
which eventually exposed

853
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,460
a case of embezzling tax silver.

854
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,980
(I'd better show off a bit)

855
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,540
(to prove my value.)

856
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,180
(No. 1)

857
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,460
That's precisely what happened.

858
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,540
Anything else to discuss?

859
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,380
If not, let's adjourn.

860
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,440
I need to wipe out
mountain bandits tomorrow.

861
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,540
(No. 2, No. 3)
No. 3,

862
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,980
you've been here this long.

863
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,420
Could you share

864
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,740
your name with us?

865
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,580
I live and die

866
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,100
by my name.

867
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,420
I am

868
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,780
