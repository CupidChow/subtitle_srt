190
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
all like to play.

191
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,620
They'll grow up gradually.

192
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,500
Students' grades vary.

193
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,740
Isn't that normal?

194
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,820
Besides,

195
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,380
aren't there some students who lag behind

196
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,540
to make a comeback every year?

197
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,060
I think these two girls are very clever.

198
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,410
If they really work hard,

199
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,500
they won't be worse than anyone.

200
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,940
But in the current situation,

201
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,900
you really should change their seats.

202
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,580
Right?

203
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,850
[Diligently nurturing talented individuals, and the fragrance of peach blossoms fills the world]

206
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,490
Juan.

207
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,740
Rabbit.

208
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,700
Juan.

209
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,740
Rabbit.

210
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,659
Don't leave me.

211
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,580

[Set out for dreams]

213
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,200
only then will I part ways with you.

214

You two...

[Set out for dreams]

216
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,730
Don't be disgusting.

217
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,370
Hurry up!

218
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:08,980
Don't block the traffic.

219
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,580
Hurry up.

[Set out for dreams]

221
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,220
Mr. Xue,

222
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,380
do you really want to break us up?

223
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,420
You know

224
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,370
I can talk

225
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,860
to anyone wherever I sit.

226
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,210
Why do you have to

[Set out for dreams]

228
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,810
disrupt the whole class arrangement for me?

229
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,460
Move first.

230
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,180
Hurry up.

231

[I have nothing to say. Suit yourself. Graceful. Elegant. Mature.]

237
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,340
Xue.

238
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,460
You win.

239
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,980
Hello, Yin Zihan.

240
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,090
Is it so unfair for you to be seated

241
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,260
next to the last place student?

242
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,980
No matter who I sit with as a desk partner,

243
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,180
it won't affect me from getting the first place in the exam.

244
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,810
Then why are you sighing?

245
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,580
Without Ling Chao in this grade,

246
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,180
what's the use of my ranking?

247
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,020
Is Ling Chao that important?

248
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,980
In the fifth grade elementary school math competition,

249
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,420
Ling Chao came in first, and I came in second.

250
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,940
In the English competition in the first grade of junior high,

251
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,660
Ling Chao came in first, and I came in second.

252
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,170
In the city-wide middle school composition competition,

253
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,940
Ling Chao came in first, and I came in second.

254
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,620
Yin Zihan.

255
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
Do you hold grudges like this?

256
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,900
Don't be sad.

257
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,220
I don't think Ling Chao is that good.

258
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,820
He is just

259
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,100
an ordinary test machine.

260
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,740
Maybe

261
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,340
he’s not as good as you in PE.

262
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,060
He won the MVP award in a basketball tournament

263
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,580
when he was in middle school.

264
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,420
I think ranking and honor

265
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,780
are nothing.

266
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,940
You're already excellent.

267
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,340
Why do you have to compete with Ling Chao?

268
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,860
This is my dream.

269
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,340
It's engraved into

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,740
What de...? What acid?

272
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,060
It's useless to tell you.

273
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,980
It's better to solve more questions.

274
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,420
You have to hurry up.

275
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,140
The world is coming to an end.

I look forward to studying with you.

285
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,220

What's wrong?

290
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,020
Ling Chao, I don't want to die yet.

291
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,460
I just dreamed about the end of the world.

292
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,780
Many monsters came to catch us.

293
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,940
They ate us humans one by one,

294
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,820
very swiftly.

295
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,580
Ultraman, Monkey King, Superman

296
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,740
all came to save us.

297
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,380
But you were still captured.

298
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,220
I wanted to ask for help.

299
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,340
But...

300
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,140
But I don't know

301
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,900
what the name of the Ultraman closest to me is.

302
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,180
I only know Tiga.

303
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,570
After that, that monster found me too.

304
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,820
And it came to catch me, too.

305
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,380
I don't know if the world will end.

306
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,460
I only know

307
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,340
you have three hours left.

Don't you have any regrets?

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,850
No.

317
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,620
it's to get a good night's sleep.

The world won't end.

323
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,940
It can only be said that the earth

324
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,860
has entered a new solar calendar.

325
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,020
It's said that the Mayans

326
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,500
had a different way

of calculating dates than us.

328
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,860
According to the calculation of the Mayans,

329
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,940
December 21st

330
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,260
is the beginning of a big loop.

331
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,540
It's not that this world will be destroyed.

332
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,180
Do you understand what I'm saying?

333
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,820
Are you still scared?

334
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,420

00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,780
This show is so lame.

Rabbit.

340
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,940
I bought you a T-shirt.

341
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,820
It's very cute.

342
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,850
-There's a rabbit pattern.
-Thank you.

343
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,340

344
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,540

345
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,540
You're lucky.

Let's wear it together.

349
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,980
We don't wish to be born on the same day,

350
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,130
but to die on the same day.

351
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,980
No.

352
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,980
Childish.

353
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,820
The rabbit is so cute.

354
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,060
How can it be childish?

355
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,580
Let's wear it together.

356
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,980
No, it's too sissy.

357
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,700
Forget it.

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,300
You want to wear it with me?

361
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,140
My mom gave the wrong one.

362
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,700
You're in high school.

363
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
You still wear this?

364
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,340
But there's nothing surprising about it.

365
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,130
Do you have a problem?

366
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,460
This novel is so touching.

367
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,500
In the face of unwavering love,

368
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,500
everything else doesn't matter.

369
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
Do you have something to wipe with?

370
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,940
No.

371
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,500
I mean tissues.

372
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,050
Forget it.

373
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,820
Why would a boy carry tissues with you?

374
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,140
I asked too much from you.

375
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,180
