1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,870
Ling Chao.

3
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,710
Is this your dad's car?

4
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,070
It's so classy.

5
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,750
Your dad is really capable.

6
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,990
He quit a stable job

7
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,710
suddenly.

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,950
He went to another place alone to make a fortune.

9
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,030
He even returns home in glory after making money.

10
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,270
Mrs. Ling

11
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,990
is really lucky.

12
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,190
Her husband is so daring.

13
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,350
Her son is so outstanding.

14
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,030
I have something to do. I have to go.

15
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,750
Ling Chao,

16
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,070
Isn't your home here?

17
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,630
Coming.

18
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,229
Let me.

19
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,270
I'll open the door.

20
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,710
Make yourself at home.

21
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,590
Don't be polite.

22
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,470
Come in.

23
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,590
Sorry for any inconvenience.

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,630
-Help yourself.
-Eat more.

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,550
Eat.

26
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,950
Why didn't you tell me you would come?

27
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,750
Tell you?

28
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,070
Do I have to make an appointment when I come to your house?

29
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,750
That's not what I meant.

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,510
Then what do you mean?

31
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,829
You've invited so many classmates. Why didn't you invite me?

32
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,430
There are too many people here.

33
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,870
We don't have enough slippers.

34
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,190
Where are my slippers?

35
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,110
Do godparents know you are so unrestrained at home?

36
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,510
They went shopping.

37
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,670
They won't be back until tonight.

38
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,829
Juan.

39
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,550
Ling Chao.

40
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,310
The sofa is too crowded.

41
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,750
Ling Chao, you are tall.

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,310
Change seats with Jia Siwen.

43
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,830
I'm about the same height as Ling Chao.

44
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,910
We don't need to change.

45
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,550
Well.

46
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:09,550
Yin Zihan.

47
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,630
Let's change seats with them.

48
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,390
Sure.

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,230
No.

50
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,110
Well,

51
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,910
I've already made my seat warm.

52
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,390
I don't want to leave.

53
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,550
You can make another seat warm.

54
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,670
Come on.

55
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,910
Come closer.

56
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,829
There's extra space here.

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,510
It's rare for us to gather here.

58
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,310
How about we play Truth or Dare?

59
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,110
Okay.

60
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,710
I don't know how.

61
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,030
There's always a first time. I'll guide you.

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,950
Come on.

63
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,270
Come on.

64
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,550
Let me show you.

65
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,310
I want Truth.

66
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,430
Who wants to hear your truth?

67
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,150
You must choose Dare.

68
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,830
Dare.

69
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,310
Let's do it.

70
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,790
Well,

71
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,190
you sing a love song with Ling Chao.

72
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,190
I don't know how.

73
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,630
Neither can I.

74
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,470
Honey.

75
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,829
You will never get hurt.

76
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,670
Honey.

77
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,550
You will never get hurt.

78
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,750
Don't. Alright.

79
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,870
Just one line?

80
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,390
One more round.

81
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,030
OK.

82
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,750
-Then I also...
-No.

83
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,350
I don't want to hear the truth either.

84
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,990
I want your to choose Dare.

85
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,310
OK.

86
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,550
Just stare at one of the boys in the room for ten seconds.

87
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,870
Come on, you.

88
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,390
Come on.

89
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,550
I'll start now.

90
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,430
Come on.

91
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,030
Ten.

92
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,510
Nine.

93
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,910
Eight.

94
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,470
Seven.

95
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,590
Six.

96
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,510
Five.

97
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,430
Four.

98
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,230
Three.

99
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,390
Two point five.

100
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,190
One.

101
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,870
Juan.

102
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,350
Do you want to kill me?

103
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,150
With your tricks,

104
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,470
you could at most become a maid in the laundry department in a palace intrigue drama.

105
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,670
I'll give you a chance. You do it.

106
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,830
OK.

107
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,430
Truth or Dare?

108
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,870
Truth.

109
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,630
Rabbit.

110
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,670
You ask.

111
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,110
Ask something exciting.

112
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,390
Three.

113
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,510
Two.

114
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,750
Wait.

115
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,710
What's your favorite food?

116
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,750
What a boring question.

117
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,470
Well.

118
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,870
There're no secrets

119
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,070
-between Ling Chao and me.
-Chocolate.

120
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,790
Don't you like sweets?

121
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,350
This is the second question.

122
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,030
You have a secret.

123
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,510
When did you start loving to eat chocolate?

124
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,950
Rabbit.

125
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,110
It doesn't matter.

126
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,909
Go on.

127
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:34,710
OK? Go on.

128
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,710
I want to sing a love song.

129
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,590
The most beautiful...

130
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,350
Who asked you to sing a love song?

131
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,030
Truth.

132
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,830
Yin Zihan.

133
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,750
What secrets do you have?

134
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,230
It's time for you to confess.

135
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,710
Xiao Tu.

136
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,870
In fact, there was a period of time

137
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,230
when I kept following you and Ling Chao.

138
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,190
I know.

139
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,550
It's the car following us.

140
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,830
Don't be shy.

141
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,950
I understand.

142
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,950
You just finished school?

143
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,230
What a coincidence.

144
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,710
I was about to visit you.

145
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,550
Stop pretending.

146
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,910
You've been following me for so many days.

147
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,910
What do you want?

148
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,630
Well, you...

149
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,030
You misunderstood. I...

150
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,430
I was just passing by today. I...

151
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,270
Is it fun?

152
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,070
Don’t disturb our life.

153
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,230
Chao, I...

154
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,550
I wanted to investigate something before.

155
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,470
But it doesn't matter now.

156
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,870
I will try my best

157
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,590
to get what I want.

158
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,230
Xiao Tu.

159
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,230
I'm really happy

160
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,990
to be friends with you.

161
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,070
Me too.

162
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,590
Jia Siwen, spin it.

163
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,710
One, two, three.

164
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,630
I want to sing a love song.

165
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:14,430
From now on,

166
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,630
don't dance too much.

167
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,070
How is that possible?

168
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,270
I dance so well.

169
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,510
Honey.

170
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,630
Ling Chao,

171
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,950
Juan's house is too far away.

172
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,190
It's getting dark.

173
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,390
Send her home.

174
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,750
Who will send me back?

175
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,750
No need.

176
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,350
We are on the same way.

177
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,630
I can send her home.

178
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,470
What's wrong with him?

179
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,549
I don't know.

180
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,990
Maybe he was upset because we pulled out his leg hair just now.

181
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,510
Definitely.

182
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,270
You pulled the most out just now.

183
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,110
I...

184
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,470
He's unhappy about that.

185
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,670
Bye.

186
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,350
Bye.

187
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,390
Bye.

188
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,270
Yin Zihan, come often.

189
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,310
Why don't you ask Jiang Juanjuan to come often?

190
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,710
She came uninvited.

191
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,110
Do I need to say anything?

192
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,510
You too. Come often.

193
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,350
I'm leaving.

194
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,470
You went out to play?

195
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,870
I went to Xiao Tu’s home.

196
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,390
Well,

197
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,030
how are you recently?

198
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,390
I'm fine.

199
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,390
What about you?

200
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,990
I'm fine. Everythig is fine.

201
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,990
Go upstairs.

202
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,230
Your mom is cooking.

203
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,870
Okay.

204
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,750
Zheng.

205
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,670
You don't have to come in. I'll be out soon.

206
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,790
Yes, we'll go straight to the venue.

207
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,510
Hurry up if you didn't hand in the form.

208
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,790
I'll hand it over to the teacher later.

209
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,270
Help me check

210
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,910
whether Zhang Danian chose liberal arts or science.

211
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,310
Does it affect you?

212
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,670
Of course.

213
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,870
Except him,

214
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,510
who else can compete with me?

215
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,070
You're humiliating Zhang Danian.

216
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,590
Let me see.

217
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,470
Let me...

218
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,390
What are you doing?

219
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,590
Juan,

220
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,270
help me take him down.

221
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,710
Consort Rabbit and Consort Jia,

222
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,630
both of you are my favorite.

223
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,350
Thirty.

224
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,550
My family.

225
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,950
Are you going to choose science?

226
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,550
Yes.

227
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,510
After all, two tigers cannot share the same mountain.

228
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,910
-If the two of us were in the same class,
-Come closer.

229
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,150
it would only result in both of us being worse off.

230
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,550
Listen.

231
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,910
Everyone in the class is saying that...

232
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,710
-I'll miss you.
-Yin Zihan and Xiao Tu

233
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,510
-You can eat whatever you want,
-are not just friends.

234
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,710
but don't talk nonsense.

235
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,150
I'm afraid Yin Zihan would hit me.

236
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,070
What does it have to do with him?

237
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,950
I think Yin Zihan is a little weird.

238
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,590
But I'm not sure.

239
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,750
Jiang Juanjuan.

240
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,670
Was it you who spread rumors?

241
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,870
No.

242
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,790
I didn't.

243
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,430
It's true.

244
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,070
Mr. Xue, our class's subject division forms.

245
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,710
Okay.

246
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,150
I’m leaving.

247
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,750
Go ahead.

248
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,510
Jia Siwen.

249
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,950
After class is divided,

250
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,950
I will still be

251
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,510
the head teacher of Class 4.

252
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,870
I’m glad that you chose liberal arts.

253
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,790
In this way, we can spend

254
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,550
two extra happy years together.

255
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,630
But have you discussed with your parents

256
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,190
about which subject you would choose?

257
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,310
The college entrance exam is the first obstacle in life.

258
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,470
If you get over it, you will be smooth sailing.

259
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,750
But before you start,

260
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,230
you must think carefully

261
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,190
whether to go left or right.

262
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,750
Based on your condition,

263
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,110
I suggest

264
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,870
you should go back and think twice about it.

265
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,510
Although it's your life,

266
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,230
this is an important decision.

267
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,270
I think you should

268
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,790
discuss it with your parents.

269
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,750
How about this?

270
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,630
I'll give you one more day.

271
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,710
Go back and think about it.

272
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,710
Okay, I got it.

273
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,990
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

274
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,630
You're welcome.

275
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,990
Jia Siwen.

276
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,590
You didn't choose liberal arts

277
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,030
because

278
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,790
you can't bear to leave me, did you?

279
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,310
What a charm.

280
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,230
What are you doing?

281
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,310
Why are you hiding there silently?

282
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,150
You scared me.

283
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,030
I made a sound and you were still scared?

284
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
What are you doing?

285
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,190
My house is too dangerous lately.

286
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,110
I'm here to find a safe home for my idols.

287
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,670
Keep it a secret for me.

288
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,230
What are you doing here?

289
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,910
You chose liberal arts.

290
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,230
But Xue doesn't allow, right?

291
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,310
Mr. Xue asked me to think twice about it.

292
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,950
If I were Xue, I would also ask you to think twice about it.

293
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,070
After all, you have good grades.

294
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,750
You'll have more advantage in college entrance exam if you study science.

295
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,830
But I'm not Xue.

296
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,390
I’m your deskmate.

297
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,750
You like liberal arts so much.

298
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,910
You buy Geography World every week.

299
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,910
If you study science,

300
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,750
you would be so depressed.

301
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,590
You just said...

302
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,350
It's not like only studying science

303
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,990
can lead to getting into good universities.

304
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,190
You are just indecisive because you have too many choices.

305
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,630
For me,

306
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,070
I don't even have a chance to choose

307
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,990
since my science grades are so poor.

308
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,350
With such good qualifications,

309
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,990
of course you can choose the one you like.

310
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,230
What if I choose the wrong one?

311
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,350
Before you choose,

312
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,990
how do you know you were wrong?

313
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,390
Besides,

314
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,030
there are so few female students in science and engineering universities.

315
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,670
How can you compete with others

316
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,750
since you're such a passive guy?

317
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,830
By then, you won't even have a girlfriend...

318
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,110
Did I hurt him?

319
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,670
Mr. Xue.

320
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,470
Mr. Xue, I've figured it out.

321
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,750
I like liberal arts.

322
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,670
I'll choose liberal arts.

323
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,790
-Well...
-Mr. Xue, don't worry.

324
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,510
My parents will agree to my choice.

325
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,390
-I...
-Mr. Xue.

326
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,430
Goodbye.

327
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,590
Is it so happy to be my student?

328
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,310
Look at the time. Why are you still sleeping?

329
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,350
Get up.

330
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,350
Let me sleep for five more minutes.

331
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,990
More?

332
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,710
Hurry up and do your homework.

333
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,590
Going to school is so tough.

334
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,110
It's the weekend. Just let her sleep.

335
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,550
Don't bother her.

336
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,510
Mr. Xiao.

337
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,550
She's here for you.

338
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,830
Mrs. Xu.

339
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,630
Mrs. Xiao.

340
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,710
What makes you so happy?

341
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,990
Come in and sit down.

342
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,990
No, thanks.

343
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,630
I have to go somewhere else.

344
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,750
It’s not a big deal.

345
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,350
My Linglong

346
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,590
took part in a national dance competition

347
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,070
and won the gold award.

348
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,830
That's a great thing.

349
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,910
These are the celebration sweets.

350
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,790
Thank you.

351
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,470
I heard that many great directors

352
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,830
are watching this competition.

353
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,150
If some director discovers her,

354
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,790
maybe she can be a star.

355
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,950
Your Linglong

356
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,030
has a star face since childhood.

357
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,110
You're lucky.

358
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,710
Congratulations, Mom of a Star.

359
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,270
I'm just saying.

360
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,030
I don't expect her to be a superstar.

361
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,550
But after winning this award,

362
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,750
she has a fifty percent chance of getting into

363
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,350
the Dance Department at Yunhai University.

364
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,750
She can get special recruitment for college entrance exam?

365
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,270
Of course.

366
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,869
We can't help it.

367
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:10,910
The kid has to go to college anyway.

368
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,390
I couldn't make Linglong

369
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,710
be born intelligent.

370
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,630
I can only go other ways.

371
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,950
You can also inquire for Xiao Tu.

372
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,829
Okay.

373
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,829
I'll stop here.

374
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,869
I have to send the celebration sweets.

375
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,390
OK.

376
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,150
-I’m leaving.
-Bye, Mrs. Xu.

377
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,270
I'll go.

378
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,350
Come in.

379
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,670
Are you not feeling well?

380
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,310
I'm fine.

381
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,710
We're waiting for you to eat.

382
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,870
I'm hungry. Have a seat.

383
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,870
It's the weekend.

384
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,710
It's not easy for your dad to come here.

385
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,670
It's all my fault.

386
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,430
I've been too busy lately.

387
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,550
I didn't have time to have dinner with you.

388
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,150
Chao.

389
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,790
I bought you some fruits.

390
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,790
I remember when you were young,

391
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,430
you loved cherries the most.

392
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,510
My classmate asked me out.

393
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,990
I can't break the appointment.

394
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,630
Chao.

395
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,150
I'm leaving.

396
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,350
Are you really okay?

397
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,110
Have some soup to warm your stomach.

398
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,270
I'm fine.

399
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,070
Xiao Tu.

400
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,310
Look at Ling Chao.

401
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,150
Look at Xu Linglong.

402
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,750
One is good at studying,

403
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,110
and the other is talented.

404
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,110
Think about it.

405
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,510
What do you have?

406
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,310
Even if you are

407
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,390
good at nothing,

408
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,990
as long as you have a dream,

409
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,550
even if this dream is far away from you,

410
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:01,470
we will do our best to support you.

411
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,270
But do you?

412
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,950
Do you want to live like this forever?

413
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,190
Right.

414
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,510
What is my dream?

415
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,830
Well...

416
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,310
Xiao Tu is a freshman.

417
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,670
She still has time to think.

418
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,670
Don't force her.

419
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,870
I force her?

420
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,750
They are going to divide classes soon.

421
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,230
If she chooses liberal arts,

422
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,870
she can only apply for liberal arts majors

423
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,990
when taking the college entrance examination.

424
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,950
Xiao Haishan.

425
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,070
Can you stop pretending to be the good cop?

426
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,390
If she can't even go to college,

427
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,670
she will blame us

428
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,590
for not giving her a good push today.

429
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,870
What you said is so harsh.

430
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,950
Why did you say I'm pretending to be a good cop?

431
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,070
Am I wrong?

432
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,870
Tell me.

433
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,150
Can you make big money or something?

434
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,270
I can't.

435
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,030
I didn't let you two

436
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,150
-live a good life.
-What is

437
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,030
-I'll run away from home, okay?
-my dream?

438
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,430
Sure. Go.

439
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,910
Go away!

440
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,990
Fine.

441
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,230
You old hag!

442
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,270
Why don't you understand?

443
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,950
The child will grow up and eventually leave home.

444
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,750
I'm the one who'll push your wheelchair in the future.

445
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,830
Godfather.

446
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,430
Are you here for a walk too?

447
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,070
Yes.

448
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:40,670
Yes.

449
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,070
How's your study?

450
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,310
Not bad.

451
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,510
Forget it.

452
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,470
Cotton candy.

453
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,990
Cotton candy.

454
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,950
It's the weekend.

455
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,270
We should find a place to play.

456
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,070
There are so many fun places for adults to enjoy,

457
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,990
but you underage kids can't go to them.

458
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,670
What a pity.

459
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,710
You can't understand

460
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,670
the happiness of adults.

461
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,590
What is a place for adults?

462
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:43,070
How about this?

463
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,430
I'll take you to a place.

464
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,310
It's so exciting.

465
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,070
How exciting?

466
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,390
You'll know when you get there.

467
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,990
It will make your heart beat faster.

468
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,070
It's really exciting.

469
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,110
Godfather,

470
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,550
do you come here often?

471
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,910
Why are you upset?

472
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,550
I'm not in the mood today.

473
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:12,550
Godfather.

474
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,150
Come and see how much I win.

475
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,830
What are you so proud of?

476
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,230
No matter how much you win,

477
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,430
I bought the lottery.

478
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,190
Scratch cards themselves

479
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,470
are a game of life's gamble.

480
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,710
Some make a big deal out of small,

481
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,190
but some will lose everything.

482
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,430
As long as you calm down,

483
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,950
you won't go wrong.

484
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,990
I have to remember that.

485
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,150
I may use it when arguing in the future.

486
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,510
Take me for example.

487
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,390
Although I failed for most of the times,

488
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,670
have I become disheartened?

489
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,550
Did I give up?

490
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,870
Am I confused?

491
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,430
The last one.

492
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,150
Still failed.

493
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:54,950
It's okay, Godfather.

494
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,190
I've already won seven to eight hundred.

495
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,190
How about

496
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,470
we go somewhere else?

497
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,350
Where do you young people usually go

498
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,830
to kill time?

499
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,630
Show me.

500
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,310
ID card.

501
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,590
We just captured a few demons.

502
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,990
We also subdued a few monsters.

503
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:28,910
For two.

504
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,670
Twenty yuan.

505
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:34,950
Let's go, Godfather.

506
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,510
He asked for the ID card.

507
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,470
So elastic.

508
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,310
It's amazing.

509
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,110
Yes.

510
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,030
It's milky white.

511
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:56,190
It's such a good website.

512
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,790
You...

513
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,110
How could you keep it a secret?

514
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,390
Xiao Tu told me this.

515
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,430
Xiao Tu?

516
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,870
What a coincidence.

517
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,430
We have the same taste. I didn't expect that.

518
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,550
Right?

519
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,790
You know each other?

520
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,350
We met two days ago.

521
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,110
I didn't have lunch before I went out.

522
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,510
Me either.

523
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,350
How about

524
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,550
we go back for dinner?

525
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,110
Didn't you say Ling Bo would come to your house to eat

526
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,710
this weekend?

527
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,030
Did he come or not?

528
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,910
It's all because of Ling Chao.

529
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,590
He always avoids his dad.

530
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,550
Besides, Ling Bo is busy.

531
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,550
The secretary is here.

532
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,390
The place is small.

533
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,390
Let them finish their work first.

534
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,110
Xiao Tu

535
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,870
really worried me.

536
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,070
When will they two

537
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,630
be able to reconcile?

538
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,630
What should we do

539
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,110
if she can't go to college?

540
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,150
It's so difficult for me to be caught in between

541
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,950
the two of them.

542
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,070
Well.

543
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:25,950
Sir.

544
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,230
Where have you been?

545
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,710
Well, I...

546
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,990
What?

547
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:32,630
On weekends,

548
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,790
you always play cards or watch TV.

549
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,470
Have you ever worried about this family,

550
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,310
Xiao Haishan?

551
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,030
What's in your bag?

552
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,750
Alright, stop talking.

553
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,190
Go wash your hands.

554
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,510
Could you please set the dishes and chopsticks?

555
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,990
I'm going back.

556
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,110
Aren't you eating at my home, Wenhui?

557
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,990
I'm not eating.

558
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,630
Okay.

559
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,270
-Bye.
-Let's get ready for dinner.

560
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,830
Why are you still standing here?

561
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,390
I asked you to wash your hands.

562
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,630
Why is there no response?

563
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,070
Can you do it or not?

564
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,030
Don't break it.

565
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,150
Let me take another look.

566
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,870
I didn't open the cap just now.

567
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,190
Alright.

568
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,390
What was I going to ask?

569
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:35,390
His dream.

570
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,830
What was your childhood dream?

571
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,550
My childhood dream

572
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,470
was to have endless pancakes to eat.

573
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,550
So I opened this pancake stall.

574
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,670
What's your dream now?

575
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:55,590
My dream now is to open a pancake shop

576
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,190
in front of your school.

577
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,390
What's your dream?

578
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,270
My dream is to marry Junhui.

579
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,470
But tomorrow it may not be the same.

580
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,350
I was asking about your dreams,

581
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,470
not asking you to daydream.

582
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,630
I'll set a small goal then.

583
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,470
I'll become an entertainment reporter

584
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,430
and learn from more idols.

585
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,630
Jia Siwen.

586
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,870
Jia Siwen.

587
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,070
Has his period not ended yet?

588
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,990
Don't record him.

589
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,350
What are you shooting?

590
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,270
Let me sing you a song.

591
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,790
-The boundless distant horizon...
-I still want to eat.

592
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,430
Don't grab it with your hands.

593
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,430
Let me dance for you

594
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,110
to show you my latest learning results.

595
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,830
You're not as good as me.

596
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,470
Look.

597
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,590
Can you do this?

598
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,630
Xu Linglong, do you have a pencil?

599
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,310
Lend it to me.

600
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,110
Let me see.

601
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,830
This one.

602
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,910
Your answer won't have much reference value,

603
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,150
but what is your dream?

604
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,310
My dream is to be a superstar.

605
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,910
You just rolled your eyes.

606
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,470
If you really become a superstar,

607
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,710
this will be your dark history.

608
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,150
My eyelashes fell into my eyes.

609
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,110
Mr. Xue,

610
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,670
what's your dream?

611
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,830
Me?

612
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,070
My childhood dream has come true.

613
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,470
I wanted to be a teacher.

614
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,950
As for my dream now...

615
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,710
Will this part be aired?

616
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,150
Delete it for me.

617
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,270
You...

618
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,590
Senior.

619
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,270
What is your dream?

620
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,430
My dream is

621
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,270
to go to Qingbei University, of course.

622
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,110
Lan.

623
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,910
What is your dream?

624
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,750
I haven't decided yet.

625
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,630
Have you and Ling Chao decided?

626
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,190
What about your dream?

627
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,830
Is dream important?

628
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,150
Yes.

629
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,470
For me,

630
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,590
I can achieve anything

631
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,590
I want to do.

632
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,830
So the next thing I want to do

633
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,830
is my dream.

634
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,310
As for you,

635
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,750
I think you are quite good at this.

636
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,350
Why don't you be a reporter?

637
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,270
Why did you bring the DV to school?

638
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,190
I'm doing something meaningful.

639
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,190
I'm asking everyone's dream.

640
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,230
Principal,

641
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,110
what was your childhood dream?

642
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,590
My childhood dream...

643
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,310
It's ringing.

644
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,750
Go back to your class.

645
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,310
Which class are you in? Stop!

646
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,790
You got the first place in the competition.

647
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,150
The training is over.

648
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,110
You have nowhere to go at night.

649
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,510
So you always come to my house, right?

650
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,710
It's too hot outside.

651
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,070
There are mosquitoes at night.

652
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,950
But I'm sleepy.

653
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,470
You are here, how can I sleep?

654
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,030
Just wait a little longer.

655
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,470
It should be soon.

656
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,990
You have been spending so much time with Godfather.

657
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,470
I bet you're immune by just watching at him.

658
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:18,630
I still don't know how to get along with him.

659
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,350
You are so contradictory.

660
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,590
The more you avoid, the more it shows that you care.

661
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,470
Since you care,

662
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,910
why are you running away?

663
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,230
The person who should apologize, apologizes;

664
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,390
the person who should get angry, gets angry.

665
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,430
If you keep being like this,

666
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,830
there will never be a result.

667
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,230
You'll only make things difficult for Godmother.

668
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,790
You're already so good?

669
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,030
You can actually say such high-level words?

670
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,630
Watching TV shows is not a waste of time.

671
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,990
I understand family ethics very well.

672
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,150
Go to sleep.

673
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,070
I'm leaving.

674
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,710
You've been home late recently.

675
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,910
Sometimes.

676
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,070
You...

677
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,110
Pay more attention to your mother.

678
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,950
Go home early when you're free.

679
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,750
Well,

680
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,710
I won't go upstairs.

681
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,710
Take this up.

682
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,910
Like all teenagers,

683
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,670
I, at the age of sixteen or seventeen,

684
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,990
-easily immerse myself 
-Ling Chao.

685
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,750
in my own sadness and confusion.

686
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,670
Because of this self-esteem...

687
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,590
I'll go.

688
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,310
I ignored my mom's feelings.

689
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,310
Are you not feeling well?

690
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:24,030
I always envy Xiao Tu for being carefree.

691
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,590
But she always sees me so thoroughly.

692
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,430
The person who should apologize, apologizes;

693
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,710
the person who should get angry, gets angry.

694
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,750
If you keep being like this,

695
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,110
there will never be a result.

696
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,550
You'll only make things difficult for Godmother.

697
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:35,630
She even

698
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,350
knows what I should do better than myself.

699
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
At this moment,

700
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,430
I want to be Xiao Tu

701
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,870
so that I have the courage not to run away anymore.

702
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,430
Let's go up together.

703
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,870
You have a secret.

704
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,430
When did you start loving to eat chocolate?

705
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,430
Rabbit.

706
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,670
I don't want to. I won't leave.

707
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,270
Stop eating. Look at your mouth.

708
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,190
Are you not leaving?

709
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,510
Then you stay here alone.

710
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,150
I'll leave.

711
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,150
Don't scold him.

712
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:49,230
Wenhui.

713
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,430
You hold hands with him.

714
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,070
Wait for me here.

715
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,470
Don't run around, you hear me?

716
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,390
Okay, good girl.

717
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,510
Wenhui!

718
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,870
Why won't you go to kindergarten?

719
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,590
Dad used to take me to kindergarten.

720
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,190
Don't be afraid. I'll hold your hand.

721
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,030
Mom told us to hold hands.

722
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,469
Don't cry.

723
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,350
Is it good?

724
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,750
Yes.
