1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,350
The meal is ready.

3
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,840
You finally got up.

4
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,150
I don't think you two cook very often.

5
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,150
The pot is too thin.

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,950
The fire is too strong.

7
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,680
The knife is too blunt.

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,150
The seasoning is almost expired.

9
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,070
Nothing useful.

10
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,230
Just make do with it.

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,310
You are acting like my mom.

12
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,950
How can you ask a guest to cook?

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,789
I didn't ask him to come.

14
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:32,789
I wanted to come.

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,759
It's because

16
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,710
someone brazenly said he would treat me to home-cooked dishes.

17
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,000
But now,

18
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,950
I bought the ingredients.

19
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,120
I cooked the meal.

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,590
And someone wouldn't get up.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,759
I don't know what he wanted to treat me to.

22
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,070
Take-away food

23
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,590
from a home-made dish restaurant.

24
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,070
Xiao Tu.

25
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,400
This is the foot of a singer-dancer.

26
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,920
Sorry. Sorry.

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
You guys eat first.

28
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,750
I have something to deal with.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,310
After so many years,

30
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,630
Ling Chao is still the same.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
He is still as annoying as before.

32
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,870
But you seem to have grown up.

33
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,710
You are maturer.

34
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,870
Really?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,870
You seem to have aged.

36
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,910
No way.

37
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,240
I'm still handsome.

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,520
I didn't expect you to be a star

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
considering your previous dance level.

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,750
That was all because of you.

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,079
If it

42
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,280
weren't for you,

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,750
I might never take this step.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,630
So, theoretically,

45
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,360
you changed my life.

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,870
Yin... Yin Zihan.

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,910
Do you like me?

48
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,030
You think too much.

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,470
Did Jiang Juanjuan ask you

50
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,400
to read weird romance novels again?

51
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,030
But in the TV program yesterday...

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,870
There must have been a girl you had a crush on.

53
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,590
Your fans are curious about your ideal type.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,560
My ideal type. She's actually very ordinary.

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,310
But

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,190
she was also the first person

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,750
to support me on the stage.

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,750
It was for my public persona.

59
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,560
If I didn't say that,

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,520
wouldn't it seem that I have no stories?

61
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,680
Besides,

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,870
I'm an idol now.

63
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,630
An idol can't date anyone.

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,190
They have to be single.

65
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,870
Really?

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,310
An innocent person like you

67
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,280
shouldn't be a fangirl.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,680
You'll get hurt if you're too sincere.

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Scumbag.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,310
Alright, don't see me off.

71
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,870
I don't like this.

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,120
We'll all feel uncomfortable.

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,240
I don't know when we'll meet again.

74
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,920
Yeah.

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
I didn't plan to see you off.

76
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,630
She needs to go back with me.

77
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,270
Do you think you are awesome because you're in a relationship?

78
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,630
Yes.

79
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,560
In terms of relationships,

80
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,159
you win.

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,630
Real men should

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
be compared in terms of the career.

83
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,000
We're not in the same industry.

84
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,310
What's there to compare?

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,750
I'll get more endorsements.

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,430
I'll endorse whatever you buy.

87
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,560
My posters will be all over the streets.

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,390
If you turn on the TV, you'll see my face too.

89
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,390
I'll make you annoyed like that.

90
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,480
Alright.

91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,190
Honey,

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,830
can we not buy a TV in our house?

93
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,560
Really?

94
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,920
Your wife works at a TV station.

95
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,950
And you don't let her watch TV?

96
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,510
So you know

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,190
she is my wife.

98
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,750
Enough.

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,950
You'll miss your flight if you don't leave now.

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,390
Ling Chao, I'll be back.

101
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,510
Bye.

102
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,270
Bye.

103
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,870
Honey.

104
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,040
What's wrong?

105
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,510
I'm on the trending topic.

106
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,750
I was there too.

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
Why did they remove me?

108
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,630
Am I not worth mentioning?

109
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,630
They used "seeing a pretty girl" in previous reports.

110
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,920
But in this report, they used "a girl".

111
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,600
Am I nobody?

112
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,270
Hello. Yin Zihan.

113
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,750
We're on the trending topic.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,070
I saw it.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,830
These unscrupulous media.

116
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,560
I'll ask Jiang Juanjuan

117
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,159
to write reports for me from now on.

118
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,430
Wait.

119
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,120
Sister.

120
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,360
Can we not remove the trending topic now?

121
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,800
Is this the girl whose program

122
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
you insisted on going to?

123
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,680
I knew there must be a reason

124
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,070
why you wanted to go to that interview.

125
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,270
It's great to be on the trending topic.

126
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,360
It's good.

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm saving money for the company.

128
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,360
I think you're just doing this for yourself.

129
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,560
Look.

130
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,270
The photo is good.

131
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,240
So romantic.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,870
I think

133
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,270
a producer will ask me to film soon.

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't contact him too often in the future.

135
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,630
I only see him once in a few years.

136
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,630
Don't chat with him.

137
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,270
Why?

138
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,000
Understand?

139
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,720
What is this?

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,800
You still don't understand?

141
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,720
I will make you understand today.

142
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,870
Close your eyes.

143
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,960
Time for class.

144
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,630
Should I get up

145
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,030
or pretend to sleep?

146
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,550
Don't go.

147
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,240
Get some more sleep.

148
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,630
Aren't you hungry?

149
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,320
I'm hungry.

150
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,790
But I don't want breakfast.

151
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,270
I want to eat...

152
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,080
Please don't do this.

153
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,510
What?

154
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,750
Well, I...

155
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,480
I'm thinking what to wear today.

156
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,240
I made an appointment with Jiang Juanjuan

157
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,030
to go shopping this afternoon.

158
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,550
No need to think.

159
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
You only have one suit of clothes.

160
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,720
It got dirty last night.

161
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,270
You'd better not wear it.

162
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,960
Then how do I go out today?

163
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,630
Then don't go out.

164
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,630
But Jiang Juanjuan...

165
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,390
Someone will take care of Jiang Juanjuan.

166
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,240
As for you,

167
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,870
you have plenty of time to think

168
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,510
about what you want.

169
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,670
Hi.

170
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,600
I'm here. Sorry, I'm late.

171
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,030
One more chair.

172
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,510
I thought this is a party of our dorm, right?

173
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,750
I don't think he is one of us

174
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,750
in Room 404.

175
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
He has legs.

176
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,390
It's out of my control.

177
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,630
You have to tell us if you take your boyfriend.

178
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,080
We are all alone.

179
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,840
I'm sorry for being here without telling you.

180
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,030
It's my treat today,

181
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,480
as a celebration of your graduation.

182
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,790
That's more like it.

183
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,630
Really?

184
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,150
Then add all of these we just ordered.

185
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,840
Okay.

186
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,670
Let's eat. Hurry.

187
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,390
It's been just one month since I left.

188
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,240
But

189
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,320
you've changed a lot.

190
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,510
Am I fat?

191
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,030
Is it that obvious?

192
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,630
It's all my mom's fault.

193
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,200
She said it was good for health.

194
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
I ate a lot of pig's feet these days.

195
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
You look good.

196
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,440
After she suffered a bone fracture,

197
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,910
I became the lead dancer.

198
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,440
I was exhausted every day.

199
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,670
I didn't have time to eat.

200
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,670
So I lost a lot of weight.

201
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,480
I'm so jealous. She just doesn't gain weight.

202
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I didn't expect that after four years in college,

203
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,870
I didn't even make it to the graduation performance.

204
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,550
Don't be sad.

205
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,670
Xia Mo has been admitted to a dance troupe in Shanghai, right?

206
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,030
With her personality,

207
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,440
it's torture

208
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,960
to her.

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,750
Here, have some vegetables.

210
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,840
Let me feed you.

211
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,440
God must be jealous of me.

212
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
But it's okay.

213
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,030
I plan to start a dance training class in Yidong.

214
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,030
I'm going to be an entrepreneur.

215
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,840
I'll stay at Yunhai TV Station

216
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,030
and be transferred to the people's livelihood team.

217
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,910
I'll be on TV.

218
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,550
Then I'll be a star.

219
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,120
You mean an office lady.

220
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,750
I'm the most miserable.

221
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm just a Beijing drifter.

222
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,240
You won't.

223
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,550
I'll buy a house for you in Beijing.

224
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,750
You won't be a Beijing drifter.

225
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,150
I'm full. I don't want to eat anymore.

226
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,270
-Stop eating. -No.

227
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,550
Let's raise our cups.

228
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,150
To the annoying couple.

229
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,150
To the annoying couple.

230
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,320
Happy graduation!

231
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,630
Happy graduation!

232
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,840
You went abroad alone in Senior 3.

233
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,550
What's the inspiration of

234
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,390
your original love song?

235
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,120
Did you date in school?

236
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,320
Actually, when I was in school, I focused on study.

237
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,390
And I focused on training overseas.

238
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,670
It seems

239
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,150
my life was miserable.

240
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,320
There must have been a girl you had a crush on.

241
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,750
Your fans are curious about your ideal type.

242
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,960
My ideal type is actually very ordinary.

243
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,750
She loves snacks.

244
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,600
She looks silly when she smiles.

245
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
She couldn't do math exercises no matter how hard I taught her.

246
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,550
But

247
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,960
she was also the first person

248
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,000
to support me on the stage.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,630
So your song is for her?

250
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,120
Basically,

251
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,840
she inspired me.

252
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,320
When I think of her, the feeling is like puppy love.

253
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,080
Zihan,

254
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,150
can you

255
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,870
sing your favorite song for us today?

256
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,000
OK.

257
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,270
♫I wanted to tell you this, but something has changed♫

258
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,630
♫I swallowed the words♫

259
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,840
As long as you're happy.

260
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,080
Nice to meet you.

261
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
If you want,

262
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,080
we'll be best friends forever.

263
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,390
Slowly.

264
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,390
Let me go.

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,600
Hello?

266
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm okay.

267
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
Are you close?

268
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,480
Did you drive?

269
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,720
Hurry up.

270
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,550
-I'm sorry. -It's getting out of control.

271
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,870
Did I run into you?

272
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,550
Why...

273
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,960
Why didn't he speak?

274
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,550
-Drink some water. -Okay.

275
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,240
Bottoms up.

276
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,390
Cheers.

277
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,000
Alright.

278
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,390
Where is Jia Siwen?

279
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,600
-Here, here, here. -Coming.

280
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,000
You know what?

281
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,630
I'm so angry when I see you like this.

282
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,030
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,630
Don't say sorry to me.

284
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,270
If you say sorry,

285
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,910
I...

286
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,480
The bag.

287
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,600
Nothing.

288
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,670
Why won't you tell me

289
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,069
your real thoughts?

290
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,160
Am I that untrustworthy?

291
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,510
Isn't he good at talking alone?

292
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,720
Let me help you recall.

293
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,920
I've seen all the videos in this phone.

294
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,750
Juanjuan.

295
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,880
I just arrived.

296
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,790
I didn't expect the signal in the mountain to be so bad.

297
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,720
I lost the signal before I could tell you.

298
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,830
I guess you'll scold me when I come back.

299
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,830
But it's okay.

300
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,680
I'll go look for the signal

301
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,240
and see if I can tell you I'm safe.

302
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,070
Don't worry.

303
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,510
I'm on my way.

304
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,550
It's very cold in the mountain.

305
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,960
And...

306
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,310
And I sneaked out.

307
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,400
I didn't tell my teacher.

308
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,440
So I have to hurry.

309
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,240
I heard it's going to rain tonight.

310
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,830
Wait for me.

311
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,240
Juanjuan, good morning.

312
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,590
It's 5:00 in the morning.

313
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,480
I just got up.

314
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,720
It rained halfway yesterday.

315
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,550
The rain came fast in the mountain.

316
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,640
I didn't want to trouble the villagers and my teacher.

317
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,960
So I came back.

318
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,160
But when I arrive in town this afternoon,

319
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,750
as soon as I get the signal, I'll give you my best wishes for your birthday.

320
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Three, two, one.

321
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,750
It's 0:00 now.

322
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,790
It's Jiang Juanjuan's birthday.

323
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,880
Happy birthday to you, Jiang Juanjuan.

324
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,830
Today is your first birthday after we've been together.

325
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,680
I can't go to Yunhai to accompany you.

327
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,550
Juanjuan, do you remember the tellurion I gave you

328
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,880
when I graduated?

329
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,640
The coordinates under it are the location of Heart Island.

330
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,070
Humans found Heart Island

331
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,270
on the Earth of five trillion square kilometers.

332
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,000
There are seven billion people on the Earth.

333
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,030
I only found you.

334
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,270
I'm very lucky to meet you, Jiang Juanjuan.

335
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,480
Happy birthday to you.

336
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,590
Let me sing you a birthday song.

337
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,640
Happy birthday to you.

338
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,510
It's late. Everyone's asleep.

339
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,030
I should go to bed too.

340
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,400
You should rest early too.

341
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,680
Jiang Juanjuan.

342
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,680
Good night.

343
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,720
Sorry.

344
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,440
Screw you.

345
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,750
I apologize.

346
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,680
Don't think I don't know

347
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,920
"apologize" and "sorry"

348
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,070
have similar meanings.

349
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,070
What's going on?

350
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,000
You being happy

351
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,310
is the most important to me.

352
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,350
Instead of explaining and quibbling,

353
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,590
I'd rather spend time making you happy.

354
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,160
You can complain.

355
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,240
I won't think you're immature or unreasonable.

356
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,790
So you don't have to care about my feelings.

357
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,550
I'm happy when you're happy.

358
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,480
What you said is useless.

359
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,510
Let me ask you,

360
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,750
why won't you say "I like you"?

361
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,030
Why won't you say it?

362
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,750
Why?

363
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,680
I like you.

364
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,960
We're back.

365
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
Godfather. Godmother.

366
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,880
Why didn't you tell me you would come back in advance?

367
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,310
I wanted to give you a surprise.

368
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,550
Are you cleaning?

369
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,440
Yes.

370
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,400
I thought you haven't been home for a long time.

371
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,640
So I should do some cleaning.

372
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
And the two families can have dinner together.

373
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,310
You're back.

374
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,590
We're back.

375
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,640
Let me help you.

376
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,440
No need.

377
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,400
You just came back.

378
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,440
Get some rest.

379
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,880
Chao, hurry up.

380
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,510
Take a rest.

381
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,200
Why haven't I seen these photos before?

382
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,590
When did you eat cakes behind my back?

383
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,030
You ate them too.

384
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,310
I didn't eat too many.

385
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:45,350
These must have been collected by Godfather.

386
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,880
These things should be placed outside.

387
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,550
Why are you touching his things?

388
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,030
He knows where to put them.

389
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,750
He won't be able to find them, if you move them.

390
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,200
I just don't want these things to get covered by dust here.

391
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm just moving them to a new place.

392
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,720
Don't move.

393
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,440
Chao, come and take a look.

394
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,480
I think we should find a cabinet

395
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,960
to display these things.

396
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,920
What do you think?

397
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,720
Okay.

398
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,070
Okay, I'll find a place.

399
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,830
I'll buy one for you tomorrow.

400
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,550
Okay.

401
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,960
I've never seen so many trophies in my life.

402
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,920
Take them back.

403
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,720
They are not mine.

404
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,960
There is no name on them anyway.

405
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:04,790
Besides,

406
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,590
what belongs to me is also yours, right?

407
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:08,960
That makes sense.

408
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,880
I'll take them then.

409
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,790
Godmother.

410
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,830
Come here.

411
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,750
Well.

412
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,960
There is nothing on this wall.

413
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,200
Shouldn't we put something on it?

414
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,680
Son.

415
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,590
You're tall.

416
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,000
Put it on the wall.

417
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,750
No.

418
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,110
This picture was taken years ago.

419
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,070
Let's take a new one.

420
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,070
I'm relieved. Yes. Come on.

421
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,720
Finally, we have a new family photo.

422
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,830
Okay.

423
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,510
Sit up. Ling. Sit up.

424
00:24:59,240 --> 00:24:59,920
OK.

425
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,310
Three, two.

426
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,110
Wait. Wait.

427
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,240
You too, Little Rabbit.

428
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Yeah. Take a photo with us.

429
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,830
Come on.

430
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,830
OK.

431
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
Where are you taking me?

432
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,590
Guess.

433
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,240
You guess if I'll guess or not.

434
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,510
I guess you won't.

435
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,680
The snack shop.

436
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,920
What did you do here?

437
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,160
What did you do?

438
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,240
What did I do?

439
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,960
I remember I snatched your little red flower here.

440
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,350
I have a red flower. I have a red flower.

441
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,270
Then you got carried away

442
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,790
and ran into the tree.

443
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,070
And when I was having a competition with you,

444
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,200
my new pants were broken.

445
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,070
That was one of the most embarrassing occasions in my life.

446
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,000
I think it was here.

447
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,480
Oh no, my pants are broken.

448
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,480
Ling Chao.

449
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,110
Are you okay?

450
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,830
My pants are broken.

451
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,310
And you got beaten up by your godmother after going home.

452
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,550
You insisted on playing this game.

453
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,750
You asked me to play it.

454
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,640
You don't like meat, do you?

455
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,200
Give it to me.

456
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,920
Give it to me.

457
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,790
You're the best.

458
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,720
Do you need me to help you recall what happened?

459
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,310
No.

460
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,070
I remember it clearly.

461
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,400
After that, every time I had oden,

462
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,880
I kept the stick in my hand.

463
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,750
Have you noticed that

464
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,110
every time you pick on me,

465
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,960
you are the one to suffer in the end?

466
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,030
I help you clean up the mess.

467
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,680
Right.

468
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,480
Do you like this place?

469
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,310
Yes.

470
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,960
Mu Yehan proposed under a sky wheel.

471
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,480
So I guess you'll like it.

472
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,640
Who?

473
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,030
Mu Yehan.

474
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
The book you read in high school.

475
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,440
The cover is in English.

476
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,240
But it was

477
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,000
actually a romance novel.

478
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,240
You read it?

479
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,960
So you should know

480
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,440
what I want to tell you today.

481
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,240
Before your college entrance exam scores were announced,

482
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,240
I thought

483
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,510
if we couldn't go to the same university,

484
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,480
and if you didn't come to Yunhai,

485
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,590
would we go our separate ways

486
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,680
like other childhood sweethearts

487
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,750
just like that?

488
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,920
But then I thought about it.

489
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,270
We won't.

490
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,830
Are you that confident?

491
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,590
If we were always together,

492
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,550
I might never have this feeling.

493
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,440
But we separated

494
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,480
in the first year of college.

495
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,920
I walked a long road alone.

496
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,400
But I still wanted to come back to you.

497
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,640
I'm not home.

498
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,510
I don't know if she can handle it herself.

499
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,200
So I'm more confident in you

500
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,400
than in myself.

501
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,750
I made a bet.

502
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,160
No matter where we go,

503
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,400
I still want to go back to the stairway in the childhood

504
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,640
to wait for you.

505
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,880
As long as I wait,

506
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,830
you will come.

507
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,640
Congratulations.

508
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,550
You win.

509
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,480
We may

510
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,680
see different scenery in life.

511
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,680
But only when I'm with you,

512
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,830
I'm not just passing by.

513
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,720
It's called the eternity of a moment.

514
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,750
So, will you marry me

515
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,030
and enjoy more scenery with me?

516
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,750
Yes.

517
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,030
Shouldn't you have a ring when you propose?

518
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,440
Where is your ring?

519
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,550
I came out in a hurry.

520
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,000
I didn't have time to prepare.

521
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,790
So I'll give you the ring later.

522
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,270
No.

523
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,270
What do you think?

524
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,030
Are you satisfied

525
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,480
with my new magic?

526
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,000
Are you going to write a program next?

527
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,960
I wanted to write a program

528
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,720
to propose to you

529
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,830
at the top of the sky wheel.

530
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,270
If you don't agree,

531
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,510
I won't let you come down.

532
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,550
How dare you!

533
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,830
But I thought about it.

534
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,200
You'll definitely say yes.

535
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,830
So I gave up the plan.

536
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,400
Come on.

537
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,200
You just don't want to buy tickets.

538
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,070
Yes.

539
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,070
Alright.

540
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,240
Let me tell you a secret.

541
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,240
I love you.

542
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,720
I love you more.

543
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,750
How much do you love me?

544
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,830
I'll give you

545
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,680
everything good.

546
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,720
It's so beautiful.

547
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,750
Look.

548
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,000
Is it beautiful?

549
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,160
Dad.

550
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,960
Look.

551
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,000
There are fireworks.

552
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,400
My mom said when I was born,

553
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,960
I was most welcomed by my dad.

554
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,640
So cute.

555
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,030
You're a man.

556
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,640
Let me change your diaper.

557
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,510
I heard that other children's parents

558
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,030
never allow them to watch cartoons.

559
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,270
But my dad is different.

560
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,400
He let me watch as long as I want.

561
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,350
Dad said

562
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,710
men should eat more carrots if they want to be tall.

563
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,230
I want to be as tall as Dad,

564
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,110
so that I can protect my mom.

565
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,670
Every weekend,

566
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,960
my dad will send me

567
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,440
to my grandparents.

568
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,710
Because he said

569
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,880
"be well-behaved and filial".

570
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:33,960
Being filial is the most important thing in life.

571
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,920
When I grow up, I'll be filial to my parents

572
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,710
like this.

573
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,000
Wait.

574
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:50,760
What's wrong?

575
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,840
I suddenly remember

576
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,840
I forgot something on the day of the proposal.

577
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,590
What?

578
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Tolerant, brave, and filial.

579
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,230
This is my dad.

580
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,630
The person who loves me the most in the world.

581
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,550
Little baby. Little Rabbit. Let's do it.

582
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,510
The notebook.

583
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,320
Money. Crayon.

584
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,150
Take the notebook.

585
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,030
And this.

586
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,400
Here. This is a doctor thing.

587
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,400
She chose this cloth.

588
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:04,920
our niece may need to plant cotton in the future.

589
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,760
Be ambitious, okay?

590
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Planting cotton?

591
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,360
How could you think of that?

592
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,480
In my opinion,

593
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,590
Little Rabbit will be a tailor in the future.

594
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,400
Little Rabbit will be

595
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,550
a fashion designer.

596
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,320
Yes.

597
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,230
-Ling. -A fashion designer.

598
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,030
Did you see Chao's diaper?

599
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,510
The white one with blue spots.

600
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,510
The white one... The white one with blue...

601
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,440
This is it.

602
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,320
This is it.
