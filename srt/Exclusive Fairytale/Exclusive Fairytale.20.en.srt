1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,950
I thought about it.

3
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,590
I think it's necessary to tell you

4
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,470
this.

5
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,550
My Moments is crowded.

6
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,390
Everyone thinks

7
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,310
Madam and Zhou Xingyu are a couple.

8
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,150
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,270
How to enable Moments?

10
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,550
Senior Sister.

11
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,789
Xiao Tu.

12
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,509
Let me give you a ride to the classroom.

13
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:37,229
No need.

14
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,789
Just a few hundred meters.

15
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:40,830
A motorbike is not necessary.

16
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,390
And

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,030
we're not from the same university.

18
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,110
Stop calling me Senior Sister.

19
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,590
How about having some breakfast? No.

20
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,630
I'm on a diet.

21
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,789
On a diet?

22
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,070
You're so thin. Why are you still on a diet?

23
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,430
Is it because your boyfriend thinks you're fat?

24
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,110
That's his problem.

25
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,030
I'm different.

26
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,350
I just want you to be healthy and happy.

27
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:02,870
What's going on?

28
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:07,350
Love is a ray of light. Green...

29
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,990
Don't hit me.

30
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,630
This is my boyfriend.

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,710
We have a good relationship.

32
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,630
You must be Ling Chao.

33
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,390
Hello.

34
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,430
I checked online.

35
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,710
It is very likely for those who major in computer

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,710
to get bald in the future.

37
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,550
Sister.

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,310
By that time,

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,270
will you still like him

40
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,270
like you do now? Luckily.

41
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,030
Who are you?

42
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,470
It doesn't matter who I am.

43
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,550
You don't deserve her anyway.

44
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,590
That day, when she was carrying a lot of things

45
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,230
and comforting the kids,

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,829
I didn't see you.

47
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,790
Mind your own business.

48
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,350
I'm right, right?

49
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,950
The relationship between you

50
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,230
is not that good, right?

51
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,910
Otherwise,

52
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,270
why didn't she announce you are her boyfriend on WeChat?

53
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,990
I think the background of her Moments is not you either.

54
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,430
Childish.

55
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,350
Childish?

56
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,150
Only an unromantic old man like you

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,550
will think others are childish.

58
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,710
I don't see a rubber band on your wrists.

59
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,710
And she doesn't have a ring on her fingers.

60
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,790
You don't even have the basic sense of ritual.

61
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,510
How dare you say you like her?

62
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,750
I'm different.

63
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,190
She gave this to me personally.

64
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,990
I'll always wear it.

65
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,710
I don't understand what you're saying.

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,310
I'm just one year older than you.

67
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,430
There is a generation gap between us?

68
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,270
You don't need to understand.

69
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,790
I'll do everything for you.

70
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:39,950
I don't deserve it.

71
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,430
I'm also an old woman who's not romantic.

72
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,270
I sent him so many interesting messages.

73
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,510
Why did he only say good morning and good night?

74
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,870
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

75
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,910
Sorry.

76
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,670
My phone will be always on.

77
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,310
You can call me or text me anytime.

78
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,750
Flowers, a ring, and Moments.

79
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,149
That's too exaggerating.

80
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,430
Sister, is he mad at me?

81
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,390
Sister?

82
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,910
Hello. Senior Sister.

83
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,790
Senior Sister.

84
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,270
How many brothers do you have?

85
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,790
Well, they are really my junior brothers

86
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,630
in our department.

87
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,870
There is really nothing.

88
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,350
Don't be jealous, Ling Chao.

89
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,390
Are you satisfied?

90
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:22,910
Sister.

91
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,390
There's a furniture store ahead.

92
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,350
Let's go take a look.

93
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,950
What's so interesting about a furniture store?

94
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,470
You want to buy furniture for your dorm?

95
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,470
I heard their ice cream is delicious.

96
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,150
Forget it if you don't want to go.

97
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,230
Since we're already here,

98
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,950
let's go take a look.

99
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,630
Let's go.

100
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,470
What do you think?

101
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,150
This bowl is so cute.

102
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,030
It's perfect for a spicy rabbit head.

103
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,950
You'd better buy something practical.

104
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,150
You'll break it

105
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,230
sooner or later.

106
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,190
Who said that?

107
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,230
I've never broken the dishes.

108
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,790
You didn't wash dishes many times, right?

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,710
You want to buy bowls.

110
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,630
Why are you worried that I'll break them?

111
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,030
Anyway, we'll live together sooner or later.

112
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,030
Who wants to live with you?

113
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,750
The sofa is so soft.

114
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,710
It must be very comfortable to sleep on it.

115
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,430
I want to eat QQ candies.

116
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,670
You're so clumsy.

117
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,470
This grey wolf looks just like you.

118
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,310
I think this looks like you.

119
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,590
I...

120
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,030
Don't move.

121
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,030
Cute.

122
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,110
Take a photo.

123
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,270
What are you doing?

124
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,150
What are you doing?

125
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,710
You failed to pursue your junior sister again?

126
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,150
No.

127
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,710
Look.

128
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,910
I've checked all social apps.

129
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,350
It's not that easy

130
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,470
to deal with Zhou Xingyu.

131
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,030
You think too much.

132
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,870
Can't you tell?

133
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,070
What?

134
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,630
Sister,

135
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,350
I bought this gift for you.

136
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,470
Don't feel pressured.

137
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,270
It's nothing. It's normal.

138
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,230
You're too naive.

139
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,310
Let's go back to the dorm.

140
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,550
I'm going to teach you.

141
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,310
Three, two, one.

142
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,790
You finally remember to call me.

143
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,590
Sorry, I just got off the plane.

144
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,870
You could have told me.

145
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,590
You can record your trip on the Exclusive Fairy Tales, right?

146
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,190
I left in a hurry this time.

147
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,750
I won't do it again.

148
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,590
Don't worry.

149
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,750
I know you are busy.

150
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,590
But you are alone

151
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,150
and you are so far away from home.

152
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,790
And I couldn't reach you.

153
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,750
Well,

154
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,670
I'm worried about you.

155
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,429
I'll give you a video call every day

156
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,150
and let you know I'm safe.

157
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,190
Really?

158
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,750
You said that.

159
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,470
Don't worry.

160
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,110
I won't make you worried anymore.

161
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:42,950
Fine.

162
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,910
Master,

163
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,590
I'm willing to help you

164
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,750
deal with Zhou Xingyu, that male monster.

165
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,430
Through my comprehensive analysis

166
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,750
and with my years of experience,

167
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,190
I think it's not easy to deal with Zhou Xingyu.

168
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,030
He is

169
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,670
a Green Tea Bitch.

170
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,750
Sister.

171
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,510
I drank your tea.

172
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,910
Will your boyfriend be mad if he finds out?

173
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,750
Oh, right.

174
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,230
A Green Tea Bitch

175
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,230
looks considerate

176
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,030
and harmless on the surface.

177
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,870
But in fact, he has evil intentions

178
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,510
and plays tricks everywhere.

179
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,550
If we can't notice it in time,

180
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,870
there will be endless problems.

181
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,990
Fortunately, I traveled around the world

182
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,070
and I've seen countless people.

183
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,510
I have sharp eyes... Get to the point.

184
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,990
The Green Tea class begins now.

185
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,710
To be honest,

186
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,870
Zhou Xingyu's persona

187
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,590
is really good.

188
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,590
On the surface,

189
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,710
he's a personalized boy who rides a motorbike.

190
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,310
But in fact,

191
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,990
he's gentle, considerate and kind to Madam.

192
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,790
Sha, answer my question.

193
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,870
The key information of this sentence should be...

194
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,750
Gentle, considerate, and kind.

195
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,190
Wrong. Totally wrong.

196
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,990
It should be making a contrast.

197
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,070
Think about it.

198
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,190
Master has a pure heart and few desires like a monk.

199
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,030
If he suddenly does something very romantic

200
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,750
that Master has never done before,

201
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,830
she'll fall for it.

202
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,510
That makes sense.

203
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,310
So if Zhou Xingyu

204
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,110
continues to sow discord between you,

205
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,790
Master should make him understand she is yours

206
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,910
unintentionally.

207
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,430
Let me give you an example.

208
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,670
Brother.

209
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,750
It seems you don't look quite well today.

210
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,510
Is it because the color of your T-shirt

211
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,150
doesn't suit your skin color?

212
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,030
I know the answer.

213
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,990
You answer it.

214
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,990
Really?

215
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,910
I usually don't pay attention to this kind of things.

216
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,750
My girlfriend chose the clothes for me.

217
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,870
Good.

218
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,310
You've improved a lot.

219
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,110
But what I just said is not the most important.

220
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,070
A Green Tea Bitch is best at pretending to be weak.

221
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,910
So we can't lose

222
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,510
in acting coquettishly.

223
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,150
There should be some air in the tone.

224
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,430
There should be ups and downs in the intonation.

225
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,390
Sister.

226
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,230
Ridiculous!

227
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,950
Master! Master!

228
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,870
Remember.

229
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,710
Use his way to defeat him.

230
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,510
Use magic to defeat magic.

231
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,590
I should've only written down the last sentence.

232
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,030
Hello?

233
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,390
Daddy.

234
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:31,990
Xiao Tu.

235
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,070
What happened?

236
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,190
What did I do wrong?

237
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,910
You think you are old enough?

238
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,750
Congratulations.

239
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,870
You planned to leave with Ling Chao long ago, right?

240
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,830
No. Dad.

241
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,750
Did you watch a drama?

242
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,870
Or did you have a nightmare?

243
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,550
That's not true.

244
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,870
A drama?

245
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,070
Your situation is even worse than dramas.

246
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,590
What? Just tell me what happened.

247
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,830
How dare you question me?

248
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,710
As the old saying goes, a daughter who is married is like water poured away.

249
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,750
But I never thought

250
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,030
you are already on his side now.

251
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,430
Well. Dad, you...

252
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,070
You're back.

253
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,070
This...

254
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,950
What's wrong with her?

255
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,190
Jealousy makes people crazy.

256
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,430
Considering your current relationship with Ling Chao,

257
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,110
it's normal for her to be upset.

258
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,550
What did you say?

259
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,670
Stop pretending.

260
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,510
Ling Chao announced you are his girlfriend

261
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,630
on WeChat Moments, right?

262
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,670
He seldom releases a post on Moments.

263
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,750
But he released a post for you.

264
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,990
It is quite romantic.

265
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,470
I saw it too.

266
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,750
Right?

267
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,750
Why did he suddenly do this?

268
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,630
I thought he wouldn't post it on Moments.

269
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,070
Give me your phone.

270
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,990
Listen.

271
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,750
When Ling Chao sent me a WeChat message

272
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,470
and asked me to like his post in the afternoon,

273
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,110
I thought his account was hacked.

274
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,870
It turns out he wants the whole world to know

275
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,430
you plan to live together.

276
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,310
He did this to make Zhou Xingyu understand

277
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,430
you are his girl, right?

278
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,310
Wonderful.

279
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,750
Ling Chao's post is not visible to me.

280
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,470
Really?

281
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,390
I see.

282
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,110
Ling Chao's intention is very obvious.

283
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:36,430
He was stimulated by Zhou Xingyu.

284
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,830
He wants to fight back.

285
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,190
Well.

286
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,190
Then why am I the only one who can't see his post?

287
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,550
I don't deserve to know?

288
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,830
You don't like to be high-profile, right?

289
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,470
Maybe he's afraid that you would be unhappy

290
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,630
and force him to delete his post.

291
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,190
It's just a post.

292
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,750
Why would I be unhappy?

293
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,150
But he released a post and blocked his girlfriend.

294
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,630
Everyone gets angry.

295
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,030
It's too late to call him now.

296
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,990
You major in journalism.

297
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,070
Don't you know how fast the gossip travels?

298
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,310
Look.

299
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,630
Your relationship with Ling Chao is all over Moments.

300
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,310
Look, many people said

301
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,910
you are going to live together.

302
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,990
This one said you plan to get a marriage certificate.

303
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,430
What marriage certificate?

304
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,790
I'm not at the legal age for marriage.

305
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,590
What are they thinking?

306
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,390
No wonder Ling Chao is smart.

307
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,510
He is using the public opinion to defeat Zhou Xingyu.

308
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,590
If it's true,

309
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,790
Zhou Xingyu will be the other man.

310
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,150
You will be a bad girl and a traitor.

311
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,590
What are you talking about?

312
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,590
What time is it? Can't you see I'm sleeping?

313
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,950
Ling Chao.

314
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,430
Wait and see.

315
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,790
You still won't give up?

316
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,430
What's the big deal about living together?

317
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,390
As long as you are not married,

318
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,630
I still have a chance.

319
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,670
I don't want your money.

320
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,870
I bought this for Xiao Tu willingly.

321
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,990
The delivery fee.

322
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,430
Ling Chao.

323
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,710
Why did you block me on your Moments?

324
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,710
Explain it to me.

325
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,470
Sister.

326
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,470
You are having a fight with him?

327
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,670
Gosh.

328
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,510
Are you going to break up because of me?

329
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,950
I feel so guilty, if that is the case.

330
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:36,630
Baby.

331
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,070
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

332
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,790
I wanted to prove our relationship very much.

333
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,030
Are you angry because I love you so much?

334
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,510
Are you okay?

335
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,790
You really care about him more.

336
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,510
I really envy you.

337
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,390
You can attract her attention

338
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,670
by making her angry.

339
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,110
You are not like me.

340
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,550
Whenever I see Xiao Tu,

341
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,870
I will blush, and my heart will beat so fast. And I can't say a word.

342
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,470
Sister.

343
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,350
Am I useless?

344
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,270
You said a lot.

345
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,390
No.

346
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,070
Baby.

347
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,590
It's my fault.

348
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,630
I'm not smooth-tongued.

349
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,990
I can't say sweet words to make you happy.

350
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,870
Sister.

351
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,830
Are you having hypoglycemia

352
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,830
because you were angry and not in the mood to eat anything?

353
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,230
It's my fault. I didn't take good care of you.

354
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,230
This is the meal box I made for you.

355
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,750
It might not be as good as what he bought for you.

356
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,030
But if you are willing to taste it,

357
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,190
I'll be very happy.

358
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,950
Baby.

359
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,390
Did you not sleep well?

360
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,990
I should have realized that you can't sleep well in the dorm.

361
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,270
I should have...

362
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,630
Shut up.

363
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,790
Sister.

364
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,470
Are you satisfied today?

365
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,430
Why did you take me here today?

366
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,990
It's so beautiful.

367
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,390
QQ candies.

368
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,390
Gosh, this sample room

369
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,109
is exactly what I want.

370
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,349
If you like it, buy it.

371
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,310
I don't want this, this, and this.

372
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,750
I'll buy the rest.

373
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,510
Take these three.

374
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,109
I already paid.

375
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,510
A bossy president fell in love with me?

376
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:32,950
My Lady.

377
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,990
Are you satisfied?

378
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,670
You...

379
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,430
You really bought it?

380
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,870
Where did you get so much money?

381
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,310
I made some money with Exclusive Fairy Tales.

382
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,950
My parents gave me some.

383
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,550
Why are you in such a hurry to buy a house?

384
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,230
I'm going to Handuo as a trainee next semester.

385
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,190
You want to work at Yunhai TV Station after graduation, right?

386
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,870
It will be quite convenient for both of us if we live here.

387
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,270
But why did you decorate your house

388
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,190
according to my preferences?

389
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,150
Because...

390
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,590
Because the things you chose

391
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,950
are quite good.

392
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,830
I like them.

393
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,630
I mean

394
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,990
I

395
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,630
like you.

396
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,190
What are you doing?

397
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,830
I didn't say I'll move in.

398
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,230
I didn't invite you.

399
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,350
This is the spare key.

400
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,550
Keep it for me.

401
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,750
OK.

402
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,470
I'll keep it for you reluctantly.

403
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,870
What did you eat?

404
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,390
Why are you so tall?

405
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,710
What did you eat?

406
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,670
Why haven't you grown taller?

407
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,550
Xiao Tu.

408
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,830
Wish you happy.

409
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,790
Rabbit.

410
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,110
Come here.

411
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,190
What do you think of this company?

412
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,870
They are recruiting interns.

413
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,030
Is it too early

414
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:32,950
to focus on internship recruitment?

415
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,590
I don't have many classes in the third academic year.

416
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,430
So I want to work as an intern while studying.

417
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,950
This company is in Beijing.

418
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,230
Then I can get closer to Jia Siwen.

419
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,710
So you don't want me anymore?

420
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,870
That's not what I meant.

421
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,070
You two have a tacit understanding.

422
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,310
Hi, Jia Siwen.

423
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,230
Look what we are doing.

424
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,510
Xiao Tu and I are hanging out our quilts.

425
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,230
Hello, Jiang Juanjuan's virtual boyfriend.

426
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,550
Thank you.

427
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,790
I feel like I'm dating my brother.

428
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,990
Is it because I'm wearing the contact lens

429
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,350
endorsed by your brother?

430
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,830
What?

431
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,030
I mean you are busier than my brother.

432
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,470
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,270
I miss you so much.

434
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,270
Don't throw up on the quilt.

435
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,470
You two continue.

436
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,710
Juanjuan.

437
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,750
The weather forecast says it will rain in Yunhai.

438
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,870
Remember to bring your coat and an umbrella when you go out.

439
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,710
Don't catch a cold.

440
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,190
You too.

441
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,710
I just saw the recruitment information of an entertainment company

442
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,550
in Beijing.

443
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,190
I want to give it a try.

444
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,110
If I pass the interview,

445
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,470
I can go to see you.

446
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,310
It's too hard.

447
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,470
I should go to Yunhai to see you more.

448
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,910
It's okay. As long as we can meet,

449
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,630
it's worth it no matter how hard it is.

450
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,950
I'm going to buy two sets of clothes for the interview

451
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,270
in the mall later.

452
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,030
I'll send photos to you.

453
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,990
Help me choose.

454
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,950
Okay.

455
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:04,910
Right.

456
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,470
You still remember

457
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,590
what day it is in several days, right?

458
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,830
Your birthday.

459
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,750
I won't forget.

460
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,670
Jia Siwen.

461
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,590
Get in.

462
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,710
Coming.

463
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,350
I have to go.

464
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,270
Okay.

465
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,510
Be careful.

466
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,470
From this perspective, don't you think

467
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,230
my legs won't look long enough in the photo?

468
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,870
Your legs are long enough.

469
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,350
I'm almost on the ground.

470
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,950
Did you activate the beauty mode?

471
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,830
Yes.

472
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,870
Okay.

473
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,870
Take a look.

474
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,470
OK.

475
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,470
I'm sending it to Jia Siwen.

476
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,630
I think the first one looks better.

477
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,190
It doesn't matter what you think.

478
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,830
What Jia Siwen thinks matters.

479
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,830
Miss.

480
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,230
Are you satisfied with any of the 28 suits

481
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,550
you just tried on?

482
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,430
In a minute. We are thinking about it.

483
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,590
Is Jia Siwen busy?

484
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,830
Why don't we take a look at something else first?

485
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,830
I want to visit the home furniture store.

486
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,150
Home furniture?

487
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,350
You denied you are married

488
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,870
and you said you wouldn't live together, right?

489
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,830
What?

490
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,110
Now you are acting like you are his wife.

491
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,310
Go get changed.

492
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,990
Go get changed.

493
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,230
Everyone.

494
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,750
After we go into the mountain,

495
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,790
there might be no signal.

496
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,230
You must hold the walkie-talkie.

497
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,350
Follow the team closely.

498
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,430
Don't act alone.

499
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,230
Got it?

500
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,470
Yes.

501
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,710
We're going to stay in the mountain for two days.

502
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,110
There might be no signal.

503
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,990
Don't worry.

504
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,630
Okay. Everyone.

505
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,790
It will be mountain roads ahead.

506
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,990
We can't drive in.

507
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,470
Pack your things

508
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,470
and get off with me in an orderly manner.

509
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,150
Come and get your stuff.

510
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,670
So cute.

511
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,590
Look at that bear.

512
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,350
What do you want for your birthday?

513
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,350
It shouldn't cost more than ten yuan.

514
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,550
Don't worry.

515
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,230
I don't expect much from you.

516
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,790
I'm looking forward to Jia Siwen's gift.

517
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,350
After all, this will be the first birthday

518
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,470
after we were together.

519
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,950
Fine.

520
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,350
Has your virtual boyfriend replied to your message?

521
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,150
No.

522
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,710
It's okay. Let's go.

523
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,630
Shuang.

524
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,590
Check it first.

525
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,550
Sir.

526
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,870
Can I apply for a leave for an hour?

527
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,590
I came in a hurry.

528
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,230
I didn't have the time to tell my family.

529
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,630
So I want to go up the mountain to look for the signal

530
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,070
to see if I can send a message.

531
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,230
But you can't go out now.

532
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,350
They'll pick us up tomorrow morning.

533
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,590
Okay, thank you.

534
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,630
Do you remember that chemistry teacher?

535
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,350
In junior high school.

536
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,630
Siwen, where are you going?

537
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,110
I'm going up the mountain to look for the signal.

538
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,150
Don't go.

539
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,670
The weather forecast says there will be showers tonight.

540
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,350
It's not safe.

541
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,710
It's okay.

542
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,590
I'll be back soon.

543
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,630
Rest early.

544
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,950
Be careful.

545
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,950
Master.

546
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:19,950
Look.

547
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:23,470
We're going to Shile for internship soon.

548
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,750
Shouldn't we show

549
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,910
team spirit?

550
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,870
Zhu.

551
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,710
Help me remember.

552
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,670
Are the master and his three disciples in Journey to the West

553
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,870
always together

554
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,830
when they eat, sleep, drink, and walk?

555
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,710
Yes.

556
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,230
Monsters come to capture me frequently.

557
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,110
It's normal that I don't live with you.

558
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,950
That's not true, Master.

559
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,190
If you can share your room with me in your apartment,

560
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,470
I would be willing to be taken away by monsters.

561
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,870
Me too.

562
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:00,670
OK.

563
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,830
I'll find you

564
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,270
a realtor in a few days.

565
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,750
You can rent a house too.

566
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,830
Master.

567
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,430
No need to bother with it.

568
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,590
Think about it.

569
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,630
Madam is busy with her studies.

570
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:15,870
She can't move in soon.

571
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,030
Why don't you let us live in the new house first

572
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,710
to liven it up?

573
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,950
You're too noisy.

574
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,830
You'll only make me angry.

575
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,190
What about me?

576
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,430
I promise I'll lie in my bed as soon as I get home.

577
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,110
I'll be invisible.

578
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,750
You snore.

579
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,470
You can't live there either.

580
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,030
We don't sleep together.

581
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,470
What's wrong with snoring?

582
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,830
Among you guys,

583
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,310
Sha is the only one I can accept.

584
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,510
He doesn't talk much.

585
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,630
He is quiet.

586
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,550
Master.

587
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,470
It's decided then.

588
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,430
I recorded it.

589
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,950
Good for you, Sha.

590
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,470
You've learned.

591
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:52,830
Master,

592
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,630
I will pay the rent on time.

593
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,110
Don't act like a good boy.

594
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,430
You're acting like a good boy.

595
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,030
Rabbit.

596
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,630
Is it okay if I wear this today?

597
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,830
Rabbit.

598
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,990
Where did she go?

599
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,190
You all disappeared.

600
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,230
Does anyone remember my birthday?

601
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,470
Okay, everyone.

602
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,790
Take your small bags with you.

603
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,830
Come with me to put large bags in that bus.

604
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,110
Come on, give me your large bags.

605
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,950
Put them together.

606
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,790
You didn't find any signal last night

607
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,750
and got wet in the rain.

608
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,590
You've caught a cold.

609
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,750
I have cold medicine.

610
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,870
It's okay. I've taken it.

611
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,750
Really?

612
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,390
Still looking for the signal?

613
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,110
Today is my girlfriend's birthday.

614
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,470
We'll arrive in the town in a few hours.

615
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,870
It doesn't matter if you contact her later, right?

616
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,590
What?

617
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,750
Are you afraid your girlfriend will be angry?

618
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,870
No.

619
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,310
It's just that she couldn't reach me in the past two days.

620
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,670
I don't want her to be worried about me.

621
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:17,270
Fine. You just showed your love to each other.

622
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,830
Forget what I said.

623
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,110
Juanjuan.

624
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,470
Happy birthday.

625
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,350
That's it?

626
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,950
Nothing concrete?

627
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,350
How about treating you to candlelight...

628
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,590
Malatang?

629
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,830
I'm just kidding. I'm not going.

630
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,270
No, you have to go.

631
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,790
I'm not going. Let's go.

632
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,510
You have to go. Malatang.

633
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,910
Go. Hurry. Change your shoes. Hurry.

634
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,870
Come in.

635
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,830
No need to change your shoes.

636
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,590
Here.

637
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,790
No wonder you didn't reply to my messages.

638
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,950
So it was all planned.

639
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,950
I'm giving you a big surprise.

640
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,630
So many dishes.

641
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,990
Let me see

642
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,750
who made all these

643
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,150
delicious dishes.

644
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,310
I

645
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,070
ordered takeaways.

646
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,670
You made such a big fuss.

647
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,350
I thought you made them.

648
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,550
What I made is here.

649
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,230
You threw them.

650
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,670
Coming.

651
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,110
I'm carrying too many things. I can't get my key.

652
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,710
Long time no see, Xiao Tu.

653
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,590
Hello, Senior...

654
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,550
Hello, Madam.

655
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,590
What's going on?

656
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,270
I don't know.

657
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,590
Come in first.

658
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:04,910
Xiao Tu.

659
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,790
Let me explain.

660
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,510
No, I don't want to hear it. Let me explain.

661
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,190
Well.

662
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,550
I left the cake I bought for Jiang Juanjuan at the gate.

663
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,270
It's an ice cream cake. I forgot it. Let's go.

664
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,870
This is my Big Brother.

665
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,870
Sun Shibo.

666
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:18,590
Hello. This is my

667
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,430
junior brother, Guan Jiu.

668
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,190
Your Guan Jiu?

669
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,190
Yes.

670
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,590
We're a team of four.

671
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,710
Ling Chao is not here now.

672
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:27,590
This is my high school classmate,

673
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,950
Yin Xinlan.

674
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,790
So this is

675
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,310
the pretty girl you've been thinking of?

676
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,630
If I met a beautiful girl like her

677
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,950
in high school,

678
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,310
I wouldn't have been single till now.

679
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,310
How did you get in touch again?

680
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:39,910
Tell us about it.

681
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,310
I'll give you a video call every day to let you know I'm safe.

682
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,350
Don't worry.

683
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,990
I won't make you worried anymore.

684
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,750
I'm looking forward to Jia Siwen's gift.

685
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,270
After all, this will be the first birthday

686
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,390
after we were together.

687
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,070
My phone will be always on.

688
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,830
You can call me or text me anytime.

689
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,190
You still remember

690
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,150
what day it is in several days, right?

691
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,070
Your birthday. I won't forget.

692
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,950
Let's wish Jiang Juanjuan

693
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,150
a happy birthday, okay?

694
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,390
Happy birthday!

695
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,830
Happy birthday!

696
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,470
In my opinion,

697
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:27,630
the takeaways Madam ordered are so delicious.

698
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,110
It would be great

699
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,630
if I can eat the takeaways ordered by Madam every day.

700
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:33,470
Every day? Yes.

701
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,350
How dare you

702
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,750
say that!

703
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,910
Today, I will beat you

704
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,750
on behalf of Master. Enough.

705
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,190
You don't understand.

706
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,750
Well.

707
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,470
Master.

708
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:43,670
This is what I mean.

709
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,430
If I can live in the guest bedroom,

710
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,550
I can eat the takeaways

711
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,790
ordered by Madam every day, right?

712
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,790
It belongs to me. Master promised to let me live here.

713
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,510
You sleep on the floor.

714
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,110
Turn off the lights. I sleep in the bed.

715
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,470
Okay. You wish.

716
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,950
That's mine. Don't try to compete for it. Add a bed.

717
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,990
Line up.

718
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,110
First come, first served.

719
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,030
Come on. I'll be the first. You guys line up.

720
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,110
It's time.

721
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,750
Come on.

722
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,710
Come on. Junior Sister.

723
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,070
What language do you like

724
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,830
for your birthday song?

725
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,550
Whatever you want.

726
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,430
You said it like you know how to sing them.

727
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,070
Of course.

728
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:11,710
Show us.

729
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,430
Really?

730
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,630
Happy birthday to you. What is this?

731
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,310
Happy birthday.

732
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,590
Happy birthday to you.

733
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,750
Happy birthday.

734
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,630
Happy birthday to Jiang Juanjuan.

735
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:31,190
Happy birthday to you.

736
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,550
Wait.

737
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:33,390
How about

738
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,990
calling Jia Siwen?

739
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,350
Ask him to join us remotely.

740
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,870
Good idea.

741
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,590
Senior Brother, can I order a song?

742
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,550
What I sang is not good.

743
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,270
No problem.

744
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,310
Just give me a name. I can sing a lot of songs.

745
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,350
Anything you want. Come on.

746
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,430
Happy breakup.

747
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,830
Breakup?

748
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,070
I'm just kidding.

749
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,200
Just kidding.

750
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,950
Okay. Kidding.

751
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,230
Let me make a wish.

752
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,350
