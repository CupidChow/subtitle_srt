1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,560
Why are you so hesitant?

3
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,150
Ridiculous.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,600
Good night.

5
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,150
What do you mean?

6
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,000
Zhu.

7
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,760
I have something to tell you too.

8
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,640
Do you want to hear it now

9
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,710
or after the college entrance exam?

10
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,479
I want to hear it now too.

11
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,039
Can you

12
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,870
wash the stinky socks

13
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,560
under your bed?

14
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,590
It stinks.

15
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,870
Breaking news.

16
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,280
On the first day of school,

17
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,240
four girls

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,030
met such a thing.

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,470
In the middle of a dark night,

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,470
four female freshmen

21
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,310
were taken as scammers

22
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,360
and refused to enter the dorm by the doorkeeper.

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,840
She claimed that there was no room 404.

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,360
While they were scared to shake,

25
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,079
the four girls

26
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,310
finally found out

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,910
it was because Yunhai University enrolled too many students

28
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,000
so that it had run out of female dormitories.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,310
It changed a storage room to a dorm temporarily

30
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,750
and had to use the number 404

31
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,560
that was abandoned

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
because of its meaning of bad luck.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,360
The doorkeeper didn't realize at that time

34
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
and made a mistake.

35
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,240
Should the school's negligence be blamed

36
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,470
or is it a feudal superstition?

37
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,079
Where should the four girls do

38
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,430
and what should they do?

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,870
Good.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
You showed the students

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,840
a typical wrong example.

42
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,190
Put aside your writing problems

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,590
and the five elements of news writing.

44
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,120
The essence of news is truth.

45
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,520
You can even say

46
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,750
truth is the life of news.

47
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,240
The most serious problem

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,560
of your news

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,310
is a lack of reality.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,400
If you like making up stories,

51
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,120
please go to the next class.

52
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,910
But what I said is true.

53
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,590
What happened next?

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,560
I'll tell you after class.

55
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,030
Smells good.

56
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,079
Have a bite.

57
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,680
No.

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
In order to better protect Xia Mo,

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
I need to strengthen my muscles.

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,240
Forget it.

61
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,590
According to her unique taste,

62
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,190
it'll be more effective to protect her

63
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,240
by buying some crosses

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
or amulets.

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,630
Besides, no one only practices upper limbs.

66
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,840
What are you talking about?

67
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,280
My abs are showing.

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Look.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,630
No, no, no.

70
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:55,560
I don't deserve it.

71
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,240
I don't deserve it.

72
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,710
Look.

73
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,470
-Don’t. -Look. Look.

74
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,000
Senior, don't be shy.

75
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,080
I want you to see this post on the school forum.

76
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,870
The true identity of the Prince Charming from the Computer Department.

77
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,630
Hello, sir.

78
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm Jianghu from the Student Union.

79
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,960
I need your help.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,870
Everybody, wait a minute.

81
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,870
The Psychology Department of the Student Union

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,160
is going to hold…

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,600
There's a Psychology Department in our school?

84
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,600
Look.

85
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,070
Does he look like the senior

86
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,360
you talked to last time?

87
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,920
Who wants to volunteer?

88
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,430
I’ve asked around for you.

89
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,510
His name is Jianghu.

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,070
He's a sophomore from the Computer Department.

91
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,120
-Anyone? -He's good at academic and has a good personality.

92
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,430
Many people want to date him.

93
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,680
There are too many of them so that it's like drawing a lottery to become his girlfriend.

94
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,360
Since you've already got his number,

95
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,680
you're ahead of others.

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,680
Paper, paper.

97
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,870
It's dripping.

98
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,159
The one who raised her hand.

99
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
The one who's holding a bun.

100
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,310
Please stay here for a moment.

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,600
I'll tell you

102
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
the details of this seminar.

103
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,510
This is your chance. Seize it.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,310
Why didn't you call me?

105
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,040
I lost the game.

106
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,630
It was for fun.

107
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,390
I was afraid you might forget me,

108
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,870
so it was a friendly reminder.

109
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,190
How can I forget?

110
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,000
I should thank you for helping me.

111
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
It's okay.

112
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,630
I'm here to ask for your help again.

113
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,510
There are too many events

114
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,040
at school recently.

115
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,600
Journalists at the Student Union

116
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,510
are busy,

117
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,510
so please

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,600
take care of the news and photos

119
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,480
for this psychological health seminar.

120
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,630
No problem.

121
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,950
It's just I'm only a freshman.

122
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm not good at

123
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,600
taking photos and writing news.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,870
It's okay.

125
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,630
There's still some time before the meeting.

126
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,830
You'll also be taught

127
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,430
some basics in class.

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,950
I'll recommend you some books.

129
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,560
You can read when you're free.

130
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,600
Okay.

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,830
Thank you, Senior.

132
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm asking you for help.

133
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,480
Why are you thanking me instead?

134
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,070
I feel embarrassed.

135
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,160
How about this?

136
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,070
I'll treat you to a meal.

137
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,830
Thanks. I'm good.

138
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,750
Anyway, it's time to eat.

139
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,390
Let's go.

140
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go eat at the canteen.

141
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,630
Consider it as my gratitude for your help.

142
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,830
Okay, thank you.

143
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,480
Jiang Juanjuan.

144
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,720
Listen.

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,870
Ling Chao has become the target.

146
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,190
How's he doing? Has he been sent to the hospital?

147
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,510
No. Check this out.

148
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,950
The public image of the Prince Charming from the Computer Department

149
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,390
has been ruined.

150
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,120
I've already sent it to you.

151
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,000
It's said in the post

152
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,750
that there is a handsome boy from the Computer Department

153
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,120
who's good at academic.

154
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,720
He's actually a cheater

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,750
in private.

156
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,830
Which one of the two words you said,

157
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,510
cheater and Prince Charming,

158
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,190
has anything to do with Ling Chao?

159
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,360
Take a closer look.

160
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,310
At first,

161
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,190
according to the details in this post,

162
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,920
it's said the person is Ling Chao.

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,240
Then more and more people

164
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,190
spilled the tea on Ling Chao.

165
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,040
There was even conclusive evidence

166
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,160
pointing to him.

167
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Look at this.

168
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,750
This jerk called another girl's name

169
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,480
when he was dating someone else.

170
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,560
This is indeed what Ling Chao can do.

171
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,870
He can't remember people's names.

172
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,950
But didn't Wukong say

173
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,070
Ling Chao is a modern monk

174
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,360
and not interested in women?

175
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,680
That's why

176
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,270
it's called the collapse of his public image.

177
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,190
On the one hand, he's attracting fans in the name of being single;

178
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,750
but actually, there are so many beauties around him.

179
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,159
If he's in the entertainment industry,

180
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,560
it would be a capital crime.

181
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,950
This post is so fake.

182
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,830
If Ling Chao really is a playboy

183
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,310
like they said,

184
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,680
how can he not be interested in me?

185
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,159
They said Ling Chao has a bad personality,

186
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,870
not a bad eyesight.

187
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
The comments

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
are getting crazier.

189
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,159
There are at least 50

190
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,720
out of more than 1,500 comments

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,750
are from the so-called insiders.

192
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
They claimed to be Ling Chao's primary school classmates

193
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,390
and even kindergarten classmates.

194
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
They even exposed Ling Chao's home address.

195
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,680
What about the other 1,000 comments?

196
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,920
At least there are more normal people.

197
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,870
The other 1,000 comments

198
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,390
are criticizing Ling Chao.

199
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,190
There are already 1,734 comments.

200
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,070
Someone even exposed his phone number

201
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,750
and incited others to call and scold him.

202
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,000
Just wait.

203
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,830
I’ll scold back at whomever

204
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,390
scolding my Ling Chao.

205
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,240
It doesn't help much

206
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,190
if you keep replying to them one by one.

207
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,270
It's a waste of time.

208
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,510
There is a way.

209
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,200
Come on.

210
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Let me teach you something for free.

211
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,510
Here.

212
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,870
Why don't I have confidence

213
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,150
in Wukong?

214
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,030
It sounds harsh.

215
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,150
You haven't tried it.

216
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,510
How do you know it won't work?

217
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,670
Next.

218
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,360
I've found out the IP address of the poster.

219
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,120
Sha is so reliable.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,960
Hello, Ling Chao.

221
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,790
Where are you?

222
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,600
I'll post something

223
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,510
against online violence

224
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,720
and condemn the irresponsible behavior of those trolls.

225
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,720
You

226
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
take charge of

227
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,000
encouraging relatives and friends

228
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,030
to like and comment.

229
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,510
Try to make it trend.

230
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,030
Is there anything I can help?

231
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:39,320
Registers some smurf accounts on the forum

232
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,510
and comment down below the post.

233
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,630
Tell them

234
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,030
Ling Chao is busy writing codes.

235
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,440
Shift their attention to his academic results.

236
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,120
Ask them to stay away from his personal life.

237
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,870
That sounds about right.

238
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,200
They don't know how excellent Ling Chao is.

239
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,630
I heard

240
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,840
there's a movie called something Jiong.

241
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,030
A sequel is released.

242
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,840
It's quite interesting.

243
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,030
Why don't we watch it together?

244
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,240
Okay, I'll buy the tickets.

245
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,240
No, well…

246
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,440
It just came to me

247
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,670
that I haven't done my homework.

248
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,390
Why don't you come with me to the library to finish my homework?

249
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,550
Sure.

250
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,240
I'll tell Ju Wenyu.

251
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,600
I won't play games with him tonight.

252
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
Play games?

253
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,480
It's not the time to play games.

254
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,550
Beef rice.

255
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,240
BBQ pork rice.

256
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,120
Fried rice with chili.

257
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,870
Thank you.

258
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,790
I've set up a block.

259
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,240
I can't receive

260
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,480
those messy things.

261
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,390
Don't worry.

262
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm not worried about you.

263
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm afraid you are so bad-tempered

264
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,910
that you have to reply to them one by one.

265
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,360
It's a waste of money.

266
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,870
Have you ever thought

267
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,080
what if I'm a scumbag

268
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,670
like they said in the post?

269
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,270
How is that possible?

270
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,960
In summary,

271
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,080
that scumbag in that post

272
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,510
dates Cuihua on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,

273
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,360
and dates Shufen on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

274
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,030
He even seeks someone new on Sunday.

275
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,670
And you

276
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,200
spend almost every day on books and computers,

277
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,550
eight days a week,

278
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,670
32 days a month.

279
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,910
That was in the past.

280
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,080
What if

281
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,390
I've changed

282
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,960
and want to date?

283
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,630
Well…

284
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
You're an adult.

285
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,840
I can't control your relationship.

286
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,360
Aren't you afraid

287
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,320
that after I have a girlfriend,

288
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,390
I have no time for you?

289
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,480
I don't think you have time for me

290
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,080
when you don't have a girlfriend.

291
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,600
Go after someone you like.

292
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,480
I support you

293
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,870
as long as she's not Xu Linglong.

294
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:53,750
Fine.

295
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,790
You said that.

296
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,240
I second it.

297
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,600
I'm all for it.

298
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,240
Why did you ask me to come down so early?

299
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,600
To class.

300
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,440
Didn't we agree to go to school together?

301
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,550
I don't have a morning class today.

302
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,870
The fried dough sticks from the second canteen

303
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,240
and rice balls from the third canteen

304
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,320
are all your favorite.

305
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,390
Do you want to eat?

306
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,720
Go to class with me.

307
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,270
Isn't that Ling Chao?

308
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,630
Isn't he shameful of himself?

309
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,550
That girl looks silly.

310
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,000
Can she be cheated by him?

311
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,200
Do you know him?

312
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,200
Not only knowing him from your side,

313
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,360
but both sides?

314
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,030
No.

315
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,390
What evidence do you have

316
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,720
that Ling Chao is a scumbag?

317
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,480
It's said on the Internet…

318
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,510
On the Internet?

319
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,550
How can you

320
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,720
make a conclusion

321
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
on someone's character

322
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,440
only according to some trolls online?

323
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,960
Even the King of Hell can't do that.

324
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,750
Who are you?

325
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,200
Who are you to criticize us?

326
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,550
I'm just a kind citizen passing by.

327
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,200
Let me remind you.

328
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,840
You left your brains at home.

329
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:10,870
Besides,

330
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,270
I don't look stupid.

331
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,320
What's wrong with her?

332
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,320
Let's go. What a bad luck.

333
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,480
These people are not as smart as me.

334
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,870
How did they get into Yunhai?

335
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,440
Seriously.

336
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,480
There are so many people here.

337
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,200
It may not be inappropriate.

338
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,840
So what?

339
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,750
What?

340
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,320
My breakfast.

341
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,360
I need to eat something to blow off steam.

342
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,390
Xiao Tu.

343
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Morning, Senior.

344
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,750
Why don't you eat buns today?

345
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,510
You're right.

346
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,510
There are so many types of breakfast in the canteen.

347
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,840
I need to try more.

348
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
so that I can know

349
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,150
what I like the most.

350
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,360
You know each other?

351
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,750
He's my brother.

352
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,080
Brother?

353
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,870
Not related by blood.

354
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,480
What?

355
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,000
Rabbit.

356
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm going to the canteen.

357
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,120
Do you want me to bring you anything?

358
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,550
Where is she?

359
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,790
Xiao Tu?

360
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,360
She left at seven this morning.

361
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,510
She has no class today.

362
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,030
Why did she get up so early?

363
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,600
I don't know.

364
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
She just answered a call and left.

365
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,120
Looks like someone in our dorm

366
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,080
is going to start a relationship.

367
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,720
Are you going back to bed?

368
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,000
I've been reading a novel all night.

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,790
I didn't sleep.

370
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,630
You stayed up all night?

371
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,080
What novel is so good?

372
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,480
Ghost story.

373
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,360
It's better to read it at night.

374
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
You scared me.

375
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,510
That post about Ling Chao was deleted.

376
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,270
Really?

377
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,550
The administrator posted something

378
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,390
calling for rules online.

379
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,150
Really?

380
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,910
That means our work

381
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,320
is very effective.

382
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,360
Ling Chao must have stayed up all night because of this.

383
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,270
Well…

384
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,600
He only has me now.

385
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,200
I need to care more about him.

386
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,510
Was I so stupid

387
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
when I was fangirling?

388
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,320
Class is over.

389
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,840
I feel like I've slept for a century.

390
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,630
Then you slept for a whole century.

391
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,480
Sorry, Senior.

392
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,910
Did I affect you?

393
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,320
I'm sitting next to you.

394
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,080
I should be the one who got affected the most.

395
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,440
You deserve it.

396
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,870
Who asked you to let me come to class?

397
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,870
I definitely can't get it.

398
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,320
Xiao Tu.

399
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,630
Our department will have a meeting later

400
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,240
to prepare for the psychological health seminar.

401
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,240
You must come.

402
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,000
Okay.

403
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,630
What should I prepare?

404
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,440
Don't bother.

405
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,720
I'm sure you'll understand.

406
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,510
You have a series of meetings

407
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,080
for a seminar?

408
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,390
What for?

409
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,790
You know nothing.

410
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,200
By the way,

411
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,670
do you have a camera?

412
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,870
You'll need it for taking pictures.

413
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,320
I just enrolled.

414
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,360
I didn't have time to buy one.

415
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,270
It's okay.

416
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
I'll borrow one for you.

417
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,080
Okay, thank you.

418
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,150
Let's go.

419
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,510
Master.

420
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,720
Let's go.

421
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,200
Let's go.

422
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,550
You need to

423
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,160
learn to grow up.

424
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,069
Someone said he wouldn't go with us.

425
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,349
He wanted to go by himself.

426
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,109
Now what?

427
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,720
He's alone.

428
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Get lost!

429
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,790
Master, how about this?

430
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,110
Let me be fair.

431
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Now,

432
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,590
I have a reason to think that

433
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,680
the post on the forum

434
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,640
was talking about you.

435
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,160
You have someone in your heart

436
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,270
but are also surrounded by other girls.

437
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,110
You're quite a playboy.

438
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,160
Wukong.

439
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,030
That's why you're stubborn.

440
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,680
What's wrong?

441
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,920
Can't you tell?

442
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,640
What?

443
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,550
Xiao Tu

444
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,680
is Master's

445
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,960
childhood sweetheart.

446
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,480
So Xiao Tu is his childhood sweetheart.

447
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,960
I didn't know Master you like cute girls.

448
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,550
Master.

449
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,680
Didn't you always teach me

450
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,160
when we were in high school?

451
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,830
Why can't you do it yourself?

452
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,510
If you don't take action now,

453
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,550
Madam will be

454
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,160
taken away

455
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,160
by others.

456
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,240
By others.

457
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,750
By others.

458
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,350
By others.

459
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,000
He's angry.

460
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,510
Master.

461
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,070
Don't underestimate this table.

462
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,590
I borrowed this table from the doorkeeper.

463
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,270
I also asked around.

464
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,920
This is the winner seat.

465
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,720
Sitting here can help you get rich.

466
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,160
If you play cards in this seat,

467
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,270
even if you have bad cards,

468
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,310
you'll still win.

469
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,270
I have my own rhythm.

470
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,720
Aren't you afraid that if you fail,

471
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,310
you two won't be able to be friends?

472
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,240
Not being friends

473
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,070
or seeing Xiao Tu taken away by others?

474
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,480
Choose one.

475
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,920
Come on, Sha.

476
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,790
Sit here.

477
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,160
I think the most important thing now

478
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,110
is to find a perfect way

479
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,480
for master to attack and defend.

480
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,110
I think

481
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,310
we should start with

482
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,200
what she's interested in.

483
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,070
Based on my understanding of Xiao Tu,

484
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,350
you can't make mistakes by sending her food.

485
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,070
That's it?

486
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,110
Of course it's not just about food.

487
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,750
You can take this opportunity

488
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,720
to hint at your feelings for her

489
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,200
and make some romance.

490
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,350
I'll wait for your good news.

491
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,200
Hello.

492
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,000
Come downstairs.

493
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,590
I have something for you.

494
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,960
What is it?

495
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,440
You'll know when you get downstairs.

496
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
I don't want to change clothes.

497
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,960
Wait for me.

498
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,550
Ling Chao.

499
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,440
Here.

500
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,030
Put it in this basket.

501
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,550
Thanks.

502
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,200
It was our fault.

503
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,830
We shouldn't

504
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,240
treat her

505
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,070
like a normal girl.

506
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,720
What ideas do you have?

507
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,480
Today,

508
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,720
I'll teach you something.

509
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,350
Please go ahead.

510
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,310
I think

511
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,550
the point

512
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,960
is not the material itself,

513
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,440
but the form.

514
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,110
Wukong, tell us in detail.

515
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,400
Then I'll talk some details.

516
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,750
Master and Madam

517
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,680
grew up together.

518
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,270
What's the most important thing

519
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,030
between childhood sweethearts?

520
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,070
What is it?

521
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,640
The most important thing

522
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,310
is not asking each other whether you're full today

523
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,030
or if you're cold.

524
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,000
The most important thing

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,350
is also the hardest,

526
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,550
which is freshness.

527
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,880
You have a point.

528
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,200
Right.

529
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,000
So I think

530
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,680
Master should give her

531
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,270
a surprise.

532
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,830
Surprise?

533
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,920
Are you going to do magic again?

534
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,920
You only know a few tricks.

535
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,960
I'm sick of them.

536
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,680
What are you talking about?

537
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,680
The magic is old,

538
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,960
but the audience is new.

539
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,640
Master.

540
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,030
I'll teach you how to

541
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,550
to win her heart with cards.

542
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,000
First,

543
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,350
transfer your energy to these cards.

544
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,270
Blow on these cards.

545
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,510
Next,

546
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,400
it's time to witness a miracle.

547
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,110
Draw a card.

548
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,160
It's not difficult.

549
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,680
You just need to shuffle the cards in a proper way.

550
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,400
Well, look at the cards carefully.

551
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,480
No, it's not difficult.

552
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,550
I've seen it several times.

553
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,480
Let me show a trick for you.

554
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,510
No.

555
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,550
Master.

556
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,640
We were wrong.

557
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,440
I'm useless.

558
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,880
No.

559
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,590
It's my fault.

560
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,400
How dare I

561
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,920
learn from you?

562
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,400
It's okay, Master.

563
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,790
You failed for the first two times.

564
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,590
You still have

565
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,200
Guan Jiu.

566
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,030
Forget it.

567
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,200
He's not as good as us.

568
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,270
He can write codes.

569
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,880
Right.

570
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,680
Why don't we write codes?

571
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,030
Codes?

572
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,070
Why are you taking me out in the middle of the night?

573
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,350
Let's go to the activity center.

574
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,160
As a college student,

575
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,310
we should have some exercise.

576
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
It's closed already.

577
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,000
Come on.

578
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,200
I see.

579
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,400
We're out anyway.

580
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,510
It's such a nice day.

581
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,830
We can watch stars and the moon.

582
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,960
We can talk about poems, songs

583
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,400
and life philosophy.

584
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,790
Jiang Juanjuan,

585
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,920
Do you know I can tell conspiracy from your face?

586
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,590
Tell me.

587
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,790
What are you hiding from me?

588
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,270
No, I'm not.

589
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,830
You won't tell me?

590
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,310
Fine.

591
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:48,920
Okay.

592
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,000
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

593
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,440
Who turned off the light?

594
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,550
What's going on?

595
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,070
Look.

596
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,550
Who did this?

597
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,200
So romantic.

598
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,880
Who is it?

599
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,240
Happy birthday.

600
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,070
Thanks.

601
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,110
I treat him as my brother,

602
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,270
but he...

603
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,510
We grew up together.

604
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,440
We're kind of like childhood sweethearts to each other.

605
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
Our parents are also very close.

606
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,200
I always treat him

607
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,510
as my brother.

608
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,000
We were quite close when we were young.

609
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,590
Ling Chao, come downstairs to play.

610
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,310
But I don't know since when

611
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,750
he has refused to call me sister.

612
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,550
I don't have a sister like that.

613
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,640
We were together from kindergarten to high school.

614
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,590
Everything was normal,

615
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,920
but after the college entrance exam,

616
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,480
he seemed a little strange.

617
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,680
Sometimes he would get close to me when we were talking.

618
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,030
He would say something

619
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,400
that I've only seen

620
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,790
in dramas.

621
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,160
I want to see you every day.

622
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,440
You can't leave me alone.

623
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Not long ago,

624
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,550
he did many strange things

625
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,160
and even prepared a birthday surprise for me.

626
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,510
Happy birthday.

627
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,160
But more strangely,

628
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,750
I don't dislike

629
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,160
his behavior.

630
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,110
Why?

631
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,160
Well,

632
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,270
why are you looking for me today?

633
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,400
I have an appointment.

634
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,590
What?

635
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,200
Can't we eat together?

636
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,110
You've already given me a birthday present.

637
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,240
Well, it's my treat.

638
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,200
I'll do it myself.

639
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,720
I...

640
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,790
I can do it myself.

641
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,240
Stop following me.

642
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,310
Stop following me.

643
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,830
Stop following me.

644
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,960
Senior.

645
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,680
Why are you here?

646
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,510
Just now,

647
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,440
the salesperson came to school.

648
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,110
It really affects the school's morale.

649
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,640
We have to deal with it seriously.

650
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,310
I see.

651
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,070
I've got the camera for you.

652
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,590
Let's take some photos

653
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,480
and practice.

654
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,880
Make a heart gesture.

655
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,880
Like this.

656
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,030
Okay.

657
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,550
Ling Chao, what are you doing?

658
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,510
Hurry up.

659
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,400
It's okay, Xiao Tu.

660
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,070
If Ling Chao doesn't want to do it,

661
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,400
I can cooperate with you.

662
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
Smile.

663
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,880
Isn't that Ling Chao and Jianghu?

664
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,590
Smile.

665
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,680
Has the scumbag Ling Chao

666
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,350
reached his claws to men?

667
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,270
Gosh.

668
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,070
Is this a new way to prove Ling Chao's innocence?

669
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,640
What's there to shoot?

670
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
I think

671
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,440
scumbag and the innocent

672
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,680
make a good couple.

673
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
I'm shipping them.

674
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,030
Look at me.

675
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,960
Smile.

676
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,240
You got up so early today.

677
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,000
My dad found me a tutor.

678
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,590
He asked me to pass Level 4 in one go.

679
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,000
Level 4?

680
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,270
How could I forget that?

681
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,790
You've been

682
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,550
busy with love recently.

683
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,920
You don't have time for that.

684
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,720
What are you talking about?

685
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,750
I have to go.

686
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,350
Bye.

687
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
Hi, Yin Zihan.

688
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,480
Hi, good morning.

689
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,920
It's not time for class in China, right?

690
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I don’t' have class in the morning.

691
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,070
But I'm going to study in the library

692
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,590
this afternoon.

693
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,590
You've become so hardworking

694
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,510
when I'm not in China.

695
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,310
I'm impressed.

696
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm going to have a Level 4 exam.

697
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,030
I have to prepare for it.

698
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,880
Your English must become better abroad.

699
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,550
Can you tutor Jiang Juanjuan and me?

700
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,030
Right.

701
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,200
Then I don't have to

702
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,590
deal with the tutor my dad hired for me.

703
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,960
Okay.

704
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,350
You're thinking highly of me.

705
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,270
I'm in Asia.

706
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,720
We don't speak English here.

707
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,240
Besides,

708
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,790
aren't you in the same university as Ling Chao?

709
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,440
Why don't you ask him to teach you?

710
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,750
Listen.

711
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,000
Ling Chao and Xiao Tu

712
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,680
are very interesting recently.

713
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,240
You know what?

714
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,510
Ling Chao recently wrote a program for Xiao Tu.

715
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,160
I'm telling you.

716
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,310
He even used the whole building.

717
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,510
Don't talk nonsense.

718
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm telling you. It's very romantic.

719
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,030
Stop it.

720
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,350
I don't want to listen.

721
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,680
The connection is bad. I have to go.

722
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,030
What are you talking about?

723
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,000
Isn't that true?

724
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,790
No.

725
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,920
I'm sorry.

726
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,790
So many comments.

727
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,350
My goodness.

728
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,550
What kind of romance is this?

729
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,550
If this is not love,

730
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,200
what's there to be sad about?

731
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,720
I'm with you.

732
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
When you like someone,

733
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,830
you will think of him unconsciously.

734
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,110
Will I?

735
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,200
You'll start to think about your relationship.

736
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,750
I'll do it myself.

737
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,840
It must be your first love, right?

738
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,800
When you ask this question,

739
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,590
it means you've fallen in love with him.

740
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,440
Do I

741
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,030
like

742
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,760
Ling Chao?

743
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,070
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

744
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,630
Do the codes Master wrote

745
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,840
work like this?

746
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:44,960
Probably.

747
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,320
Who cares?

748
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,920
Master's programming teacher has approved it anyway.

749
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,190
Let's move on to the next step.
