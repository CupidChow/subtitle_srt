1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,310
F-a-v-o-u-r-i-t-e.

3
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,470
Favourite.

4
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,069
Hello?

5
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,310
What are you doing?

6
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,630
I'm reviewing English.

7
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,430
Why are you talking like a thief?

8
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,670
Aren't you sick of me bothering you?

9
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,110
Oh c'mon.

10
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,230
You already called.

11
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,190
Can you stop pretending to be polite?

12
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,950
Aren't you gilding the lily?

13
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,370
Can you save the proverb

14
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,710
for your writing?

15
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:23,910
I'll hang up if you have nothing to say.

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,550
Hang on.

17
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,070
The college entrance exam is coming soon.

18
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,750
Are you nervous?

19
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,350
I would be lying if I say I am not nervous.

20
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,030
But

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,110
I think I have no regrets in my senior year.

22
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,870
I'll just do my best.

23
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,630
I believe you can make it.

24
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,190
I have a question for you.

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,509
What is it?

26
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,310
Well...

27
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,190
Nothing.

28
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,470
Why are you so hesitant?

29
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,110
So weird.

30
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,789
I'll tell you after the exam.

31
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,910
Isn't it just a few days away from the exam?

32
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,350
Why can't you tell me now?

33
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,470
Yes.

34
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,830
It's only a few days away.

35
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,270
Don't study too hard.

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,550
Go to bed early.

37
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,350
Good night.

38
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:11,830
What do you mean?

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,750
Check if my head is square shaped.

40
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,350
No.

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,310
No.

42
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,070
Fine.

43
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,110
At the beginning of high school,

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,550
I took a photo here.

45
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,550
I thought

46
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,630
I'd taken another photo after graduation,

47
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,470
but I didn't expect

48
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,150
this day arrived so early.

49
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,710
It's really unreal to me.

50
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,910
After taking this photo,

51
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,470
we will drift apart.

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,470
Take it easy.

53
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,670
Sun Yat-Sen University

54
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,670
is not far from Yunhai University.

55
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,270
It's only two or three hours by car.

56
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,070
If you miss me,

57
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,230
come to see me there.

58
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,590
Why won’t you come to see me?

59
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,650
Haven't you been admitted by

60
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,790
Yunhai University?

61
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,630
Haven't you been admitted by

62
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,670
Sun Yat-Sen University?

63
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,390
Come on.

64
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,350
Stand in the middle.

65
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,910
Everybody, are you ready?

66
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,150
Look at me.

67
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,190
Look at the camera.

68
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,350
Three.

69
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,750
Two.

70
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,550
One.

71
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,550
Cheese.

72
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,630
Why are you crying?

73
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,310
What are you crying for?

74
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,870
Attention, everyone.

75
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,550
Xu Linglong's crying

76
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,070
is quite brilliant.

77
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,470
After 10 or 20 years,

78
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,910
when you look at this photo,

79
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,430
you may not remember

80
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,270
the names of your classmates.

81
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,829
But you will always remember

82
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,829
the ugliest student who is crying

83
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,110
is Xu Linglong.

84
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,950
It is ugly indeed.

85
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,870
It's ugly. Don't cry.

86
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,110
In writing,

87
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,990
what is this method called?

88
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,230
Foreshadowing.

89
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,310
Exactly.

90
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,030
Come on. Let's take a photo.

91
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,350
Smile, everyone.

92
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,790
Is your head teacher handsome?

93
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,270
No.

94
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,150
Rabbit.

95
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,630
Rabbit.

96
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,510
Did you sleep well?

97
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,390
Our student comes out.

98
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,590
Good.

99
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,230
So good.

100
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,149
Look at Rabbit.

101
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,110
Dad, mom.

102
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,630
I'm back.

103
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,709
Ling Chao, why are you back?

104
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,230
Your godmother is worried.

105
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,070
She asked Ling Chao to take two days off

106
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,710
to accompany you for the exam.

107
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,070
There's no need to take a leave.

108
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,830
Can Ling Chao take the exam for Rabbit?

109
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,790
Xiao Haishan, how can you say that?

110
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,550
Do you know many students

111
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,590
wear Chao's photos

112
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,710
as an amulet?

113
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,390
Pray for God's blessing.

114
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,630
We have a living God in our family.

115
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,590
Of course we need to pray for his blessing.

116
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,270
Am I right?

117
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,390
With the accompany of our living God,

118
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,150
you will definitely make it.

119
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,430
-Right, Rabbit? -Yes.

120
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:48,990
Have you got everything with you?

121
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,350
Okay, check it quickly.

122
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,470
Identity card, admission card, sign pen,

123
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,950
pencil, eraser.

124
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,790
Yes.

125
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,190
Okay, yes. Let's check it again.

126
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,830
Yes. Check it.

127
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,510
Okay.

128
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,110
Yes.

129
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,750
Did you wear the purple underwear

130
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,510
I bought for you?

131
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,150
Mom, that's too ugly.

132
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,750
How can you say that?

133
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,190
I bought it for you.

134
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,710
There's a check mark on it.

135
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,670
It brings good luck. You must wear it.

136
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,150
Let's go. I'll wear it.

137
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,950
Don't you know that underwear is so popular?

138
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,230
Many moms bought them.

139
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,390
Have you guys

140
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,030
worn it?

141
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,230
Yes, of course.

142
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,110
Certainly we have worn it.

143
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,270
Yes, definitely.

144
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,950
Have you all worn it?

145
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,910
Yes.

146
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,550
No matter what we do,

147
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,030
we stay

148
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,910
and work together

149
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,070
and strive for the best.

150
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,390
Strive for the best!

151
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,230
Strive for the best.

152
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,070
Let's have breakfast.

153
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,430
Yes. Come on.

154
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,390
My dear daughter, have a seat.

155
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,190
Try the breakfast I made for you. 100 marks.

156
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,550
-100-mark breakfast! -Yes.

157
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,550
100 marks. Try it.

158
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,110
Is it good?

159
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,110
Fine.

160
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,710
You guys try it.

161
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,390
Don't look at me like this.

162
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,270
We've already eaten. You...

163
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,630
Yes, enjoy your breakfast.

164
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,790
Yes, eat them all.

165
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,710
Dad.

166
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,350
The score of each Liberal Arts exam is 100,

167
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,310
but it's 150 for Chinese, Maths and English.

168
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,270
One.

169
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,830
The number five is missing.

170
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,070
Five is missing. Xiao.

171
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,070
Go looking for it. Five is missing.

172
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,350
Do you have any food that sounds like five?

173
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,310
Turtle!

174
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,710
Steamed turtle?

175
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,790
It can be steamed with soft-shelled turtle.

176
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,830
Do you have wax apple?

177
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,030
Wax apple, how about five-kernel mooncake?

178
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,110
Exactly, five kernel.

179
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,870
It's not five kernel. How about these...

180
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,550
Not five kernel. They're not here.

181
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,510
Five-kernel mooncake is not here.

182
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,190
Not here.

183
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,670
What should we do?

184
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,390
Got it.

185
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,870
Let's dance.

186
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,470
Dance?

187
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,910
Yeah, I'm good at dancing.

188
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,310
Let's dance together.

189
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,070
Let's dance. Come on.

190
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,670
Why don't we ride a bike?

191
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,150
With your luck,

192
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,990
on such an important day,

193
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,150
your bike will have a flat tire

194
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,550
or fall into a manhole cover

195
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,030
which couldn't be pulled out.

196
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,710
So it's safer to walk.

197
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,550
My luck is not that bad.

198
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,110
I think you're right.

199
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,730
It's not surprising

200
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,830
that this happened to you.

201
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:49,830
Sit here.

202
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,550
This dog has a bad stomach.

203
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,270
Maybe you should just wear my shoes.

204
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,590
Don't tell me you have athlete's foot.

205
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,310
Yes I have.

206
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,910
Ten-year athlete's foot.

207
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,390
Dogshit or athlete's foot.

208
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,870
It's up to you.

209
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,430
Okay.

210
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,430
Try walking a few steps.

211
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,070
Let's go.

212
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,670
Okay, give me my bag.

213
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,190
Wait.

214
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,390
What?

215
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,790
Be sure to read the questions carefully.

216
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,990
Sometimes you know how to solve a problem,

217
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,390
but you're careless.

218
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,270
You must be careful.

219
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,270
Besides,

220
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,190
if you can't solve a problem,

221
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,550
just skip it first.

222
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,470
Don't get stuck there.

223
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,790
Maybe when analyzing for the second time,

224
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,910
you'll have new ideas.

225
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,710
Okay.

226
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,390
What else?

227
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,270
By the way,

228
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,230
the most important thing is

229
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,990
that check your answer card carefully.

230
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,510
Last year, there is someone in our class...

231
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,790
Stop it.

232
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,550
You've said it too many times.

233
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,750
I've said it many times.

234
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,590
I don't know if you've listened to me.

235
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,670
But you must remember,

236
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,430
don't be nervous.

237
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,430
Also,

238
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,990
you've taken so many exams.

239
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,770
The college entrance exam

240
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,390
is just one of them.

241
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,549
I think you're the one who's nervous.

242
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,990
You've become so talkative all of a sudden.

243
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,309
Don't worry.

244
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,070
I'm not nervous at all.

245
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,750
Just wait for me outside.

246
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,750
I'm leaving.

247
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,270
Good luck.

248
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,750
Thank you.

249
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,510
Hello.

250
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,430
We are from Yidong Event Program Team.

251
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,230
I have a few simple questions for you.

252
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:59,510
I saw you seeing off a girl to the exam.

253
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,430
You look very close to each other.

254
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,990
Is she your sister?

255
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,350
No.

256
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,070
Today is the first day

257
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,830
of the college entrance exam.

258
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,030
Do you have any good wishes

259
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,910
for all the candidates?

260
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,350
Good luck everyone.

261
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,750
What a simple and powerful blessing.

262
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,630
The exam is finally over.

263
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,950
The last question is too difficult.

264
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,030
So difficult.

265
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,110
The college entrance exam is over.

266
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,790
Another school year has passed.

267
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,870
Everything in front of me

268
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,150
is familiar but also unfamiliar.

269
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,430
I seem to have

270
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,350
a very long dream.

271
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:10,830
A dream like a TV series.

272
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,670
Teacher.

273
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,870
In my dream,

274
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,230
I still remember

275
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,830
those math problems that I can't understand

276
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,630
no matter how hard I try.

277
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,910
And those inseparable friends.

278
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,750
Those gossips we talk

279
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,870
when we gather together.

280
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,070
Those first prizes that I can't get

281
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,590
no matter how hard I study.

282
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,110
Of course,

283
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,550
in my dream there are also delicious snacks

284
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,150
that we share with classmates.

285
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,670
Everything seems to have happened yesterday.

286
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,150
I finally understand,

287
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,510
the youthful time

288
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,710
is really like a one-way train.

289
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,150
It takes us all the way to the future.

290
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,630
We have enjoyed the tenderest spring breeze.

291
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,070
And we have seen

292
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,430
the most spectacular views in life.

293
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,110
However, this train can never

294
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,270
carry us back.

295
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,070
At this moment, I suddenly realized

296
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,510
this may be the last time for some people

297
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,350
to see each other in their lives.

298
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,110
After today,

299
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,910
I can no longer run down the corridor

300
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,150
in this school uniform.

301
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,110
And I can never enjoy

302
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,590
the sunset on the way home from school.

303
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,030
We will never be 16 or 17 years old anymore.

304
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,990
I know

305
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,550
that no matter how long a TV series is,

306
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,110
there will be an ending.

307
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,390
No matter how real a dream is,

308
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,750
it'll be waken up by the morning alarm.

309
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,590
I've only just left

310
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,710
but I'm already missing

311
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,630
those days

312
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,910
which are once-in-a-lifetime.

313
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,470
Is that her?

314
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,590
Rabbit.

315
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,390
How was the exam?

316
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,150
Not bad.

317
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,110
I think it's good.

318
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,510
If you come out later,

319
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,710
the ice cream's gonna melt.

320
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,310
Everyone else gives flowers.

321
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,790
Why are you giving ice cream?

322
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,190
You can't eat flowers.

323
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,590
You're right. You know me best.

324
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,510
Why did you come out so late?

325
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,790
How was the last exam?

326
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,910
Not bad.

327
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:12,870
The exam is over.

328
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,470
No more questions.

329
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,630
Yes.

330
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,670
Xiao, how about this?

331
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,070
I've booked a private room in restaurant.

332
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,470
Let's celebrate together tonight.

333
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,110
Mom.

334
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,110
Look at that tall and handsome boy there.

335
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,870
He was a senior in my school last year.

336
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,870
He's always the best.

337
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,190
Really exceptional.

338
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,790
Really? He's so amazing.

339
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,790
I didn't even notice

340
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,310
that you've grown so tall.

341
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,910
The look on your face

342
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,550
is idiotic.

343
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,470
By the way, let's take a photo together.

344
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,310
We didn't take when Ling Chao was graduated.

345
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,710
I've brought the camera here.

346
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,830
Okay, let's take a photo.

347
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,350
Get someone.

348
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,270
Come on, mate.

349
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,870
Could take a photo for us?

350
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,950
Of course, auntie .

351
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,590
Thank you.

352
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,350
-You're welcome. -Thank you.

353
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,030
Don't mention it.

354
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,550
Stand closer.

355
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,230
Three, two, one.

356
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,910
Cheese.

357
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,830
Dad, mom.

358
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,430
My ass is turning purple.

359
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,230
Take it easy.

360
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,510
Why are you making a fuss?

361
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,390
That's the color fading.

362
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,630
-Take it easy. -You...

363
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,390
You are wearing it too?

364
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,110
Did the colour fade?

365
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,950
Why is that window open?

366
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,870
Yes, go and take a look.

367
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,510
Okay.

368
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,230
Godfather, godmother.

369
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,390
I can't take too much time off from school.

370
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,030
I'm leaving now.

371
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,150
-Don't leave. -Okay.

372
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,030
You're wearing it too, aren't you?

373
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,630
Let me see.

374
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,430
Let me see your underwear.

375
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,030
What are you doing?

376
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,670
Let me see.

377
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,590
Hey, what are you touching?

378
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,070
Are you crazy?

379
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,470
Let me see if your ass is purple.

380
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,590
-What are you doing? -Let me see.

381
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,030
-Are you crazy? -Let me see.

382
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,630
What's wrong?

383
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:41,950
Don't move.

384
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,190
No. We're not wearing it.

385
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,150
You're the only one wearing it.

386
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,390
Well,

387
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,990
we're going to have a meeting?

388
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,830
I'll be there soon.

389
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,150
Xiao, let's play it next time.

390
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,870
Okay. Bye.

391
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,310
Next time. Okay.

392
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,310
What a pity.

393
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,270
You liars!

394
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:55,990
Yes.

395
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,870
Yes, that...

396
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,870
I'm not the only liar.

397
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,630
You're the only one I've told about this.

398
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,670
How did she know?

399
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,710
Well, when you called me just now,

400
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,230
I was already at your door.

401
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,950
I laughed too loudly

402
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,550
and she heard it.

403
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,550
How did he know that my ass turned purple?

404
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,630
Won't I be embarrassed?

405
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,390
I don't know.

406
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,110
I just knew it.

407
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,550
I've stepped into your home after that.

408
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,910
I didn't have time to commit the crime.

409
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,350
By the way, why are you here?

410
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,510
I’m here to give out wedding candies.

411
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,270
Wedding candies?

412
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,590
Are you getting married?

413
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,430
It's not me.

414
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,790
It's Mr. Xue.

415
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,510
Mr. Xue and Ms. Xiao are getting engaged.

416
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,390
Mr. Xue?

417
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,950
Yes.

418
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,950
He said

419
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,190
by the time he gets married,

420
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,630
his students can't get together.

421
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,110
So he asked me

422
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,710
to give out candies to the students nearby

423
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,270
to share the good news in advance.

424
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,030
I didn't expect Xue to win Ms. Xiao's heart.

425
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,870
Of course.

426
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,550
They were childhood sweethearts.

427
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,630
I heard

428
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,310
that in order to win Ms. Xiao's heart,

429
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,750
Xue went to the same university with her

430
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,390
in spite of the objections of his family.

431
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,550
But Ms. Xiao is one year older than him.

432
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,990
So what?

433
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,350
There is no such a rule

434
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,350
that a girl can't marry

435
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,630
the boy who is one year younger than her.

436
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,070
Xue Xiaoxiao. Xiao Xiaoxue.

437
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,710
It sounds like couple names.

438
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,850
Ling Chao and I

439
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,190
were childhood sweethearts too.

440
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,310
We share couple names.

441
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,030
It doesn't sound like couple names.

442
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,750
You are not good at Chinese, right?

443
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,110
We both have "Ling" in our names.

444
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,550
Ling...

445
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,070
Ling Chao and Xiao Tu...

446
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,470
They both have two characters in names.

447
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,190
One is "rabbit" and one is "grass".

448
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,870
Rabbits eat grass by their nest.

449
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:43,630
Perfect match.

450
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,990
You two can argue.

451
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,830
Why do you mention me?

452
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,590
You...

453
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,829
596.

454
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,950
Rabbit, you're amazing.

455
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,270
Look.

456
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,310
Purple underwear brought good luck, right?

457
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,069
Yes.

458
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,910
Good girl.

459
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,950
You are the first college student

460
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,430
in Xiao's family.

461
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,190
Yes. Great.

462
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,349
20 points higher than I expected.

463
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,170
What was the minimum passing score

464
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:21,790
of Yunhai University last year?

465
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,750
601.

466
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,790
How about

467
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,350
considering other universities?

468
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,470
Yes.

469
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,470
Medical University.

470
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,470
Medical University is good.

471
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,390
It's good for girls to study medicine.

472
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,110
Yes.

473
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,110
Let me think about it.

474
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,950
It's good.

475
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,710
Hello.

476
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,230
Did you check the exam results?

477
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,590
Is it bad?

478
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,310
596.

479
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,310
Isn't it nice?

480
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,430
The exam this year is quite difficult.

481
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,390
Your already did very well.

482
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,710
My score is five points behind

483
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,030
the minimum passing score of last year.

484
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,070
Ling Chao,

485
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,390
I can't go to Yunhai University, can I?

486
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,510
Take it easy.

487
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,190
Yunhai offered a journalism major this year

488
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,590
and it expanded enrollment.

489
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,070
The minimum passing score

490
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,830
is not very likely to rise this year.

491
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,390
You could apply for journalism major

492
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,990
be subject to professional adjustment.

493
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,830
You have a good chance of being admitted.

494
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,950
I don't agree.

495
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,850
Choosing university

496
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:57,750
is the most important in her life.

497
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,510
This time,

498
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,110
I can't let you mess things up.

499
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,190
How can you say that?

500
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,510
With her score,

501
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,150
if she wants to go to a better university,

502
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,910
she must go further away from home.

503
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,910
Don't you worry about her?

504
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,430
That's right.

505
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,950
Give it a try.

506
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,230
Maybe she could be admitted.

507
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,110
Besides,

508
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,430
these two kids will have companions

509
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,310
when they're together.

510
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,190
Yeah.

511
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,630
Ling Chao can take care of Little Rabbit.

512
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,350
Right?

513
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,310
Yes.

514
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,230
Xiao.

515
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,350
We are not familiar with

516
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,550
the university application process,

517
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,710
but the kids are familiar with it.

518
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,550
I think

519
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,350
we should let them make their own decisions.

520
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,270
Let her decide it.

521
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,750
Our Xiao Tu

522
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,870
has been following

523
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,710
Ling Chao's step since she was a child.

524
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,990
She will do whatever Ling Chao says.

525
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,310
I don't care

526
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,670
if it's anything else,

527
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,910
but applying for unversity is different.

528
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,310
I couldn't let her mess it up.

529
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,830
If we make a mistake on this,

530
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,630
who will regret for her?

531
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,710
Xiao Tu.

532
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,990
Let me ask you.

533
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,070
What do you think?

534
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,910
Don't be disturbed.

535
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,190
I want to apply for Yunhai University.

536
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,270
I did listen to

537
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,430
Ling Chao's analysis and advice,

538
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,630
but I didn't make this decision

539
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,470
under his influence.

540
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,470
The decision was made through consideration.

541
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,430
I can fill in several applications anyway.

542
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,550
I want to take Yunhai as my first choice.

543
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,190
Also, Journalism is my favourite major.

544
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,070
Dad.

545
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,750
This is the first time

546
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,910
I've made a big decision on my own.

547
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,630
I want to give it a try.

548
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,390
Okay?

549
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,710
Why are you in such a hurry?

550
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,150
Are you in a hurry to go home?

551
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,710
Are you really going back home?

552
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,470
Yes.

553
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,030
The train is in two hours.

554
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,030
No wonder you handed in exam paper early.

555
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,270
Master.

556
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,670
You made me anxious.

557
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,670
I didn't get the last question right.

558
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,670
Where is Guanjiu?

559
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,910
He won't come out

560
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,270
until the last minute.

561
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,350
Master is in a hurry to see his child bride.

562
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,710
What are you doing?

563
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,830
Are you in a hurry to reincarnate?

564
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,030
Child bride?

565
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,270
A beauty brings misfortune.

566
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,950
Beauty is overstated,

567
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,390
but misfortune is true.

568
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,030
I'm not at home.

569
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,870
I don't know if she can handle it herself.

570
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,070
I'm leaving.

571
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,270
See you next semester.

572
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,150
Okay.

573
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,150
Bye.

574
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,750
Execuse me.

575
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,430
Where is Master going?

576
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,230
Where is he going?

577
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,030
Come here, Sha.

578
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,350
Master was taken away by a demon.

579
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,510
Taken away?

580
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,470
So how's your application?

581
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,190
Just so so.

582
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,750
What is so so?

583
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,910
Well,

584
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,830
my dad didn't agree.

585
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:26,830
Didn't agree.

586
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,550
Have you argued with him?

587
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,150
Didn't you apply for Yunhai University?

588
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,950
Why are you yelling suddenly?

589
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,350
Did you apply for other university in Yunhai City?

590
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,070
Even if it’s not Yunhai University,

591
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,270
you could apply for another college there.

592
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,910
Why do you insist

593
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,990
to let me go to Yunhai?

594
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,270
Because...

595
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,190
Because I want to see you every day.

596
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,030
Didn't we used to see each other every day?

597
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,790
Because we used to see each other every day,

598
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,910
I've already taken your accompany

599
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,270
as granted.

600
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:12,190
The past dozen years

601
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,230
have been wasted by us.

602
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,230
I want to cherish every moment from now on.

603
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,190
Rabbit.

604
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,270
Do you understand what I mean?

605
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,470
You're really weird.

606
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,750
To avoid me in high school,

607
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,430
you skipped a grade.

608
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,630
Now you want me

609
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,830
to go to the same university with you.

610
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,510
Didn't you say we are gonna be together?

611
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,510
Even if we're not in the same university,

612
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,190
we can still meet during festivals.

613
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,150
Why festivals?

614
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,030
What if I say

615
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,350
I want to see you every day?

616
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,030
You...

617
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,310
I can't swim.

618
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,910
You...

619
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:41,670
You...

620
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:42,510
The water is shallow.

621
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,590
You can stand up.

622
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,990
You know this place too?

623
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,430
This place is really good.

624
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,190
What do you want to eat?

625
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,950
Help yourself. My treat.

626
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,590
Thank you so much.

627
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,550
The tiramisu is yummy.

628
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,710
The Dark Forest Cake looks good too.

629
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,950
Which one do you want?

630
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,150
You can order them both.

631
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,070
Both.

632
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,790
This is for you.

633
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,310
How do you know today is my birthday?

634
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,710
Isn't your birthday over?

635
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,150
June 20.

636
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,550
Today is my lunar birthday.

637
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,350
How do you know that?

638
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,670
Let me see.

639
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,150
You give me a ball.

640
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,790
What do you mean?

641
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,150
This is the graduation gift for you.

642
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,670
I see.

643
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,590
You mean

644
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,510
although Yunhai and Qingbei are far away,

645
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,790
but as the earth is a ball,

646
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,790
we will finally meet again someday.

647
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:10,790
Yes.

648
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,510
One of my other friends

649
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,590
said that too.

650
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,710
I think it's so romantic.

651
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,030
Jia Siwen,

652
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,670
you're so thoughtful.

653
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,810
I didn't get admitted by

654
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,710
Sun Yat-Sen University,

655
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,550
but Yunhai is also good.

656
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,830
I can be together with Xiao Tu.

657
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,390
You don't need to comfort me.

658
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,910
I'm not sad at all.

659
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,310
This ball is really cute.

660
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,550
Thank you.

661
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,430
I like it so much.

662
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,390
Xiao.

663
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:41,910
Congratulations.

664
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,910
Congratulations.

665
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,390
Congratulations. Why do you bring me gifts?

666
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,910
Just bring your mouth is fine.

667
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,270
Don't say that.

668
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,510
Rabbit is the prospective journalism student

669
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,590
at Yunhai University.

670
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,550
We must celebrate it.

671
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,870
To be admitted.

672
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,070
To be admitted.

673
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,070
The admission letter hasn't arrived yet.

674
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,510
What's the difference?

675
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,670
It's already released online.

676
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,270
Who dares not to admit our Little Rabbit?

677
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,910
Exactly.

678
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,870
Xiao,

679
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,030
Wenhui said

680
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,430
she wanted to hold a roadside banquet

681
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,710
in our community,

682
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,030
but I think

683
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,470
this is too ostentatious.

684
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,950
Too ostentatious.

685
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,150
There are many candidates in the community.

686
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,030
If you hold a roadside banquet,

687
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,270
won't you make a fool of yourself?

688
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,590
Change your shoes.

689
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,510
Okay.

690
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,870
Godfather, godmother.

691
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,750
Where is Ling Chao?

692
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,750
He caught a cold. I didn't ask him to come.

693
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,070
He didn't want to infect us.

694
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,950
Hasn't he had a cold for a while?

695
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,710
Exactly.

696
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,470
It's summer now.

697
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,070
How can he catch a cold?

698
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,230
But he's getting better.

699
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,630
At the end of a cold,

700
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,990
it is most contagious.

701
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,030
Don't worry about him.

702
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,590
Let's eat and drink.

703
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,550
When we go back home,

704
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,950
we'll bring him some leftovers.

705
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:40,590
That's it.

706
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,910
What are you talking about?

707
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,750
Here, the last dish. Come on.

708
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,070
Great! Wonderful!

709
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,550
I'll sit next to Rabbit. Sit here.

710
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,230
Have a seat.

711
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,630
Everything is so delicious.

712
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,670
Everything you cook

713
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,230
is delicious.

714
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,830
Yes.

715
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,790
Cheers!

716
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,910
Come on. Let's celebrate.

717
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,590
Yeah.

718
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,430
Together.

719
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:58,270
Come on. Together.

720
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,750
How about

721
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,750
giving him a call?

722
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,310
It's me pushing him into the lake.

723
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,790
But if he hadn't come closer,

724
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:13,310
how could I have done it?

725
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,910
How can a normal person

726
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,070
have a cold for two weeks?

727
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,830
How about

728
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,550
visiting him to see if he's fine.

729
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,110
Cheers. Another drink.

730
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,910
Another one. Come on.

731
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,190
Okay. Bottoms up.

732
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,590
Dad, mom, I need to go out.

733
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,030
Where are you going so late?

734
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,470
You...

735
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,630
Be careful.

736
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,630
Ling Chao.

737
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,110
Are you home?

738
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,150
Ling Chao.

739
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,550
Why he is not here?

740
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,910
Ling Chao.

741
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,710
I can't believe the book is here.

742
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,350
Here it is.

743
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,950
The cold and fiery atmosphere of the night

744
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,310
is gradually approaching.

745
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,310
The wall behind her is cold.

746
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,550
There's no turning back.

747
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,190
No.

748
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,190
Why should I hide?

749
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,350
Bath towel?

750
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,310
Clothes?

751
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:22,390
There's...

752
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,550
Oh no.

753
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,630
How long are you going to stay under my bed?

754
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,230
How did you know I was under the bed?

755
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,470
Next time when you act like a thief,

756
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,910
remember to hide your slippers.

757
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,310
Why did you take off your clothes?

758
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,830
Are you a pervert?

759
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,790
Who took off clothes?

760
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,110
I was going to wash them.

761
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,190
Are you kidding me?

762
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,830
Can you be reasonable?

763
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,310
You attacked me

764
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,750
but don't allow me to take revenge on you?

765
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,030
That's because

766
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,870
you were acting weird that day.

767
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,630
I felt a little guilty,

768
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,630
so I came to see if you've recovered.

769
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,550
You're pretending to be sick.

770
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,190
What are you tallking about?

771
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,230
I go into the water every day,

772
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,470
so I haven't recovered from the cold.

773
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,030
Why did you go into the water?

774
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,310
I'm learning swimming.

775
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,470
If

776
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,670
you throw me into the lake again,

777
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,390
what should I do?

778
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,710
Are you crazy?

779
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,190
Get up, you two.

780
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,350
We have to set off.

781
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,710
Can't get out of bed.

782
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,710
Dad, mom,

783
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,510
I don't want you to see me off.

784
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,870
I decided to go there myself.

785
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,550
It is my first time

786
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,190
to go on a long journey alone.

787
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,830
Xiao, your daughter ran away.

788
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,990
But don't worry.

789
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,390
I have paddles of happiness and wisdom.

790
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,790
I'll call you when I get there.

791
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,630
Love you.

792
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,150
Xiao Tu.

793
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:24,850
Today is the first day

794
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,590
of the college entrance exam.

795
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,490
Do you have any good wishes

796
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,390
for all the candidates?

797
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,470
Good luck everyone.

798
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,630
What a simple and powerful blessing.

799
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,790
What do you expect

800
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,070
from that girl?

801
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,550
I hope she can be admitted by my university.
