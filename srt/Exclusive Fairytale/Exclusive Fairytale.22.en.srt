1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,950
This is my head.

3
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,630
Hello?

4
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,710
What?

5
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:26,990
You're awake.

6
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,150
Be careful. Don't get up.

7
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,230
What happened to my legs?

8
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,190
What happened?

9
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,470
Calm down.

10
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,229
Calm down.

11
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,550
Xu Linglong, right? Calm down.

12
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,750
Don't move.

13
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,910
Doctor. Doctor.

14
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,710
I can't feel my legs.

15
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,150
Don't worry.

16
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,350
It's just an ankle fracture.

17
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,670
And a minor concussion.

18
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,150
A fracture?

19
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,509
No. I need to dance.

20
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:51,910
It's okay. We still have time.

21
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,070
Take your time. Miss.

22
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,070
You can't even walk.

23
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,310
Don't think about dancing.

24
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,590
Take a rest for two or three months

25
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,390
and see if you can fully recover.

26
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,830
What about the graduation performance?

27
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,070
We still have time.

28
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,790
It's okay.

29
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,030
If you want to achieve long-term development

30
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,110
in dancing,

31
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,590
you must take a good rest.

32
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,509
It will be a serious problem if you can't fully recover.

33
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,030
I heard you fell from a high place.

34
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,710
Any other discomfort?

35
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,830
Like your limbs, joints, and thoracic vertebra?

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,510
Doctor.

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,030
I suddenly feel

38
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,829
chest distress. And I'm short of breath.

39
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:26,230
My heart is beating faster.

40
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,150
This is the psychological effect.

41
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,030
How about this?

42
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,070
Take a rest for several days.

43
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,670
If you still don't feel well, do an overall physical examination.

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,750
Call me if anything happens.

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,990
Okay, thank you. Doctor.

46
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,390
No.

47
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,750
Hurry back and practice.

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,590
How can you practice like this?

49
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,070
I'm asking you to hurry back and practice.

50
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,510
My legs are injured.

51
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,030
The teacher will choose a new lead dancer.

52
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,470
I'm okay with you being the lead dancer.

53
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,790
I can't accept others to be the lead dancer.

54
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,310
But if I go,

55
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,350
who will take care of you?

56
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,230
I will.

57
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,710
What?

58
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,230
After I received your call,

59
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,990
I came here without eating.

60
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,630
You didn't eat.

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,990
You think I ate?

62
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,630
Do you know how to take care of a patient?

63
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,710
You don't even know what food you should buy.

64
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,790
Don't push your luck.

65
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,310
Do you think

66
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,230
I called you here because I like you?

67
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,990
My cousin is on a business trip.

68
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,270
Xia Mo has a rehearsal.

69
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,990
Jiang Juanjuan went to Beijing.

70
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,710
I called you because I have no choice.

71
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,470
So you know you have no choice.

72
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,510
Look at your attitude towards me.

73
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,070
Don't worry.

74
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,550
I won't starve you.

75
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,470
Ling Chao went to buy food.

76
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,430
He'll be here soon.

77
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,230
Do you have any cosmetics in your bag?

78
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,270
A lipstick will do. Hurry up.

79
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,590
If I knew Ling Chao would come,

80
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,190
I should have put on full makeup.

81
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,270
Do you

82
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,430
really like Ling Chao so much?

83
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,790
He is so excellent.

84
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,990
It's hard not to like him.

85
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,510
Don't forget

86
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,350
Ling Chao and I grew up together too.

87
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,790
After I was with Ling Chao,

88
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,630
I don't think you hate me that much.

89
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,870
Who said that?

90
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,910
I hate you so much.

91
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,750
I don't know what's so good about you.

92
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,870
Ling Chao has only been willing to play with you since childhood.

93
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,910
Getting closer to him is more difficult for me than winning a dance competition,

94
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,190
even just a little bit.

95
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,510
Then why do you still like him?

96
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,590
Are you a masochist?

97
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,990
I thought about this a long time ago.

98
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,550
Why did I fall into a fantasy

99
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,270
and keep feeling touched?

100
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,590
Then I realized that

101
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,710
what I like

102
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,550
is just the feeling of liking him.

103
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,430
Actually, I realized the reality long ago.

104
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,350
But I wouldn't admit it.

105
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,430
I think if I admit I don't like him,

106
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,190
I will betray my past

107
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,270
and my persistence for so many years.

108
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,310
If one day,

109
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,830
you really get married,

110
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,230
I will still give you my sincere wishes.

111
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,910
But don't think about the money.

112
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,670
Without Ling Chao,

113
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,750
we should be good friends who keep no secrets from each other, right?

114
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,909
Who said that?

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,909
I don't want to be friends

116
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,590
with simple-minded people with well-developed limbs.

117
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,909
Your limbs are quite simple,

118
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,310
but you're not smart.

119
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,510
Ling Chao.

120
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,909
You're here.

121
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,390
You must be hungry.

122
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,790
I bought some dishes with a light flavor.

123
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,070
I also bought bone soup.

124
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,470
Thank you.

125
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,710
Go prepare the food.

126
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,030
Ling Chao.

127
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,030
Can you carry me to the bathroom?

128
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,150
I need to wash my hands before eating.

129
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,830
I'm strong. Let me carry you.

130
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,630
No, my legs.

131
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,390
Ling Chao, help!

132
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,990
You are so heavy.

133
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:31,910
Should we keep walking?

134
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,350
You need to accompany her, right?

135
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,150
Let's walk a little longer.

136
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,590
It's been a while since I took a walk with you.

137
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,310
You will go on another business trip tomorrow.

138
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,750
Just tell me if you don't want to leave me.

139
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,150
Walk me back to the hospital.

140
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,470
And I'll walk you out.

141
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,190
I suddenly feel a little emotional.

142
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,550
In your opinion,

143
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,710
do other people think it's easy for us

144
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,590
to be together?

145
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,430
Yes.

146
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,670
Having a relationship is different from what's in TV series.

147
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,030
Many things that can be explained clearly

148
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,830
eventually became misunderstandings.

149
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,350
Because

150
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,870
not all couples are like us.

151
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,870
We've been accumulating our love

152
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,230
since childhood.

153
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,670
You're right.

154
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,950
Because we both have given each other the sense of security.

155
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,030
Ling Chao,

156
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,110
how did you successfully pursue Xiao Tu?

157
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,909
Can you teach me?

158
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,470
You're asking the right person.

159
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,550
First,

160
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,710
you need to

161
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,670
have a perfect plan.

162
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,190
If you want to pursue a girl,

163
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,110
you have to start from

164
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,990
what she's interested in.

165
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,590
From what I know about Jiang Juanjuan,

166
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,230
giving her flowers is the right thing to do.

167
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,950
You put it in this basket.

168
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,870
The situation of you and Jiang Juanjuan is different.

169
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,630
You two have emotional foundation.

170
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,870
So it's not enough

171
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,590
to just give her what she likes.

172
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,790
You need to create a feeling of freshness.

173
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,830
It's too simple.

174
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,270
It's done just by shuffling the cards, right?

175
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,070
Lastly,

176
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,910
and most importantly,

177
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,230
you need to write code.

178
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,710
Write code?

179
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,070
It's indeed difficult for you.

180
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,110
You can do something else

181
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,710
to show your personal charm.

182
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,350
Come on.

183
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,390
Thank you.

184
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,150
Jun.

185
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,270
I've sent the first draft of the interview to your email.

186
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,510
I'd like to ask for your advice.

187
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,790
Please let me know

188
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,670
if there is anything that needs to be improved.

189
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,470
No.

190
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,030
Well.

191
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,230
I still want to ask you a few questions about this interview.

192
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,190
It's not necessary.

193
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,390
Your interview won't be used.

194
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,510
It's just the first draft.

195
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,350
I can modify it if it needs improvement.

196
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,470
You chose someone with no fame

197
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,630
to be your interviewee.

198
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,950
It will only lower the quality of our show.

199
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,990
I watched every episode

200
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,070
of the program.

201
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,070
It started with small potatoes.

202
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,350
According to the audience rating,

203
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,310
those touching little stories can better move the audience.

204
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,070
You also said it was in the past.

205
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,470
Are you going to reason with me

206
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,150
with outdated data and things?

207
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,030
That's not what I meant.

208
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,510
What I want to say is

209
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,030
maybe it's more touching

210
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,150
if we focus on the authenticity sometimes.

211
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,230
Am I the leader or are you the leader?

212
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,590
Know your place.

213
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,590
I'm the person in charge of this program.

214
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,910
You have to listen to me.

215
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,830
Stay if you can do your job.

216
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,870
Leave if you can't.

217
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,470
Hello, Jia Siwen.

218
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,390
Have you eaten?

219
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,190
You didn't take the initiative to call me.

220
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,430
Okay, I forgive you.

221
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,430
I learned a new recipe recently.

222
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,590
Xiao Tu taught me.

223
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,990
French fries with ice cream.

224
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,990
At first, I thought

225
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,430
it was unsavoury.

226
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,750
But then I realized

227
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,710
it's really delicious.

228
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,750
You can try it later.

229
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,590
Trust me.

230
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,990
Try it later. Please.

231
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,270
Jia Siwen, listen.

232
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,630
There are many couples around here.

233
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,310
They are lovey-dovey here every day.

234
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,070
You see that?

235
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,110
We'll do the same next time you come.

236
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,070
They didn't see me.

237
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,670
Jia Siwen.

238
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,430
Are you doing an experiment again?

239
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,510
Xiao Tu and I are hanging out the quilts.

240
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,990
Is it hot over there?

241
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,590
I'm free today.

242
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,750
So I hung this out.

243
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,710
Is your girlfriend diligent?

244
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,230
Ling Chao.

245
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,230
Why are you here?

246
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,310
Get in the car.

247
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,710
Where did you get the car?

248
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,150
I bought it.

249
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,910
Our child has grown up.

250
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,270
It can make money on its own.

251
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,190
Mr. Jiang invested in and optimized Exclusive Fairy Tales.

252
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,630
So I made some money.

253
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,950
So it's a reliable kid.

254
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,670
You said you'd be back next week, right?

255
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,470
I heard there's a nice hot pot restaurant nearby.

256
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,550
Let's go there

257
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,430
to celebrate our successful bidding. What do you think?

258
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,310
Great.

259
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,910
I can finally relax.

260
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,550
Okay.

261
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:23,070
I'm so jealous.

262
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,110
We haven't eaten well

263
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,350
since we came here.

264
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,390
I want to have hot pot too.

265
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,830
Master.

266
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,550
This time...

267
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,510
It was mainly my fault this time.

268
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,910
We are as competitive as others,

269
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,950
but

270
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,950
our project plan

271
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,550
is indeed not good enough.

272
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,710
I'm also responsible this time.

273
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,510
We agreed that Master would be the speaker

274
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,230
and I would explain the details.

275
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,550
But the files I prepared were not even used.

276
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,030
And there was awkward silence.

277
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,070
I'm responsible for technical work.

278
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,790
It has nothing to do with me that we failed, right?

279
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,310
My problem is...

280
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,150
I can't think of it now.

281
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,470
But I'm definitely responsible.

282
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,830
I will deeply reflect on myself.

283
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,230
All right.

284
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,670
Ultimately,

285
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,270
I'm the one in charge. It was my fault.

286
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,670
Go back to the company and review it.

287
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,350
For me,

288
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,870
the number of failures

289
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,470
is like the peanuts in a plate.

290
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,830
It's too many.

291
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,070
But for you,

292
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,430
it may indeed be a Waterloo in your life.

293
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,990
But it doesn't matter.

294
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,430
We are a team.

295
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,270
We should take the blame together.

296
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,350
Right?

297
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,390
Didn't you say you miss me?

298
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,510
I came back in advance.

299
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,590
That means we failed in the bidding.

300
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,550
I didn't expect you to end up like this.

301
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,350
The hero's halo disappeared.

302
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:58,910
I failed.

303
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,270
But you look happy.

304
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,630
You've always been perfect.

305
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,590
It's normal to fail once in a while.

306
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,230
Someone didn't know the taste of failure

307
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,070
until today, right?

308
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,630
But we invested a lot of money in the beginning.

309
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,270
I wonder if Mr. Ye will...

310
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,550
Will Ye Jun ask you to compensate for it?

311
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,990
Are you worried about me

312
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:21,670
or money?

313
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,390
Money

314
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,950
can be earned again.

315
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,990
Besides, no one can always win.

316
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,350
Life is full of ups and downs, right?

317
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,190
Is it okay that I don't have to

318
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,830
be the winner all the time?

319
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,790
I approve.

320
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,670
Thank you.

321
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,430
You're welcome.

322
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,750
To comfort me,

323
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,710
have dinner with me tonight.

324
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,830
Sure.

325
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,910
What do you want to eat?

326
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,910
The western restaurant you want to go.

327
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,190
I've made a reservation.

328
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,790
Just now, Master asked me to reserve a table in a western restaurant.

329
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,150
He wants to give you a surprise.

330
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,310
In my opinion, he will propose to you soon.

331
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,750
Wait for me.

332
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,750
I'll be right back.

333
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:20,550
Hello. Sir.

334
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,550
Do you have a reservation?

335
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,150
Mr. Ling.

336
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,710
Your table is over here. This way, please.

337
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,750
This is your table.

338
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,510
You can serve the dishes.

339
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,390
Okay.

340
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,590
He must have another purpose.

341
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,230
So mysterious.

342
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,070
Will he

343
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,390
propose to me?

344
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:48,110
Beautiful.

345
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,710
He knows the tricks.

346
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,670
You're wearing

347
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,710
too little.

348
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,270
I'm wearing long johns.

349
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,990
I'm wearing long johns.

350
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,870
There is a tablecloth.

351
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,910
You can roll it down now.

352
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,070
Eat.

353
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,390
Your couple set.

354
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,110
Thank you.

355
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,750
I can do it myself.

356
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,950
Did the ring melt?

357
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,150
Should I try another way?

358
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,470
He put it in the wine.

359
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,590
Cheers.

360
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,030
Are you thirsty?

361
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,030
Did the waiter make a mistake?

362
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,990
Don't drink too much.

363
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:53,910
Stop drinking.

364
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,390
Wait for me.

365
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,790
So serious.

366
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,710
I should have dressed up more formally.

367
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,950
Hello. Sir.

368
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,750
The blanket you required.

369
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:28,790
Okay, thank you.

370
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,310
You

371
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,430
don't like today's restaurant?

372
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,230
It's not that.

373
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,190
Why were you acting weird just now?

374
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,670
I...

375
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,750
I thought

376
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,510
you were going to propose to me.

377
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,030
What did you say?

378
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,950
I thought you were going to propose to me.

379
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,430
I didn't know you are so eager to marry me.

380
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,870
What are you talking about?

381
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,190
Luckily, you didn't propose to me.

382
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,390
Otherwise, I would have to consider

383
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,390
whether I should marry you.

384
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,830
You were walking so fast.

385
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,550
You want to go to my house as soon as possible?

386
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,190
Who said I'm going to your house?

387
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,110
But now,

388
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,470
the dorm is closed.

389
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,310
Good for you.

390
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,790
So much for comforting you.

391
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,390
I think you're up to no good.

392
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,830
The weather forecast says it's only ten degrees Celsius tonight.

393
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,270
The living room is too cold.

394
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,350
Wait a minute.

395
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,950
Here.

396
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,230
That's it?

397
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,270
Wait.

398
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,150
What do you mean?

399
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,830
Didn't you say this pig looks like me?

400
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,270
Then let it sleep with you.

401
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:04,750
It's like me sleeping with you.

402
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,950
Fine.

403
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,670
Tuck in the quilt.

404
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,030
Don't catch a cold.

405
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,710
Okay, good night.

406
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,830
I've been busy lately.

407
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,910
I always sat.

408
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,110
My neck is really uncomfortable.

409
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,670
Sleeping on the sofa makes me really uncomfortable.

410
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,870
You really want me to sleep on the sofa?

411
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,390
You sleep in the bed.

412
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,350
I promise I'll be good.

413
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,430
I'll sleep on the sofa.

414
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,190
All right.

415
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,710
Do you want to hear a bedtime story?

416
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,990
It's about 2.23 cubic meters.

417
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,430
So we need materials of

418
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,990
2.238 cubic meters.

419
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,470
Next, we're going to talk about multivariable function of functions

420
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,230
and methods of derivation of functions.

421
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,710
You were pretending to sleep?

422
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,470
I... I just want to go to the toilet.

423
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,990
Just pretend you didn't see it.

424
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,030
I won't turn on the light when I go to the toilet in the future.

425
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,190
That's not what I meant.

426
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,310
In the future,

427
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,350
I'll drink less water before going to bed.

428
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,870
No, he meant

429
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,790
it was an accident.

430
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,790
It won't happen again.

431
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,830
Don't worry.

432
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,670
But I can't hold it back.

433
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,590
Forget it.

434
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,110
Sha,

435
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,150
you're still young.

436
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,510
Sometimes, when you can hold it back.

437
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,630
hold it back.

438
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,710
How can I hold it back?

439
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,990
Someone!

440
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,150
Jiang Juanjuan.

441
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,830
Why are you back?

442
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,670
I'm back for my thesis defense.

443
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,590
Why didn't you tell me you would come back in advance?

444
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,750
I'll pick you up.

445
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,710
I was afraid you're busy.

446
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:18,910
Tell me

447
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,430
where you are now in your relationship.

448
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,070
Tell me.

449
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,870
Ling Chao and I just slept...

450
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,750
Slept?

451
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,910
Don't.

452
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,030
We just slept in the same bed.

453
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,310
It's not what you think.

454
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,190
You slept in the same bed,

455
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,230
and nothing happened?

456
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,030
Listen.

457
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,790
The atmosphere was not right.

458
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,430
You need to make it romantic.

459
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,230
Like

460
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,390
roses,

461
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,630
candles,

462
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,150
or some wine.

463
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,510
Stop.

464
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,790
What are you thinking?

465
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,310
Boring.

466
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,590
Look.

467
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,950
What era is it now?

468
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,670
How can someone confess their love in this way?

469
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,870
You said roses and candles are romantic, right?

470
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,710
When did I say that?

471
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,510
Is my taste that bad?

472
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,230
Look.

473
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,710
The petals have rough edges.

474
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,150
I don't know which era they are from.

475
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,870
That's right.

476
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,910
People in my parents' era like this kind of things.

477
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,630
Right?

478
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,950
Let me tell you.

479
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,230
There is a heart set with candles over there.

480
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,470
Can it illuminate my heart?

481
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,150
It will only blind me.

482
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,590
I'm going to take a photo and send it to my best friend.

483
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,870
I can't be the only one blinded by it.

484
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,510
I'll take a photo too.

485
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,870
What if it's on the trending searches?

486
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,270
Right.

487
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:39,830
Let's go.

488
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,950
I'll go there to take a photo. Let's go.

489
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,230
You...

490
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,830
We're going too.

491
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,590
Okay.

492
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,950
There is really someone confessing his love.

493
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,550
Let's go.

494
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,110
She is here.

495
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,390
Ready.

496
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,030
Okay? Yes.

497
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,310
What's wrong?

498
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,190
You like it lively.

499
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,310
You like it romantic.

500
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,550
You like the sense of ritual.

501
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,030
Do you like these things

502
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,070
today?

503
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,830
Don't touch me. I have something to tell you.

504
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,550
It's been 632 days

505
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,950
since we broke up.

506
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:06,590
During the 632 days,

507
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,310
I've been counting the days every day.

508
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,270
It's the first time I feel that waiting for someone

509
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,750
is painful.

510
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,510
You waited long for me in the past.

511
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,070
I think I've waited that long.

512
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,670
You are the one who always compromised,

513
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,270
whether on time or distance.

514
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,870
You always took the initiative to call me

515
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,670
and text me

516
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,030
to share your life with me.

517
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,190
This time,

518
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:46,870
it's my turn.

519
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,750
Jiang Juanjuan.

520
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,230
I don't want to be apart from you.

521
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,310
I admit I'm not a brave person.

522
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,070
Jiang Juanjuan.

523
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,270
You can ignore me.

524
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,430
You don't have to see me.

525
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,510
I can wait for you forever.

526
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,350
I can wait until you forgive me.

527
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,270
I learned Junhui's new dance.

528
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,430
Learn with me.

529
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,630
Anthomanic.

530
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,030
Anthomaniac.

531
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,150
Trainee?

532
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,550
Are you talking about this kind of trainees?

533
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,790
What do you think?

534
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,390
Are you happier now?

535
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,230
In the future,

536
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,510
tell me if you're unhappy.

537
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,110
Don't be upset alone.

538
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,070
Understand?

539
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,470
Jia Siwen.

540
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,190
From now on,

541
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,910
record your body temperature.

542
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,790
Jiang Juanjuan.

543
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,470
I...

544
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,470
miss you a little.

545
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,190
I miss you more than a little.

546
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,630
I miss you very much.

547
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,990
Be together. Be together.

548
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,830
Be together! Be together!

549
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,070
Jiang Juanjuan.

550
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,630
Let's start over.

551
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,510
What if I make a wrong choice?

552
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,350
You haven't chosen yet.

553
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,590
How do you know you are wrong?

554
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,230
How can you compete with others

555
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,430
if you never take the initiative?

556
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,590
If you are always like this,

557
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,430
you won't even find a girlfriend.
