1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,150
How is the story going?

3
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,350
At least give us, the viewers,

4
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,470
an ending.

5
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,350
I'll follow this post.

6
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,230
Yes.

7
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,870
I can't believe I'm watching a drama on the Tieba forum.

8
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,230
Will you be together?

9
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,350
Family, I'm here to update.

10
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,230
After you said I like him last time,

11
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,070
I've been confused.

12
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:16,750
I was nervous and shy.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,590
So,

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,870
I've been avoiding him these days.

15
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,670
I dare not answer his calls.

16
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,670
What should I do now?

17
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,550
I don't know if I've been too reckless lately.

18
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,870
I was able to ask her out,

19
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,789
but now she just disappeared.

20
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,950
How long has madam been like this?

21
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,150
72 hours.

22
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,270
That means our tricks

23
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,910
won't work on her.

24
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:59,310
If what you said is useful,

25
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,230
it won't be this useless.

26
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,310
But why did she hide?

27
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,430
If she doesn't like you,

28
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,950
she could just say it.

29
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,270
I know.

30
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,430
At this point,

31
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,070
you have no choice.

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,070
Just go to her

33
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,550
and ask her why she's avoiding you.

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,110
What if I scared her away?

35
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,070
I think

36
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,590
she blocking you

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,190
is the worst result.

38
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,910
But as long as she's still at school,

39
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,750
she won't cancel her account.

40
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:32,870
Sha,

41
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,990
you're really good at comparing.

42
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,950
But I think

43
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,270
since we can't act rashly,

44
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,670
let's boil the frog in warm water.

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,350
Let's boil the rabbit.

46
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,030
I'll meet first

47
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,230
and then boil the rabbit.

48
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,550
Thank you for today.

49
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,470
Not at all.

50
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,350
I'm just a freshman.

51
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,750
I am happy that

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,829
I can attend this kind of big event.

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,990
Your camera is heavy, right?

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,350
Give it to me.

55
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,470
No, I can do it myself.

56
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,630
Your camera was borrowed by the student council.

57
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,070
It's my duty to protect it.

58
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,110
Plus, your tripod is quite heavy.

59
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,310
Let me take it.

60
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,150
Here.

61
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,510
Okay.

62
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,630
Thank you.

63
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,270
You're welcome.

64
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,710
Hello.

65
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,550
Hello.

66
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,829
Who is the girl next to Jianghu?

67
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,990
Why is he helping her?

68
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,710
Senior.

69
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,150
I didn't expect you to be so popular.

70
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,790
It feels like everyone passing by knows you.

71
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,470
They are juniors from the student council.

72
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,630
Sometimes, it's a big trouble

73
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,110
memorizing names while attending all the events.

74
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,710
But you are different.

75
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,310
Your name is special

76
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,550
and unforgettable.

77
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,510
I'll get going then.

78
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,110
Bye.

79
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,150
Okay.

80
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,070
Bye.

81
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,470
How is it?

82
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,750
She hung up.

83
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,110
Why didn't you answer my call?

84
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,350
Is your phone broken?

85
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,550
Yes.

86
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,950
Are you crazy?

87
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,790
This...

88
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,670
It's just fixed.

89
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,950
What do you want?

90
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,310
What can I do?

91
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,110
If you're here for your birthday present,

92
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,070
let me tell you,

93
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,670
I don't have much money left this month.

94
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,190
I advise you not to pick too expensive ones.

95
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,670
I want nothing.

96
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,470
I just want...

97
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,990
As long as you are not avoiding me...

98
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,710
Who is that?

99
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,750
Stole my line.

100
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,030
Doesn't he look like Jianghu?

101
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,470
This is boring.

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,390
Put your double chin back.

103
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,710
What are you doing?

104
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,510
I'm looking for a book.

105
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,270
Are you sure it's this book?

106
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,470
Is anyone sitting here?

107
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,470
Yes.

108
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,830
Is anyone sitting here?

109
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,470
Study hard.

110
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,870
Do you often use this sentence...

111
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,510
Eyelashes

112
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,950
are longer than mine.

113
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,590
Nose.

114
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,070
According to Jiang Juanjuan's fangirl terminology,

115
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,870
it shapes like a slide.

116
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,870
Mouth

117
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:29,070
is heart-shaped.

118
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,670
What?

119
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,150
You snored.

120
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,590
I never snore when I sleep.

121
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,750
Then why did you fall asleep while reading?

122
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,070
I came to take the seats at six.

123
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,310
Unlike someone

124
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,590
who sleeps until ten o'clock.

125
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,190
Why don't you...

126
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,750
get back to sleep.

127
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,550
Are you worried about me?

128
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,270
I'm not.

129
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,750
What are you doing?

130
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,750
Ling Chao is popular again.

131
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,110
This time, it's a love confession wall.

132
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,510
There is such a handsome guy in our school.

133
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,390
I don't believe it.

134
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,429
Unless you give me his WeChat.

135
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,309
Stop thinking about it.

136
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,350
I have his WeChat.

137
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,669
I never post it on Moments.

138
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,669
I was there too.

139
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,909
Why crop me out?

140
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,150
I can't shop anymore.

141
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,110
I've been shopping with you all day.

142
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,990
My feet are going to have blisters.

143
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,150
Hang in there.

144
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,390
I'll buy you milk tea later.

145
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,430
If you can't find a suitable gift this year,

146
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,510
maybe next year,

147
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,590
the great laboring people

148
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,070
will invent one.

149
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,070
There are birthdays every year.

150
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,150
You...

151
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,470
This shop is nice.

152
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,390
Let's go in and have a look.

153
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:12,990
Take a look.

154
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,510
This knitting wool...

155
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,790
Knitting wool like this...

156
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,190
If you are knitting socks,

157
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,590
this roll is enough.

158
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,390
You must buy two rolls.

159
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,550
This is very suitable.

160
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,350
It's beautiful.

161
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,150
Look.

162
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,670
The cerise and pink

163
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,990
suit you very well.

164
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,510
Are you

165
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,230
knitting a scarf

166
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,550
to give it to Ling Chao?

167
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,550
So what?

168
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,310
You think I can't learn?

169
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,430
Is that the problem?

170
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,430
Girl.

171
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,790
Your mind is very dangerous.

172
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,350
Miss, do you want knitting wool?

173
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,270
Are you knitting a scarf for your boyfriend?

174
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,430
The black one sells very well.

175
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,590
It's comfortable and won't pilling.

176
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,910
Many girls in your university city

177
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,110
buy it.

178
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,830
He is not my boyfriend.

179
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,990
He will be your boyfriend after you finish knitting.

180
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,150
I understand.

181
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,270
Me too.

182
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,590
How is it?

183
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,270
Are you happier now?

184
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,470
If you

185
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,550
are unhappy,

186
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,550
just tell me.

187
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,430
Don't be upset alone.

188
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,230
Got it?

189
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,390
Yes.

190
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,870
It's getting late.

191
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,830
Go to bed early.

192
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,470
Good night.

193
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,190
Good night.

194
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,960
What are you laughing at?

195
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,830
Am I?

196
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,110
What about you?

197
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,830
You are not sleeping in the middle of the night,

198
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,110
and you are here knitting a scarf for your boyfriend.

199
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,230
Why do you all say that?

200
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,150
Do you think I will knit a scarf for Ling Chao

201
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,310
as a birthday gift?

202
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,390
I don't think so.

203
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,550
It does seem a little strange.

204
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,990
Then why can you do it?

205
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,510
Because Ling Chao and I...

206
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,950
Are sister

207
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:11,110
and brother?

208
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,830
I just don't understand

209
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,910
what it is to like someone.

210
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,550
I checked online,

211
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,870
but there is no standard answer.

212
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,990
Didn't you like

213
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,390
Xu Linglong's cousin?

214
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:25,990
No.

215
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,950
That's admiration.

216
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,550
Ling Chao is different.

217
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,990
But I can't tell what's different.

218
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,470
Let me ask you another question.

219
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,710
Do you have someone you like?

220
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,310
When I asked you this question,

221
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,670
who was in your mind?

222
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,350
Please answer.

223
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,310
Ling Chao.

224
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,070
That's it.

225
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,390
Sister,

226
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,150
I'll make it clear today.

227
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,230
You have a crush on him.

228
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,950
Listen to me.

229
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,910
You'd rather break up at the end

230
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,910
than miss any chance.

231
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,750
But if...

232
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,990
Don't tell me

233
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,310
you're afraid that you can't be friends anymore.

234
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,110
You need friends?

235
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,110
I'm going to sleep.

236
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,630
You just need to knit

237
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,470
that love nicely.

238
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,470
Bye.

239
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,430
Ling Chao.

240
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,710
What is it?

241
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,910
This is for you.

242
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,310
I knitted it myself.

243
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,510
I wanted to give it to you on your birthday.

244
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,070
I can't wait.

245
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,790
I don't wear a scarf.

246
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,670
You're right.

247
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,030
The temperature has been pretty high these days.

248
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,390
But the temperature will drop next week.

249
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,590
It will be useful.

250
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,630
I mean,

251
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,590
I can't accept it.

252
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,070
It's not about the weather.

253
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,950
It's my fault.

254
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,230
I thought you would understand

255
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,070
even if I don't say anything.

256
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,150
I have to tell you now.

257
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,110
What's wrong?

258
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,630
Don't cry.

259
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,550
Ling Chao said

260
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,110
he's not afraid of the cold.

261
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,230
He never wears a scarf.

262
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,110
All right.

263
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,070
I like...

264
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,470
I don't want to hear it.

265
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,630
What's wrong with you?

266
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,470
I said I don't want to hear it.

267
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,230
Calm down

268
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,990
or keep your voice down.

269
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,990
Then tell me,

270
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,230
I'm different

271
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,230
from other girls, right?

272
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,910
We grew up together.

273
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,230
It's different.

274
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,430
What?

275
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,590
What kind of attitude is that?

276
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,430
How could you say that?

277
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,030
Fine, I'll grant your wish.

278
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,870
I won't deceive myself anymore.

279
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,510
I won't bother you anymore.

280
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,550
Are you satisfied?

281
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,550
All right.

282
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,870
Dad.

283
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,470
This scarf is for you.

284
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,070
My dear daughter.

285
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,510
I love it.

286
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,030
Thank you.

287
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,110
Really.

288
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,070
My little girl is so sweet.

289
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,670
But at my age,

290
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,790
wearing white

291
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,190
is too plain, isn't it?

292
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,510
Like.

293
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,390
Dislike.

294
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,670
Like.

295
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,390
Dislike.

296
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,030
Like.

297
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,830
Dislike.

298
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,710
Like.

299
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,590
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,470
S-Senior.

301
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,510
Are you okay?

302
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,030
You seem strong.

303
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,510
I'm not...

304
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,510
I used to learn taekwondo.

305
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,270
What was that?

306
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,270
I was thinking about something.

307
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,310
I wasn't watching.

308
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,110
Is something bothering you?

309
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,390
Do you want to tell me?

310
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,910
He knows Ling Chao.

311
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,430
I might get exposed.

312
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,910
I should change some of the information.

313
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,230
I have...

314
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,630
A friend?

315
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,350
No, she's my cousin.

316
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,270
I should've just said friend.

317
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:55,990
And then?

318
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,030
And

319
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,589
she has a close senior

320
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,230
who often appears in front of her recently.

321
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,390
Do you think

322
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,670
he is seeking attention?

323
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,829
Objectively speaking,

324
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,430
Ling Chao is indeed a senior.

325
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,310
It depends.

326
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,990
Maybe it's fate.

327
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,750
Or maybe

328
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,710
your cousin

329
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,310
appears in a way that

330
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,550
made him feel

331
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,030
he should show up in front of her.

332
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,750
And this senior

333
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,470
is special to her.

334
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:40,230
She has a little crush on him.

335
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,070
But she's not sure

336
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,630
if he likes her or not.

337
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,790
So your cousin...

338
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,310
she has never been in a relationship, right?

339
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,070
I think

340
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,070
she should believe in her intuition.

341
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,790
Since she has never been in a relationship,

342
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,110
yet she has developed

343
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,990
a special feeling toward this senior.

344
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,590
I think

345
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,910
it has a special meaning.

346
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,350
I'll go back and think about me...

347
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,830
about my cousin.

348
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,550
Senior,

349
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,350
you've helped me so many times.

350
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,710
If I don't treat you to a meal,

351
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,310
I would feel sorry.

352
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,150
Okay, let's go.

353
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,150
We have to do it after I finish level 4 exam.

354
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,670
Okay.

355
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,470
Bye.

356
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,510
I'll tell the truth.

357
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,200
I fell in love with him.

358
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,510
But

359
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,430
I don't know if he likes me.

360
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,110
You just gave your dad the scarf?

361
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,830
Are you sure you are going to Ling Chao's birthday empty-handed?

362
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,950
He doesn't need gifts.

363
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,550
There are birthdays every year.

364
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,550
I'll give him next year.

365
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,790
What did you prepare?

366
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,790
We can't both go to the birthday dinner empty-handed.

367
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,470
Jia Siwen picked a computer book for me.

368
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,350
It's very practical.

369
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,150
It won't go wrong.

370
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,230
Jia Siwen is quite reliable.

371
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,230
Ling Chao is also reliable.

372
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,030
Didn't he reject Xu Linglong?

373
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,630
He didn't say he liked me.

374
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,190
What if he rejected me too?

375
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,910
How is that possible?

376
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,670
He was so fierce

377
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,990
but it turned out to be unreliable.

378
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,670
Don't worry.

379
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,350
I made mistakes twice.

380
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,470
The third time will never go wrong.

381
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,430
Trust me.

382
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,710
It's true this time.

383
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,790
Hello, Tony.

384
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,270
Can the hairstyle you mentioned last time

385
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,150
makes me shine?

386
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,670
Today is an important day for me.

387
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,990
I have to take the risk.

388
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,230
Why are you sitting here?

389
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,150
Can't I sit here?

390
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,590
I reserved a seat for Xia Mo.

391
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,750
Xia...

392
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,790
Xia Mo, Xia Mo will…

393
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,150
Hi.

394
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,270
Hi.

395
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,150
Hello.

396
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,790
Waiter, we are ready to order.

397
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,750
Listen,

398
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,390
order whatever you want.

399
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,710
Tonight, all the expense

400
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,110
will be paid by Mr. Ling.

401
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,550
You are so generous.

402
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,230
Happy birthday.

403
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,270
Thank you.

404
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,190
Why are you the only two from your dorm

405
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,310
coming here?

406
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,870
Xia Mo is attending a horror party that

407
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,590
she can't refuse.

408
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,030
I don't know what Xu Linglong is doing.

409
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,510
Before the order is ready,

410
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,550
why don't we take a look

411
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:20,870
what madam prepared for master?

412
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,710
Right.

413
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,870
It's rare for Sha to make a request.

414
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,470
Let's satisfy him.

415
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,030
Satisfy him.

416
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,390
I didn't prepare a gift.

417
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,110
No way.

418
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,630
I came empty-handed.

419
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,270
I don't need gifts.

420
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,670
We're not kids.

421
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,870
It's already nice that

422
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,750
we sit together and have dinner.

423
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,030
Let me tell you.

424
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,630
Someone stayed up for several nights

425
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,150
and knitted a scarf.

426
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,550
I heard that

427
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,910
our birthday boy is particularly not afraid of cold

428
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,150
that he doesn't need a scarf at all.

429
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,870
So she gave it to her dad.

430
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,070
Really?

431
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,310
Can I ask for another one?

432
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,070
You never wear a scarf.

433
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,790
Never.

434
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,190
I can wear it from now on.

435
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,950
Me on that day

436
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,550
is different from me today.

437
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,710
I said I can wear it today.

438
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,910
It starts from today.

439
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,470
The scarf can be replenished later.

440
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,150
Birthday gift is a must.

441
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,270
Why don't

442
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,670
you two go shopping nearby?

443
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,910
Go, go, go.

444
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,710
I'll call you when the food is served.

445
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,790
Go ahead.

446
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,990
It's wonderful outside.

447
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,790
There are also acrobatics.

448
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:46,670
Go, go, go.

449
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,790
Here you go.

450
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,750
Thank you.

451
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,630
Thank you.

452
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,470
You're welcome.

453
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,910
Doesn't it feel like New Year's Eve?

454
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,670
You are feeling like New Year's Eve.

455
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,150
I don't feel like it at all.

456
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,590
Why don't you bring Xia Mo here?

457
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,550
Then go with her.

458
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,070
I dare not.

459
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,750
Are you Ms. Jiang?

460
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,750
We didn't order vegetables.

461
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,310
Mr. Jia

462
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,550
called to order.

463
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,550
And he has already paid

464
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,710
for this table.

465
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,910
Why did you pay the bill?

466
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,310
Today is Ling Chao's birthday.

467
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,550
It should be his treat.

468
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,670
Thank you.

469
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,510
Welcome.

470
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,550
Please feel free to pick.

471
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,510
Not too free.

472
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,790
This is the new design of our designer.

473
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,350
Do you want to try your size?

474
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,910
No hurry. Let's take a look.

475
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,030
Okay. You can shop around first.

476
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,710
2999.

477
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,550
4299.

478
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,390
Can you get me a size bigger?

479
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,750
Okay, wait a moment.

480
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,470
Are you serious?

481
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,190
Aren't you going to give me a gift?

482
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,670
And have my pick.

483
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,070
The saleswoman said it.

484
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,190
I didn't say it.

485
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,910
I told you

486
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,830
I don't have much pocket money left this month.

487
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,070
You can't pick too expensive ones.

488
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,510
But I've asked the saleswoman

489
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,430
to get my size

490
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,670
of the cloth that I just picked.

491
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,550
Just try it

492
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,510
and say

493
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,390
it's not a match or

494
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:51,510
you don't like it.

495
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,070
Or it's too big or too small.

496
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,190
Whatever.

497
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,030
Okay.

498
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,190
Sir, this is the size you want.

499
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,190
Thank you.

500
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,950
Hold this for me.

501
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,430
How is it?

502
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,870
How is it?

503
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,670
It fits perfectly.

504
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,910
It fits well.

505
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,750
This is the classic design of our shop.

506
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,910
And the color goes with everything.

507
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:39,790
Very practical.

508
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,950
Yes.

509
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,510
There are no shortcomings except the price.

510
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,510
Then this one.

511
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,750
We offer a special price on this one

512
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,790
for our anniversary.

513
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,830
It's only 199 yuan.

514
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,350
It's a good deal to buy it now.

515
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,510
You're sensible.

516
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,110
Satisfied?

517
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,550
You must be hungry.

518
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,710
I'm starving.

519
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,190
Eat more.

520
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,030
Young man.

521
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,590
Do you want to buy a bouquet of flowers for your girlfriend?

522
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,430
Do you want it?

523
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,830
No.

524
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,510
I'm not your girlfriend.

525
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,110
So,

526
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,910
is he still single?

527
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,750
For now.

528
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,670
Can I add you on WeChat?

529
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:38,910
Sorry.

530
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,190
I forgot my phone.

531
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,910
Then give me your WeChat number.

532
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,830
Why are you walking so fast?

533
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,430
Why did you catch up?

534
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,830
Why didn't you talk more?

535
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,830
You two seem to get along well.

536
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,430
Why don't you let her celebrate your birthday?

537
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,510
You gave me a gift.

538
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,670
Of course I have to treat you to dinner.

539
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,630
It's just a shirt.

540
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,430
I can give it to my dad.

541
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,270
The size is not right.

542
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:25,270
Then...then I'll give...

543
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,510
give...

544
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,830
Check your contact list

545
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,510
and see who you can give it to.

546
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,390
I'll check it now.

547
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,750
I'll give it to someone right away.

548
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,390
Can we go eat now?

549
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,230
Happy birthday to Ling Chao.

550
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,510
May all your wishes come true.

551
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,550
Wish all of you good health in the new year.

552
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,590
Enjoy it.

553
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,870
Wish everyone a better life.

554
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,790
Cheers.

555
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,150
It's almost time.

556
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,230
Countdown.

557
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,150
Wait.

558
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,990
Ten.

559
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,310
Nine.

560
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,350
Eight.

561
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,470
Sir, if you can't drive,

562
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,070
just drop me off here.

563
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,430
No, I can't park here.

564
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,510
Wait for the next intersection.

565
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,790
Seven, six, five.

566
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,630
Girl, where did you get your hair done?

567
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,350
Four, three, two.

568
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,910
Did you ask him for compensation?

569
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,590
Hair.

570
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:32,750
One.

571
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,910
Happy New Year.

572
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,350
Cheers.

573
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,830
I'm not going.

574
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,470
I used to think

575
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,230
you could understand if I didn't tell you.

576
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,150
But I have to say it now.

577
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,110
I'm sorry.

578
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,030
Why?

579
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,470
I like...

580
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,510
I don't want to hear it.

581
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,630
I like Xiao Tu.

582
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:11,990
Dislike.

583
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,910
Like.

584
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,550
Dislike.

585
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:16,950
I'm sorry.

586
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,470
I like her very much.

587
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,310
Like.
