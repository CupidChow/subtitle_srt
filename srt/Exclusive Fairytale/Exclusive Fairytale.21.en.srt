1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,030
You haven't been out for days.

3
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,150
You can't keep pretending to be a mummy here.

4
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,070
I've sent your ex-boyfriend away

5
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,710
as you requested.

6
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,709
He let you down again and again.

7
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,030
You're brave enough.

8
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,910
Which one do you like?

9
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,190
You can find a boyfriend again.

10
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,830
But you only have one life.

11
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,350
Look at your dark circles.

12
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,750
They are so big.

13
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,070
Don't cry.

14
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,630
Let's go to class.

15
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,509
Let's go.

16
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,229
Stand up.

17
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,750
Let go.

18
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,630
Go eat by yourself.

19
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,390
I have to accompany Jiang Juanjuan.

20
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,310
Be careful.

21
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,310
Jiang Juanjuan, wake up!

22
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,630
Do you know you're like a lonely ghost now?

23
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,590
I'm fine.

24
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,990
I looked away for just one second, and you almost fell.

25
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,270
And you're saying you are fine?

26
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,310
You haven't said a word for so many days.

27
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,870
Do you know I'm worried about you?

28
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,870
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,350
What are you sorry for?

30
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,070
Can you stop apologizing?

31
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,870
If I knew you would be like this...

32
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,270
Wait.

33
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,670
I'm calling him now

34
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,630
to ask him to see you.

35
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,870
No.

36
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,870
I don't want to see him.

37
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,030
I'm afraid I'll be soft-hearted.

38
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,270
Then don't torture yourself like this.

39
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,550
You're driving me crazy.

40
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,470
Besides,

41
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,510
it's better to have short, sharp pains than long, dull pains, right?

42
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,510
Even if I make up with him today,

43
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,470
it will end the same way.

44
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,670
But look at you now.

45
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,990
Love

46
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,310
is like taking a bus.

47
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,070
If I fail to catch this one,

48
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,350
it's normal to be depressed for a while.

49
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,030
I'll be fine when the next one comes.

50
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,950
I'll accompany you to wait for it.

51
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,710
My goose bumps.

52
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,470
Sorry.

53
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,670
I'm sorry. Sorry.

54
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,590
Rabbit, what are you doing?

55
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,150
Let me tell you something good.

56
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,710
What is it?

57
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,310
You are so happy today.

58
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,710
I'll participate in an event tomorrow.

59
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,990
I'll meet my Junhui.

60
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,430
Junhui?

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,510
I thought your idol is someone else now.

62
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,590
Why is it so noisy over there?

63
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,950
I'm in the bus.

64
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,510
I took a day off

65
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,950
to look for a house.

66
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,870
I

67
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,110
want to live closer to the company.

68
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,950
You're not familiar with Beijing.

69
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,270
If you can't handle it,

70
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,670
you must go to Jia Siwen.

71
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,430
Don't act tough.

72
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,310
Stop joking.

73
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,350
A good ex should be like a dead person.

74
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,830
It's just a breakup.

75
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,110
You don't have to say that about yourself.

76
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,070
I'm talking about Jia Siwen.

77
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,990
What about you?

78
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,230
How is your internship?

79
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,710
I'm fine.

80
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,950
The air conditioner is on, and the coffee smells good.

81
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,310
It's so cozy.

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,670
Xiao Tu.

83
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,390
I have to go. Bye.

84
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,870
What's wrong?

85
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,070
My computer can't be connected to the printer.

86
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,390
Let me check it for you.

87
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,070
No need.

88
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,990
I sent it to you.

89
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,870
After you print it,

90
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,630
help me deliver it to Jun's office.

91
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,190
But the tea table and the office

92
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,550
are in two different directions.

93
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,550
I know.

94
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,990
But I'm going to meet

95
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,390
the guests of the next episode of the program.

96
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,430
Of course

97
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,670
you should do it.

98
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,150
Hello, Mr. Li.

99
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:03,830
Yes.

100
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,230
I'm Vivian.

101
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,990
Xie Weiwei is fine.

102
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,550
Why did she give herself a foreign name?

103
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,670
Those who know know she is an intern like us.

104
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,510
Those who don't know might think

105
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,950
she is Xiao Tu's leader.

106
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,270
She is qualified to meet guests.

107
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,790
Why are you still doing these things here?

108
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,870
I also want to report news and meet guests.

109
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,830
But Jun didn't assign it to me.

110
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,430
You two learned journalism for nothing.

111
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,990
I guess you two are the only ones who don't know

112
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,230
this gossip.

113
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,430
Vivian

114
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,670
has a relative here.

115
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,110
That's right.

116
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,310
Otherwise, how did she get all the good resources?

117
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,430
But I heard only one of you will be hired in your team.

118
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,630
Will she be hired directly?

119
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,390
That's right.

120
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,790
Look, this popular western restaurant in the city center

121
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,510
seems good.

122
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,710
Why are you still chatting?

123
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,510
Is the coffee ready?

124
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,710
The people in the conference room have been waiting for a long time.

125
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,390
In a minute.

126
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,110
The next station is East Gate of Qingbei University.

127
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,030
Please be ready to get off.

128
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,110
Sir.

129
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,670
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

130
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,390
I'm Ling Chao, the project manager.

131
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,230
I just came here from a project meeting.

132
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,110
Sorry for my poor treat.

133
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,190
Please forgive me.

134
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,710
It's okay. We just arrived.

135
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,670
These are my students.

136
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,430
They will

137
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,590
be part of your

138
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,110
In-Depth Travel app project.

139
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,710
Thank you.

140
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,990
You haven't eaten, have you?

141
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,550
I booked a private room here.

142
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,270
Thank you.

143
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,110
Let's go.

144
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,190
Pack up.

145
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:53,830
Please.

146
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,550
Jia Siwen.

147
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,510
Chao.

148
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,990
Have you arranged everything for the team from Qingbei University?

149
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,550
No problem.

150
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,110
By the way,

151
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,670
you know a lot about food.

152
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,190
Can you recommend some nice restaurants nearby?

153
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,150
There's a popular restaurant nearby.

154
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,310
A western restaurant.

155
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,670
I heard the environment is great.

156
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,350
What?

157
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,350
A team building tonight?

158
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,550
No.

159
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,110
Can you help me reserve a table?

160
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,030
Two seats.

161
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,150
I heard that

162
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,110
the restaurant only puts roses

163
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,669
on specific tables.

164
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,030
Then I'll have a table with roses.

165
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,789
It also has a package for couples available in a limited number every day.

166
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,150
I'll have a package for couples too.

167
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,390
Okay.

168
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,390
Thanks.

169
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,590
Hello, Madam.

170
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,070
Xiao Tu, why are you still here?

171
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,550
I'm waiting for my boyfriend to get off work.

172
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,150
We will go to the western restaurant you mentioned earlier.

173
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,870
Someone is going to eat western food,

174
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,950
while someone is going to be envious.

175
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,230
Are you going to wear this to the restaurant?

176
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,350
Isn't this okay?

177
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,510
Of course it's not okay.

178
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,230
I just received my dress today.

179
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,350
But I chose the wrong size.

180
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,390
I wanted to return it.

181
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,590
I think it fits you.

182
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,350
This is good.

183
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,150
Thank you, Zhang.

184
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,310
Don't be touched.

185
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,030
Remember to transfer the money to me.

186
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,710
Okay.

187
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,590
Bye.

188
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,710
Bye. Bye.

189
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,550
Hi.

190
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,630
You?

191
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,910
Do you have to show your disappointment

192
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,070
so obviously?

193
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,750
Because

194
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,670
I'm waiting for a call.

195
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,950
Ling Chao dumped you?

196
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,510
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

197
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,270
Wait.

198
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,710
I haven't finished yet.

199
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,070
Are you and Jiang Juanjuan in Yunhai?

200
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,590
I'll come back from abroad soon.

201
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,950
After I come back,

202
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,750
we three sisters should celebrate together. What do you think?

203
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,630
Who are your sisters?

204
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,510
But why will you come back suddenly?

205
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,710
Abandoned by the company?

206
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,590
Did you learn to bear grudges from Ling Chao?

207
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,830
I think that you don't care

208
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,710
about me at all.

209
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,990
I have many fans now.

210
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,670
How could I be abandoned by the company?

211
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,150
It's fine as long as I know you're alive.

212
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,390
I will come back this time,

213
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,070
because I will have a tour in several big cities across the country.

214
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,030
The first stop will be Yunhai.

215
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,830
We'll always be best sisters.

216
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,510
You just said we're not sisters.

217
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,830
Who said that?

218
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,470
We'll be together forever.

219
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,270
Okay.

220
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,590
Bye.

221
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,190
Will you pick me up after work or should I go by myself?

222
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,150
It's a surprise.

223
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,830
It's not okay

224
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,910
to spoil it like this.

225
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,630
Are you off work?

226
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,310
No.

227
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,390
If he has work to do,

228
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,390
will it look like I'm rushing him?

229
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,630
I'm off work.

230
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,150
It can sound him out and act as a hint.

231
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,830
Perfect.

232
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,510
Hello.

233
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,510
You're off work so early today.

234
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,550
Then go back to the university early.

235
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,910
It's not safe when it gets dark.

236
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,070
Well.

237
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,310
I finally don't need to work overtime today.

238
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,630
Why don't we have dinner together?

239
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,950
Today is not okay.

240
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,470
I have an appointment with someone.

241
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,630
Is it a man or a woman?

242
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,670
A woman.

243
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,630
Liar.

244
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
Why did you ask since you've already known?

245
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,390
Fine.

246
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,590
I'll go back by myself.

247
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,510
Be careful.

248
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,350
Text me when you arrive.

249
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,630
What if it's really a girl?

250
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,590
This is your couple set.

251
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:20,990
Thank you.

252
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,750
Madam.

253
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,630
What?

254
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,910
The tea I made can't quench your thirst?

255
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,070
It's not that.

256
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,510
Madam.

257
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,310
It's hot.

258
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,830
You've been living with Ling Chao for a long time, right?

259
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,310
Madam,

260
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,390
since graduation,

261
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,390
it's been a year.

262
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,550
Let me ask you.

263
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,510
You are together day and night.

264
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,590
You should know well about

265
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,830
Ling Chao's schedule, right?

266
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,830
Well...

267
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,830
Should I know it?

268
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,710
Yes.

269
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,750
Very well.

270
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,510
Let me ask you.

271
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,390
Tonight,

272
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,470
who is with Ling Chao?

273
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,390
Where are they?

274
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,310
What are they doing?

275
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,710
Well...

276
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,910
I really don't know this.

277
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,710
You don't know?

278
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,350
If you ask me where the bug is,

279
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,190
I can find it for you.

280
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,590
But if you ask me to find Master,

281
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,510
I really don't know where he is.

282
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,750
Let me ask you.

283
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,230
Is there any suspicious woman

284
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,510
around Ling Chao recently?

285
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,030
Cleaners excluded.

286
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,150
I don't think there is.

287
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,390
Forget it.

288
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,510
It looks like

289
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,910
you don't know anything.

290
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,790
You may leave.

291
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,510
Yes.

292
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,390
He still knows he should come home.

293
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,710
I'd like to see how he'll explain.

294
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,030
What if he brings her back?

295
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,390
I thought you went back to the university.

296
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,750
Jia Siwen.

297
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,190
Why are you here?

298
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,590
We've been working on a project together.

299
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,830
Sit.

300
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,150
So,

301
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,030
the one you were on a date with

302
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,510
is Jia Siwen?

303
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,910
Your couple set.

304
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,110
Thank you.

305
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,950
Have a taste first.

306
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,190
If it's delicious,

307
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,750
I'll take Xiao Tu here next time.

308
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,510
Maybe I should go back to the hotel.

309
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,390
Wait.

310
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,830
It seems

311
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,990
you are living a good life even without Jiang Juanjuan.

312
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,590
Poor Juanjuan.

313
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,950
She cried so hard for you that she almost went blind.

314
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,030
Indeed,

315
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,830
men are all bad.

316
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,830
How has she

317
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,310
been?

318
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,830
She's been fine.

319
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,190
She's doing well in Beijing.

320
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,670
There are many handsome boys

321
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,510
waiting to be interviewed by her

322
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,070
every day.

323
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,150
Beijing?

324
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,150
Don't worry.

325
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,190
It's not for you.

326
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:20,950
Don't think too much.

327
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,270
I know.

328
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,510
What?

329
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,150
When you were together, you emotionally abused her and disappeared.

330
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,390
You broke up. Now you start to care about your ex-girlfriend?

331
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,910
This is not necessary.

332
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,310
I didn't ignore her intentionally.

333
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,510
Actually...

334
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,510
Why can't I log into

335
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,910
Exclusive Fairy Tales on my new phone?

336
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,270
I can only register another account.

337
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,590
It must have been untied.

338
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,630
But my previous phone shows it's not untied.

339
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,470
The records are still there.

340
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,430
I can continue to write diaries.

341
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,830
Although

342
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,830
she won't read the diaries anymore.

343
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,190
This should be a bug.

344
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,270
I'll fix it for you after I go back.

345
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,950
Well.

346
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,710
Can you

347
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,390
not fix it now?

348
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,630
Thanks to this bug,

349
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,510
I can continue

350
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,470
to write diaries every day.

351
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,590
What's the use of writing alone?

352
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,150
Like you said,

353
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,870
she won't read them anymore.

354
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,070
I went to your university several times to see her.

355
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,470
She just didn't want to see me.

356
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,150
Later,

357
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,910
I thought

358
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,150
even if she could forgive me,

359
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,350
what's the use?

360
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,070
I can't even give her the basic sense of security.

361
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,670
So I thought

362
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,710
maybe I should

363
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,630
let her go.

364
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,750
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

365
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,790
I cursed you for her over a year.

366
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,430
That was the first thing I did when I woke up.

367
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,390
It's fine.

368
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,070
No matter what the reason is,

369
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,510
I broke her heart.

370
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,550
Since you still like each other,

371
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,070
don't give up so easily.

372
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,190
Are you going to miss each other like this?

373
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,950
It's too late.

374
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,790
She must be disappointed in me.

375
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,030
Let me ask you.

376
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,630
What's the biggest obstacle in a long-distance relationship?

377
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,310
You.

378
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:35,950
Answer me.

379
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,070
The lack

380
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,430
of the sense of security?

381
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,510
You.

382
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,030
How should I know?

383
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,430
I've never been in a long-distance relationship.

384
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:48,510
The sense of security doesn't matter.

385
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,830
What you need is communication.

386
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,950
Between you and Jiang Juanjuan,

387
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,790
one is afraid that the other will be unhappy,

388
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,630
and one is afraid that the other will be disappointed.

389
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,030
Actually, you both get it wrong.

390
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,670
I hope you have a new relationship soon.

391
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,510
Never have a long-distance relationship again.

392
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,910
So insecure.

393
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,910
Actually, I think

394
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,550
the lack of the sense of security,

395
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,550
immaturity, and being unreasonable

396
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,910
are nothing.

397
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,670
In fact,

398
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,550
the most serious thing is

399
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,070
if I understand and care about him too much,

400
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,190
I'll lose balance in mentality.

401
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,310
I felt very uncomfortable,

402
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,070
but I had to put up with it.

403
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,670
And I would make a fuss about who cares more.

404
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,710
Sometimes I was wondering

405
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,190
if Jia Siwen took my understanding

406
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,910
for granted.

407
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,710
Then you should have told him.

408
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,310
I was afraid that if I told him, he would think I'm immature

409
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,670
and petty.

410
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,790
Besides, this kind of thing can't simply be explained

411
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,510
on the phone.

412
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,830
What if we got impulsive

413
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,790
and we quarreled and broke up?

414
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,910
Then it's better you tell him.

415
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,790
It's better to let him know what you think

416
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,830
than breaking up unclearly, right?

417
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,270
I think

418
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,830
he should understand.

419
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,110
Every time he finished his work,

420
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,430
he would try his best to please me.

421
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,070
And I would say it's okay.

422
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,270
And then

423
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,430
we would say more sorry.

424
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,310
One day, I realized

425
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,550
if I keep putting up with him,

426
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,710
there must be something wrong with our relationship.

427
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,950
Instead of this,

428
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,430
we'd better live separately.

429
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,550
Are you crying?

430
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,350
But it's been two years.

431
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,510
Will it be too late to pursue her again?

432
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,070
You have to be brave and take the initiative.

433
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,110
No matter what,

434
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,350
you have to fight for a chance.

435
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,310
How do you know if you don't try?

436
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,150
What if I choose the wrong one?

437
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,270
You haven't chosen yet.

438
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,910
How do you know you are wrong?

439
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,870
I know what to do.

440
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,310
You will help me.

441
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,350
Right?

442
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,510
Thank you, Xiao Tu.

443
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,030
You're leaving? Let me walk you out.

444
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,430
Bye.

445
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,070
Bye.

446
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,430
What do you mean by "all men are bad"?

447
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,230
Did I say that?

448
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,070
I said it, because I was angry.

449
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,550
I was talking about Jia Siwen.

450
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,350
When did you

451
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,430
become a relationship expert?

452
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,310
I'm not really an expert.

453
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,790
Truth is derived from practice.

454
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,310
You are very experienced?

455
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,190
I don't believe it.

456
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,670
Toilet.

457
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,350
Why is he here?

458
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,590
I forgot.

459
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,070
He has been here the whole night.

460
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,190
Wait.

461
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,710
Why should I come in?

462
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,150
It's so late.

463
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,590
The dorm is closed.

464
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,830
You can't go back.

465
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,030
Of course you should sleep here.

466
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,590
But you only have one bed.

467
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,950
I can't let you sleep on the floor.

468
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,630
Who said I will sleep on the floor?

469
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,430
You want me to sleep on the floor?

470
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,190
Can't we

471
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,710
both sleep in the bed?

472
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,910
This bed is so small.

473
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,310
How can we sleep together?

474
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,190
The bed is indeed a little small.

475
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,510
I'll buy a bigger one some other day.

476
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,070
Make do with it today.

477
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,750
No.

478
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:56,910
I have poor sleeping habits.

479
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,430
I would roll around.

480
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,070
I know.

481
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,590
Don't worry.

482
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,830
I have good sleeping habits.

483
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,310
Just ignore me.

484
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,470
Come on.

485
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,670
Why are you so nervous?

486
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,190
I'm not nervous.

487
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,550
I just like this side.

488
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,550
What?

489
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:55,870
What can I do?

490
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,790
I only have one quilt.

491
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,990
You want to freeze me to death

492
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,430
so that you can find a new boyfriend, right?

493
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,830
You want to suffocate yourself

494
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,350
to let me die alone?

495
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,070
Come on.

496
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,190
What?

497
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,310
Aren't you...

498
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,710
Don't worry.

499
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,710
What I want is our future,

500
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,350
not now.

501
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,590
Sleep.

502
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,710
Have you

503
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,470
not completely recovered?

504
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,830
What?

505
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,710
I mean...

506
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,710
that.

507
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,790
You're back.

508
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:21,790
Yes.

509
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,830
Ling Chao, sit here and rest.

510
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,950
Be careful.

511
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,310
I'd better stand.

512
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,590
OK.

513
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,950
Xiao Tu.

514
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,670
Yes.

515
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,710
Come out.

516
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,070
Come to this store

517
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,710
and carry things back.

518
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,830
Boss.

519
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,030
This is new?

520
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:54,630
Yes.

521
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,750
Ling Chao, go play basketball.

522
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,910
Next time.

523
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,310
Xiao, what did you buy?

524
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,550
All you care about is eating.

525
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,590
Take this.

526
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:07,830
Let's go, Ling Chao.

527
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,110
What's wrong with him?

528
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,310
He had an operation.

529
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,590
Operation? Oh, no. I didn't pay him.

530
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,510
Let me carry you.

531
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,310
No need.

532
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,630
You're a patient now.

533
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,550
Be good.

534
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,430
No need.

535
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,750
Don't be embarrassed. I'm strong.

536
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,830
It's late.

537
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,350
Sleep.

538
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:38,950
Good night.

539
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,710
What?

540
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,670
I remind you of your painful memory?

541
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:46,790
Don't worry.

542
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,790
I won't dislike you.

543
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,390
Thank you.

544
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,710
Sister.

545
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:56,830
Do you think

546
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,110
I'm robbing the cradle?

547
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:00,870
Don't worry.

548
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,590
I won't dislike you.

549
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,030
Well,

550
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,710
I won't stand on ceremony.

551
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,270
Do you really think

552
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,350
I dare not do anything to you?

553
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,190
What can you do to me?

554
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,070
I dare not do anything to you.

555
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,270
OK?

556
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,190
How about

557
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,030
not holding me so tight?

558
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,070
I dare not.

559
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,550
But it doesn't mean I don't want to.

560
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,670
I won't let go.

561
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,070
I'll let you do this for a while longer.

562
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,190
Look at that cloud.

563
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,110
Does it look like a dog?

564
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,350
I came to Yunhai recently.

565
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,790
But

566
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,550
I heard you went to Beijing.

567
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,590
I feel like we always miss each other.

568
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,590
Before I met you,

569
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,030
I seldom got emotional.

570
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,590
I felt everything was much of a muchness.

571
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,310
I was not very unhappy

572
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,990
or very happy.

573
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,350
After being with you,

574
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:01,950
I started to care about gains and losses,

575
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,550
when I was happier,

576
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,710
and when I was less happy.

577
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,950
I told Ling Chao

578
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,830
your account still exists when I use my old phone.

579
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,750
He said it is a bug.

580
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,070
But I didn't let him fix it.

581
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,670
Because I think

582
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,030
you will definitely come back.

583
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,790
I still miss you.

584
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,910
Good night.

585
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,030
I'm back.

586
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,430
You're back.

587
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,270
Godmother.

588
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,950
Rabbit is here too.

589
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,070
This...

590
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,430
What's wrong with him again?

591
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,310
Does it hurt that much?
