00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,350
Be together!

3
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,790
Be together!

4
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,070
Be together!

5
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,430
Be together!

6
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,670
Be together!

7
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,830
Jiang Juanjuan.

8
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,390
Let's start over.

9
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,190
Jiang Juanjuan.

10
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,830
Jiang Juanjuan.

11
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,830
Jiang Juanjuan.

12
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,990
Jiang Juanjuan.

13
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,230
You...

14
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,789
Stop crying.

15
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,590
Jiang Juanjuan.

16
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,630
Is it because I didn't dance well?

17
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,550
You know yourself well.

18
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,110
No matter what dance you like,

19
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,310
I'll learn it in the future.

20
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,390
In the future?

21
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,950
You wish.

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,310
Although I'm a little touched,

23
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,630
I haven't forgiven you.

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,150
You have to let me think about it for a few days.

25
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,910
So how many days exactly?

26
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,430
Don't push your luck.

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,150
It's up to me.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,710
Okay.

29
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,630
It's cold.

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,270
Don't catch a cold.

31
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,470
Don't cry.

32
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,270
Drive safely.

33
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,350
Don't you feel embarrassed about driving this car here?

34
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,630
Hello, Ling Chao.

35
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:56,950
You...

36
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,590
I'm here to be an intern.

37
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,710
Why are you at the reception?

38
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,790
Your major is dance, right?

39
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,990
Yes.

40
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,110
But as long as I can spend time with you every day,

41
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,670
I'm willing to try anything.

42
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,150
Alright, I'm just kidding.

43
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,710
My leg is injured.

44
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,030
I have nothing to do anyway.

45
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,589
I just want to seize this chance to get an internship certificate.

46
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,190
Then sit.

47
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,110
What?

48
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,750
Are you worried about me?

49
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,270
Why didn't you do this earlier?

50
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,470
But it's okay.

51
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,710
We can see each other every day in the next few months.

52
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,190
You have plenty of opportunities to show your care.

53
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,870
Fine.

54
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,110
When we work overtime and ask you to do things,

55
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,590
don't think it's troublesome.

56
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:38,990
The TV station

57
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,270
has an assessment

58
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,909
for interns.

59
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,350
The rules are simple.

60
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,430
Each of you

61
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,030
makes a show independently.

62
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,990
The one gaining the highest audience rating will stay.

63
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,670
The audience rating

64
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,150
is the only thing that matters in this assessment.

65
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,830
Don't worry, Jun.

66
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,710
I'm confident.

67
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,230
Xiao Tu,

68
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,110
you should pay more attention.

69
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,710
You can't always use these unimportant things

70
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:04,470
to deal with me.

71
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,390
Both of you, do your best.

72
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,310
Prove yourselves with high-quality content and works.

73
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,590
I will never be biased.

74
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,950
By the way,

75
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,510
these are

76
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,710
some excellent works from last year's assessment.

77
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,150
Take them for reference.

78
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,590
Little Rabbit.

79
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,870
Hello, Mr. Ye.

80
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,230
I'm Xiao Tu, the intern director of

81
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,990
Yunhai TV Station's "Yunhai Sea of People" program.

82
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,550
Nice to meet you.

83
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,990
Congratulations.

84
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,590
Have a seat.

85
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,430
Not bad, Xiao Tu.

86
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,630
Your program's audience rating reached a small peak.

87
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,870
Xiao Tu, well done.

88
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,510
It's really satisfying this time.

89
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,070
Xiao Tu.

90
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,630
Come here.

91
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,510
Go.

92
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,590
You've seen the statistics released by the TV station.

93
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,430
The latest episode

94
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,909
achieved a small success.

95
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,110
But don't be arrogant.

96
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,470
In fact,

97
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,510
the assessment standard is not fair.

98
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,830
Jun,

99
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,510
what do you mean?

100
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,230
My program was aired on Thursday.

101
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,110
Your program was aired on Saturday.

102
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,830
You have the upper hand.

103
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,870
You gained an advantage,

104
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,590
but why are you

105
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,710
pretending to be innocent?

106
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,870
I'm just in charge of making the program.

107
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,830
I have no right to choose the time.

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,190
Besides, Jun said it herself.

109
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,830
Prove ourselves with high-quality content.

110
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,470
What does your low audience rating have to do with the schedule?

111
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,990
Do you really think the audience rating

112
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,310
has something to do with the schedule?

113
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,590
You... Enough.

114
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,430
But overall,

115
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,310
we still have to be

116
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,950
fair, square, and open.

117
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,430
Based on this rule,

118
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,990
Xiao Tu,

119
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,110
you need to make another episode as soon as possible.

120
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,550
We'll reschedule

121
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,710
the programs ready to be aired.

122
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,310
Your program will be aired next Thursday.

123
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,830
This is fair to everyone.

124
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,870
Next Thursday?

125
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,710
It's less than ten days.

126
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,670
Our internship is almost over.

127
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,110
Of course they need to decide

128
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,870
who can stay as soon as possible.

129
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:49,830
Fine.

130
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,390
Just wait and see.

131
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,590
Why are you here?

132
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,790
Are you here for an answer?

133
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,550
Jia Siwen, listen.

134
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,510
Boys will get dumped, if they are too clingy.

135
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,270
No.

136
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,630
I'm not in a hurry.

137
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,150
Not in a hurry?

138
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,110
Then I'll tell you the answer

139
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,990
in 50 years.

140
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,750
No. No.

141
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,830
I'm not rushing you.

142
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,070
No matter how long you want to think about it,

143
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,990
I'll wait for you.

144
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,950
That's more like it.

145
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,870
Then why are you here today?

146
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,830
Xiao Tu can't come here today, because she has something to do.

147
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,190
So I came to accompany you.

148
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,150
Then try your best today.

149
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,309
Maybe when I'm happy, I...

150
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,590
I understand.

151
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,350
Do you regret saying that?

152
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,870
Yes.

153
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,230
Is it too late if I drive you back to your company

154
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,150
to beg your leader?

155
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,710
Begging her is impossible.

156
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,870
Every time I see them colluding,

157
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,310
I get angry.

158
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,990
Rabbits bite when they are anxious.

159
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,510
I have to make this episode

160
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,990
to prove myself to them.

161
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,630
How about

162
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,230
interviewing me?

163
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,670
What a joke.

164
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,430
I interviewed your boss in the previous episode.

165
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,470
If I interview you this time,

166
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,270
it's like a consumption downgrade.

167
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,430
You didn't even pay.

168
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,350
So there is no downgrade.

169
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,670
How about

170
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,710
paying first?

171
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,670
I always take a hit like this.

172
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,350
My passion is almost gone.

173
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,950
Do you think I'm not suitable for this job?

174
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,750
You're still a rookie.

175
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,710
You need to grow gradually.

176
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,550
Don't deny yourself when you encounter some setbacks.

177
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,470
Then tell me,

178
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,630
what should I do

179
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,750
if I can't persist with it?

180
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,070
Then think about this.

181
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,710
Why did you choose to major in journalism?

182
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,470
Because my score was just above the line.

183
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,430
And?

184
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,550
And I helped someone by accident.

185
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,150
I became interested.

186
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,150
Gradually, I started to enjoy it

187
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,550
and became willing to work hard for it.

188
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,350
I think I can do this for the rest of my life.

189
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,870
Remember what you just said.

190
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,550
And congratulations.

191
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,310
You finally found your little dream.

192
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,430
OK, I'm revived.

193
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,510
Mr. Ling, let's go.

194
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,630
This is not the way back to the university, right?

195
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,790
We are going to the apartment.

196
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,030
But Guan Jiu...

197
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,110
In order to make it convenient for him to drink water and go to the toilet at night,

198
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,310
he moved out yesterday.

199
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,750
Is it too late if I get off now?

200
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,390
It's too late.

201
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,510
Let's have a competition.

202
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,790
What competition?

203
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,110
Fishing.

204
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,510
Let's see who gets more.

205
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,710
If you lose,

206
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,230
don't come to me again.

207
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,790
What if I win?

208
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,510
If you win, I'll consider giving you a chance.

209
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,990
It's a deal then.

210
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,710
It begins now.

211
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,430
Fishes.

212
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,670
I win.

213
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,470
The fishes are so slippery.

214
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,030
I can't catch them.

215
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,910
Take mine.

216
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,470
We had a deal.

217
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,790
I win.

218
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,470
You can't go back on your words.

219
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,870
I didn't say I would.

220
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,550
But if I agree to give you a chance just because of some fishes,

221
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,710
it'll be my loss.

222
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,910
There should be a probation period.

223
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,430
Forget it if you don't like it.

224
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,630
I do.

225
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,430
I want to eat French fries now.

226
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,470
I know.

227
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,750
French fries with ice cream.

228
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,750
Wait for me here.

229
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,550
I'm going to buy it for you.

230
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,150
Aunt.

231
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,830
You let him win, right?

232
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,350
What Aunt? Call me Sister.

233
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,390
We're in a relationship.

234
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,990
Just pretend you didn't see anything.

235
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,470
Go home and do your homework.

236
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,750
Xiaomei, don't worry.

237
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,470
You can play as long as you want.

238
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,190
I've bought this fishpond for you.

239
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,110
Don't watch too many idol dramas.

240
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,630
I didn't get admitted to my favorite university,

241
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,470
because I watched too many idol dramas.

242
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,030
Boss.

243
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,590
Dad. The bill.

244
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,950
It's 70 yuan. How would you like to pay?

245
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,870
She must

246
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,710
be very lucky to interview Ye Jun.

247
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,550
In fact,

248
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,670
she's just someone from another city

249
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,270
who has no background.

250
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,350
If she wants to defeat me,

251
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,790
she has to interview a popular celebrity.

252
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,350
Thank you.

253
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,190
If you didn't remind me,

254
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,750
I wouldn't have thought of this.

255
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,590
Sometimes,

256
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,150
I replace the name of the operator with a celebrity's name.

257
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,870
But I still suggest

258
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,710
you should be realistic.

259
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,750
Let's go and take a look.

260
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,110
Take a photo with him.

261
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:47,710
Really handsome.

262
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,270
So handsome.

263
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,510
Can you please ask Xiao Tu to come here?

264
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,350
Thank you.

265
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,190
Han.

266
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,870
He greeted me.

267
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,990
He asked you to come here to check the process.

268
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,670
We've done it six or seven times.

269
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,870
Can you not understand it?

270
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,270
Or did I not say it clearly?

271
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,110
Is this how you treat your guest?

272
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,510
Mr. Yin.

273
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,470
Is there anything else I can help with?

274
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,390
Yes.

275
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,590
Now I need you to sit down and chat with me.

276
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,830
He's asking Xiao Tu to sit down and chat with him.

277
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,910
I'm so jealous.

278
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,990
Xiao Tu is so lucky.

279
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,390
Stop joking. I'm busy.

280
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,070
Will this program be cancelled without you?

281
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,230
Sit down.

282
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,950
He even held Xiao Tu's hand.

283
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,030
This is our chief director. My goodness.

284
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,110
Hello. Director.

285
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,230
Just call me Yin.

286
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,270
Hello. Yin.

287
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,390
I heard you're quite popular here.

288
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,310
I didn't expect you to join our show.

289
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,190
My ancestral home was in Yunhai.

290
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,350
So it's my honor to join the best program

291
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,070
of Yunhai TV Station.

292
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,110
Thank you

293
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,110
for bringing us new vitality.

294
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,790
You're welcome.

295
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,670
Actually, I really appreciate the crew's efforts.

296
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,110
But this time, I specially want to

297
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,350
thank my best friend,

298
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,190
Xiao Tu.

299
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,710
She invited me here.

300
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,190
That's why I have the chance to join this meaningful program.

301
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,270
Hello. Director.

302
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,910
This is my intern.

303
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,110
Her name is Xiao Tu, from Yunhai University.

304
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,550
She is very reliable and capable.

305
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,870
And she has strong hard-working spirit.

306
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,230
She's very excellent.

307
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,990
We need

308
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,230
insightful young people like her.

309
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,190
OK.

310
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,270
Let's get it started.

311
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,190
Okay. Director.

312
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,110
Okay, thank you.

313
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,870
No, no.

314
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,710
Xiao Tu.

315
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,310
OK.

316
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,310
This is all for today.

317
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,510
Okay.

318
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:05,430
Thank you.

319
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,069
Thank you. Thank you.

320
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,190
OK. Thank you, Zihan.

321
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,589
Thank you, everyone.

322
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,790
Not at all.

323
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,430
Thank you, Mr. Yin. Thank you, Mr. Yin.

324
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:11,910
This way.

325
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,630
Okay.

326
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,430
I didn't expect I can take a close look

327
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,589
at Yin Zihan.

328
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,750
Gosh.

329
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,869
Thanks to Xiao Tu, I realized my dream.

330
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,230
So handsome.

331
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,390
He's so handsome. Let's look at the next one.

332
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,109
Don't you think

333
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,190
she offered something

334
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,310
to invite him here?

335
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,790
She is not a local.

336
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,870
I think she is probably thinking

337
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,430
if she can know a celebrity one day...

338
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,550
Who cares?

339
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,030
Xiao Tu has a boyfriend, okay?

340
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,510
Her boyfriend must be nobody.

341
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,070
Can you not be so harsh?

342
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,750
Xiao Tu.

343
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,590
What are you doing here?

344
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,390
Xiao...

345
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,990
I bought these for your colleagues.

346
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,590
Who is this, Xiao Tu?

347
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,590
What's going on?

348
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,870
These are for you.

349
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,350
Thank you.

350
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,510
Hello, I'm Xiao Tu's boyfriend.

351
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,670
Boyfriend.

352
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,670
Thank you for taking care of Xiao Tu.

353
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,710
Not at all.

354
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,150
Then I'll leave it to you.

355
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,070
I'm leaving.

356
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,150
Go.

357
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,790
Bye.

358
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,310
See you.

359
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,870
Bye.

360
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,670
Come on, let's eat the cakes.

361
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,510
Come on.

362
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,030
Take it.

363
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,110
Oh my god.

364
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,990
So Xiao Tu's boyfriend is him.

365
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,750
Who?

366
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,390
When we made the episode featuring Ye Jun,

367
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,950
I searched his company.

368
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,830
I have a deep impression of Ling Chao in his team.

369
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,550
He is handsome.

370
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,550
And he has been a straight A student since he was little.

371
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,950
He got many national scholarships

372
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,350
and is a computer genius.

373
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,590
Xiao Tu must have saved the galaxy in her previous life.

374
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,030
Oh my god.

375
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,630
Why were you so exaggerated today?

376
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,270
I think you scared my colleagues.

377
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,590
You mean my suit or the desserts?

378
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,710
So you know.

379
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,910
How did you know Yin Zihan

380
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,950
and I were together at the show?

381
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,550
Yin Zihan told me.

382
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,550
He bought the desserts.

383
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,870
I came after I met the investor.

384
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,910
It was actually credited to him.

385
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,830
That was indeed something he would do.

386
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,630
About your work,

387
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,510
you always talk to me casually.

388
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,870
You didn't tell me when you faced challenges.

389
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,230
It makes me feel

390
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,150
that I'm not a good boyfriend.

391
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,510
They didn't really bully me.

392
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,390
Didn't you tell me

393
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,470
it's normal to encounter difficulties?

394
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,830
So I told myself

395
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,990
these are precious experiences.

396
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,190
They will be useful in the future.

397
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,910
Brave Rabbit.

398
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,350
I'm not afraid of difficulties.

399
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,990
I'll keep going no matter what.

400
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,790
I regret saying those words to you all of a sudden.

401
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,030
Why?

402
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,350
I think you are more independent.

403
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,190
You are less dependent on me.

404
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,630
Who said that?

405
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,710
You are driving for me, right?

406
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,150
If something like this happens again,

407
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,430
you must tell me first.

408
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,950
I want to support you too.

409
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,350
I know.

410
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,110
Why do I feel like

411
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,750
I'm the heroine in idol dramas?

412
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,350
Alright, get some sleep.

413
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,470
You can have everything in your dreams.

414
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,430
I'm really going to sleep.

415
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,470
Sleep.

416
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,030
Are you ready?

417
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,390
OK. Come on.

418
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,910
Slow down. Too fast.

419
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,990
You can't take it now?

420
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,230
Didn't you say I was too slow?

421
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,670
I thought you were slow, because I was afraid it would be burnt.

422
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,190
Now you're too fast.

423
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,550
I'm afraid the oil will burn me.

424
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,510
Let me do it.

425
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,590
You said you would teach me, right?

426
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,670
It's enough that one of us can cook.

427
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,110
You are the biggest obstacle

428
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,670
on my way to do housework.

429
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,950
What are you doing?

430
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,070
I'm lacing up the apron for you.

431
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,270
But I'm holding you.

432
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,270
Let's eat first.

433
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,030
Okay.

434
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,190
Morning.

435
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,990
Morning. Honey.

436
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,270
What did you call me?

437
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,070
Honey.

438
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,430
Isn't it too early to call me that now?

439
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,910
We've been married for three years.

440
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,990
Isn't it too late to regret it?

441
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,630
When did we get married?

442
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,030
You are not having a fever.

443
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,390
Why did you talk nonsense?

444
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,990
Did I

445
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:56,030
have a time travel?

446
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,270
There's something you may not believe.

447
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,430
I might have lost my memories.

448
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,670
Don't scare me.

449
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,510
Really.

450
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,870
I don't remember anything that happened in the past three years.

451
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,950
How was my graduation thesis?

452
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:12,710
You passed.

453
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,790
What about my work at the TV station?

454
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:14,750
It's good.

455
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,910
We've been married for three years.

456
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,470
We don't have a child?

457
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,990
Child?

458
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,710
If you want one,

459
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,790
now we can...

460
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,950
Liar.

461
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,630
We are not married.

462
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,150
But we are engaged.

463
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,190
Mom. Godmother.

464
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,190
Chao.

465
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,110
Listen.

466
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,990
Your father did a great job

467
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,430
today.

468
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,830
Your father made great efforts

469
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,950
to get him drunk.

470
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,590
Yes. Done.

471
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,190
He finally agreed

472
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,190
with your marriage with Little Rabbit.

473
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,830
Yes.

474
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,550
Really?

475
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,270
Of course.

476
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,590
Let me tell you.

477
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,950
Today is the day.

478
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,350
You should be engaged today.

479
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,310
But Xiao Tu and I are still in Yunhai now.

480
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,430
Look at you.

481
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,230
Are you stupid?

482
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,710
The engagement is about the two families having a meal together, right?

483
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,110
Yes.

484
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,150
The four of us

485
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,270
ate

486
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,510
and drank together.

487
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,910
It's settled then.

488
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,830
Am I right?

489
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,470
Yes.

490
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,190
Look at us.

491
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,590
Wenhui, show him.

492
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,350
Come on.

493
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,630
Xiao.

494
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:27,510
Ling Chao looks smart.

495
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,710
But he's just a kid when he's in a relationship.

496
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,990
He likes Xiao Tu.

497
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,510
He has no other intentions.

498
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,030
Dating and getting married

499
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,790
are not the same.

500
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,190
Ling Chao.

501
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:45,710
He is smart.

502
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,990
Right?

503
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,470
He's handsome too.

504
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,790
Right? Yes.

505
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,950
He's down-to-earth.

506
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,990
Then why are you still not satisfied with him?

507
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:03,550
Being not dissatisfied means you are satisfied.

508
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,950
I understand.

509
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,510
You just don't want your daughter to get married.

510
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,670
Ling.

511
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,310
I keep thinking

512
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,710
when Xiao Tu was just born,

513
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,390
she was only this little.

514
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,430
It felt soft and chubby when I held her in my hands.

515
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:26,190
She was like a piggy.

516
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,150
Now she has grown up.

517
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,550
She's going to get married.

518
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,230
Calm down.

519
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,910
Don't think too much.

520
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,910
We'll be a family after they get married.

521
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,550
It's our fate.

522
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,670
Right, Xiao?

523
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,990
A family?

524
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:46,910
A family.

525
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,350
A family speaks with one voice.

526
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,470
Xiao, it's a deal then.

527
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,030
Be nice to my daughter.

528
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,270
Of course.

529
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,590
So much for my father's ambition.

530
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,830
He betrayed me just like that.

531
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,670
It was more of a surrender.

532
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,190
Anyway, we have to

533
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,070
go to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

534
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,910
You acted so well just now.

535
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,190
It's a pity if you don't become an actor.

536
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,990
Forget it.

537
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,950
If I become an actor,

538
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,590
Yin Zihan will have to change his career.

539
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,110
I should be merciful.

540
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,070
What time is it now?

541
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,310
It's over 11:00 a.m.

542
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,230
Oh no.

543
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,510
I asked Yin Zihan to come here at 11:00 a.m.

544
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,630
I was wondering why he came here so early in the morning.

545
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,150
Don't walk barefoot.

546
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,350
And

547
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,350
get changed before you go out.

548
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,510
Hello? What?

549
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,470
Guess where I am.

550
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,510
On the Earth.

551
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,150
Why are you so perfunctory?

552
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,190
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

553
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,630
What are you busy with?

554
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,550
Is there anything I can help?

555
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,350
I'm busy with an interview.

556
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,150
It's crucial to my career.

557
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,070
That's great.

558
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,030
I just came back to Yunhai.

559
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,910
Interview me.

560
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,390
At your service.

561
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,270
I'll contact you when I finish my work.

562
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:27,870
Be good.

563
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,390
Hello?

564
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,830
Xiao Tu.

565
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,310
Sister.

566
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,670
Can you write something awesome about me

567
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,230
in tonight's article?

568
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,390
My classmate

569
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,190
just won't believe that I'm already popular.

570
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,270
I want to show her.

571
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,150
Okay.

572
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,790
I'll make you a trending topic, okay?

573
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,150
Okay.

574
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,630
Thank you.

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,030
Be nice to my daughter.

00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,150
Of course.

Both fathers.
