1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,350
Ye Jun is awesome!

3
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,350
Ye Jun is awesome!

4
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,270
Ye Jun is awesome!

5
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,350
It's so cold outside today.

6
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,710
You two are so happy.

7
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,270
You know what?

8
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,510
Xu Linglong's mother

9
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,190
is really funny.

10
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,390
Her nephew has come back from abroad,

11
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,030
and she always takes him everywhere

12
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,350
to brag about him.

13
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,949
He played the violin last time, right?

14
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,350
Guess what he did this time?

15
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,030
What did he do?

16
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,230
He set up a stall in our neighborhood to write couplets.

17
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,870
It's surprising that she came up with this idea.

18
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,990
So funny.

19
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,470
It was not easy for that young man.

20
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,550
Take it as a warm gift

21
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,990
to the neighbors.

22
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,750
What kind of warm gift is it?

23
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,950
He had no choice.

24
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,350
Luckily,

25
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,950
we don't have such relatives.

26
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,150
Otherwise,

27
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,230
Xiao Tu

28
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,590
might be asked to perform

29
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,270
the show of breaking stones on her chest.

30
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,150
I can't imagine it.

31
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,510
Mom, I once learned taekwondo,

32
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,150
not acrobatics.

33
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,550
For the skills of taekwondo, you also

34
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,510
do the kicking and break bricks.

35
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,829
They are almost the same.

36
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,550
Can't you make an analogy?

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,670
Then according to what you said,

38
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,590
if I can speak,

39
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,110
am I able to perform a comic dialogue?

40
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,829
I haven't hit you for three days.

41
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:00,790
Do you feel like being hit now?

42
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,830
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

43
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,990
Where are you going?

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,870
During the winter vacation,

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,190
she's always missing.

46
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,550
And you, Xiao Haishan,

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,790
you're sitting here all day long

48
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,630
to watch your mobile phone.

49
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,630
Both the father and the daughter are troublesome.

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,750
Who else wants some couplets?

51
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,110
Me, me, me!

52
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,030
Ye Jun,

53
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,750
can you write a set of couplets for me as well?

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,070
Sure. What do you want me to write on them?

55
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,550
Write...

56
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,070
Chicken, duck, fish and rice.

57
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,630
Sleep until 10:30 a.m. every day.

58
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,910
The horizontal scroll, Happy New Year to Xiao Tu.

59
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,710
Xiao Tu, are you educated?

60
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,670
Who writes such a long sentence on a horizontal scroll?

61
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,630
Ye Jun didn't say anything about it.

62
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,150
It's none of your business.

63
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,070
I think you are quite free.

64
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,030
Don't tell me you didn't do your winter-vacation homework at all.

65
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,270
It's still early. The winter vacation has just begun.

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,590
Ling Chao, you're here.

67
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,230
This is my cousin.

68
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,070
We played together when we were kids.

69
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,910
Cousin.

70
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,470
This is Ling Chao.

71
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,150
Ling Chao has grown so tall.

72
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,270
Ling Chao,

73
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,670
what couplets do you want?

74
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,150
I'll ask my cousin to write them for you.

75
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,470
No need.

76
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,470
We don't lack couplets in our family.

77
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,030
That's different.

78
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,950
Ye Jun will write these couplets personally.

79
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:16,790
Ye Jun.

80
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,630
Just write these words for Ling Chao.

81
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,310
Steak, milk tea and crispy fried pork.

82
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,710
Have a Happy New Year.

83
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,270
I think it's you who want another set of couplets, huh?

84
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,150
No way.

85
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,430
My cousin is going to accompany me to

86
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,990
do homework and practice piano later.

87
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,150
He doesn't have time

88
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,990
to write such ridiculous things.

89
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,630
It's okay.

90
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,030
If Little Rabbit wants it,

91
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,430
I can write another set.

92
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,350
What?

93
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,990
Have you finished your winter-vacation homework?

94
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,150
Xiao Tu.

95
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,390
I didn't expect that you would descend to do this.

96
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,550
You even want to copy my winter-vacation homework.

97
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,630
You think too highly of yourself.

98
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,270
Even if I need to copy someone else's homework, I won't copy yours.

99
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,430
I don't want to argue with you.

100
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,750
What a waste of time.

101
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,830
Don't go. Let me finish.

102
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,070
Well, I want you to come to my home so that we can

103
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,310
do homework together.

104
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,910
Have you forgotten that

105
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,670
we are not

106
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,590
good friends?

107
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,630
Don't try to please me.

108
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,030
I won't accept it.

109
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,430
Our relationship

110
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,470
is not very good indeed.

111
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,550
However,

112
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,110
we can't let this trivial matter

113
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,510
affect my relationship with Ye Jun.

114
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,550
Ye Jun will tutor you in your homework, won't he?

115
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,110
Our homework is the same anyway.

116
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,670
Come to my home and let's do homework together.

117
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,510
I see.

118
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,390
Ask Ling Chao to join us, too.

119
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,110
I guess he's also very eager to

120
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,390
communicate with my cousin.

121
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,230
But

122
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:50,550
Ling Chao usually likes to study alone.

123
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,909
You can't even do this little thing.

124
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,670
You still want me to make an appointment with my cousin for you?

125
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,710
I'm not a philanthropist.

126
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,230
If you want to make an appointment with my cousin, it's okay.

127
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,110
Just exchange Ling Chao for him.

128
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,790
Fine.

129
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,470
You're in charge of asking Ye Jun to come to my home.

130
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,190
I'll ask Ling Chao to come over.

131
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,870
Your house has been quite lively recently.

132
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,030
There are still guests at this hour.

133
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,390
Dear guest,

134
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,430
don't you know you should knock on the door before entering someone else' room?

135
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,310
I'm a guest?

136
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,790
Ask this door.

137
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,430
Have I ever knocked on the door for these ten years?

138
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,110
Are you having an English class?

139
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,870
I won't see it if you don't allow it.

140
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,470
What a petty guy.

141
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,590
Come to my home tomorrow to do homework.

142
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,030
I finished my homework long ago.

143
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,430
It's been only a few days since the winter vacation began.

144
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,270
Is that what a human can do?

145
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,070
Forget it.

146
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,670
Come and read a book.

147
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,470
It's also okay to stay there in a trance.

148
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,630
It'll be fine as long as you come.

149
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,990
What are you up to this time?

150
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,670
I...

151
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,750
No.

152
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,870
It's been so long since the winter vacation began.

153
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,750
It's time to study.

154
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,310
Then you should study hard.

155
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,030
I won't disturb you.

156
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,030
Don't.

157
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,150
Alright.

158
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,830
I have an appointment with Xu Linglong and Ye Jun.

159
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,990
Anyway, Ye Jun

160
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,590
needs to tutor Xu Linglong anyway.

161
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,870
He can also tutor me.

162
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,270
You want to ask a science student who is about to graduate from college

163
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:21,790
and has been away from senior high school for so long

164
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,270
to teach you,

165
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,390
a liberal arts student who ranks the last in the class?

166
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,470
Let's not talk about whether you can learn it or not.

167
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,590
Does Ye Jun know how to teach you?

168
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,550
Why can't he do that?

169
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,510
It's just a piece of cake

170
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,310
for Ye Jun to teach me.

171
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,030
I can only say that he's too young

172
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,630
and has never experienced

173
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,190
the torture of someone who only got 38 points in math.

174
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,630
Ye Jun is a nice guy.

175
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,909
Do you think everyone is just like you?

176
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,830
I mean

177
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,150
he's as excellent

178
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,070
as you.

179
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,070
I've perceived it.

180
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,310
You've fallen in love with someone else.

181
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,790
Poor Yin Zihan.

182
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,670
Yin Zihan and I are just friends.

183
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,550
If you keep talking nonsense,

184
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,030
I'll send you a lawyer's letter.

185
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,590
The relationship between

186
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,030
Ye Jun and I is not like what you think.

187
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,750
We're childhood sweethearts.

188
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,150
I've admired him since childhood.

189
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,670
Childhood sweethearts?

190
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,670
Do you know what this phrase means?

191
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,110
Don't use it if you don't know its meaning.

192
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,710
Of course I know its meaning.

193
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,670
I have evidence.

194
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,950
All you cared about was eating your own food.

195
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,230
Luckily, Ye Jun found that I didn't have chicken legs,

196
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,790
and he gave one to me specially.

197
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,910
Thank you, Ye Jun.

198
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,830
Thank you, Jun.

199
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,430
Why don't you blow it, Ling Chao?

200
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,150
Ling Chao,

201
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,070
do you want to eat lollipops?

202
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,230
Every time when I talked to you,

203
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,390
you seemed to ignore me.

204
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,910
Ye Jun treated me well.

205
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,670
He bought all the lollipops for me.

206
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,070
Come on. Eat them.

207
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,990
Thank you, Ye Jun.

208
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,950
Ye Jun is so considerate

209
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,230
and so gentle.

210
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,070
He gave the chicken leg to you,

211
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,670
because no one dared to compete with you for it.

212
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,750
He brought you the lollipops

213
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,990
because you kept staring

214
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,350
at the lollipops.

215
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,630
Besides,

216
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,230
he asked you to take one

217
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,190
instead of taking the whole box away.

218
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,430
Even if what you said is true,

219
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,670
it can still prove that

220
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,510
Ye Jun is very gentle, right?

221
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,670
He's also talented and has a good personality.

222
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,750
He deserves to be the one I admire.

223
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,350
You're so obsessed with him.

224
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,550
The point is that

225
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,150
you ate a lot

226
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,750
and ate very fast, right?

227
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,630
Look at this photo.

228
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,910
You guys' ice cream was almost finished.

229
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,190
I still had half of it.

230
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,430
How dare you say that I ate so much and so fast?

231
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,630
Luckily, I have evidence.

232
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,590
That's because

233
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,230
you were eating the second one.

234
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,510
You want evidence, right?

235
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,110
Come on.

236
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,350
I have the photo album.

237
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,510
Come to my home to collect it tomorrow.

238
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,350
Otherwise, I'll destroy it.

239
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,870
Is it necessary for you to do this

240
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,230
just for a photo album?

241
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,190
I'll go out later.

242
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,790
I don't want to show insincere courtesy to strangers.

243
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,230
That's why I said

244
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,030
coming to my home would be the best choice.

245
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,070
Hot water is supplied for 24 hours.

246
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,110
There's no service fee.

247
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,070
You don't have to communicate with strangers as well.

248
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,830
What do you think?

249
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,110
Are you tempted?

250
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,350
What time is it?

251
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,430
7:15.

252
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,790
I'm asking you what time I should go tomorrow.

253
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,310
Anytime.

254
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,550
You can come anytime.

255
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,110
Let's make it clear in advance.

256
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,030
We'll do our own homework respectively.

257
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,510
Don't make a noise.

258
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,470
Don't bother me.

259
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,910
Don't worry.

260
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,070
I know the rules.

261
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,870
This book has been published for the tenth version.

262
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,230
I know.

263
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,830
We've been studying for an hour.

264
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,830
Why don't we take a break?

265
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,870
Let's watch an episode of a TV drama to relax.

266
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,350
I think it's okay.

267
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,230
It's over so soon?

268
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,990
Study for two minutes,

269
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,350
and watch a drama for two hours.

270
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,270
This drama is so interesting.

271
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,750
I can't stop at all after I started watching it.

272
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,950
It's fine for you to watch a drama about a domineering CEO.

273
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,590
You're even interested in aliens.

274
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,030
Ridiculous.

275
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,510
But true love transcends everything.

276
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,790
Nothing is a problem.

277
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,270
That's why it's so touching.

278
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,670
Don't you think

279
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,990
the plot of the first snow

280
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,590
was really romantic?

281
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,390
Right? I like that part, too.

282
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,710
Just imagine it.

283
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,870
On the day of the first snow,

284
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,350
white snowflakes are floating in the sky.

285
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,550
It's really

286
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,590
perfect for a confession love and eating fried chicken.

287
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,790
Speaking of this, I'm a bit hungry.

288
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,630
You're still hungry?

289
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,870
You've eaten so much.

290
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,310
Just a few cups of instant noodles

291
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,270
are not enough for me.

292
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,310
Ye Jun.

293
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,510
You didn't eat anything this afternoon.

294
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,230
You must be hungry.

295
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,150
When my mom comes back later,

296
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,350
I'll ask her to make delicious food for you.

297
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,710
It's too late today.

298
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,590
I'll disturb you any longer.

299
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,510
On the day of the first snow,

300
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,990
I'll treat you all to fried chicken.

301
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,310
According to the weather forecast,

302
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,630
It'll snow next Wednesday.

303
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,230
Good.

304
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,390
Let's do it next Wednesday.

305
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,790
Why didn't you put on more clothes?

306
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,270
Yes, I did.

307
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,830
I've put on the thermal underwear and Long Johns.

308
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,950
I merely have a slight cold.

309
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,590
You shouldn't eat fried chicken when you're sick.

310
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,510
Come on. Let's go home.

311
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,270
I'm fine.

312
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,350
I've taken cold medicine.

313
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,590
I'm almost recovered.

314
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,950
Ling Chao has finally grown up.

315
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,310
He knows how to take care of others.

316
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,630
I'm just worried that your cold will get serious

317
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,710
and will infect me.

318
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,830
I'll infect you.

319
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,510
Morning, Ling Chao.

320
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,110
-It's already afternoon. -Ye Jun.

321
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,150
What?

322
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,470
You two are sick and should stand together.

323
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,350
I'm not sick.

324
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,830
Then why do your eyes and cheeks look red?

325
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:03,910
She's fine.

326
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,630
Let's go.

327
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,950
Let's eat.

328
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,270
Wait.

329
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,830
The first snow hasn't appeared yet.

330
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,630
Right.

331
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,310
Let's eat and wait.

332
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,190
The fried chicken won't taste good after it gets cold.

333
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,510
Come on.

334
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,070
Stop pretending.

335
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,430
We've known each other for so long.

336
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,030
He surely knows how you eat, right?

337
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,950
Is the snow

338
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,750
stuck on the way?

339
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,510
Maybe the flight was cancelled.

340
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,310
Forget it. Whatever.

341
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,390
Still eating?

342
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,950
If you keep eating chickens, they'll become protected animals.

343
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,550
Is it enough? Do you want more?

344
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,670
Ye Jun treats me the best.

345
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,110
Just like this fried chicken.

346
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,750
It smells good and is crispy,

347
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,630
unlike someone,

348
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,950
who is both stiff

349
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,310
and annoying like a chicken bone.

350
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,790
Little Rabbit,

351
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,990
why are you blushing?

352
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,510
It seems a little hot.

353
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,030
Little Rabbit, are you okay?

354
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,150
I think I'm in big trouble.

355
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:50,990
Ye Jun.

356
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,990
You're so handsome.

357
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,190
You're cute, too.

358
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,310
You were my idol when I was a kid.

359
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,710
You look drunk after drinking the non-alcoholic beverage?

360
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,550
Are you trying to get close to my cousin?

361
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,830
Xiao Tu is not feeling well.

362
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,950
I'll take her home first.

363
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,390
Let's go.

364
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,550
Go home.

365
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,790
Bye.

366
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,110
Bye.

367
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,990
Why did you touch my head?

368
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,710
-I'm back. -I like this decorative

369
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,790
style very much.

370
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,350
Chao, you're back.

371
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,070
Thank you.

372
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,630
Mr. Ling,

373
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,230
if you have any problem about housing subsequently,

374
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,550
you can contact me anytime.

375
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,350
Okay. Thank you.

376
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:46,870
Okay.

377
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,390
Alright.

378
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,750
I'll won't disturb you any longer.

379
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,470
-Okay. -Okay.

380
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,070
I'll see you off.

381
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,670
Okay.

382
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,990
Hurry up. Your dad is waiting for you.

383
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,030
Come on, Ling Chao.

384
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,590
Have a seat.

385
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,230
Take care. See you.

386
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,030
Look at this.

387
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,990
Bye. Bye.

388
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,710
Villa?

389
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,670
Yes.

390
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,510
Here's the thing.

391
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,550
I think the house we're live in now

392
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,870
is a bit small.

393
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,830
Look. You don't have a separate study room.

394
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,270
I don't have a reception room, either.

395
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,030
It's not convenient to study

396
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:17,990
or talk about business.

397
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,430
Besides, this is an old neighborhood.

398
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,430
There's also no garage.

399
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,150
It's troublesome to park a car.

400
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,390
So you want to move to a new house?

401
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,910
I've bought it.

402
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,710
It's well decorated.

403
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,710
Let's pick a date,

404
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,070
and then we can move in directly.

405
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,750
I won't move to the new house.

406
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,190
You don't like it?

407
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,670
Both the lighting and green space in this neighborhood

408
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,550
are good.

409
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,070
Its area is big, too.

410
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,430
I've even prepared a separate

411
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,550
computer room for you specially.

412
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,030
Take a look first.

413
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,390
It's really good.

414
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,030
When I was a kid,

415
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,310
you treated me as a little child,

416
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,790
and didn't discuss with me about anything.

417
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,510
It was fine for me.

418
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,150
I've grown up now, but you're still treating me like this.

419
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,270
You try to decide everything for me

420
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,550
with your own ideas.

421
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,870
Have you ever respected what I think?

422
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,870
Chao, don't say that.

423
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,550
You're in the 12th grade now.

424
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,750
Your dad is worried that this will affect your study,

425
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,830
so he wants to replace this

426
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,270
with a better environment for you.

427
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,710
I'm living well here.

428
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,550
You can move if you want.

429
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,630
I won't move anyway.

430
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,270
Chao.

431
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,590
Come on, Wenhui.

432
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,230
Have some water.

433
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,030
What's wrong?

434
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,310
You don't look well lately.

435
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,590
Is something bothering you?

436
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,390
It's because of my husband and son.

437
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,430
My husband wants to move to a new house,

438
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,590
but my son disagrees.

439
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,350
My son got angry because of the disagreement.

440
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,550
Then your husband can move,

441
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,590
and your son won't move.

442
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,950
Isn't it quite simple?

443
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,750
Right?

444
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,470
Have some water.

445
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,190
You've just said that you're going to move to a new house?

446
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,270
Ling Chao is in the 12th grade now, isn't he?

447
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,110
Ling Bo bought a villa,

448
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,350
and said that he wanted a move to a better environment.

449
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,550
He bought a villa.

450
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,430
Is it quite far away from here?

451
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,310
It's not decided yet.

452
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,310
But this happened

453
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,990
so suddenly.

454
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,390
It really happened so suddenly.

455
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,030
You said you would move to a new house.

456
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,150
I feel that

457
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,910
I don't want you to leave.

458
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,510
All these years,

459
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,630
if you and Xiao hadn't helped me,

460
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,270
I wouldn't have made it.

461
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,630
What are you talking about?

462
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,270
I'll go back and tell Ling Bo that

463
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,070
we won't move.

464
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,270
No, no, no.

465
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,310
You must move.

466
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,510
Listen to me.

467
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,150
This is really a good thing.

468
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,590
I'm truly happy for you.

469
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,630
Remember,

470
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,630
we are still in-laws.

471
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,310
You are my closest family.

472
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,630
I don't want to leave you.

473
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,150
I don't want to leave you, either.

474
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,350
You are the closest person to me all my life.

475
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,270
How can I be happy without you?

476
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,110
The 8 o'clock show is not as dramatic as you two.

477
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,030
Coming.

478
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,350
Little Rabbit.

479
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,070
Godfather.

480
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,990
Come in.

481
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,670
Ling Chao is not home.

482
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,350
Godfather, I'm here to see you.

483
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:21,990
Okay.

484
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,350
Sit.

485
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,990
Come on. Have a tangerine.

486
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,790
Godfather.

487
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,750
Are you going to move to a new house?

488
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,990
Yes, that's what I plan to do.

489
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,630
Well,

490
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,830
Ling Chao isn't willing to do so, right?

491
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,510
I want to talk to him patiently again.

492
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,990
Godfather,

493
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,470
do you still remember

494
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,550
the computer you gave Ling Chao at that time?

495
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,870
He still keeps it now.

496
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,390
Actually, we all know

497
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:03,990
it's not that he doesn't want to discard that computer.

498
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,190
He just doesn't want to let go of the memories about you and him.

499
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,030
For several times,

500
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,430
I saw him secretly looking at the family photo.

501
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,590
Later, I realized that

502
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,670
he was used to holding back many of

503
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,910
his thoughts and emotions.

504
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,430
But he actually values family relationships very much.

505
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,390
For what you've said,

506
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,550
I know it all very well.

507
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,950
That's why I feel that

508
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,670
I've owed Ling Chao too much.

509
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,390
I want to make it up to him.

510
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,670
This time, we're going to move,

511
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,350
and it's for his own good actually.

512
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,870
But Godfather,

513
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,270
for Ling Chao,

514
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,670
your return

515
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,630
is the best thing.

516
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,550
Actually,

517
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,830
Ling Chao doesn't care whether the house is big or not.

518
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,950
What he wants

519
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,510
is that the whole family can be together.

520
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,110
It seems that

521
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,190
I didn't think this through indeed.

522
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,390
Rabbit.

523
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,030
Look.

524
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,070
I've specially designed a separate

525
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,870
study room for him in this new house.

526
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,550
He won't be disturbed when he studies and does

527
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,950
his homework there in the future.

528
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:13,950
Look here, too.

529
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,190
I asked someone

530
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,510
to make a separate

531
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,910
computer room for him specially.

532
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:18,910
Godfather,

533
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,150
this is the new house you bought?

534
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:21,790
Yes.

535
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,990
It's so big.

536
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,630
Let me tell you.

537
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,270
Ling Chao's bedroom

538
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,750
is as big as this living room.

539
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,070
There's a swimming pool and a garden.

540
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,150
So nice.

541
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,350
But I

542
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,910
still don't want you to move elsewhere.

543
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,070
Don't worry.

544
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,150
I've thought about it.

545
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,390
I've specially reserved

546
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,830
a room for you in this new house.

547
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,790
It's right here.

548
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,510
After we really move to the new house,

549
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,310
you can come to visit us anytime.

550
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,910
Godfather,

551
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,350
why don't you talk to Ling Chao patiently again?

552
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,950
Or you can take him to the villa directly.

553
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,310
Then he might agree.

554
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,870
Okay.

555
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,030
I'll carefully discuss it

556
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,230
with your godmother again.

557
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,470
I'm the elder sister.

558
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,350
I never lie to little brothers.

559
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,230
If you don't believe me,

560
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,630
I'll wait for my godfather with you.

561
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,270
My doll and I will always be with you

562
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,310
and protect you.

563
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,790
Thank you, sister.

564
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,230
Who is it?

565
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,470
Ling Chao.

566
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,430
Are you really going to move to a new house?

567
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,830
If you wake me up

568
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,070
at 6 a.m. again

569
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,310
next time,

570
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,230
I'd rather move elsewhere.

571
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,390
Then I won't wake you up so early again.

572
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,710
You...

573
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:20,590
How come you have no sense of humor at all?

574
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,790
I'm just kidding.

575
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,550
It has nothing to do with you.

576
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,710
I know that

577
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,510
you don't lack anything in your new house,

578
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,430
but you still need to take some things with you.

579
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,790
For this tea table,

580
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,230
we scrambled for candies here when we were kids,

581
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,670
which made you hurt your head.

582
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,710
You still have a scar on your forehead.

583
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,910
And this cabinet.

584
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,870
We played hide-and-seek here when we were kids.

585
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,950
You hid inside.

586
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,430
In the middle of the game,

587
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,870
I was attracted by the sugar cakes

588
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,950
bought by my godmother.

589
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,790
Because of that, you hid inside here for a long time,

590
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,190
and fell asleep in the end.

591
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,750
And this sofa.

592
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,510
When we were in junior high school,

593
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,950
we sat here and ate watermelon.

594
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,590
We insisted on have a competition of spitting watermelon seeds.

595
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,870
But we had to clean them by oursevles in the end.

596
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,790
As I'm thinking of this, we were quite childish.

597
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,430
And that little turtle.

598
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,230
You must take it with you.

599
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,470
Otherwise, it will starve to death.

600
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,590
Did you skip breakfast?

601
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,590
Why do you sound so weak when you talk?

602
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,990
At this time,

603
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,670
how could I have the mood to eat?

604
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,030
Porridge or deep-fried dough sticks?

605
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,030
Of course I'll eat Madam Zhang's soy milk with deep-fried dough sticks.

606
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,750
When these dough sticks were fried,

607
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,350
the temperature of the oil was just appropriate.

608
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,270
Both sides look golden yellow.

609
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,790
It tastes crispy outside but tender inside.

610
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,830
Take a sip of sweet soy milk while eating it.

611
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,190
It's chewy

612
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,510
with different layers of taste.

613
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,510
When we eat steamed buns,

614
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,870
we should eat them with this dipping sauce.

615
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,070
It tastes sweet and sour.

616
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,710
It's also appetizing and helps to cleanse the palate.

617
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,030
Ling Chao.

618
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,950
There are so many delicious foods for breakfast.

619
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,790
Are you really willing to move elsewhere?

620
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,390
Hey!

621
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,350
I've told you so much.

622
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,430
Did you hear me?

623
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,870
Who said that I would move elsewhere?

624
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,950
Don't worry.

625
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,830
I won't leave.

626
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,270
Eat more.

627
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,830
Come on. Eat more. Just eat.

628
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,310
Eat more.

629
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,310
Eat more.

630
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:36,990
This is delicious.

631
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,750
It's very delicious.

632
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,830
This is also delicious.

633
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:39,830
This is yours, too.

634
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,590
They're all yours.

635
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,030
Eat. Just eat.

636
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,430
Where did Ling Chao

637
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,190
go so early in the morning?

638
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,990
He even didn't bring his mobile phone with him.

639
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,630
I wonder if he had breakfast.

640
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,910
Leave some for him.

641
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,190
Look at this bowl.

642
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,990
Chao refused to eat when he was a kid.

643
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,670
He even broke a corner of the bowl.

644
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,150
I didn't expect that he would use

645
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,070
this small broken bowl

646
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,390
for so many years.

647
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,550
Ling,

648
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,070
are we really going to move to a new house?

649
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,270
You're back.

650
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,230
Where did you go so early in the morning?

651
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,910
I bought some breakfast.

652
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,630
You went to buy the breakfast.

653
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,670
Let's eat together.

654
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,630
I'll fetch a bowl for you.

655
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,350
Okay.

656
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:38,670
Come on. Here.

657
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,630
Why did you get up so early today?

658
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,470
Put it in the middle.

659
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,990
Why did you think of buying deep-fried dough sticks today?

660
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,870
I just went out

661
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,030
and happened to see them, so...

662
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,510
Is it because I like eating them?

663
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,470
We won't move.

664
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,070
We're not going to move.

665
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:34,670
Come on. Let's eat.

666
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,430
Okay.

667
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,590
The books are all here.

668
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,590
See if there's any book you're looking for.

669
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,990
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

670
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,230
There are so many books about the major of computers.

671
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,510
Are you going to apply for the major of computer science in the future?

672
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,710
I bought them because I was interested.

673
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,790
I think you are talented in this.

674
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,990
Why don't you consider

675
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:15,990
joining my company?

676
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,790
It's too early to say that now.

677
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,910
You're right.

678
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,550
I found it.

679
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,590
This is it.

680
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,270
Nothing.

681
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,110
I just think this is interesting.

682
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,310
What do you think

683
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,550
of Xiao Tu?

684
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,150
Xiao Tu.

685
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,750
She's quite special.

686
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,110
Does Ye Jun

687
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,350
also have such a bad taste that he has crush on Xiao Tu?

688
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,350
Wait.

689
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,430
Why did I say "also"?

690
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,190
Godfather.

691
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,230
When I watched this TV drama,

692
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,430
I saw that the heroine often

693
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,310
leaned her head on the shoulder of a boy.

694
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,230
I wanted to give it a try to see if it feels comfortable.

695
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,230
You're not okay.

696
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,070
You're too thin.

697
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,830
Your bones made me feel uncomfortable.
