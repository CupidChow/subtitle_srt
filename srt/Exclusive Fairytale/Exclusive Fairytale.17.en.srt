00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,270
Check out, please.

3
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,590
All done.

4
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,350
Thank you.

5
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,830
Sun, hold this for me.

6
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,030
My hands are tied.

7
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,590
Thanks, Wukong.

8
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,710
Is there a replay?

9
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,670
Who can tell me what happened?

10
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:21,990
Itchy.

11
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,789
You know what I want to say.

12
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,750
I...

13
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,190
I don't know.

14
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,070
You know.

15
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,830
Do you want to hear it?

16
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,990
Go ahead. I'm listening.

17
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,229
We know each other.

18
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,190
We also know each other's dark history.

19
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,630
We can accept each other.

20
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,310
Although we often quarrel,

21
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,710
we'll always make up.

22
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,070
You will tolerate me,

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,110
and I will accommodate you.

24
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,470
We're not alike,

25
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,390
but we're just like the other self to each other in this world.

26
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,790
So I'm glad it's you.

27
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,350
It can only be you.

28
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,470
I like you.

29
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,710
In your words,

30
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,110
I like you the most in this universe.

31
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,030
Do you

32
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,950
want to be with me?

33
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,750
I see.

34
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,550
Well,

35
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,870
let's talk about it after you win first place tomorrow.

36
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,750
So strict?

37
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,630
Can I

38
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,230
ask for some luck in advance?

39
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,390
What?

40
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,990
Are you and Ling Chao dating?

41
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,150
I didn't see that coming.

42
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,830
What do you mean?

43
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,070
Didn't you always set me up with Ling Chao?

44
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,790
We just did

45
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,390
what you want.

46
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,510
I didn't expect you not to tell me until now.

47
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,470
How's your first relationship?

48
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,149
Is it sweet?

49
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,029
Linglong.

50
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,470
Are you okay?

51
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,070
There are many excellent boys out there.

52
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,190
Don't be too sad.

53
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,310
Why should I be sad?

54
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,750
Xiao Tu doesn't deserve Ling Chao.

55
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,430
Sooner or later, they will break up.

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,950
Then Ling Chao will find out

57
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,150
I'm better.

58
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,990
Sha.

59
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,909
Bajie.

60
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:46,870
I'm here.

61
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,030
Master fell in love

62
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,510
and left us behind.

63
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,070
Right.

64
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,470
I was born to be with her.

65
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,950
You can't compare with me.

66
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,670
Your feelings have got a response

67
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,310
after you've been waiting for so long.

68
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,070
That's great.

69
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,590
It's great to have a girlfriend.

70
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,630
Everyone envies him.

71
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,910
Senior.

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,430
How are things going between you and Xia Mo?

73
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,150
Forget it.

74
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,510
We can only be friends

75
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,430
in this life.

76
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,710
What's going on?

77
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,990
Didn't you get along with her at the beginning of this semester?

78
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,030
She is good.

79
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,510
She's also good-looking.

80
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,110
Right.

81
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,030
She's also in good shape.

82
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:32,909
Right.

83
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:33,909
But I…

84
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,110
But I dare not watch horror movies.

85
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,830
Look at you.

86
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,870
You're my senior.

87
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,830
Master, where are you going?

88
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,470
To see my girlfriend.

89
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,150
Bajie. Sha.

90
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,270
There'll only be three of us

91
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,390
staying single.

92
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,350
The three of us...

93
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,830
The three of us

94
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,790
can only warm us up ourselves.

95
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,870
Who is it?

96
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,150
Promotion.

97
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,110
Is it from Ling Chao? What did he text you?

98
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,070
A promotion message.

99
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,950
What's wrong with you guys?

100
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,430
You two haven't contacted each other

101
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,590
for an hour.

102
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,310
Are you in a relationship?

103
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:40,710
Ling Chao! Ling Chao!

104
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,390
I saw him. I'm not blind.

105
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:47,510
Let's go.

106
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,510
Let's go. Aren't you going to eat?

107
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,710
If you two are on a date,

108
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,190
I won't go with you.

109
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,270
What's wrong with it?

110
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,430
Can't we eat if we're dating?

111
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,390
I'll be a third wheel

112
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,750
between you two.

113
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,190
It's embarrassing.

114
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,390
I'm not going.

115
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,310
Who's free?

116
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,390
Come to the old place.

117
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,750
That's it.

118
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,270
Then we got together.

119
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,870
That's it?

120
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,990
It's not romantic at all.

121
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,030
Love should start

122
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,110
with a bouquet of flowers and a confession.

123
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,190
Really?

124
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,990
Must there be flowers?

125
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,550
Can't it be broccoli?

126
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,310
You're so clumsy.

127
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,670
Less than three seconds.

128
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,390
This is for you.

129
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,590
Wait. You can't eat it.

130
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,590
What's wrong?

131
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,150
Are you going to say

132
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,830
shrimp is so cute,

133
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,310
how can I eat shrimp?

134
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,030
Come on.

135
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,790
Your boyfriend

136
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,070
should peel it for you.

137
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,790
It's okay.

138
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,270
The shrimp's essence

139
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,430
is on its shell.

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,830
It won't taste good if others peel it.

141
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,190
Is the point the taste of shrimp?

142
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,630
Are you two dating or not?

143
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,510
Are you acting?

144
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,150
I always feel something is wrong.

145
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,110
Then tell me,

146
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,590
how should a relationship be?

147
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,870
It's simple.

148
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,430
If you like someone,

149
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,470
you always want to know what he eats today.

150
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,670
What does he see?

151
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,870
Is there anything interesting thing?

152
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,590
Anyway,

153
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,430
you'd like to share everything with him.

154
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,230
Look.

155
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,510
But Ling Chao is right next to me.

156
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,429
He knows what I ordered.

157
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,190
That's not what I meant.

158
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,270
It's just dating…

159
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,110
You two should have more interactions

160
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,470
in a relationship.

161
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,110
Ms. Jiang is right.

162
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,590
Right?

163
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,190
Right, well…

164
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,310
How can we interact while we're eating?

165
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,750
That's enough.

166
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,710
You can't eat this much.

167
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,790
How about this, Ms. Zhu?

168
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,670
Let's

169
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,830
show them.

170
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,630
Okay, tell me.

171
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,870
What should I do?

172
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,550
Babe.

173
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,910
Try this.

174
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,590
I like

175
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,310
whatever you give me.

176
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,830
Is it delicious?

177
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,710
Yes.

178
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,790
Babe.

179
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,470
I can't open this bottle.

180
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,150
Can you open it for me?

181
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,070
Let me do it.

182
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,870
Babe, you're amazing!

183
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,430
You're good at opening the bottle.

184
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,350
I want to hit you.

185
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,550
By the way,

186
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,230
neither of you had a relationship before, right?

187
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,110
Right.

188
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,150
Why should I listen to you two

189
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,750
teaching me how to date?

190
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,190
Babe, she's mad at me.

191
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,990
Protect me.

192
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,590
You...

193
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,150
What are you doing?

194
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,310
I'll send it to Jia Siwen.

195
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,510
Well, you...

196
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,230
Sorry, I was wrong.

197
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,870
Hurry up. Delete it.

198
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,590
-Delete it. -I already sent it.

199
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,750
-Delete it. -Just sent it.

200
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,190
Recall it.

201
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,910
Shouldn't we hand in the photography homework?

202
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,510
Let's find a place to take photos tomorrow.

203
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,150
I'm done.

204
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,550
When?

205
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,830
I took some pictures at the meet-and-greet

206
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,430
a few days ago.

207
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,710
Well…

208
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,150
Just come with me.

209
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,310
I'll buy you milk tea.

210
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,630
Please.

211
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,030
You have a boyfriend now.

212
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,470
Don't let me accompany you for everything.

213
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,950
You should learn to grow up.

214
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,150
You should ask Ling Chao

215
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,510
to take pictures with you.

216
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,190
It's tiresome.

217
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,910
That's not what I meant.

218
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,230
I mean you and Ling Chao

219
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,670
should go out more often

220
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,030
and see the outside world.

221
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,390
Don't always date

222
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,550
in the library or a canteen.

223
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,430
It's boring.

224
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,510
You're young.

225
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,590
You should broaden your horizons.

226
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,750
Broaden.

227
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,350
Look.

228
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,110
Learn how others date.

229
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,510
Look at these high heels.

230
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,510
The skirt. Learn it.

231
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,710
Don't always wear these.

232
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,310
What's wrong with this?

233
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,230
Boy.

234
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,150
New trend.

235
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,030
You got it.

236
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,110
Don't move.

237
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,670
Give me your bag.

238
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,550
It's okay. Let's go.

239
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,790
One, two, three. Cheese.

240
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,870
Let me help you carry it.

241
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,950
It's okay. It's not heavy.

242
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,910
This is not good.

243
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,270
What pictures are these?

244
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,870
Miss.

245
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,870
You must be a photographer.

246
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,110
You look professional.

247
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,030
Could you please

248
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,230
take some photos for us?

249
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,590
Okay.

250
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,510
Okay, okay.

251
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,150
Thank you.

252
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,870
Here, thank you.

253
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,830
Come here.

254
00:12:58,830 --> 00:12:59,710
Let's take a photo together.

255
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,710
She's professional.

256
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,430
Come on.

257
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,790
Two, three.

258
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,230
Cheese.

259
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:04,990
Okay.

260
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,910
Another pose.

261
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,350
Another pose.

262
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,630
Face the wind.

263
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,990
Cheese.

264
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,710
What do you think?

265
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,030
It looks good.

266
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,670
Let me see.

267
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,470
Let me see.

268
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,590
Nice.

269
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,230
Great.

270
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,830
Thank you.

271
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,510
Thank you.

272
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,550
-Miss. -You're welcome.

273
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,950
Miss.

274
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,310
He's so handsome.

275
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,870
Is he your boyfriend?

276
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,750
What's wrong with your eyes?

277
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,830
If they are a couple,

278
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,670
would the girl carry her own bag?

279
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,350
Of course, I can tell that.

280
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,990
The way he looked at the girl just now

281
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,430
sold himself out.

282
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,350
Madam.

283
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,910
We're here for a visit.

284
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,430
Can you take a photo for us?

285
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,190
Sure.

286
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,110
It's a good background.

287
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,510
I'll take a good picture for you.

288
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,590
One, two, three.

289
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,350
I feel something is missing.

290
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,270
It's okay.

291
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,670
It looks good.

292
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,710
Are you okay?

293
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,790
I'm fine.

294
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,550
If it's not convenient for you,

295
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,070
you don't have to wear a skirt next time.

296
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,270
Okay.

297
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,150
I can't open it.

298
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,790
Thank you. Amazing.

299
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,470
That's enough.

300
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,830
It'll be too over if you keep acting.

301
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,230
Ling Chao.

302
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,350
Do you think

303
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,990
we don't look like a couple?

304
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,430
I don't know,

305
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,190
but there's no rules

306
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,750
about what a couple should do.

307
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,510
You're right,

308
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,150
but

309
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,270
the couples in those dramas

310
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,550
are not like us.

311
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,230
Like this.

312
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,310
Or...

313
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,270
How about this?

314
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,350
Or...

315
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,110
What?

316
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,750
It requires a vibe to kiss.

317
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:45,790
Xiao Tu.

318
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,110
What I like is the real you,

319
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,630
so there's really no need to do anything on purpose.

320
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,150
No matter what others say,

321
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,550
we just need to be ourselves.

322
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,550
I suddenly feel that I'm quite lucky.

323
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,349
My first boyfriend

324
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:11,030
is such a familiar person

325
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,950
whom I can get along with so naturally.

326
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,790
Your first boyfriend?

327
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,630
How many more boyfriends do you want?

328
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,430
That's not what I meant.

329
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,390
No, I...

330
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,470
What do you mean?

331
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,910
I, I want to say

332
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,310
this is my first time dating.

333
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,870
Maybe we can't be like other couples,

334
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,910
but if I do anything wrong,

335
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,990
just tell me.

336
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,190
Since we're familiar with each other,

337
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,030
there's no need to hide it.

338
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,110
What are you talking about?

339
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,710
I understand.

340
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,310
You mean…

341
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,470
Nice to meet you.

342
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,910
Nice to meet you.

343
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,710
Give me your bag.

344
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,950
Go back and rest early. See you tomorrow.

345
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,350
Master.

346
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,030
if you want to find a new tourist spot,

347
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,390
you can ask the local, Sha.

348
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,830
Sha.

349
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,150
He's a living GPS.

350
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,230
He can find a good place.

351
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,270
I recommend

352
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,870
Quantum Design Science Centre.

353
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,590
There are many…

354
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,470
Master is going on a date,

355
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,350
not to study.

356
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,150
Change another one.

357
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,470
I think the provincial library…

358
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,870
The park next to the provincial library is also good.

359
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,830
There are many projects inside.

360
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,510
Master.

361
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,110
Let's just search online.

362
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,310
Let's search it.

363
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,910
Wait.

364
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,750
I remember when I was in middle school,

365
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,950
my teacher took me to a forest park.

366
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,990
It takes three hours to take the bus there.

367
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,550
You may need to stay there for one night ahead.

368
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,630
It sounds good.

369
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,110
Master.

370
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,030
Just this one.

371
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,190
Just this one.

372
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,790
Master.

373
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,270
If you only stay for one night,

374
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,070
should you book one room

375
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,110
or two?

376
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:47,870
Two rooms.

377
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,590
Two rooms?

378
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,230
Didn't you already sleep together the night before the competition...

379
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:57,950
I see.

380
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,070
Wait for me.

381
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,710
Master.

382
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,950
Five T.

383
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,630
Not enough.

384
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,710
I have more.

385
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,670
Ridiculous.

386
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,470
What are you going to do during the holidays?

387
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,670
I haven't decided yet.

388
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,990
Then we can go…

389
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,950
Hello.

390
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,750
Xiao Tu, is Jiang Juanjuan beside you?

391
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,430
Yes.

392
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,790
Do you want me to put her on the phone?

393
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,630
No.

394
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,350
I have something to tell you in private.

395
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,070
Is that okay?

396
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,670
My connection is bad.

397
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,030
Wait a second.

398
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,430
I have to go.

399
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,550
Go ahead.

400
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,030
It's just a date.

401
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,470
Why is she hiding?

402
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,550
The child has finally grown up.

403
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,070
Hello, the number you have dialed is busy.

404
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,550
Please try again later.

405
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,710
Is he calling another girl?

406
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,550
Weird.

407
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,390
Why should I care about that?

408
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,710
Here.

409
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,590
Eat more.

410
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,590
Let's go out together during the holiday.

411
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,190
Sure.

412
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,550
There's a forest park nearby.

413
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,670
I heard it's not bad.

414
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,710
No, I have an appointment during the holiday.

415
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:29,830
Well...

416
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,950
We can go there next time.

417
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,190
Do you have an appointment with Jiang Juanjuan?

418
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,310
No, no.

419
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,270
Then who is it?

420
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:38,790
I...

421
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,830
I can't tell you yet.

422
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,590
I have the right to know whether it's a man or a woman.

423
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,390
A man,

424
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,150
probably.

425
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,190
What do you mean by "probably"?

426
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,230
I can't tell you now.

427
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,150
I have class.

428
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,070
I'm going to class.

429
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,830
A man?

430
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,150
He can't tell me yet?

431
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,030
Look at the female celebrity nowadays.

432
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,350
She's turned bad after she got rich.

433
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,750
I saw the gossip too.

434
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,990
She dated another young man

435
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:17,950
even when she has a boyfriend.

436
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,750
Exactly.

437
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,190
Women are unreliable.

438
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,590
Yes.

439
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,030
I think we should stay single.

440
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,790
It's good to be single.

441
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,830
Staying single is safe.

442
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,790
I'll seal my heart with cement.

443
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,390
Let's go.

444
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,070
Jiang Hu?

445
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,150
Probably not.

446
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,350
Ye Jun?

447
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,870
Isn't he on a business trip?

448
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,910
Hello.

449
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,830
Ling Chao.

450
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,790
Yin Zihan.

451
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,310
Are you coming back during the holiday?

452
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,110
I'm busy studying.

453
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,030
I don't have time for vacation.

454
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,790
I don't even have time to eat and sleep.

455
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,190
I don't deserve a vacation.

456
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,070
Fine.

457
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,790
That's great.

458
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,030
It's okay.

459
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,110
Hello?

460
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,270
Hello?

461
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,110
I...

462
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,070
He really took me as a tool

463
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,550
and just threw me away after using me?

464
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,070
Why is he still

465
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,470
so ruthless and unreasonable?

466
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,870
What's your plan during the May Day holidays?

467
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,550
I'm going to Wenhui's fan meet-up.

468
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,510
We're leaving tonight.

469
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,030
No, you can't go.

470
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,030
Why?

471
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:03,150
It's dangerous to go alone.

472
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,710
It's okay.

473
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,150
It's just in the nearby city.

474
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,470
Besides, it's not my first time

475
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,350
to fangirl.

476
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,950
Don't worry.

477
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,230
Then you can't go.

478
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,550
Think about it.

479
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,550
You've been to Wenhui's fan meet-up

480
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,750
many times.

481
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,430
As the saying goes,

482
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,510
distance brings beauty.

483
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,670
You need to create a sense of mystery for Wenhui

484
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,270
to make him curious about you.

485
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,870
You have a point,

486
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,630
but I've bought the ticket.

487
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,550
Besides,

488
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,830
Wenhui won't remember who I am.

489
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,790
So you'd better save it

490
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,350
for next time.

491
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,390
Juan.

492
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,910
Actually,

493
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,870
I just want you to accompany me.

494
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,550
Come on.

495
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,550
Ask your boyfriend to accompany you.

496
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,230
At this point,

497
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,470
I can only tell you the truth.

498
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,110
Actually,

499
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,790
there are some problems

500
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,030
in my relationship with Ling Chao

501
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,230
Maybe

502
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,150
it's what people call

503
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,270
the fatigue period.

504
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,630
How long have you been dating

505
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,150
and you're already getting tired of it?

506
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,790
Isn't it too early?

507
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,190
I don't know.

508
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,070
Maybe

509
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,150
we've known each other for too long.

510
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,030
He has lost

511
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,990
interest in me.

512
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,590
Anyway,

513
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,070
I'm not happy doing anything recently.

514
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,590
Life is boring.

515
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,510
If you could accompany me,

516
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,590
I would feel better.

517
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,790
Okay.

518
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,990
I'll return the ticket.

519
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,990
I'll stay with you.

520
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:48,910
Great.

521
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,470
In that case,

522
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,150
will this affect your relationship with Wenhui?

523
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,430
It's okay.

524
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,110
Wenhui will understand.

525
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,030
After all,

526
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:06,150
friends are the most important.

527
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,190
Buy me a cup of milk tea.

528
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,910
Okay.

529
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,270
Hello, what would you like to order?

530
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,390
A cup of milk tea.

531
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:13,790
One red bean double skin milk,

532
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,630
and two ice cream cones.

533
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,070
Okay.

534
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,670
What about you?

535
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,070
You don't look like

536
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,750
worried at all.

537
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,990
It's because you're with me.

538
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,950
It's too greasy.

539
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,950
I want a cup of milk tea without sugar.

540
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,510
Okay.

541
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,110
Thank you.

542
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,110
Fine.

543
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,230
Men are all bad.

544
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,470
Ling.

545
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,590
What are you doing here?

546
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,790
Didn't we agree to go to the library?

547
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,830
I don't want to go.

548
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,990
Let's go eat first.

549
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,750
I'm not hungry yet.

550
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,070
Shall I go for a walk with you?

551
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,270
No.

552
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,230
It's boring.

553
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,510
What happened?

554
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,390
Master.

555
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,950
I heard you and your girlfriend are getting into the fatigue period.

556
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,350
See you at the playground at 6 p.m.

557
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,190
I have something important to tell you.

558
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,670
Ling Chao.

559
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,070
I think it's a mistake for us to be together.

560
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,190
I'm really

561
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,430
not interested in you.

562
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,990
Holding your hand is like holding my own hand.

563
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,390
Let's break up.

564
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,270
Hurry up.

565
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,070
What's wrong?

566
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,350
I saw Ling Chao

567
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,790
taking a walk with another girl on Wutong Avenue.

568
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,590
What?

569
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,270
How could he do that?

570
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,910
Wait. I'll help you teach him a lesson.

571
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:23,830
Okay.

572
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,790
Scum.

573
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,870
You want to change your taste

574
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,470
after getting tired of dating a short girl?

575
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,230
Men really like women with long legs.

576
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,350
Today, I'll tell others

577
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,310
what kind of people both of you are.

578
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,350
You cheater!

579
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,230
You cheater!

580
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,510
You cheater, Jia Siwen.

581
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,550
-You cheater. -Turn it off.

582
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,550
-How can I turn it off? -You cheater.

583
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,430
-Well… - You cheater.

584
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,470
-Well… - You cheater.

585
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,990
You cheater.

586
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,670
Well…

587
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,670
All right.

588
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,110
What is this?

589
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,190
Well…

590
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,550
Fine.

591
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,670
Jia Siwen, tell me.

592
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,830
Is he trying to confess to me?

593
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,870
Jiang Juanjuan.

594
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,310
What's going on?

595
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,350
I'm going to confess my love.

596
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,990
Tonight…

597
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,470
There's a once-in-a-century meteor shower tonight.

598
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,790
We may not be able to observe it

599
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,710
for various reasons

600
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,830
like the weather, vision, and moon.

601
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,870
But it's about to happen

602
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,830
in this time and space.

603
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,350
Even when we can't see each other,

604
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,630
he still loves me deeply.

605
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,790
It's 18:12 now.

606
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,230
Even if it's still daytime in UTC-5

607
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,670
and it's winter in the southern hemisphere,

608
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,790
this minute

609
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,670
is the best summer dusk for me.

610
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,230
Is he trying to say

611
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,910
no matter what the world is like,

612
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,230
he only cares about me.

613
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,950
Actually,

614
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,590
I didn't think about what to say before I came here.

615
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,790
I just want to talk about meteors

616
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,950
and sunset

617
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,070
in this special time.

618
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,310
What is he talking about?

619
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,030
I don't know.

620
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,390
But

621
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,030
it's not only about meteors,

622
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,070
but also…

623
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,270
I like you too.

624
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,710
That's it.

625
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,350
This must be your first time coming to our campus, isn't it?

626
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,350
Let me show you around.

627
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,950
Okay.

628
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,790
I also want to walk on the road you usually walk on.

629
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,910
This is the romance and sense of ritual Jiang Juanjuan mentioned.

630
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,190
Jia Siwen.

631
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,830
When did you fall in love with me?

632
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,990
Be careful.

633
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:13,750
I...

634
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,670
Do you remember

635
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,470
the globe I gave you in high school?

636
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,030
Yes.

637
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,270
You said

638
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,150
the earth is round

639
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,310
and people will meet.

640
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,270
So the long distance between us is not a problem,

641
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,030
right?

642
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:30,270
You can understand it this way.

643
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,590
But actually,

644
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,390
I engraved something under the globe.

645
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:34,750
Engraved something?

646
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,430
You've liked me since then?

647
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,590
Let me get the flowers.

648
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,190
I'll give it to you when we get to the dorm.

649
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,030
Okay.

650
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,990
Take it with another hand,

651
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,110
so I can hold your hand.

652
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,110
Why is their love

653
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,950
based on our fatigue?

654
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,510
I promised Jia Siwen not to tell anyone.

655
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,750
Anyone?

656
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,110
Am I included?

657
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,870
I'm your boyfriend.

658
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,590
A boyfriend is also a human.

659
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,110
Don't look down on yourself.

660
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,630
What are you talking about?

661
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,070
Dad, mom.

662
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,190
Rabbit.

663
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,550
What are you doing?

664
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,510
Is that Chao?

665
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,710
Are you two together?

666
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,630
Yes, godmother.

667
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,790
We are together.

668
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,150
What do you mean?

669
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,270
Nothing.

670
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,390
You'll make people misunderstanding.

671
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,790
Ling Chao means

672
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,510
we are taking a walk together.

673
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,550
You two are quite romantic.

674
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,110
I have nothing.

675
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,910
I won't disturb your date then.

676
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,350
Mom, I told you.

677
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,830
We are just taking a walk together.

678
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,230
She said it was only a walk.

679
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,070
Let me say it.

680
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,990
What are you talking about?

681
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,830
Rabbit! Rabbit!

682
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,070
I'm telling you. It's stuck. Look.

683
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,070
Okay, I've got to run.

684
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,750
Why didn't you admit

685
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,910
your relationship?

686
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,990
I haven't get ready for it.

687
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,990
I think you just don’t want to make it public

688
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,070
so you can date someone else secretly.

689
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,230
It's not like that.

690
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,230
You know my mom.

691
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,070
If my mom knew we are together,

692
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,150
she would urge us to get married immediately.

693
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,950
By then, we'll have only two options.

694
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,310
A, get engaged immediately.

695
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,790
B, get nagged by her.

696
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,830
You're right.

697
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,510
That’s why

698
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,830
I will tell her

699
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,510
when time comes. Don't worry.

700
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,910
I'll be responsible for you.

701
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,190
I thought about it.

702
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,150
If my parents know

703
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,470
we are together,

704
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,790
I will be interrogated.

705
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,110
If we don't end up well,

706
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,270
I'll lose a lot.

707
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,670
It's scary just thinking about it.

708
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,750
Great, Ling Chao.

709
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,710
I think you're the one with ulterior motives.

710
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,630
You started it first.

711
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,870
Alright.

712
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,469
Just kidding.

713
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,949
Hello, mom.

714
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,909
Help me check

715
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,630
the bottom of the globe.

716
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,230
Yes, the one on my desk.

717
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,150
Send it to me.

718
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,710
Five, eight.

719
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,790
Go back and rest early.

720
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,390
You too.

721
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,910
Ling Chao.

722
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,630
Didn't we agree to be ourselves?

723
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:30,590
Yes.

724
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:32,590
I just want to kiss you now.

725
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,590
My mom bought me a little turtle

726
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,630
for my birthday.

727
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,870
Mom said it'll bring good luck to catch a golden son-in-law.

728
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,350
It has a good meaning.

729
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,270
Ling Chao.

730
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,710
What is a golden son-in-law?

731
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,750
Shallow.
