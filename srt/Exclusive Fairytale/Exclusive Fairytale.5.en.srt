1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,070
Take care. See you next time.

3
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,910
Slow down.

4
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,590
Wait.

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:01,990
Fatty.

6
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,590
I want a Pancake with Pickled Vegetables and Shredded Pork.

7
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,190
Okay.

8
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,790
Haven't you eaten?

9
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,430
I think

10
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,790
I can have another pancake.

11
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,150
I don't think it's necessary.

12
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,350
No.

13
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,670
Your shoelace is untied.

14
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,390
Hurry up.

15
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,550
It's dangerous.

16
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,150
What should you do if your shoelace

17
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:18,830
gets caught in the bicycle?

18
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,910
It doesn't matter if you fall.

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,510
If you fall into the pot,

20
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,430
it's bad for the pancakes.

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,350
Why is the small road so congested?

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,190
I can tie it myself.

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,789
Don't move.

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,670
I used to tie your shoelaces when we were young.

25
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,110
Money.

26
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,670
Go.

27
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,190
Stop! Stop!

28
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,670
We can't park here.

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,910
This is a one-way road.

30
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,190
Do you know

31
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,310
that there is a process called "wine aeration"

32
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,710
when drinking red wine?

33
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,990
The same goes for QQ candy.

34
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,910
Look.

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,150
They don't have the same style.

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,670
Why were they together？

37
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,670
When they're stuck together,

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,470
the texture must be bad.

39
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,510
At this time,

40
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,150
we need to plug them

41
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,350
one by one.

42
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,230
The key point is

43
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,550
we need to give it a proper massage

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,550
so that it can ferment.

45
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,990
In the end...

46
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,430
Where did it go?

47
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,630
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,030
What a pity.

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,750
This is ridiculous.

50
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,829
Is this school a vacation place

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,270
or a hotbed for early love?

52
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,950
Ms. Xiao.

53
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,790
-Ms. Xiao.
-Some male and female students

54
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,430
don't eat normally.

55
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,590
They feed

56
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,590
each other.

57
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,830
Especially the head teachers of both Grade 1 and 2.

58
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,790
You should reflect on yourselves.

59
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,350
Some students in your classes

60
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,630
may not focus on their study.

61
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,030
Don't think that Grade 1 and Grade 2

62
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,030
are still early.

63
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,270
By the time it's Grade 3, even if they try to catch up quickly, it's useless.

64
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,630
Right.

65
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,550
Go back and inform the students

66
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,390
that male and female students are not allowed to get close.

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,710
The canteen is also a place that requires strict management.

68
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,350
Male and female students can't dine on the same table.

69
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,230
If they're not sure about their gender,

70
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,270
send them back and teach them until they're sure.

71
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,030
That's all for today.

72
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,870
Dismissed.

73
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,950
What's going on?

74
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,829
He treats the canteen like it's a restroom.

75
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,790
The rule doesn't apply to faculty, does it?

76
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,590
Can we eat together?

77
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,310
Are you crazy?

78
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,790
The priority of students

79
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,070
is to study.

80
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,430
Anything that may affect their study

81
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,310
must be extinguished from the root.

82
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,030
I think we shouldn't judge everything with one standard.

83
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,950
The teenage years are the time of rebellion.

84
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,150
The more we don't let them do it,

85
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,910
the more they have to do it.

86
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,150
And they'll do it in a very intense way.

87
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,710
Restriction is just a tool.

88
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,110
The correct guidance is our ultimate goal.

89
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,110
Enough.

90
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,630
This is the principal's verbal instruction.

91
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,950
Don't sigh.

92
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,270
Don't complain.

93
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,990
I remember

94
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,110
your behaviour just now.

95
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,230
The ones who complained the most

96
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,590
must be suspicious.

97
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,350
How could I not know

98
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,710
how you think?

99
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,470
A famous educator

100
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,990
said that

101
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,630
rules are just a means to restrict you.

102
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,870
The ultimate purpose

103
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,190
is to guide you

104
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,310
to do what a student should do.

105
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,390
Understand?

106
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,150
Understood.

107
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,430
Didn't you eat?

108
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,430
Louder.

109
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,470
Understood!

110
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,590
That's more like it.

111
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,710
Study yourself.

112
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,790
Don't you think Xue is weird today?

113
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,230
He doesn't seem like someone who could say those things.

114
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,510
Look.

115
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,790
My idol released a new song recently.

116
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,390
It's very good.

117
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,990
It's popular everywhere.

118
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,590
I know.

119
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,710
It's that song.

120
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,710
I often listen to it.

121
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,830
Really?

122
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,350
Honey, Ah Ha.

123
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,550
What the hell?

124
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,030
My mom listened to that song.

125
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,510
Why don't you eat?

126
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,470
Why do I feel

127
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,750
the atmosphere in the canteen is weird?

128
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,750
How?

129
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,070
There are people patrolling nearby while we're eating.

130
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,430
We're like prisoners.

131
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,230
I think

132
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,630
we are like owners of a high-class community.

133
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,510
With good security,

134
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,790
the rate of cutting in line approaches zero.

135
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,550
The probability of me buying the drumstick is greatly increased.

136
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,310
I've been narrow-minded.

137
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,510
Yin Zihan, you got the wrong way.

138
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,670
Boys are over there.

139
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,070
It's okay.

140
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,510
There are so many people in the canteen.

141
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,270
They can't tell at first glance.

142
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,070
Leave now.

143
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,430
Don't get us involved.

144
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,670
Oh no.

145
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,950
Oh no.

146
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,310
You.

147
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,430
Come out.

148
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,390
What happened to your deskmate?

149
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,830
He exposed himself.

150
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,070
I don't know.

151
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,270
He stared at me all morning.

152
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,510
He wouldn't stop it.

153
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,110
I think he must have been stimulated.

154
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,510
Look at our principal.

155
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,430
He should let him finish eating first.

156
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,750
Every grain comes from hard work.

157
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,950
Don't worry. I'm here.

158
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,110
No rice

159
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,910
can escape from the canteen.

160
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,670
What's wrong with you?

161
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,870
I just told you this morning.

162
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,230
And you're breaking the rule?

163
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,070
I went to ask Xiao Tu a question.

164
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,430
The top student asked the bottom student a question.

165
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,630
Well, Yin Zihan.

166
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,270
Are you insulting my IQ?

167
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,190
I really can't judge a book by its cover.

168
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,590
I just changed your seats for a few days.

169
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,630
I asked you to take Xiao Tu to study,

170
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,190
not to fall in love with her.

171
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,590
Mr. Xue.

172
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,110
I didn't fall in love with her.

173
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,190
Listen.

174
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,990
Ling Chao and Xiao Tu are in love.

175
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,590
I'm collecting evidence.

176
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,750
Can't you find a better excuse?

177
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,430
Ling Chao and Xiao Tu.

178
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,190
Are they from the same world?

179
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,110
See? Even you think so.

180
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,190
Alright, stop it.

181
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,470
As long as it doesn't affect your study,

182
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,150
whether Xiao Tu's grades will be affect...

183
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,350
Go get Xiao Tu.

184
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,310
I'll talk to her.

185
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,750
Is it necessary?

186
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,430
You don't want to go?

187
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,550
Have some tea.

188
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:19,830
Hurry up. Close the door.

189
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,670
Come in.

190
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,990
You're here.

191
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,030
I asked you here

192
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,789
because...

193
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,669
Girls are more sensitive.

194
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,430
Isn't it inappropriate to ask too directly?

195
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,630
The final exam is coming.

196
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,470
If I ask her this,

197
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,990
will it affect her mood?

198
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,190
Actually, it's normal for deskmates

199
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,270
to have affection for each other.

200
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,070
There's no need to make a fuss.

201
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,830
It's too hard to be the head teacher.

202
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:02,950
It's okay.

203
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,150
Study hard.

204
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,430
Go. Go back.

205
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,510
Amazing!

206
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,790
Let's go.

207
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,710
Morning.

208
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,590
What's your relationship with Ling Chao?

209
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,950
Why do you ask?

210
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,190
I want you to tell me in person.

211
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,830
This opening speech

212
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,990
seems familiar.

213
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,510
I don't want to hear it from others.

214
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,750
I want you to tell me in person.

215
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,590
Trust me.

216
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,550
There's nothing between us.

217
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,550
I don't believe it.

218
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,830
Trust me.

219
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,470
There's nothing between us.

220
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,430
I don't believe it.

221
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,510
You live in the same neighborhood.

222
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,750
I saw it.

223
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,030
You mean this?

224
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,870
We've known each other since childhood.

225
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,230
My mom is his godmother.

226
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,670
His mother is my godmother.

227
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,950
We are like siblings with different parents.

228
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,030
You grew up together?

229
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,150
Do you know Ling Chao well?

230
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,950
Of course.

231
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,750
Why do you ask?

232
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,430
Nothing.

233
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,550
Did you finish your homework yesterday?

234
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,670
Of course.

235
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,830
How long does it usually take

236
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,190
you to do homework?

237
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,830
About three hours.

238
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,390
Math is too difficult.

239
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,870
One test paper takes two hours.

240
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,110
That long?

241
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,630
Isn't Ling Chao going to help you?

242
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,430
If he helps you,

243
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,870
how long does he spend to do exercises?

244
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,670
I'm just asking.

245
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,750
I care about you as your deskmate.

246
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,630
If you have any questions,

247
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,950
feel free to ask me.

248
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,990
Wake her up.

249
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,830
Got it.

250
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,750
Do you think

251
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,950
Yin Zihan has been acting weird lately?

252
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,950
What's wrong?

253
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,150
Look.

254
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,830
He insisted to sit with you last time.

255
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,190
But he was caught by the principal.

256
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,950
Not to mention that.

257
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,110
I've been observing you for a long time.

258
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,590
Since then,

259
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,390
he has been caring about you.

260
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,550
Are you cold?

261
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,750
Are you hungry?

262
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,150
Did you solve the question correctly?

263
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,870
Did you write it right?

264
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,790
I bet

265
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,710
if you have no tissue when you defecate,

266
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,870
he will definitely send you tissues.

267
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,470
Do you believe that?

268
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,470
Stop.

269
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,390
I'm eating.

270
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,830
Besides, you should be the one

271
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,030
to come to the ladies' toilet.

272
00:12:59,230 --> 00:12:59,990
Don't interrupt.

273
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,950
When you first became deskmates,

274
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,430
he ignored you.

275
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,910
He focused on the exercises.

276
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,950
Suddenly, he became like this.

277
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,870
He taught you how to solve questions every day.

278
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,510
He forced you to do it.

279
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,750
I think so.

280
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,750
My math grades

281
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,110
has indeed improved a lot.

282
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,030
Yin Zihan

283
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,670
is totally in love with you.

284
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,790
Well.

285
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,030
Think about it.

286
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,590
In order to dine with you,

287
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,630
he disobeyed the school rule in public.

288
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,430
Isn't this what's written in romance novels,

289
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,910
'To be against the whole world for the sake of you'?

290
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,870
In the past,

291
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,030
he was also a favored man who is arrogant.

292
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,470
In order to teach you,

293
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,350
he lowered his noble head.

294
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,270
Impossible.

295
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,110
As the story goes on,

296
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,950
I can only say it will be

297
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:00,990
"Woman.

298
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,190
You got my attention."

299
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,190
So you are here.

300
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,790
No wonder I couldn't find you.

301
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,310
What do you mean?

302
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,950
Why did you change your route?

303
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:39,950
Idiot.

304
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,710
Can't you see someone following us?

305
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,270
Why should we be followed?

306
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,230
It's him.

307
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,430
Is he sending me home?

308
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:56,790
Don't worry.

309
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,550
I've checked.

310
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,430
He's my deskmate.

311
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,310
Actually,

312
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,510
it's not necessarily bad people who follow us.

313
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,470
It could be someone who cares about me.

314
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,790
Care about you?

315
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,950
That's a turning light.

316
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,430
Do you think there's any other meaning?

317
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,870
Let me ask you.

318
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,110
If a boy was spending every second in studying,

319
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,550
but suddenly he's willing to spend time

320
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,830
to teach a girl to solve questions.

321
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,470
Doesn't that mean he cares about the girl?

322
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,990
That only means he's tired of studying,

323
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:24,310
so he wants to go to you beginners to show his presence.

324
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,430
What if

325
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,750
when a girl passed by the basketball court,

326
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,830
in order not to hurt her,

327
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,910
the boy gave up shooting a a three-pointer,

328
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,430
doesn't that mean he cares about her?

329
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,670
From what you said,

330
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,030
this guy is unprofessional

331
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,110
when playing basketball.

332
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,590
Besides,

333
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,470
you'd better not cross the basketball court.

334
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,590
You will disturb the players.

335
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,630
What if

336
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,510
a boy who only cares about himself

337
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,350
suddenly

338
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,310
worries if the girl

339
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,110
would feel cold when sleeping during class,

340
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,790
and if her friend has time to guide her

341
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,510
after class.

342
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,030
Doesn't that mean he cares about her?

343
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,550
You slept during class again?

344
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,910
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell your mom...

345
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,830
Ling Chao,

346
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,950
do you not want to see someone caring about me?

347
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,110
Fine.

348
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,350
If what you said

349
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,870
happened to someone else,

350
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,910
it's possible.

351
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,790
But if this girl is you,

352
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,750
I think he might have other intentions.

353
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,270
It's the first day of winter vacation.

354
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,630
The happiest time in the world.

355
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,630
Don't force me to hit you.

356
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,670
Hey!

357
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,310
That's my bike.

358
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,110
Chao, eat more.

359
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,910
What are you doing?

360
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,070
Having dinner.

361
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,910
It looks good.

362
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,310
Do you want to come out tomorrow?

363
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,510
Sure.

364
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,310
Where are we going and doing?

365
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,710
Don't use your phone when eating.

366
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,150
Go to Time Square

367
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,270
and do homework together.

368
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,869
Who it it?

369
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,030
Why has to talk to you during dinner?

370
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,589
My deskmate.

371
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,190
He asked me to do homework tomorrow.

372
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,670
That's a good thing.

373
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,030
You should study

374
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:25,310
with your classmates.

375
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,869
You'll have the learning atmosphere.

376
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:27,630
It's good.

377
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,390
It's good.

378
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,590
She always stayed up all night

379
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,430
in the last three days of the holiday to do her homework.

380
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,630
Once,

381
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,070
she couldn't finish it.

382
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,790
She even changed the name

383
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,350
on Chao's homework

384
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,830
into her own name.

385
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,070
Really?

386
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,310
What should Ling Chao do?

387
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,630
I told the teacher

388
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,230
my homework was eaten by the rabbit at home.

389
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,350
Let bygones be bygones.

390
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,390
It's serious this time.

391
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,390
My deskmate, Yin Zihan.

392
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,670
the top student of the grade.

393
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,350
A straight A student.

394
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,030
You can ask Ling Chao.

395
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,110
I'm a sophomore,

396
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,670
how would I know about your first year?

397
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,750
I trust you.

398
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,510
Let bygones be bygones.

399
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,110
Forget it.

400
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:16,550
Communicate with top students more.

401
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:17,630
Eat.

402
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,190
Let's eat.

403
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,030
What did you say?

404
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,150
I haven't replied yet.

405
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,390
Why are you so reserved?

406
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,310
Say yes.

407
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,470
Well, I will do homework at the beginning of the holiday?

408
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,590
I want to rest for a few days.

409
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,430
You're hopeless.

410
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,710
Is asking you to do homework

411
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,430
just to study?

412
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,110
That's just an excuse

413
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,590
to ask you out.

414
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,270
Look at that male lead.

415
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,110
He just wants to confess to the female lead.

416
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,550
He's shy

417
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,990
and not straightforward at all.

418
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,910
Xiao Tu's mom and I

419
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,110
were straightforward.

420
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,430
I confessed directly.

421
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,430
Bang. Take her down.

422
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,830
He doesn't know if the female lead likes himself.

423
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,870
So he needs to test her.

424
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,750
But Godfather,

425
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,990
It's been so many episodes.

426
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,030
Didn't you notice

427
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,270
he's the second male lead?

428
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,630
Really?

429
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,630
That makes sense.

430
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,350
Yin Zihan must be testing me.

431
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,150
After all, we're deskmates.

432
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,230
It's the most natural way to do homework together.

433
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,310
It's really hard work.

434
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,630
But what if he confesses to me?

435
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,510
I'm so worried.

436
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,110
Have you made up your mind?

437
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,430
There's a new dessert shop in Time Square.

438
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,070
The environment is nice and quiet.

439
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,350
It's suitable for doing homework there.

440
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,390
And their tiramisu is very delicious.

441
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,470
Okay, see you tomorrow.

442
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,110
Daddy.

443
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,430
I have an appointment with my classmate

444
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,590
to have desserts at Time Square tomorrow.

445
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,990
Okay.

446
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,790
This is all I have.

447
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,430
Don't eat too much.

448
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,710
Watch your teeth.

449
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,550
Be careful not to have cavities.

450
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:22,870
I...

451
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,590
Got it, Daddy.

452
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,550
Watch your teeth.

453
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:31,790
Chao.

454
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:34,670
If you come later,

455
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,790
the store will be closed.

456
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,830
Bro.

457
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,030
Why didn't you say it was you

458
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,430
who called me suddenly last night?

459
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,350
You even forced me to come to the arcade with you.

460
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,030
Hi, Ling Chao.

461
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,670
Lan.

462
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,870
Why are you here?

463
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,110
I'm not used to

464
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,390
not seeing you for so long.

465
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,110
So I came uninvited.

466
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,470
Will I disturb you?

467
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,510
No, no.

468
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,310
Buy some coins.

469
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,910
Let's go.

470
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,230
Let's go.

471
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,950
Do you think the rabbit is so cute

472
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,550
so you don't...

473
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,270
Delicious.

474
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,230
Then eat more.

475
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,190
I feel bored once the holiday begins.

476
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,590
What about you?

477
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,870
What have you been doing these days?

478
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,350
How can I be bored during holidays?

479
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,350
There are so many interesting things to do.

480
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,030
Right.

481
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,110
You live close to Ling Chao's house.

482
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,910
You can even visit each other.

483
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:34,910
Right?

484
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,270
Yin Zihan.

485
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,470
I want to ask you a question.

486
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,230
Do you like me?

487
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,070
Well.

488
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,430
Why do you think so?

489
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,870
I admit

490
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,470
your tricks

491
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,830
have indeed attracted my attention.

492
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,670
But we are too young.

493
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,030
It's not appropriate to think about it now.

494
00:21:59,310 --> 00:21:59,910
No.

495
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,150
I don't like you.

496
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,110
If you don't like me,

497
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,550
why did you ask me out for dessert?

498
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,150
I asked you out to do homework

499
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,710
and have desserts.

500
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,630
If you ask him directly,

501
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,470
he won't admit it.

502
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,910
Then why did you ask me to do homework together?

503
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,630
When we just became deskmates,

504
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,270
you would nag for half a day

505
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,550
if you did one exercise less.

506
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,630
Not to mention teaching me.

507
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,070
Well,

508
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,110
we are deskmates.

509
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,390
We should help each other.

510
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,790
When he starts to find excuses to refute you,

511
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,430
he will start showing flaws.

512
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,470
At this moment,

513
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,590
you have to expose each and every one of his lies.

514
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,310
With my grades,

515
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,670
I can't help you much.

516
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,670
You gave me spicy strips to eat.

517
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,230
What about Zhang Danian?

518
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,430
We are almost the same.

519
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:57,870
He sits too far.

520
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,590
It's not convenient.

521
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,830
But don't push too hard.

522
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,470
You should stop at the right time.

523
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,910
After all, he's a boy.

524
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,070
He has strong self-esteem

525
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,670
and he's easy to be shy.

526
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,910
Just now,

527
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,310
you mentioned Ling Chao and I live close.

528
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,030
You're not jealous?

529
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,630
Of course not.

530
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,550
I was just saying.

531
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,910
Stop guessing.

532
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,630
We are pure friends.

533
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,150
Trust me.

534
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,750
If he is in a hurry to end the topic,

535
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,030
there must be something wrong with him.

536
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,070
Okay.

537
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,110
I believe you.

538
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:44,630
Yin Zihan.

539
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,190
You have cream stuck at the corner of your mouth.

540
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,870
That man looks like Mr. Xue.

541
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,430
The girl next to him

542
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,230
seems to be Ms. Xiao.

543
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,310
Be confident.

544
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,510
It is Ms. Xiao.

545
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,750
It's the first time I've seen Ms. Xiao wearing that kind of clothes.

546
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,350
Are they dating?

547
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,430
Let's go.

548
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,390
Hide. Hide.

549
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,030
Ten, fifteen, twenty.

550
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,790
Twenty-three.

551
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,230
Luckily, it's enough.

552
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:58,910
What are you doing?

553
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,390
Let's split the bill.

554
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,910
I asked you out, of course it's my treat.

555
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,190
I asked you to pay

556
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,030
because I didn't bring that much money.

557
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,230
But I can afford

558
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,310
my own part.

559
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,230
No way.

560
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,190
How can I let a girl pay?

561
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,590
What does this have to do with gender?

562
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,950
I know your family is rich.

563
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,390
But we are still students now.

564
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,350
We spend our parents' money out here.

565
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,150
When you can make money yourself,

566
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,230
I promise I won't save money for you.

567
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,390
Take it.

568
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,830
I'll take it.

569
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,550
I'm full. Let's take a walk.

570
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,310
Let's go.

571
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,790
Let's go.

572
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:55,830
When are we going to continue watching?

573
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,510
The exciting part is going on.

574
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,110
Let's go.

575
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,030
Let's go.

576
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,710
Let's go.

577
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,310
What a coincidence. Junior.

578
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,230
Are you two here for a date?

579
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,110
We just did homework together.

580
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,310
How much did you do?

581
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,390
Don't tell me you didn't do any homework

582
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,750
and just ate.

583
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,510
Why are you here?

584
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,470
Don't you need to study on weekends?

585
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,190
What can I do here?

586
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:36,910
Of course to play video games.

587
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,750
If not, to have dessert?

588
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,270
Ignore him.

589
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,750
He doesn't usually do homework

590
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,870
when it's not holiday.

591
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,550
Let's go in this one.

592
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,790
Let's go.

593
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,590
Chao.

594
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,950
How about this?

595
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,190
Not bad.

596
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,790
How about this?

597
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,670
What do you think?

598
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,030
Xiao Tu.

599
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,110
This dress looks good on you.

600
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:22,070
I...

601
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,950
It may not match

602
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,990
what your wear today,

603
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,910
but

604
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,910
it's good to try

605
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,790
other styles sometimes.

606
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,910
Let's go and have a try.

607
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,910
Let's go.

608
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,750
Junior.

609
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,950
Look.

610
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,670
You and Senior Lan are both surnamed Yin.

611
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,990
And you two look a bit alike.

612
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,790
Are you relatives?

613
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,830
Brother-in-law,

614
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,870
what kind of guy does your sister like?

615
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,830
Tell me.

616
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,990
Tell me.

617
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,910
Senior,

618
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,150
did anyone say

619
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,110
you have a rich imagination?

620
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,390
He did.

621
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,830
People with the same surname are not necessarily relatives.

622
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,750
I have nothing

623
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,150
to do with this senior.

624
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,830
But I just saw a drugstore

625
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,790
outside.

626
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,750
Do you need some eye drops?

627
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:19,750
How rude.

628
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,750
What do you think?

629
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,270
How does this one look on Xiao Tu?

630
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,270
Isn't it pretty?

631
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,750
What month is it?

632
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,310
Why are you still wearing this dress?

633
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,230
Aren't you afraid of the wind?

634
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,910
This looks good on you.

635
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,230
Kindergarten style.

636
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,910
Wear this.

637
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,110
That one is too silly.

638
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,750
This is warm and beautiful.

639
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,310
Your size.

640
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,310
Try it.

641
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,150
Sales, give me a small-sized one.

642
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,390
Lan, pick this for me.

643
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:11,950
Which one of these two hats looks better?

644
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,790
It suits me.

645
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,110
This blue one.

646
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,150
Blue one, right?

647
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,590
It suits you well.

648
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,070
Just take this one.

649
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,310
Bill, please.

650
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,270
You have a Gold membership.

651
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,230
You can get 12% off.

652
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,230
The original price is 500 yuan.

653
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,870
It's 440 yuan after the discount.

654
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,710
Okay.

655
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,070
My dad's Black Gold Supreme membership card can get 25% off.

656
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,070
Pay with my card.

657
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,110
Okay, Sir.

658
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,110
Yin Zihan, what are you doing?

659
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,270
I'm saving money for you.

660
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,190
Don't bother.

661
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:49,510
I'll pay her clothes

662
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,910
with my card.

663
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,750
Get changed.

664
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,070
Please hurry up.

665
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,550
We need to go home for dinner.

666
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,550
Okay.

667
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,910
What's their relationship?

668
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,350
They

669
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,630
grew up

670
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,590
together.

671
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,310
Thank you.

672
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,310
Let's go.

673
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,230
We're leaving. See you next semester.

674
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,790
Bye.

675
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,750
12% off and 25% off

676
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,470
are very different.

677
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,550
The gap is...

678
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,350
65.

679
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,830
Yes, 65.

680
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,470
65.

681
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,390
Your deskmate sent you home after school.

682
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,230
He even wants to buy you clothes during holidays.

683
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,110
You have to pay back someday.

684
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,350
If you owe him today,

685
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,270
how will you pay him back?

686
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,870
Is it that exaggerated?

687
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,950
What are you doing?

688
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:51,790
Give me the money.

689
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:52,990
What money?

690
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,030
You buy clothes for free?

691
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,470
I don't have much money now.

692
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,430
Give me as much as you can.

693
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,270
Do you think I'm a beggar?

694
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,630
Where is the money Godfather gave you yesterday?

695
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,910
It's spent on food.

696
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,790
Forget it.

697
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,550
Take it as your New Year gift.

698
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,550
Really?

699
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,790
Yes.

700
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,830
Dad, Mom.

701
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:49,990
What’s wrong?

702
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,110
Rabbit, you're back.

703
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:51,830
Come here.

704
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,350
Here.

705
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,510
These are clothes.

706
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:55,950
Come, sit down.

707
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,830
Xiao Tu.

708
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,030
Sit down.

709
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,110
We have something serious to tell you.

710
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:02,750
Look.

711
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,910
These are all from Ling.

712
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,190
Your godfather is back.

713
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,390
Do you know?

714
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,470
I know a little.

715
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,510
Ling Chao didn't tell me.

716
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,510
I didn't ask much.

717
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,830
Here's the thing, Rabbit.

718
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,470
Before, you were young.

719
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,710
You wouldn't understand.

720
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,110
Now that you've grown up,

721
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,470
We should tell you

722
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,710
these things.

723
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,310
Your godfather

724
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,670
is stubborn.

725
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,870
Back then,

726
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,430
your godmother didn't agree

727
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,390
that he quit his job and started a business.

728
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,910
Your godfather

729
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,070
swore

730
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,510
to return to in glory.

731
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:39,990
In the first few years,

732
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,350
he was too ashamed to come back when he didn't do well.

733
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,150
His company has been

734
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,190
on track these years.

735
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:48,390
He can finally give them an explanation.

736
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,710
But...

737
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,430
Look at Chao's

738
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,030
attitude towards his father.

739
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,870
Your godfather

740
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,550
is very regretful now.

741
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,070
He did succeed in his career,

742
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,750
but his child refused to acknowledge him.

743
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,510
Do you

744
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,270
want me to persuade Ling Chao

745
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,550
to forgive my godfather?

746
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,870
After all, he's his biological father.

747
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,710
Yes.

748
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,110
It must be hard for Godfather

749
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,550
to work hard these years.

750
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,590
But Ling Chao waited at the stairs for a month.

751
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,950
In the end, he could only be regarded as a child without a father.

752
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,310
He was sad too.

753
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,630
We've never experienced it.

754
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,510
How can we forgive on behalf of him?

755
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,670
Both of them

756
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,310
have their own standpoint

757
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,910
and grievances.

758
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,910
How about this?

759
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,830
Rabbit.

760
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,630
You bring these things

761
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,310
to Chao's house first.

762
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,270
It's not appropriate

763
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,310
to put them here.

764
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,110
Right?

765
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,710
I went to your house to deliver New Year's goods.

766
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,510
But you weren't there.

767
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,030
I knew you'd be here.

768
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,949
My godfather bought it.

769
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:40,670
Try it.

770
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,429
Traitor!

771
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,230
Chocolate is innocent.

772
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,710
Don't go against chocolate.

773
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,310
I want to sit alone for a while.

774
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,630
Go back first.

775
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,350
By the way,

776
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,590
take away those goods

777
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,270
from my house.

778
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,390
I'll do a bit more.

779
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,870
I'll take away the family photo by your bed

780
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,070
and the old computer

781
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,230
as well. Okay?

782
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,150
I'm leaving.

783
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:12,270
I...

784
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,830
I'm really leaving.

785
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,910
You were fine during the day.

786
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,670
Why do you look like you've seen a ghost

787
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,390
when you saw your dad?

788
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,710
What's the difference between seeing someone who suddenly comes back

789
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,310
after ten years and seeing a ghost?

790
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,630
Are you afraid of ghosts?

791
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,270
Why did you come out if you weren't afraid of ghosts?

792
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,910
You came out in the winter

793
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,150
to show you're resistant?

794
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,670
So cold.

795
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,030
I know

796
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,950
you don't really hate your dad.

797
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,430
You just need some time to digest.

798
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,030
Right?

799
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,030
I'm afraid I have indigestion.

800
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,950
I have experience of curing indigestion.

801
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,470
This should be the only disease

802
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,590
that can be cured by time.

803
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,110
I really admire you.

804
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,710
Being optimistic is also a gift.

805
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,270
I admire you for eating so much.

806
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,670
So what?

807
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,870
I ate your rice?

808
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,550
You have eaten a lot.

809
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,190
It's really cold here.

810
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,070
When are you going back?

811
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,270
You go back first.

812
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,750
I want to stay a little longer.

813
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,310
Let's go together.

814
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,030
It's cold.

815
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,350
What if you catch a cold?

816
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,030
Let's go.

817
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,590
Let's go.

818
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,670
Let's go.

819
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,510
Let's go.

820
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:26,790
Hey.

821
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,230
Let's go.

822
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,390
Let's go.

823
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,590
Let's go home.

824
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,230
I can walk by myself.

825
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:32,950
It's so heavy.

826
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,510
Let's go.

827
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,230
Stay away from me.

828
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:37,670
Let go.

829
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,950
Try the chocolate.

830
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,910
Have some chocolate.

831
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,870
Have some chocolate.

832
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,590
Let's go.

833
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:59,830
Just because you looked at me one more time in the crowd,

834
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,990
you can never forget my face.
