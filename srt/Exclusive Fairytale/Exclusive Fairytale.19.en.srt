1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:54,990
Tell me.

3
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,110
When did you two get together?

4
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,349
-Not long. - It's been a while.

5
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,230
Tell me.

6
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,710
Just a few months.

7
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,590
Just...

8
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,150
Dad.

9
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,510
Didn't you say I could find someone from our hometown?

10
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,190
Well…

11
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,789
Is this a matter of someone from the same hometown?

12
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,350
Even if you want to find someone…

13
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,270
You can find a stupid one.

14
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,110
Dad, what are you talking about?

15
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,990
Godfather.

16
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,670
You and Godmother

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,910
have watched me grow up.

18
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,950
You should know me better.

19
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:52,110
My relationship with Xiao Tu is not overnight.

20
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,550
It's accumulated from childhood.

21
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,190
I will cherish it.

22
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,070
What…

23
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,270
Now I see.

24
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,270
I shouldn't have come to Yidong.

25
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,070
If I hadn't come to Yidong,

26
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,310
I wouldn't have come to this food factory.

27
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,190
If I hadn't come to the food factory,

28
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,270
I wouldn't have lived in this neighborhood.

29
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,190
If I didn't live in this neighborhood,

30
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,870
I wouldn't be Ling's neighbor.

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,150
If I wasn't Ling's neighbor,

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,630
I wouldn't let you two know each other.

33
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,990
I'm suffering now.

34
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,750
Dad.

35
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,670
You have a guest today?

36
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,750
Your dad invited an investor over for dinner.

37
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,550
It concerns a big project next year.

38
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:09,950
It's very important.

39
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,790
Is that  important?

40
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,790
Why don't you go to a restaurant for dinner?

41
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,190
Well, here is the thing.

42
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,829
Mr. Jiang, the investor,

43
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,790
usually lives abroad.

44
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,230
He wanted to eat some home-cooked dishes,

45
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,750
so I invited him here.

46
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,110
If you feel uncomfortable,

47
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,350
stay in your room.

48
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,630
It won't take long.

49
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,870
No.

50
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,910
I mean it's more serious to eat in a restaurant.

51
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,590
Take your time.

52
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,150
I'm going back to my room.

53
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,710
Come on, dad.

54
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,030
Coming.

55
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,790
Master.

56
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,550
Is that speaker really

57
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,430
that amazing?

58
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,710
I don't know.

59
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,790
Let's talk about it later.

60
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,510
Okay.

61
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,190
Senior is asleep again?

62
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,350
Big brother.

63
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,390
Big brother.

64
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,270
Master was captured by monsters.

65
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,750
Big brother.

66
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,110
Master and Bajie were captured by monsters.

67
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,670
Wukong.

68
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,150
Junior is here.

69
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,070
Junior?

70
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,110
Which junior?

71
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,870
You used to not even wake up with eight alarms.

72
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,149
What lecture is it

73
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,630
that makes you so active?

74
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,750
It seems to be a R&D introduction meeting.

75
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,870
It doesn't matter anyway.

76
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,830
What matters is

77
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,310
the speaker is very handsome this time.

78
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,470
There's already a picture of him in Tieba.

79
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,670
I'm Jiang Juanjuan.

80
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,150
How can I miss the opportunity to look at a handsome guy?

81
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,470
I knew it wasn't a proper reason.

82
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,070
I'm gonna go.

83
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,670
Since you're here,

84
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,390
you should at least take a look.

85
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,590
Aren't you afraid that I'll tell Jia Siwen about this?

86
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,550
I already told him.

87
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,990
Anyway, I'll just take a look.

88
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,310
Here's one for you.

89
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,190
I hope these devices

90
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,430
won't waste my looks today.

91
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,870
Madam.

92
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,390
Madam!

93
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,870
Master.

94
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,830
Madam came to the Computer Department's lecture

95
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,550
for you.

96
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,430
I'm so touched.

97
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,990
She didn't come for me.

98
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,510
No, Jiang Juanjuan asked me to come with her.

99
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,670
Why is she here?

100
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,710
What is she doing here?

101
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,350
Good morning, everyone.

102
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,950
I'm today's speaker.

103
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,950
I'm Ye Jun.

104
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,909
I'm here today

105
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,230
to share with you

106
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,990
the core technology of our company.

107
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,430
-Ye Jun. -First of all.

108
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,430
We need to learn what the computer network is.

109
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,030
Who is it?

110
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,950
You know him?

111
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,870
Ye Jun is my cousin.

112
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,550
Since you like him so much,

113
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,550
I can get his autograph

114
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,150
for you.

115
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,070
Really?

116
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,710
Sure.

117
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,310
I told you before.

118
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,350
He's the one I admired so much when I was a kid.

119
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,830
Him?

120
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,750
How long have you been with Ling Chao?

121
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:12,110
Can I return him now?

122
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,470
Master.

123
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,390
Madam seems to be

124
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,750
quite familiar with the speaker.

125
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,910
Are you still touched?

126
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,910
No. I'm speechless.

127
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,230
Bro, you may not know

128
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,470
we used to sit here

129
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,350
when our two dorms went on blind dates.

130
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,150
I was so sharp-sighted.

131
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,310
I immediately told

132
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,230
that Master

133
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,350
had feelings for Xiao Tu.

134
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,830
So I'm not surprised

135
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,110
you two are together.

136
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,270
Really?

137
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,950
And he came to me for you.

138
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,790
Hello?

139
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,830
Tell me.

140
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,910
Tell me.

141
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,950
That day, Ling Chao…

142
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,510
Come and eat.

143
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,350
Okay.

144
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,190
Xiao Tu is not in a good state recently.

145
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,390
It's mainly about her grades.

146
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,950
Can you encourage her?

147
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,390
After all,

148
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,750
she's obsessed with you for no reason.

149
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,110
Okay, I'll call her later.

150
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,550
Thanks.

151
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,990
Wait.

152
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,830
Why don't you text her?

153
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,230
Then she can print it out

154
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,550
and put it on her forehead so that she can read it every day.

155
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,230
As you wish.

156
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,870
Really?

157
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,790
Xiao Tu.

158
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,710
I might need to borrow Ling Chao from you.

159
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,550
You're welcome. Take it.

160
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,670
Go back and rest.

161
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,750
Take care.

162
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,550
Brother, don't worry.

163
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,550
I'll send these girls back safely.

164
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,630
We're gonna go, Ye Jun.

165
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,030
Take care, cousin. Be careful when you're driving.

166
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,750
Don't worry.

167
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,950
Mr. Ye, see you.

168
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,350
Mr. Ye Jun, see you.

169
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,870
Bye, Ye Jun. Bye.

170
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,830
Let's go. Bye.

171
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,230
Let's go. I want to talk to you alone.

172
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,670
I'll get straight to the point.

173
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,470
I hope you can come to our company after graduation.

174
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,550
I won't beat around the bush.

175
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,430
What's good for me?

176
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,990
I can't guarantee too much,

177
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,710
but I promise

178
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,990
after you come,

179
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,590
you can do whatever you want.

180
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,670
That's too rough.

181
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,310
I've seen the program you designed.

182
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,950
It's pretty much what Handuo wants.

183
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,150
So I have to fight for you no matter what.

184
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,830
Since it's a fight,

185
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,590
there must be some conditions.

186
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,510
Of course.

187
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,470
Tell me.

188
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,230
Two conditions.

189
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,790
First,

190
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,790
I want to form my own team.

191
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,550
I don't need many members,

192
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,310
but I want to work with my roommates.

193
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,110
You just met them.

194
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,310
I’ll skip the introduction.

195
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,270
You're top students from the Computer Department of Yunhai University.

196
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,230
You're professional.

197
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,510
You also get along with each other.

198
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,150
It's worth considering it

199
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,790
since it can help the company save the cost on team building.

200
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,750
Second,

201
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,870
stay away from Xiao Tu.

202
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,350
Don't get too close to her.

203
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,150
This condition is too harsh.

204
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,870
I need to think about it.

205
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,550
I was just kidding.

206
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,830
Why are you so serious?

207
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,430
But Handuo is still at the starting stage.

208
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,590
I need to discuss it with my partner.

209
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,390
You don't even have the right to decide this?

210
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,310
I thought you were in charge.

211
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,830
I don't care about others,

212
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,270
but you're such an excellent talent.

213
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,790
Of course I have to discuss with the management.

214
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,030
That way, we're showing our respect to you.

215
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,470
You're really something.

216
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,230
You're good at talking.

217
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,150
You handled it well too.

218
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,270
That's what I'm talking about.

219
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,550
I have a feeling.

220
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,390
If we work together,

221
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,870
it must be a pleasant journey.

222
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,510
That depends on your performance.

223
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,150
Roger.

224
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,590
You look so beautiful today.

225
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,910
How beautiful?

226
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,790
So beautiful.

227
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,030
I like you so much.

228
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,390
How much do you like me?

229
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,390
So much.

230
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,270
Did you miss me

231
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,630
when I wasn't by your side these days?

232
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,870
Yes.

233
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,310
How much did you miss me?

234
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,950
I missed you so much.

235
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,830
Get up and do your homework.

236
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,750
Hurry up.

237
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,830
I'm so angry.

238
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,030
I haven't changed my clothes.

239
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,950
What clothes. You look good.

240
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,710
Wait.

241
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,030
Jiang Juanjuan.

242
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,910
Stop fangirling.

243
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,550
Oh no.

244
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,710
Juanjuan.

245
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,990
Don't follow me.

246
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,430
Don't follow me.

247
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,630
Jia Siwen, you're here to see Juanjuan.

248
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,990
Juanjuan.

249
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,430
Quick question.

250
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,190
When's Junhui birthday?

251
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,230
June 10th.

252
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,950
What was the latest event

253
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,430
of Wenjun?

254
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,550
He acted in a new drama.

255
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,350
Then what's his debut song?

256
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,030
I like you very much.

257
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,990
I like you too.

258
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,910
That's about it.

259
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,630
Okay, thank you for your cooperation.

260
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,030
How is it? Have you got enough materials?

261
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,190
I want to take some empty shots.

262
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,750
It'll come in handy when I'm editing.

263
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,390
I'll buy you some drinks.

264
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,150
I'll go with you.

265
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,990
Let's go.

266
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,510
Let's go.

267
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,430
Let's go.

268
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,350
You hit me!

269
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,110
Young man.

270
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,910
Why did you ride so fast?

271
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,870
Look at you.

272
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,470
You hit her so badly.

273
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,070
Rabbit.

274
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,990
Have some water.

275
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,270
Thank you.

276
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,950
What happened over there?

277
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,750
You have to ride slower.

278
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,990
Someone was hit.

279
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,270
It seems to be a car accident.

280
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,230
I was checking the recordings. I didn't pay attention to it.

281
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,310
You were running around on the street.

282
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,670
Can't you ride slower?

283
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,670
You look fine after hitting someone.

284
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,350
-That's right. -I didn't hit her.

285
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,590
She fell down herself.

286
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,390
The motorcycle guy

287
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,310
seems to be a handsome guy.

288
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,830
Your guy is here.

289
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,110
Stop looking around.

290
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,790
As someone who's going to work in the media industry,

291
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,590
I should have sharp eyes

292
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,630
that can discover news at any time.

293
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:57,830
Sharp eyes?

294
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,550
With your eyesight,

295
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,190
what can you see from so far away?

296
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,470
You're right.

297
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,350
Let's go and have a look.

298
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,790
Why aren't you feel ashamed?

299
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:09,910
You didn't hit her.

300
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,430
That old lady bumped into you herself.

301
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,950
What era is it?

302
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,070
Don't try to avoid responsibility with the scam.

303
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,750
Young man.

304
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,710
She's old.

305
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,550
She doesn't need to joke about her life.

306
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,670
Am I right?

307
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,550
Right.

308
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,950
What does this have to do with you?

309
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:24,750
What do you mean?

310
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,870
You're running around on your motorcycle.

311
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,870
You'll probably hit others

312
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,670
next time.

313
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,950
Right?

314
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,150
I didn't hit her.

315
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,270
I told you many times. I didn't hit her.

316
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,710
I've seen a lot of gangsters

317
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,230
like you.

318
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,150
You want to run away when something happens.

319
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,790
Are you trying to escape responsibility?

320
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,350
Right.

321
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,830
I...

322
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,510
Look at you.

323
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,070
I didn't hit her.

324
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,230
-She hit me! -Are you alright?

325
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,190
I'm fine.

326
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,630
Luckily, Jia Siwen protected me.

327
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,310
Is the camera okay?

328
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,790
Let me see.

329
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,630
Are you okay?

330
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,710
You hit me after you bumped into someone?

331
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,190
The man riding a motorcycle

332
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,390
looks like a decent person.

333
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,670
I didn't expect him to be so irresponsible.

334
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,870
I must expose him.

335
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,590
Don't get involved.

336
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,070
Jia Siwen finally came to Yunhai.

337
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,350
Spend more time with him.

338
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,590
It's okay. Let me send the equipment back first.

339
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,710
You don't have to help me with such a trivial matter.

340
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,470
Go and have fun.

341
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,270
I won't stay here.

342
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,230
Go. I didn't hit anyone.

343
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,230
How come?

344
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,150
We all saw it, right?

345
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,910
What took you so long?

346
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,510
I was waiting for you.

347
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,150
This little guy's crying almost made me deaf.

348
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,070
Don't mention it.

349
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,190
Something happened.

350
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,870
What's wrong?

351
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,390
We'll help you. It's okay.

352
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,510
Let's talk inside.

353
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,270
What happened to you?

354
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,230
Who bullied you?

355
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,870
Here, have a popsicle.

356
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,710
Don't cry. Good boy.

357
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,310
Eat.

358
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,790
Don't you know you can't eat cold food?

359
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,110
He wants it.

360
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,430
I'm afraid he can't finish it. I'm just helping him.

361
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,030
Thank you.

362
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,150
You're welcome.

363
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm glad to help.

364
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,230
Kid.

365
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,670
Is your mother waiting for you inside?

366
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,589
Go inside.

367
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:08,550
Let's go too.

368
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,869
I want milk tea.

369
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,030
You can't drink anything cold.

370
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,750
Fine.

371
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,190
Are you full?

372
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,910
I'm so full.

373
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:22,510
Jia Siwen.

374
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:25,950
You're busy studying every day.

375
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,910
You must lack exercise.

376
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,590
Sometimes the practice environment can be tough.

377
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,230
We need to hike by foot and stuff.

378
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,950
So.

379
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,750
Not bad.

380
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,070
So it's worth trying?

381
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,590
What's wrong?

382
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,870
Nothing.

383
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,830
I'm sorry.

384
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,790
It's okay. Are you okay?

385
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm fine.

386
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,670
You can't even walk.

387
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,190
Be careful.

388
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,870
Can't she keep her eyes on the road where she's walking?

389
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,270
Jiang Juanjuan.

390
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,270
What a prank.

391
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,470
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

392
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,230
I'm fine.

393
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,150
It's okay.

394
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,230
This place is nice.

395
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:24,950
Does he want to stay with me?

396
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,230
Juanjuan.

397
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,630
We've been together for so long.

398
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,550
We haven't…

399
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,030
No.

400
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,350
I didn't bring my phone charger.

401
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,710
It's okay.

402
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,790
You can use mine.

403
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,630
No.

404
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,350
I didn't bring any skincare products.

405
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,350
It's okay.

406
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,670
You can turn on the beauty function.

407
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,750
Isn't this too fast?

408
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,830
A little.

409
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,310
But we've been together for so long.

410
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,270
We haven't taken a photo together.

411
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,190
Besides, I think the lighting here is nice.

412
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,110
You mean taking photos together?

413
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,350
I'll be back later.

414
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,030
How can I see you when I miss you without a photo?

415
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,950
You're going back soon.

416
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,950
If I send you back to school,

417
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,510
I'll have to take the night flight back to Beijing.

418
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,910
Are you in such a hurry?

419
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,630
I have to go on a business trip with my teacher tomorrow.

420
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,070
I need to pack up.

421
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,670
I'll leave tomorrow.

422
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,670
I came to see you today.

423
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,390
What about the holidays?

424
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,510
You don't take a break? We can't meet?

425
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,270
I'm not sure yet.

426
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,390
But

427
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,110
I'll call you when I'm free.

428
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,870
Okay.

429
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,550
I'm sorry.

430
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,230
I can't be with you by then.

431
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,350
It's okay.

432
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,350
Go ahead.

433
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,750
I'm busy anyway.

434
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,110
I might not have time to talk to you.

435
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,630
Are we still going to take a picture?

436
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,270
Sure.

437
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,030
You have to take a good picture of me.

438
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,910
Make it your home screen.

439
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,790
Okay.

440
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,430
Why are you sighing?

441
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,270
Jia Siwen hasn't replied for 12 hours.

442
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,750
Aren't you using Exclusive Fairy Tale?

443
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,950
Check what he's doing.

444
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,110
I did.

445
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,710
He must be busy selecting a topic.

446
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,430
I know he's busy,

447
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,190
but I don't know he's so busy.

448
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,510
Why are you sighing?

449
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:28,790
What's wrong with Ling Chao?

450
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,550
No.

451
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,750
I'm watching the video we filmed.

452
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,310
The more I watch it, the more boring I find it is.

453
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,150
Do you think we can draw a conclusion

454
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,150
by only asking some random people

455
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,590
about how they think of love?

456
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,350
Anyway, I think

457
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,830
love is really hard to control.

458
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,350
It's much harder than fangirling.

459
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,710
Then what's the meaning

460
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,630
of this topic?

461
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,270
It's just a homework.

462
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,830
You just need to get credits from it.

463
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,670
You're right.

464
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,670
Come to think of it,

465
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,510
I think one of the reasons

466
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,710
I chose to major in journalism

467
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,750
is to go to college.

468
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,350
No way.

469
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,710
The cute guy riding a motorcycle

470
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,230
we saw yesterday.

471
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,750
Well, that man. He's trending.

472
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,230
-Let me see. -Check this out.

473
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,470
Look.

474
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,590
Someone posted the video of him

475
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,590
not taking responsibility after hitting someone.

476
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,190
He's got a bunch of haters online.

477
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,590
Look, someone suggested

478
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,230
making judgements after learning the whole story.

479
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,670
People think he's on the guy's side.

480
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,870
He was scolded for his looks.

481
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,670
Look.

482
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,230
It's debated in the comment section.

483
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,910
Someone has found out personal information about him.

484
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,470
Why didn't you say anything since you're in the dorm?

485
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,470
You scared me.

486
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,030
The owner of the motorcycle is a freshman of Yunhai Technology University.

487
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,910
He was born in 1998.

488
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,230
Xiao Tu.

489
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,070
What do you think?

490
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,750
I think there's a serious problem.

491
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,910
A random video

492
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,150
can trigger so many comments on social problems.

493
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,190
It makes our topic more meaningless.

494
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,350
It takes fate to meet good news.

495
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,550
It's a rare opportunity.

496
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,670
Why does he look so familiar?

497
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,950
Rewind it.

498
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,910
Yes, right here.

499
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,910
So this man didn't avoid his responsibility.

500
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,110
That old lady and those old people

501
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,830
blackmailed him.

502
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,750
I knew it.

503
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,390
He's handsome.

504
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,870
How could he be a bad guy?

505
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,470
It's said that appearance stands for one's personality.

506
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,190
The old saying makes sense.

507
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,110
Rewind it.

508
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,230
The more I look at him, the more handsome he looks.

509
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,430
So this matter

510
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:07,150
is not like what they said online.

511
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,350
Didn't he get cyber violence for nothing?

512
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,950
I know what topic I want to choose.

513
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,150
Finally done.

514
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,110
How's it going?

515
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,950
Five comments.

516
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,710
Two of them are from your major account and side account.

517
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,590
So few?

518
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,030
I've already forwarded it.

519
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,670
You're welcome.

520
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,790
I'm doing this for justice.

521
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:54,950
Fine.

522
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,630
You did well today.

523
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,190
I fell asleep last night.

524
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,030
I forwarded it as long as I saw it.

525
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,470
That's all for the news homework.

526
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,350
As news,

527
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,150
it has the five basic factors and truth

528
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,310
of news writing.

529
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,590
It's better than before.

530
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,030
When it first started online,

531
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,070
I also followed it.

532
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,070
I didn't expect there would be a twist.

533
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,150
I think we need to let more people

534
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,590
know the truth.

535
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,110
This is also our duty as journalists.

536
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,630
Sir.

537
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,790
We have published it online,

538
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,830
but fewer than 30 people forwarded it.

539
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,830
I hope you can all go check the post

540
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,350
and forward it.

541
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,950
As I said,

542
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,230
I hope everyone here

543
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,710
can become a journalist with a sense of justice.

544
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,830
It's only been two classes.

545
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,310
Your news has already become the 10th trending topic.

546
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,110
It's amazing what can be achieved by working together.

547
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,230
It's us.

548
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,110
We did it together.

549
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,190
It doesn't matter.

550
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,670
What's important is the public opinion has changed.

551
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,270
The netizens are defending him.

552
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,750
Excuse me, do you know Xiao Tu?

553
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,110
But it won't be late.

554
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,950
Well...

555
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,150
Now that you mention it,

556
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,790
I suddenly realised

557
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,310
the meaning of learning news.

558
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,150
What's wrong, kid?

559
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,950
Stop crying. Who bullied you?

560
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,590
Here.

561
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,670
I'll give you a popsicle.

562
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,830
Don't cry.

563
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:51,510
Thank you.

564
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,750
Of course.

565
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,750
We saved such a handsome guy.

566
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,790
It means a lot.

567
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,590
You're majoring in journalism.

568
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,150
Whether he is handsome or not,

569
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,150
you will help him.

570
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,190
Isn't that the guy riding the motorcycle?

571
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,270
So you are Xiao Tu?

572
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,670
You know me?

573
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,630
You posted the news, right?

574
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,830
Thank you.

575
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,870
I really appreciate it.

576
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,990
You're welcome.

577
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,950
We just did what we should do.

578
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,950
Can you do me another favor?

579
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,350
What?

580
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,430
Can you send me all the videos you sent?

581
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,710
I'll keep them as evidence.

582
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,510
It might be useful in the future.

583
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,430
Sure, no problem.

584
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,510
Let me add you on WeChat.

585
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,830
If you need anything,

586
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,070
you can contact me anytime.

587
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,270
Okay.

588
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,270
My name is Zhou Xingyu.

589
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,510
I major in Life Science in Yunhai.

590
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,110
Hello, my name is Jiang Juanjuan.

591
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,190
I major in journalism.

592
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,870
That news

593
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,310
was edited by Xiao Tu and me.

594
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:53,950
Hello.

595
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,430
Thank you both.

596
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:58,950
Are you free later?

597
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,230
I can treat you to a meal.

598
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,830
No, I have something to do.

599
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,910
Talk to you later.

600
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,870
Okay, call me when you're free.

601
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,630
Who is he?

602
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,710
A junior.

603
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,990
Do you want to eat or buy milk tea first?

604
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:19,750
Milk tea.

605
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,990
Xiao Tu.

606
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,070
Why are you here?

607
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,910
Don't you want milk tea?

608
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,630
So I bought it for you.

609
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,390
That's too many.

610
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,830
Is it too many?

611
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:35,830
Because I don't know

612
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,070
what flavor you like,

613
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,110
so I bought each for you.

614
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,070
Thank you.

615
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,590
Thank you.

616
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,350
This is a little heavy. Let me help you.

617
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,350
This is nothing.

618
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,870
It's not a big deal.

619
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,750
Go back to your work.

620
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:50,870
Thank you.

621
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,910
By the way,

622
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,750
the person who really wants to buy you milk tea

623
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,790
will buy for you

624
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,870
instead of only saying so.

625
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:00,670
Go back.

626
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,390
The delivery guy is quite cool now.

627
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,310
He's so fast.

628
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,230
Zhou Xingyu sent you so many messages on WeChat.

629
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,270
Don't you read them?

630
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,950
I don't want to. You can read it.

631
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,030
He wants to ask you out for a movie.

632
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,790
Is he interested in you?

633
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,430
How is that possible?

634
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,350
I told you.

635
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,150
He just thanked me

636
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,430
for helping him tell the truth.

637
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,070
I also helped.

638
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,630
Why didn't he buy me milk tea

639
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:48,990
or ask me out for a movie?

640
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,350
How dare you say that?

641
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,950
You drank most of the milk tea.

642
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,630
Right,

643
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,510
but don't blame me for not warning you.

644
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,710
If Ling Chao finds out,

645
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,350
it'll be hard for you to explain.

646
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,230
How could I go to a movie

647
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,110
with another man?

648
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,150
Go to bed.

649
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,950
Go. Wait for me.

650
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,750
Xiao Tu, listen.

651
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,670
Did I hear it wrong?

652
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,030
Why did I hear someone calling me?

653
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,590
I think I... I'll go take a look.

654
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,150
Xiao Tu, come down.

655
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,230
It's your Romeo.

656
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,350
No, your Romeo Zhou is here.

657
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,190
Here.

658
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,470
Look who's here.

659
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,550
What are you doing?

660
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,070
From now on,

661
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,950
I'll save the back seat of my motorcycle for you.

662
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,150
You want to thank me again?

663
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,990
No, I appreciate your kindness,

664
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,510
but I can't accept this gift.

665
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,590
How about this?

666
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,350
Think of it as a exchange for your tendon.

667
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,030
Okay.

668
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:54,110
That's not what I mean.

669
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,390
The thing you did

670
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:58,270
about the helmet and candles.

671
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,390
People might misunderstand.

672
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,910
Misunderstand what?

673
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:03,710
They'll misunderstand that you like...

674
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,910
I like you.

675
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,630
I said I like you.

676
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,470
I'm going to pursue you.

677
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,670
Cut it out.

678
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,230
I have a boyfriend.

679
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,550
Zhou Xingyu looks cool,

680
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,390
but why is his confession so cheesy?

681
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,510
I know.

682
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,670
But so what?

683
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,550
Dating is all about ability.

684
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,430
Yes. And in the end,

685
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,550
we don't know who will win.

686
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,110
Right?

687
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,750
Yes, that's right.

688
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,150
You have a personality,

689
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,070
but I really have to tell you

690
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,870
don't waste your time, okay?

691
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,830
Look who this girl is.

692
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,830
Look who this girl is.

693
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,510
Who is she?

694
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,390
Xiao Tu.

695
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,670
I know this

696
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,470
-is a bit abrupt -Why is Madam here?

697
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,390
for you.

698
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,710
I'm not asking you to make a decision right now.

699
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,030
I just want you to get my feelings.

700
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,270
I like you, Xiao Tu.

701
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,150
I just feel that Ling Chao

702
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,670
is being cheated on.

703
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,710
Does that mean I have a chance?

704
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,870
Does he know that lighting so many candles at night

705
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,150
can attract ghosts?

706
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,630
Why can't you understand?

707
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,870
I told you. It's impossible for us.

708
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,270
Go back and get some sleep.

709
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,550
You might grow taller.

710
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,910
Your helmet.

711
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,710
Besides.

712
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,350
Don't call me Xiao Tu.

713
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,230
I'm older than you.

714
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,150
You have to respect me.

715
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,870
Call me sister.

716
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,270
No.

717
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,310
Your helmet.

718
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,270
She's back.

719
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,310
Hurry up. She's back.

720
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,430
Master.

721
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,990
Master!

722
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,870
Master!

723
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,070
Master, you got cheated on.
