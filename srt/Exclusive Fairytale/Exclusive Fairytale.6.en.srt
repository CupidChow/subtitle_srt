1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,070
Sagittarius will return in good luck this week.

3
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,070
Especially in the second half of the week, your love luck will become very good.

4
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,470
Some Sagittarius even have a chance to meet the right person.

5
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,269
You can take the initiative when necessary.

6
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,950
Capricornus have good luck this week in general.

7
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,430
You have good love luck.

8
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,110
You will meet many people

9
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,470
who want to develop a relationship with you.

10
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,150
But be careful that there will be bad romance.

11
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,789
According to this horoscope book,

12
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:19,430
I might meet the right person this week.

13
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,590
You will also have love luck.

14
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,750
I don't believe in these.

15
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,030
This horoscope column is very accurate.

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,990
Those who don't believe will be backfired.

17
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,750
I advise you to be respectful.

18
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,990
Be careful that your bad romance

19
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,190
will disturb your peace.

20
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,590
Your being quiet is my biggest peace.

21
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,070
Here, yours is ready.

22
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,350
Ling Chao, you're here to buy breakfast too.

23
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,710
Sorry.

24
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,630
I added more meat for you.

25
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,910
Thank you, Boss.

26
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,550
Here, I'll give you half.

27
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,670
You'll be tired next week.

28
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,190
Eat more meat to replenish.

29
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,229
Boss, I want a pancake too.

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,470
Add an egg and cut it in half.

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,350
Okay.

32
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,350
Boss, one Star Magazine.

33
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,230
Boss, one Geography World.

34
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,829
Well...

35
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,310
Star Magazine.

36
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,550
Thank you.

37
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,190
20 yuan.

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,270
20 yuan.

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,670
OK.

40
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,910
Geography World.

41
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,150
20 yuan.

42
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,750
This is my gift for you. Take a look.

43
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,470
Hey.

44
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,590
Hey.

45
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,270
You're really something.

46
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,670
Come on, listen to me.

47
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,190
You high school sophomores

48
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,470
will soon be divided into liberal arts and science classes.

49
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,550
Do you want to choose liberal arts or science?

50
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,910
You must discuss it with your parents at home.

51
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,670
Understand?

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,750
Yes.

53
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,630
Mr. Xue.

54
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,950
About the class division,

55
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,070
since the beginning of the semester,

56
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,110
you've stressed it many times.

57
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,390
We all know.

58
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,270
But this Friday,

59
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,630
you need to hand in the intention form.

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,750
I'm still worried about you.

61
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,829
It feels like you just came to my class yesterday.

62
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,310
It's almost time for class division.

63
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,110
Happy times are always short.

64
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,310
Sir.

65
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,710
The time to grab the drumstick is short.

66
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,230
Don't worry, Mr. Xue.

67
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,710
We will consider it seriously.

68
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,150
-You still have a week.
-Let's go.

69
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,990
Think about it.

70
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,550
Ask me if you have any questions.

71
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,030
Okay, okay, Sir.

72
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,630
Go.

73
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,910
Jia Siwen, here.

74
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,190
When did you become so close to him?

75
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,790
Only you and your deskmate can be close.

76
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,150
I can't be respectful to my deskmate?

77
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,110
Your language level is worse than mine.

78
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,070
Shut up.

79
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,590
Aren't you afraid of being caught?

80
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,670
It's fine.

81
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,070
This is a dividing line.

82
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,750
Our side is safe.

83
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,630
This is crossing the line.

84
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,550
Stop it.

85
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,830
If Xiao finds out,

86
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,430
she's not as easy-going as Xue.

87
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,110
Don't eat mine.

88
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,750
I was tying my shoelaces just now.

89
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,550
Actually, Xue is good.

90
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,470
But he has a bad taste.

91
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,830
Why does he fall in love

92
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,350
with this cold woman?

93
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,030
How can we figure out

94
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,350
such a comlicated thing as love?

95
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,350
Right.

96
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,150
It's not strange for a head teacher who would burn himself when drinking

97
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,830
to do anything.

98
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,390
I think Xue is good.

99
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,990
It's lucky to have him in the three years of high school

100
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,910
so that we're not bored.

101
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,070
It's true.

102
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,150
Have you thought about the division?

103
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,950
You're going to stay in Xue's class to study liberal arts?

104
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,230
I have nothing to worry about.

105
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,950
My result has decided for me.

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,230
Me too.

107
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,710
I can write lyrics or books

108
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,070
for Wen Jun.

109
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,070
You both choose liberal arts?

110
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:43,909
Jia Siwen, you would choose science, right?

111
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,950
You got it wrong.

112
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,270
He will choose liberal arts.

113
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,909
Why?

114
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,630
You have good grades in every subject.

115
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,630
You should have the advantage in choosing science.

116
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,470
Because he likes Geography.

117
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,510
Looks like I'm the only one who chooses science.

118
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,670
Xiao Tu.

119
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,550
I heard that Ling Chao skipped to Grade 2.

120
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,550
How did he choose subjects?

121
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,470
I didn't skip class. How would I know?

122
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,710
He's good in History.

123
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,670
Why didn't he consider choosing liberal arts?

124
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,910
I'm not a worm in his stomach.

125
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,030
How would I know?

126
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,510
Aren't you curious?

127
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,550
Aren't you curious?

128
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,790
I'm not his fan.

129
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,070
Why should I be curious?

130
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,630
Aren't you...

131
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,790
You're not curious.

132
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,750
Let's eat.

133
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,470
Let's eat.

134
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,070
Come in.

135
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:45,870
Ms. Xiao.

136
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,190
You want to see me?

137
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,630
I just want to ask

138
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,590
what you think about this competition.

139
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,310
I’m not going this time.

140
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,750
If you don't go,

141
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,710
our school might not get the first place this year.

142
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,870
What a pity.

143
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,270
There are many excellent students in our school.

144
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,630
The one in Mr. Xue's class...

145
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,190
He's not bad.

146
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,830
If you can get the first place again,

147
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,990
it will be helpful

148
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,230
for your to be directly admitted to college.

149
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,630
Don't you want to think twice?

150
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:13,870
I don't want to be be directly admitted.

151
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,230
I think taking college entrance exam is more interesting.

152
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,070
In a proportionate sequence, a certain term can be zero.

153
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,390
The first three terms are 6,

154
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,230
18...
-Ling Chao.

155
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,510
Didn't I ask you to go back first?

156
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,190
I forgot my key.

157
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,870
Aren't my parents working overtime these days?

158
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,030
I have nowhere to go.

159
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,909
I promise to keep quiet

160
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,150
without disturbing you.

161
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,190
Whatever.

162
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,150
Xiao Tu, why are you everywhere?

163
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,670
This should be my line.

164
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,670
Ling Chao.

165
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,670
I don't know a few math questions.

166
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,670
Can you teach me?

167
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,030
Gum.

168
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,150
You're holding an English exercise book.

169
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,990
Ling Chao, I'm done.

170
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,910
Take a look.

171
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,710
You did it right this time.

172
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,470
Really?

173
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,790
I've solved this question for two days but I haven't solved it.

174
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,070
You can solve it right away.

175
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,230
You're really good.

176
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,110
A straight A student? A talented girl?

177
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,990
You have to rely on others to solve the questions you don't know.

178
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,990
Those rumors are too exaggerated.

179
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,110
I have the type and weaknesses I'm not good at.

180
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,230
Ling Chao knows it, right?

181
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,670
You only solved one question after so long.

182
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,110
And the right answer is C instead of B.

183
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,710
If you can't solve it, choose C.

184
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,750
You don't even know this?

185
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,789
You're so stupid.

186
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,070
Give it back!

187
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,790
Isn't this the knowledge of middle school?

188
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,230
I heard that you were admitted through special admission because of Taekwondo.

189
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,910
Indeed, the academic level of specially admitted students

190
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,230
is not that high.

191
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,270
I didn't believe what others said before.

192
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,950
Let's go.

193
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,950
Didn't you say the coupon of the fried chicken restaurant

194
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,830
will expire today?

195
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,710
Let's go eat up and go home.

196
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,470
Okay.

197
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,670
Ling Chao.

198
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,910
Hey, Gum.

199
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,390
Ling Chao has left. Why are you still here?

200
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,430
Are you going to live here?

201
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,670
The coupon is for three people.

202
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,510
I'll take you with us.

203
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,310
But I don't eat fried chicken.

204
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,230
Are we really going to eat fried chicken?

205
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,470
Do we have any other choice?

206
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,310
Fried chicken is too oily. We'll gain weight if we eat too much.

207
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,350
There's no coupon.

208
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,190
Then why did you ask me here?

209
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,350
Are you stupid?

210
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,990
Can't you see the atmosphere was awkward just now?

211
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,350
Then I should thank you.

212
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,950
You're welcome.

213
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,990
Fried chicken.

214
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,190
Yin Zihan?

215
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,350
Why aren't you home yet?

216
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,790
I just finished the training for competition.

217
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,550
What a coincidence.

218
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,870
The training hasn't started yet, right?

219
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,830
To get myself into the state ahead of time,

220
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,950
I gave myself extra training.

221
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,750
Yin Zihan.

222
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,550
Did you buy a new bike?

223
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,270
Not bad.

224
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,390
I haven't been exercising lately.

225
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,630
My muscles are not very obvious.

226
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,150
It was like this before.

227
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:27,870
So, I plan to ride a bike to school.

228
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,590
With your figure,

229
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,870
it's useless to train.

230
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,790
How about a triathlon?

231
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,830
Don't listen to him.

232
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,390
A good figure can't be developed in a few days.

233
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,030
Right?

234
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,230
You go ahead.

235
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,510
I'll go back first.

236
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,590
The dishes Godmother cooked will get cold if we come back later.

237
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,670
Wait for me.

238
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,670
Ling Chao.

239
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,750
Listen.

240
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,870
I've done your monthly test.

241
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,830
I asked the teacher to read your paper.

242
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,310
I wrote 17 more words than you for the composition.

243
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,790
You're amazing.

244
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,230
Did you choose science because

245
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,510
you want to go to Qingbei University?

246
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,390
Do you want to study Math or Physics?

247
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,830
I haven't thought about it.

248
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,630
Why do I have to go to Qingbei University?

249
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,350
Do you want to go abroad?

250
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,270
Harvard? Yale?

251
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,630
Or MIT?

252
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,430
Excuse me.

253
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,030
Where are you going later?

254
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,670
Go straight ahead

255
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,310
and turn left at the second intersection.

256
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,750
Look.

257
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,230
He even knows my address.

258
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,070
That is my address too.

259
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,630
Don't be stubborn.

260
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,670
You just don't want me to meet the right person.

261
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,270
You're so careless.

262
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,790
Didn't you notice a car following us?

263
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,270
Which one?

264
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,870
You go first. I'll go check.

265
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,030
Which one? Did you see it?

266
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,950
What?

267
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,670
Is that your car?

268
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,550
No.

269
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,950
We don't drive this one on Wednesday.

270
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,910
That's too dangerous.

271
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,950
I have to protect Ling Chao.

272
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,950
What happened?

273
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,430
Nothing.

274
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,830
Let's go.

275
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,590
That man looks good at fighting.

276
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,710
Can Ling Chao beat him?

277
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,830
Don't worry.

278
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,910
Ling Chao is awesome.

279
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,310
You haven't been to my house, have you?

280
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,950
Let's go.

281
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,470
It's right ahead.

282
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,590
-Let's go.
-He's awesome?

283
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,750
He learned Thai boxing?

284
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,070
-Let's go.
-Sanda?

285
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,990
Ling Chao, you just finished school?

286
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,270
What a coincidence. I was about to visit you.

287
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,590
Stop pretending.

288
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,430
You've been following me for so many days.

289
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,230
What do you want?

290
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,990
Well, you...

291
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,350
You misunderstood. I...

292
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,350
I was just passing by today.

293
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,310
Is it fun?

294
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,990
You left and came back

295
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,630
at your will.

296
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,270
I couldn't manage it when I was young.

297
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,550
And now I don't care.

298
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,950
Just come to me directly.

299
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,190
Don't always secretly

300
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,630
influence our life.

301
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,870
Son.

302
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,630
I know you resent me.

303
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,350
But I really...

304
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,750
I just want to care about you and your mother.

305
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,030
I don't mean anything else.

306
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,790
You're always like this.

307
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,910
You imposed your own intentions on us.

308
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,950
You have never thought about what we think.

309
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,710
We're doing well now.

310
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,030
It's better without you.

311
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,790
Don’t disturb our life.

312
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,870
Chao, I...

313
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,190
Well,

314
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,630
Xiao Tu.

315
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,070
This is the first time I go to your house.

316
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,030
Shouldn't I bring some gifts

317
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,910
to your parents?

318
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,990
Like tea,

319
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,270
antique vases...

320
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:13,790
Silk!

321
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,590
Have you watched too many dramas?

322
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,350
You're not a new son-in-law.

323
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,590
You don't have to do such social things.

324
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,790
My parents are easy to get along with.

325
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,070
-Let's go.
-It's inappropriate.

326
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,830
Let's go.

327
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,870
Don't buy anything.

328
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,750
Hurry up.

329
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,270
-It's full. It's everywhere.
- This...

330
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,550
Is this vinegar?

331
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,470
-Yes.
-Dad, Mum.

332
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,150
I brought my classmate here to play.

333
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,310
Okay.

334
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,270
Wait a minute.

335
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,110
I'll get you a pair of slippers.

336
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,990
This pair belongs to Ling Chao.

337
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,830
This pair is too small.

338
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,270
Are you done?

339
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,030
I can't hold it any longer.

340
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,270
Wait.

341
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,590
Who are you bringing?

342
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,470
Hello.

343
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,070
Hello, Dad and Mom.

344
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,950
What are you doing?

345
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,230
Have an orange.

346
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:23,990
Okay.

347
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,990
Thank you, Uncle.

348
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,070
Wenhui, where are you?

349
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,030
Let me tell you.

350
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,230
Rabbit brought a classmate home.

351
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,390
A boy.

352
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,870
What? Rabbit brought a boy home?

353
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,630
Is he handsome?

354
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,030
Not bad.

355
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,910
Not as handsome as Ling Chao.

356
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,630
He's about the same height as Chao.

357
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,790
What am I talking to you about?

358
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,870
I just want to ask you

359
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,670
that it's the first time she brings a boy home,

360
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,790
what should I do?

361
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,070
Don't worry. I'll be right there. Let's talk in person.

362
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,910
Okay, hurry up.

363
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,750
I'm hanging up.

364
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,510
Okay, I'll wait for you.

365
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,510
Xiao Tu,

366
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,110
I think your classmate is very tall.

367
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,230
He's more handsome than Ling Chao.

368
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,710
Have some apples.

369
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,510
His hair is curly.

370
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,870
He looks handsome.

371
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,990
Have an apple.

372
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,790
I'll add another dish.

373
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,910
He's handsome.

374
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,710
Have table manners.

375
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,790
Don't play while eating.

376
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,470
He has a good appetite.

377
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,230
He's already had two bowls of rice.

378
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,750
If you want to eat something,

379
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,830
help yourself.

380
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,310
Make yourself at home.

381
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,670
Okay, thank you, Dad.

382
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,230
Thank you, Uncle.

383
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,790
Eat up.

384
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,150
The food price

385
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,190
has gone up.

386
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,109
I can't even afford to eat scallion, ginger and garlic.

387
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,750
Yes.

388
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,790
So,

389
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,829
Rabbit,

390
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,470
don't be picky.

391
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,589
Do you hear me?

392
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,430
I... I have too much rice.

393
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,950
Ling Chao will help me.

394
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,310
Just this much?

395
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,310
Too little.

396
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,990
Let me get you a bowl.

397
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,390
No, it's okay, Uncle.

398
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,350
I usually don't eat much.

399
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,670
Auntie's cooking is so good.

400
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,630
That's why I ate more.

401
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,230
I told you.

402
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,790
My mom is a good cook.

403
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,470
You should eat more.

404
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,790
You won't have such a good chance in the future.

405
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,070
You can come

406
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,750
whenever you want.

407
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,710
Okay.

408
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,750
We only need to add an extra pair of chopsticks.

409
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,590
Come...

410
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,990
He won't have time for a while.

411
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,790
He signed up for the competition.

412
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,670
He has training after school.

413
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,510
Right?

414
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,270
Se...nior.

415
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,550
A competition?

416
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,630
Good.

417
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,830
A straight A student.

418
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,870
Xiao Tu, if you

419
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,350
have any questions,

420
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,630
you should ask him more.

421
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,270
Xiao Tu and I are deskmates.

422
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,030
It's my duty.

423
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,510
Okay.

424
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,230
In school,

425
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,430
don't bother your classmate.

426
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,910
We already have a tutor at home.

427
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,550
Yeah.

428
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,870
Ling Chao, do you hear me?

429
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,950
Chao is a good student, right?

430
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,590
If he tutors Xiao Tu,

431
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,910
to put it nicely,

432
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,470
it's more than enough.

433
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,630
To be frank,

434
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,350
it's a waste of talent.

435
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,150
Mom.

436
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,270
You can chat with each other.

437
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,870
Why do you have to talk about me?

438
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,190
Sit down.

439
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,190
How can we let you do it?

440
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,230
Ling Chao, go.

441
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,150
Look, he knows where it is.

442
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,190
A man

443
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,390
should do more work.

444
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,750
Yes, Wenhui.

445
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,550
I envy you so much.

446
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,670
Look at Chao.

447
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,950
He's so sensible.

448
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,870
He also has good grades.

449
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,710
He can do housework too.

450
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,910
It's rare to see such a good boy

451
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,430
as Chao.

452
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,390
Auntie.

453
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,670
It's too hard for you to cook so many dishes.

454
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,390
Later,

455
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,990
let me wash the dishes and clean up.

456
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,270
-You're quite diligent.
-No, no.

457
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,430
How can I let you do the dishes?

458
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,990
Uncle, Auntie.

459
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,990
You don't have to be so polite.

460
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,270
Let me help you.

461
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,310
No, I can do it myself.

462
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,390
I'm also good at housework.

463
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,710
I...

464
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,750
The toilet is over there.

465
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,190
Yin, you must be tired.

466
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,880
Come on, sit down and watch TV.

467
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:11,830
What are you talking about?

468
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,270
What time is it?

469
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,990
Let him go home.

470
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,110
Is it late?

471
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,990
His parents will be worried.

472
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,350
He has homework to do.

473
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:21,990
Yeah.

474
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,750
Get ready.

475
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,070
That's good.

476
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,310
Anyway, come often

477
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,390
when you have time.

478
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,190
Xiao Tu.

479
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,670
See your classmates off.

480
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,590
Ling Chao,

481
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,550
You go too. Hurry up.

482
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,750
You go with Rabbit.

483
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:40,950
Well,

484
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,830
Uncle, Auntie. Thank you for the food.

485
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,670
See you next time.

486
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,390
-Take care.
-You're welcome.

487
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,310
Bye. Take care.

488
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,190
Bye. Bye.

489
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,270
Bye.

490
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:48,790
Goodbye, Uncle.

491
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,190
Okay, take care.

492
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,510
Where is my bike?

493
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,590
You didn't lock it?

494
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,910
I forgot.

495
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,710
I usually park it in my yard.

496
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,950
I never lock it.

497
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,270
Why did they only steal your bike?

498
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,310
Even bicycles are categorized?

499
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,630
I...

500
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,030
Ask your family to pick you up.

501
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,470
Stop calling.

502
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,870
It's quite suitable.

503
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,270
I think you should stay away from him.

504
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,310
Why?

505
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,590
Didn't you know that he approached you for a purpose?

506
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,630
I know.

507
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,630
Ridiculous.

508
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,910
Ling Chao,

509
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,950
do you think I should choose liberal arts or science?

510
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,150
Is there any difference?

511
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,230
It doesn't affect you to be the last place anyway.

512
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,630
You did it on purpose.

513
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,430
Ling Chao.

514
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:58,430
Morning.

515
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,310
Hello, Senior.

516
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,710
I brought it for you

517
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,750
when I passed by the breakfast shop today.

518
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,630
Thank you.

519
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,830
I've already had breakfast.

520
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,390
Junior,

521
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,510
I think you should choose liberal arts.

522
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,950
I chose science.

523
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,910
It is actually quite hard to learn.

524
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,590
But luckily, I have Ling Chao.

525
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,390
He taught me all the questions I don't know.

526
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,470
Thank you. Senior.

527
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,270
Let's go. We're being late.

528
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,270
You are so patient.

529
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,070
Why didn't you teach me how to do exercises?

530
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,310
Did I not teach you?

531
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,910
You can't be taught at all.

532
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,510
Is that called teaching?

533
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,030
How can you learn how to solve a math question at once?

534
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,830
When I taught you the second time,

535
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,470
you were already sleeping like a pig.

536
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,350
It's my fault?

537
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,750
Where's Senior?

538
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,190
Lan, good morning.

539
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,350
Why did you stop here?

540
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,550
Nothing.

541
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,590
Let's go.

542
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,710
Yin Xinlan is jealous

543
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,830
because you and Ling Chao are close.

544
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,310
Why would such a beautiful senior

545
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,590
be jealous of me?

546
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,550
I have a better relationship with QQ candies.

547
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,910
It's fine that she's stupid,

548
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,470
but she always troubles Ling Chao.

549
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,630
I'm speechless.

550
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,830
Is it that bad?

551
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,950
It's not like you didn't see what happened on the doomsday.

552
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,470
What a joke.

553
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,190
And she can't even solve the questions in junior high.

554
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,270
If Ling Chao hadn't been her neighbor since young,

555
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,630
he wouldn't be her friend.

556
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,510
What a burden.

557
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,230
Senior.

558
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,990
Are you okay?

559
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,750
I wasn't interested in other people's things,

560
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,870
but I think I should tell you.

561
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,830
Don't take too much water.

562
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,230
Otherwise, you'll burn yourself.

563
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,310
Speaking ill of others is also like this.

564
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,870
You'll be punished if you talk too much.

565
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,590
Not bad.

566
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,070
I didn't expect you to have such a charismatic side.

567
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,630
Of course.

568
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,990
I haven't watched those court intrigue dramas

569
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,590
for nothing.

570
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,390
Your Highness.

571
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,310
Is it an earthquake?

572
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,790
Why does your kettle

573
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,670
keep shaking?

574
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,150
It's my first time acting such a role.

575
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,750
I was flustered too.

576
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,230
Right?

577
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,390
But this Yin Xinlan...

578
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,030
I thought she was my goddess.

579
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,150
I didn't expect her to still have two faces.

580
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,950
She is more formidable than Ling Chao.

581
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,110
If they really get married,

582
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,310
it'll be bad.

583
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,030
They will quarrel every day

584
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:18,830
and won't have peace.

585
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,830
By then, I'll still be the unlucky one mediating the situation.

586
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,350
It's fine as long as we have a bad tempered person at home.

587
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,390
I have to find a brother-in-law

588
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,590
who has a good temper.

589
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,310
You really know how to worry.

590
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,150
This horoscope column is very accurate.

591
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,710
Those who don't believe it will be backfired.

592
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,230
Come with me to the toilet.

593
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,190
I went there already.

594
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,470
I think you can try again.

595
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:51,630
I can't.

596
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,070
You didn't come here to pee.

597
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,110
What did you come here for?

598
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,830
To find peace.

599
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,510
You don't know how lucky you are.

600
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,190
Do you believe in constellations?

601
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,390
I believe knowledge changes fate.

602
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,310
The training class Ms. Xiao mentioned

603
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,470
is full of boys.

604
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,110
It's like entering a monk's temple.

605
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,510
I think if you need peace,

606
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,510
you can get it there.

607
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:30,270
Are you crazy?

608
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,670
Do you want to get caught again?

609
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,350
It's okay.

610
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,030
Don't you know?

611
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,870
The principal's son is married.

612
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,830
Now he sees everyone as a couple.

613
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,190
He doesn't care about seperating boys and girls.

614
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,430
Then I was caught for nothing.

615
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,870
This is so unfair.

616
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,630
You feel wronged?

617
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,790
You two should be labelled

618
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,790
as the key focus.

619
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,670
Yin Zihan.

620
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,030
You're so happy about this?

621
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,550
Of course.

622
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,350
Ling Chao

623
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,910
still came to the Informatics Competition.

624
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,190
He pretended not to care,

625
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,190
but he actually cares a lot.

626
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,310
Why aren't you eating?

627
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,590
He pretended not to care,

628
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,030
but he actually cares a lot.

629
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,230
Honey, Ah Ha.

630
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,550
It's over.

631
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,190
I'm brainwashed by Jia Siwen.

632
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,310
No.

633
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,830
I want to listen to Junhui's song.

634
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,870
Stop playing. We have business to do.

635
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,510
Hello, Ling Chao.

636
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,190
I'm Xiao Tu's best friend,

637
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,830
Jiang Juanjuan.

638
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,430
Is it really okay?

639
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,590
Don't worry. I'm here.

640
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,670
I promise you will marry Ling Chao.

641
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,830
No way.

642
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,110
Junhui will get mad.

643
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,270
Who is Junhui?

644
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,390
My new idol.

645
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,870
It makes me dizzy.

646
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,070
He accepted.

647
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,710
Come on.

648
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,790
Hurry up.

649
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,710
What will we say?

650
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:20,190
What songs do you usually listen to?

651
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,910
Do you like Green Soda?

652
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,990
What is Green Soda?

653
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,230
The band Ling Chao likes.

654
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,590
Look.

655
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,710
What a coincidence.

656
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,830
I like Green Soda too.

657
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:48,750
Do you like their Big Love Song?

658
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,870
Why does he always say yes?

659
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,950
Did he reply automatically?

660
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,710
You know him.

661
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,230
He's always like this to strangers.

662
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,470
It's okay. He's just like a computer.

663
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,350
What a coincidence.

664
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,630
Me too.

665
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,590
Don't you think we're a good match?

666
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,550
It's okay.

667
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:20,670
We're different from your bad romance.

668
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,270
Why did you...

669
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,550
It's sent.

670
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,310
Why didn't he reply?

671
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,630
Maybe he's shy.

672
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,550
It's okay.

673
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,630
There's a new fried chicken restaurant near the school.

674
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:41,310
Let's go eat after school.

675
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,510
I'm not going.

676
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,710
Come on.

677
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,430
Xiao Tu.

678
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,390
Just tell me if you want fried chicken.

679
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,550
Don't be ridiculous.

680
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,750
How did he know it was me?

681
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,870
I don't know.

682
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,870
He worked so hard.

683
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,630
Let me test you.

684
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,430
You've walked in the desert for three days and three nights.

685
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,030
At that time, an animal comes to save you.

686
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,430
Which animal is it?

687
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,350
Why an animal?

688
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,190
Don't mind that.

689
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:29,990
Then.

690
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,830
A turtle.

691
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,310
At this time,

692
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,310
the turtle decides to give you something.

693
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,550
What do you think it is?

694
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,150
Why would a turtle give me something?

695
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,990
Don't mind that.

696
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,230
It must be milk tea.

697
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,270
I'm in the desert.

698
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:43,590
If the milk tea must be paired with something

699
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,510
together.

700
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,190
What would you choose?

701
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:47,950
Tiramisu.

702
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,350
You do like Yin Zihan.

703
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,870
Why?

704
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,190
Did you make up this test?

705
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,950
When you were struggling in the sea of exercises,

706
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,150
Yin Zihan came to save you.

707
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,230
Were you happy?

708
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,230
Yes.

709
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,630
When Yin Zihan gave you milk tea,

710
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,670
were you happy?

711
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,430
Yes.

712
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,270
You still don't admit that you like Yin Zihan?

713
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,830
He took you to eat tiramisu for once.

714
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,990
And you still remember it.

715
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,670
Then I guess I like him.

716
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,510
Generally, when it comes to Episode 8,

717
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,870
the male and female lead will kiss each other in Korean dramas.

718
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,350
How come there's no progress

719
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,230
between you and Yin Zihan?

720
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,350
But I still don't know

721
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,230
what he likes about me

722
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,350
and what I like about him.

723
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,390
Didn't you hear him?

724
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,830
How can we figure out

725
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,830
such a complicated thing as love?

726
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,750
You can't  figure out how to study.

727
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,910
Don't think about more complicated things.

728
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,870
I think Yin Zihan is good.

729
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,190
Don't be a coward.

730
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,590
Seize the opportunity.

731
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,070
Then I...

732
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,030
Go watch a movie

733
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:53,110
and take a walk with him.

734
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,390
Talk about poetry, songs, and philosophy of life.

735
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,430
Or do something you're good at

736
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,670
to amplify your charm.

737
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:04,590
OK?

738
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,710
Xiao Tu, I don't know how.

739
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,750
Xiao Tu, I don't know how.

740
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,790
I...

741
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,470
Don't run!

742
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,310
No, I can't do it.

743
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,110
Why are you running?

744
00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:00,230
No!

745
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,190
Mom, I'm home.

746
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,790
Mom.

747
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,230
I forgot to give some books to Xiao Tu.

748
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,390
I'm going out.

749
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:19,990
Go.

750
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,430
I'm sorry.

751
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,550
I just thought I was good at it.

752
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,990
I didn't expect you didn't know how to do it at all.

753
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,230
It's okay.

754
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,910
Today, I've learned that the taekwondo has po...

755
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,150
Charm.

756
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,790
Why don't you go back and rest first?

757
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,070
I can go back by myself.

758
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,790
No.

759
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,830
It's so dark. It's so late.

760
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,070
You must be scared if you go back alone.

761
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,710
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

762
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,510
It's okay.

763
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,070
It's just a cat.

764
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,150
If you're scared,

765
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,950
I'll sing you a song to boost your courage.

766
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,590
Sure.

767
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,910
The river flows east.

768
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:15,870
The stars in the sky point towards the Polaris.

769
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,790
Hey. Pointing towards the Polaris.

770
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,350
How about

771
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,150
I sing for you?

772
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,150
Sure.

773
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,470
Dimples and long eyelashes

774
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,110
are your most beautiful marks.

775
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,470
I can't sleep every day...

776
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,790
Not bad.

777
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,230
You sing well.

778
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,270
Of course.

779
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,190
If it weren't for my parents' disagreement,

780
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,910
I really want to be a singer and dancer.

781
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,870
Really?

782
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:52,510
I thought you have no other pursuit

783
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,110
besides surpassing Ling Chao.

784
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,270
How is that possible?

785
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,590
Surpassing Ling Chao is just my small goal.

786
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,350
My big goal is to perform on stage.

787
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,910
Imagine

788
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,630
when you stand in the center of the stage,

789
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,949
the spotlight is on you,

790
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,469
it's like you're the center of the world.

791
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,110
You sing your favorite song

792
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,510
and follow the rhythm of music.

793
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,949
At the audience

794
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,989
stands applause and glowsticks.

795
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:26,830
This feeling.

796
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,350
Why didn't your family agree?

797
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,550
Not everyone with dreams

798
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,830
is qualified to pursue their dreams.

799
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,429
But

800
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,989
having a dream

801
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,909
is already great.

802
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:48,750
Are you really okay?

803
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,949
I'm fine.

804
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,590
Okay.

805
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,390
I've completed my mission as the guardian.

806
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,470
Go home.

807
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,270
Thanks.

808
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,710
You should go back too.

809
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,390
Okay.

810
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,390
See you tomorrow.

811
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,070
See you tomorrow.

812
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,950
You scared me.

813
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,430
Do you really think

814
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,270
Yin Zihan is your Mr. Right?

815
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,110
Mind your own

816
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,990
bad romance.

817
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,750
Some flowers look beautiful,

818
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,790
but actually they are poisonous.

819
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,790
Be careful.

820
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,910
It's different.

821
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,310
Forget it.

822
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,750
Let me tell you directly.

823
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,230
Yin Zihan approached you for another purpose.

824
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,630
Yes.

825
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,510
He wants me.

826
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,950
Otherwise, you?

827
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,470
He wants you because you have a bad temper

828
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,670
or because you can't speak human language?

829
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,430
How do you know it's impossible?

830
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,310
Didn't the horoscope book say

831
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,350
I would have bad romance?

832
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,430
Can you clean it up?

833
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,280
You spread them every time.

834
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,030
Didn't you say to buy a birthday gift?

835
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,910
Why did you get a turtle back?

836
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,150
Don't mention it.

837
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,470
She got it from the kids' amusement park herself.

838
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,510
Others caught goldfish.

839
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,190
She

840
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,390
caught a turtle.

841
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,590
Turtle is also good.

842
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,550
It has a good meaning.

843
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,710
It means to get a rich and successful husband.

844
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,670
Right?
