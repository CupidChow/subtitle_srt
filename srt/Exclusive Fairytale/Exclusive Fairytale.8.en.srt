1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,470
Okay. I got it.

3
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,430
I'll ask Zheng to go over there later.

4
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,950
He is familiar with this business.

5
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:12,630
Okay. Bye.

6
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,630
Look.

7
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,470
The weather is nice today.

8
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,110
Well...

9
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,310
I don't have any appetite after I got up in the morning.

10
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,030
You're growing.

11
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,789
You should eat more.

12
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,070
It's such a substantial breakfast.

13
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,830
As I'm looking at it,

14
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,550
I feel hungry, too.

15
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,950
Your mom's cooking skill is getting better and better.

16
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,509
-It's delicious. -You're up.

17
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,350
The sugar cakes were sold out today.

18
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,630
That's all the food I've bought.

19
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,990
Make do with it.

20
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,190
I'll get you a glass of milk.

21
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,350
I'm almost done.

22
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,710
I have to go.

23
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,390
I'll drive you to school.

24
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,870
You can drive my mom.

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,070
I'm leaving.

26
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,390
Be careful.

27
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,590
Same as usual?

28
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,950
Sir. Sir.

29
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,470
You're finally here.

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,550
This is the last copy of Celebrity Weekly.

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,430
Many people want it.

32
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,070
I almost couldn't keep it for you.

33
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,470
Of course. This is my dear idol.

34
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,750
Of course it sells well.

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,710
Twenty yuan.

36
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,390
Okay.

37
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,470
-Okay -Thank you, sir.

38
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,150
You're welcome.

39
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,950
What's wrong?

40
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,950
Are you sick?

41
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,510
If I get up early, I'll be silly for the whole day.

42
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,829
To buy this issue's Celebrity Weekly,

43
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,710
I got up at five.

44
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,710
My dog hadn't woken up yet.

45
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,150
Luckily, I got it.

46
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,030
Otherwise, how could I face

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,790
such a handsome cover of my dear Junhui?

48
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,950
Then who is this?

49
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,670
This is Wenjun's poster.

50
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,270
It's not autographed anyway.

51
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,910
Besides, I like Junhui now.

52
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,910
That's why I wrapped my book with this poster.

53
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,390
I don't think there's any difference between them.

54
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:47,390
What?

55
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,430
My dear Junhui is more handsome and maturer.

56
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,710
But I shouldn't have said that.

57
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,550
Wenjun is good, too.

58
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,230
Well, I'm a sophomore in senior high shcool now.

59
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,910
I have a different taste from those little girls.

60
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,550
You changed your mind constantly,

61
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,950
and are not loyal enough to one idol.

62
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,870
There should be something new in the new semester.

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,630
Let me tell you.

64
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,230
I've also learned Junhui's new dance.

65
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,910
Let me dance for you.

66
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,990
Half of the semester has passed.

67
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,350
Really?

68
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,990
Is my dear Junhui

69
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,590
going to publish new books and new albums?

70
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,670
I'm looking forward to it very much.

71
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,909
Anthomanic.

72
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,110
Anthomanic.

73
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,070
An.

74
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,230
You should also learn it with me.

75
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,590
Everyone, please be quiet.

76
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,350
Listen to me.

77
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,230
Today is a very important day.

78
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,510
You must remind your parents again

79
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,909
not to be late.

80
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,070
Nor can they be absent.

81
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,190
It's just a parents' meeting.

82
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,230
How come Xue describes it as if it were a wedding?

83
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,230
Especially you, Jiang Juanjuan.

84
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,990
Only your seat was empty at the last parents' meeting.

85
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,310
It's not allowed today.

86
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,470
Well, Mr. Xue...

87
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,670
My family is really busy.

88
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,190
My mother

89
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,990
is swimming on a certain tropical island now.

90
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,590
My dad just went on a business trip yesterday.

91
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,270
I have no choice.

92
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,430
They're so busy.

93
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,630
If there's no other way,

94
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,310
I'll call them and ask them for a home visit.

95
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,150
No, no, no, Mr. Xue.

96
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,030
I will definitely tell my dad

97
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,590
about the importance of this parents' meeting,

98
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,990
and ask him to rush back.

99
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,430
Are you sure he will come?

100
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,870
That's more like it.

101
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,950
Class begins.

102
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,030
Come on, everyone.

103
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,950
Turn to Page 54.

104
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,909
Alright.

105
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,950
If you have any questions,

106
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,310
come to my office to ask me.

107
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,390
Class is over.

108
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,830
Goodbye, sir.

109
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,510
He must be here to see Xiao Tu.

110
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,870
Yin Zihan comes here after class every day.

111
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,630
As a student in the science class,

112
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,550
why do you always come to our Class Four when you're free?

113
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,070
Are you going to marry into our family?

114
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,230
After all, I studied in this class for a year.

115
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,870
This is my hometown.

116
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:20,630
What?

117
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,870
Can't I come home?

118
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,710
So you regard Class 4 as your home?

119
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,990
I understand.

120
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,950
There is a girl here whom you care about so much.

121
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,670
But according to seniority,

122
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,150
you should call me elder sister.

123
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,909
I won't stand on ceremony then.

124
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,390
For the parents' meeting...

125
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,230
No.

126
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,550
Please help me

127
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,909
do the cleaning in the family today.

128
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,750
You really regard yourself as his family?

129
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,470
It's all thanks to you.

130
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,670
You and Yin Zihan are so close to each other.

131
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,670
How can you order your friends around like this?

132
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,230
You don't seem to worry about the parents' meeting at all.

133
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,750
Has my tutoring for you

134
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,070
taken effect?

135
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,750
It's not that fast.

136
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,070
I need a few more courses of treatment before it takes effect.

137
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,270
However, both my parents have gone back to their hometown.

138
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,430
As long as my mom doesn't come,

139
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,550
it'll be okay if anyone else comes.

140
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,590
Xiao's uncle seemed to

141
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,790
trip on either of his feet and fell down.

142
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,310
Xiao and Shishi

143
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,070
went back to their hometown overnight.

144
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,590
It might be quite serious.

145
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,510
So,

146
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,750
we really don't know whether

147
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,430
an accident or tomorrow will come first.

148
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,670
We have to cherish the current moment.

149
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,110
Yes.

150
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,830
I should cherish

151
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,470
the days with you two.

152
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,030
If I knew this would happen,

153
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,190
I shouldn't have...

154
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,150
Look.

155
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,870
Which side looks better?

156
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,110
This one looks good.

157
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,670
You have a good taste.

158
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,870
Chao gave this to me as a birthday gift.

159
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,870
What did you want to say just now?

160
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,150
I was saying that

161
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,830
we should let Zheng attend the parents' meeting.

162
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,510
That's not okay.

163
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,470
Even if you trust Zheng,

164
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,150
you can't let an outsider attend the parents' meeting.

165
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,590
I know Little Rabbit's situation very well.

166
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,830
I'll attend the meeting for her.

167
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,710
You can attend the meeting for Ling Chao.

168
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,390
Okay?

169
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,030
But I know little about Ling Chao's situation.

170
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,390
Ling Chao's situation

171
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,030
is the same every year.

172
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,830
There will be no problem.

173
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,390
You just need to attend the meeting.

174
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,390
Alright.

175
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:32,909
Come on.

176
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,789
Help me put on the necklace.

177
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,110
Why aren't you wearing the earrings you chose just now?

178
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,670
After you gave them to me at that time,

179
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,470
I didn't wear them all the time as they are precious.

180
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,110
Ling Bo.

181
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,030
Let bygones be bygones.

182
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,550
If you hadn't been sending money to us all these years,

183
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,670
we wouldn't have become the ones as we are now.

184
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,830
You always bear the hardships by yourself.

185
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,830
There are some things that the kid doesn't know,

186
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,670
but I know, don't I?

187
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,750
All these years,

188
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,590
I've owed you two too much.

189
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,390
Don't worry.

190
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,390
I will compensate you and Ling Chao more

191
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,830
so that you can live a better life.

192
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,230
Alright, alright. Stop blaming yourself.

193
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,630
Let's go.

194
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,950
Lady Juan.

195
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,750
Which insolent brat

196
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,590
made you angry?

197
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,750
Let me teach him a lesson for you.

198
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,790
This time, I'm the one who is insolent.

199
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,110
Your idol's image has been ruined again?

200
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,390
It's because of my dad this time.

201
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,470
He never cared about

202
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,790
my grades.

203
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,870
I don't know what's wrong with him this time,

204
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,430
and he's coming to the parents' meeting.

205
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,870
He has just told me that

206
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,630
he is on his way here.

207
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,470
It's good that

208
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,710
your dad cares about you.

209
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,990
But my grades dropped a lot this time.

210
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,430
He'll be angry if he knows it.

211
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:46,190
So, when he asked me what time the parents' meeting would start,

212
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,990
I was so impulsive that

213
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,430
I told him the time which was two hours later.

214
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,790
I thought when he came,

215
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,590
the parents' meeting would be over,

216
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,630
and then the problem would be solved.

217
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,230
It's okay.

218
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,510
Maybe your dad just did it on the spur of the moment.

219
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,710
He might not be able to come if he suddenly has something else to deal with later.

220
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,390
I hope so.

221
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,510
I just hope that Xue can do it quickly

222
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,870
and end the parents' meeting soon.

223
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,550
Well,

224
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,270
how about we go to the playground for some fresh air later?

225
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,470
Maybe you'll feel better.

226
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,190
Okay.

227
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,830
Hello, hello.

228
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,910
Little Rabbit's mother.

229
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,750
Let me introduce myself.

230
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,630
I'm Yin Zihan's mother, and Zihan is Little Rabbit's deskmate.

231
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,030
Hello.

232
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,510
I heard Han talk at home every day

233
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,430
about Little Rabbit being like this today,

234
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,670
and being like that tomorrow.

235
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,670
He cares so much

236
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,670
about your Little Rabbit.

237
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,030
Little Rabbit didn't talk much about

238
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,070
Yin Zihan.

239
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,550
She has a better relationship with Ling Chao in Grade 12.

240
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,470
You mean Ling Chao?

241
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,990
His academic record is good.

242
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,390
But I've heard that he has a bad personality.

243
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,310
He's a bit weird.

244
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,950
No.

245
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,310
It's called arrogance.

246
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,990
But...

247
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,590
But Little Rabbit thinks that Ling Chao is good.

248
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,070
He always ranks the first in his class.

249
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,990
Besides, he often tutors her in her homework

250
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,230
and teaches her to do the exercises.

251
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,110
No matter how good Ling Chao is,

252
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,190
he's a student in the 12th grade after all.

253
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,590
Little Rabbit and Han

254
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,070
are deskmates,

255
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,310
and because of this, they can get closer and closer to each other.

256
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,590
Rabbits don't eat grass by their nest.

257
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,510
But they are still young.

258
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,430
We don't know what will happen in the future.

259
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,270
So,

260
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,550
I mean we should let these two kids communicate more

261
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,550
with each other

262
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,230
and learn from each other.

263
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,110
There's nothing wrong with this.

264
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,910
Hello. Hello.

265
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,630
Sit over there.

266
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,910
Right. He needs to be more focused.

267
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,870
Watch him do his homework at home.

268
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,910
Keep an eye on him.

269
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,790
Who are you?

270
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,910
Hello, I'm Ling Chao's father.

271
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,790
Hello, Ling Chao's dad.

272
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,470
I'm his class adviser. My surname is Xiao.

273
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,710
His mother attended the parents' meeting every time,

274
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,990
so I didn't recognize you.

275
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,590
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,350
It's okay.

277
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,070
How is Ling Chao at school?

278
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,910
There's no problem with Ling Chao's grades.

279
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,110
He has always been recognized as

280
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,470
the most excellent student.

281
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,230
However, his individual consciousness is a bit strong.

282
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,670
If he meets any problem, he wouldn't talk to the teacher.

283
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,990
You mean Ling Chao is a bit unsociable and eccentric at school?

284
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,870
No, no, it's not that serious.

285
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,230
He merely has his own ideas and has a unique personality.

286
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,790
So, as parents,

287
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,230
you should communicate more

288
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:36,990
with your child,

289
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,200
and care more about him.

290
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,030
Thank you, Ms. Xiao.

291
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,990
I'll be careful with it.

292
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,870
Mr. Xue.

293
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,630
Hello, hello.

294
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,990
I haven't seen you for a long time. You've become more handsome.

295
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,110
You are...

296
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,350
Yin Zihan's mother, right?

297
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,630
Yes, yes, yes.

298
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,110
You have such a good memory.

299
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,470
How come I remember that Yin Zihan

300
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,190
has been assigned to science class?

301
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,070
Have you gone to the wrong place?

302
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,990
I just came here to say hello

303
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,270
and to see you.

304
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,350
I've said hello to you.

305
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,350
I'm leaving.

306
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,430
Let me see you off. Come on.

307
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:21,670
Bye.

308
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,030
Let me see you off.

309
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,790
No need, Mr. Xue. Bye.

310
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,670
After you go out, take the stairs and enter the first classroom.

311
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,430
God bless me.

312
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,070
Please let Xue talk fast

313
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,790
so that the parents' meeting will end soon.

314
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,030
Thank you.

315
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,790
Thank you.

316
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,710
Be fast. Be fast. Be fast.

317
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,790
Is that necessary?

318
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,030
You only did a bad job in one exam.

319
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,670
Besides, you didn't rank the last.

320
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,550
If your dad really knows it,

321
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,190
just get scolded by him and apologize, and it'll be over.

322
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,310
No.

323
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,510
You know what?

324
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,430
My dad looks very fierce when he gets angry.

325
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,190
Jiang Juanjuan!

326
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,710
With your gardes like these,

327
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,630
do you deserve my efforts of bringing you up?

328
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,710
Don't even think about getting pocket money from me this month.

329
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,950
I don't care if he doesn't give me at ordinary times.

330
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,710
But this month, my idol will publish a limited-edition new book.

331
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,350
How can I buy it without money?

332
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,390
Although our grades this time

333
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,390
meet the expected goal,

334
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,350
it has something to do with the ranking of...

335
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,310
Hello.

336
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,950
Are you having a parents' meeting?

337
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,510
Yes. Who are you?

338
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,670
I'm Jiang Juanjuan's father.

339
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,310
Sorry.

340
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,510
I'm late.

341
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,710
It's okay. Take a seat.

342
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,750
Over there.

343
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,350
That seat.

344
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,070
Okay.

345
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,030
Okay. Thank you.

346
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,830
Don't cry.

347
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,550
How much is it?

348
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,350
I'll buy it for you.

349
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,990
200 yuan?

350
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,030
Just go on crying.

351
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,030
Go on crying.

352
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,230
You'll feel better after you finish crying.

353
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,830
Just cry. Go on crying.

354
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,910
You should worry about yourself.

355
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,750
You'll be the one who should cry after the parents' meeting.

356
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,310
No. Why should I worry?

357
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,790
My godmother will surely put in a good word for me.

358
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,350
Little Rabbit,

359
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,510
it doesn't matter if you did a bad job in an exam once or twice.

360
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,030
You're so smart and cute.

361
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:26,030
Maybe you'll get enlightened one day.

362
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,390
It's your turn.

363
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,670
My mom will probably be like this.

364
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,670
Han.

365
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,070
Dose my dress look good today?

366
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,750
I didn't embarrass you, did I?

367
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,390
Today, I talked with

368
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,670
the parents and your classmates at school all afternoon.

369
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,350
I'm so tired.

370
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,270
You're so good at acting.

371
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,550
Of course.

372
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,430
I can do well in all these three fields of movies, TV dramas and music.

373
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,510
I'm an all-rounder.

374
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,910
Then write a song yourself.

375
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,390
I'll think about it. I've been busy lately.

376
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,470
We can't improve our ability if we don't learn.

377
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,470
We can't make achievements if we don't have any aspiration.

378
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:22,950
As long as you firmly stick to your goal

379
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,109
and work hard,

380
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,829
You'll gain something eventually.

381
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,910
Why did you suddenly recite a passage from our textbook?

382
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,710
No.

383
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,390
Aren't we imitating the way how our parents talk?

384
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,070
That's how my dad talks.

385
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,910
Yes, yes, yes.

386
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,910
Jia Siwen's father is a professor in college.

387
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,790
He must quote passages from classics when he talks.

388
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,830
Ling Chao,

389
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,670
it's your turn.

390
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,350
Let me play the opposite role for you. Come on.

391
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,430
How was the parents' meeting today?

392
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,430
Start acting.

393
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,710
You must be tired.

394
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,230
Honey.

395
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,270
Expressionless acting skills.

396
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,310
Who can sense that you are imitating the way how your dad smokes?

397
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,350
Did you sense it or not?

398
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,390
Xiao Haishan.

399
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,430
Can you turn down the TV a bit?

400
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,750
Can't you see that we're talking about serious business?

401
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,310
Okay.

402
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,430
Let's continue. Ignore him.

403
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,470
Yin Zihan's mother

404
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,710
is so unreliable.

405
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,790
If our Little Rabbit

406
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,470
is entrusted to her in the future,

407
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,750
I won't be able to rest assured.

408
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,510
Right.

409
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,910
People always say that marriage is a matter of two families.

410
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,230
We should be careful.

411
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,950
What should we do now?

412
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,030
How come you're talking about marriage?

413
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,030
They are still kids.

414
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,430
I think Yin Zihan

415
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,950
has evil intentions towards our Little Rabbit.

416
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,030
Our Little Rabbit is so innocent that

417
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,510
she treats him as a friend.

418
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,550
In the future,

419
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,790
after they're with each other for a long time

420
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,110
and fall in love with each other,

421
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,390
what should we do?

422
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,670
Right.

423
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,750
Girls tend to suffer losses more easily in love.

424
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,030
We must prepare for it in advance this time.

425
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,150
Let's figure out a way at once.

426
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,830
I've thought about it carefully.

427
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,830
If you and Xiao don't despise us,

428
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,310
just let Xiao Tu marry into our family.

429
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,070
After all, I watched her grow up.

430
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,470
I treat her as my own daughter.

431
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,550
I won't give her a hard time.

432
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,670
Okay.

433
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,150
However, Little Rabbit will have to condescend to

434
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,870
get married with Ling Chao who is not quite perfect.

435
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,270
How can you say that?

436
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,630
Why?

437
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,750
Rabbits don't eat grass by their nest.

438
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,910
What era is it now?

439
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,950
Why did you say that?

440
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,630
We two families know each other well.

441
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,550
It's lucky for us to have this chance.

442
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,430
Yes.

443
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,910
Wenhui is right.

444
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,150
Chao is so outstanding.

445
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,230
I also like Chao very much.

446
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,390
If he can be my son-in-law,

447
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,390
our Little Rabbit

448
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,470
will be a very lucky girl.

449
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,390
Then it's easy to deal with this.

450
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,390
Then let's get Little Rabbit and Ling Chao together.

451
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,190
Okay.

452
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,430
I agree. I agree.

453
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,310
Ling Bo, what do you think?

454
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,030
I...

455
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,190
I think it makes sense.

456
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,750
For the things between these two kids,

457
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,430
no matter how much we say, it'll be useless.

458
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,550
Let them handle the things by themselves.

459
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,150
How can we neglect

460
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,110
the things about our kids?

461
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,110
Besides,

462
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,230
our Little Rabbit is so innocent and kind.

463
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,590
What if she's tricked by Yin Zihan?

464
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,750
Ling Chao

465
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,430
is just a blockhead.

466
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,750
What does he know?

467
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,350
If he takes this step wrongly,

468
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,150
what should we do?

469
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:30,990
It's okay.

470
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,550
-I feel very worried. -I know.

471
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,670
Wenhui.

472
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,030
Calm down. It won't happen.

473
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,110
We'll listen to you.

474
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,150
Right.

475
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,070
It's settled then.

476
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,510
No. What do you mean by saying that it's settled?

477
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,230
The kids are still young.

478
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,310
Shut up!

479
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,790
If my silly daughter marries a smart man,

480
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,750
she'll be cheated sooner or later, won't she?

481
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,990
These are all the posters in the store.

482
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,830
If it's not enough,

483
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,870
let's go to another store after school to buy more.

484
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,270
This is the new flavor.

485
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,030
I think it looks delicious. Taste it.

486
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,470
Well,

487
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,830
drink this.

488
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,510
I call it Happy Water.

489
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,070
Every time when I finish drinking it, I'll be in a good mood.

490
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,950
It's useless.

491
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,750
I feel extremely disappointed now.

492
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,310
My dad threw away all my idol's posters.

493
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:42,790
My pocket money was deducted.

494
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,310
My mobile phone was confiscated, too.

495
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,430
I will never be happy again.

496
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,550
Just think of it as a way to avoid disasters by losing money.

497
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,390
Trust me.

498
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,550
There will be a very good thing waiting for you later.

499
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,310
Jiang Juanjuan.

500
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,790
Mr. Xue wants you to go to the office.

501
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,230
Sir.

502
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:14,990
Come in.

503
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,870
You're here.

504
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,190
I have good news for you.

505
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,070
Are you looking forward to it?

506
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,070
For an exam,

507
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,190
if you don't give it a try,

508
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,070
you'll never know where your bottom line is.

509
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,670
Now the good news is that

510
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:34,350
you'll have a lot of room to improve in the next monthly exam.

511
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,030
As long as you work a little harder,

512
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,230
you'll have a chance to win the tile of Star of Progress

513
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,510
and be listed in the Honor Roll.

514
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,630
The network has been cut.

515
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,830
I can't even see the latest handsome photos of my idol.

516
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,790
What's the use of being listed in the Honor Roll?

517
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,470
Your dad is angry because of you.

518
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,270
You can't lie to him so arbitrarily

519
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,710
just because you're his biological daughter.

520
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,830
If your idol lip-synchs in his concert,

521
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,950
won't you be angry?

522
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,150
How is that possible?

523
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,750
My idol is an all-rounder and works very hard.

524
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,390
He can sing so well.

525
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:02,230
It's impossible that he would lip-synch.

526
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,070
That's not the point.

527
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:07,390
Actually, the adults don't object to your being a fan of your idol.

528
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,470
We just hope that you can

529
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,190
arrange your time appropriately.

530
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,110
After all, the college entrance exam

531
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,910
is the most important thing for you now.

532
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,390
Think about it.

533
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,990
I also know that your idol

534
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,870
has some advantages.

535
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,510
For example, he can sing well

536
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,710
and works hard to pursue his dream.

537
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,710
These are the things which are worth your learning.

538
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,190
Sir,

539
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,670
it's not that complicated.

540
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,630
I just like handsome guys.

541
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,590
Well... That's right.

542
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,150
Your idol is so handsome.

543
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,870
If you can't even be admitted into a decent university,

544
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,070
how embarrassed he'll feel.

545
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,310
That makes sense.

546
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,110
I understand, Mr. Xue.

547
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,830
It turns out you're teaching me how to date.

548
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,430
You...

549
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,230
What are you talking about?

550
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,910
I just hope that you can study hard

551
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,430
and you won't run away when you meet a problem.

552
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,630
I got it.

553
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,670
Mr. Xue.

554
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,910
Don't worry.

555
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,430
I've told you everything I should say.

556
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,430
Go back and think about it.

557
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,110
Wait.

558
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,790
Where can we see

559
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,910
the photos of your idol?

560
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,910
Do you need my help?

561
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,310
Really?

562
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:10,110
One paper and one photo.

563
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,550
You're hesitating just because of this?

564
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,510
It seems that your love for your idol

565
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,990
is just a tongue-in-cheek remark.

566
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,190
Don't forget to talk to your dad carefully.

567
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,550
Who bought it?

568
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,430
You bought it?

569
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,390
It's for you.

570
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,550
You bought it?

571
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,110
It was not that hard to buy it.

572
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,830
A new star is on the cover of this issue.

573
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,870
Everyone said that he spent money so that he could be on the cover.

574
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,030
Therefore, there were not many people who bought it.

575
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,430
You don't like it?

576
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:52,630
I like it.

577
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,790
Let's keep it for the time being.

578
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,830
He's the leading actor in the drama "The Rabbit Overwhelmed the Grass by Its Nest",

579
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,110
and it will be broadcast soon.

580
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,190
When he becomes popular,

581
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,990
it'll be hard for us to buy his peripheral products.

582
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,190
Forget it.

583
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,830
He won't understand even if I tell him.

584
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,710
Who said that?

585
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,230
You're a fan, too?

586
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,030
I like Wenjun's "Small Fossette".

587
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,070
Wenjun doesn't have a small fossette.

588
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,750
It's Junhui who has a fossette.

589
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,990
I'm talking about that song.

590
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,350
Song?

591
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,310
Well,

592
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,230
Small fossette, long eyelashes.

593
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,990
That's "Small Dimple".

594
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,670
That's JJ Lin's song.

595
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,990
Xiao Tu.

596
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,310
Come out.

597
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,790
I have a surprise for you.

598
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,590
Is it a full set of exam papers?

599
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,510
Look.

600
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,390
Am I such an uncreative person?

601
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,750
Wenjun's new book?

602
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,350
What do you think?

603
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,150
Do you feel surprised?

604
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,230
Do you feel shocked?

605
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,550
Don't be too touched.

606
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,710
I just hope that

607
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,270
you can get positive energy from this idol's book

608
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,630
so that you'll work hard, stick to it and study hard.

609
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,510
But Mr. Xue,

610
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,510
I like Junhui.

611
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,590
Jun... Junhui?

612
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,470
Well, not Wenjun?

613
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,630
Xiao Tu is so unreliable.

614
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,630
How could she make a mistake about this?

615
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,150
I... Sir,

616
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,110
I used to like Wenjun,

617
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,230
but I started to like a different idol a long time ago.

618
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:46,710
After all, Wenjun will be out of fashion soon.

619
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,670
Junhui is the most popular star now.

620
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,430
How could Wenjun be out of fashion?

621
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,030
It's hard to buy his books.

622
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,790
He only has those several songs,

623
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,310
and he has sung them over and over again,

624
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,590
unlike Junhui,

625
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,830
who can both sing and dance.

626
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,950
Most importantly, he's more handsome than Wenjun.

627
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,830
I think Wenjun is good.

628
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,110
When he sings, his breathing is stable.

629
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,550
He's also a good-looking boy.

630
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,270
Don't you think

631
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,950
I look a bit like him?

632
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,270
Sir,

633
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,350
I appreciate your kindness.

634
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,750
I'll leave this book to you.

635
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,710
I think you like Wenjun more than I do.

636
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,310
If you want to join Wenjun's fan club,

637
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,390
I can ask them for you.

638
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,750
After all, I used to be the administrator of Wenjun's Post Bar.

639
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,990
Well, well... No need.

640
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,190
No need?

641
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,750
No need.

642
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,430
You're a fake fan.

643
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,030
I have to go.

644
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,150
Just go back.

645
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,350
Thank you, Mr. Xue.

646
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,750
No wonder

647
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,070
Ling Chao's mother

648
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,470
came to attend the parents’ meeting for Xiao Tu.

649
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,870
Guess what?

650
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,350
Ling Chao is Xiao Tu's half-brother with the same father and a different mother.

651
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,670
Ling Chao's mother is Xiao Tu's stepmother.

652
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,710
Have you heard this?

653
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,430
Xiao Tu is a child bride in Ling Chao's family.

654
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,390
How come I heard that Xiao Tu's family owed a lot of money

655
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,310
and they had no choice

656
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,950
but to mortgage Xiao Tu to Ling Chao's family?

657
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,470
Why is she so lucky?

658
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,350
Maybe not.

659
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,030
Who knows whether Ling Chao will bully her or not?

660
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,030
How come Xiao Tu is someone like this?

661
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,990
Wasn't she very close to Yin Zihan previously?

662
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,190
One is a rich boy,

663
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,390
and the other is a talented boy.

664
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,190
If I were her,

665
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,350
I would also think it was hard to make a choice.

666
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,470
Forget it.

667
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,910
Xiao Tu is not a child bride.

668
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,190
She's just close to Ling Chao's family.

669
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,390
Besides,

670
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,190
Xiao Tu is usually the one who bullies Ling Chao.

671
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,270
Ling Chao is a nice guy and he doesn't blame her.

672
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,070
Nonsense.

673
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,230
Look.

674
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,830
You said you wanted to surpass Ling Chao.

675
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,110
What's the result now?

676
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,590
Mr. Xue.

677
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,470
That's not true.

678
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,390
Alright, alright.

679
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,310
I suggest you to focus on your study.

680
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,270
Only after you become a truly strong man

681
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,030
can you surpass him in every apsect.

682
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,350
How about this?

683
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,950
After you're admitted into college,

684
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,270
I'll tell you the secret of success.

685
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,630
I'll teach you how to successfully chase the girl you like.

686
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,110
Mr. Xue.

687
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,910
You've succeeded?

688
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,150
It's a secret.

689
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,990
That girl with a braid.

690
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,910
It's said that she got two outstanding boyfriends.

691
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:20,790
Xiao Tu.

692
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,550
What are you doing?

693
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,270
What?

694
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,590
I'm leaving.

695
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,350
I called your name. Why did you avoid me?

696
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,030
Nonsense.

697
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,390
There are so many people gossiping about us.

698
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,630
We must avoid suspicion.

699
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,030
People once gossiped that you and Yin Zihan were lovers.

700
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,150
I didn't see you avoid suspicion at that time.

701
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,310
All those rumors are not true.

702
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,190
So the rumor about you and me is true?

703
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,310
Of course not.

704
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,190
Then it's fine.

705
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,750
Besides,

706
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,190
you even called me husband.

707
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,310
You're afraid of the gossip that we're lovers?

708
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,710
Stop looking. Come and help me walk.

709
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,070
What happened to your foot?

710
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,190
Nothing.

711
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:12,790
I bought new shoes.

712
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,350
I'm afraid they'll get wrinkles too soon.

713
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,070
So you walked like this all day long?

714
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,110
I changed into another pair of shoes when I got to the classroom.

715
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,670
What?

716
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,070
While you're walking like this, you look like

717
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,790
Cinderella's sister whose feet were cut.

718
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,670
Stop laughing.

719
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,750
Help me walk steadily.

720
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,350
Chao, don't be angry.

721
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,950
I didn't do it on purpose.

722
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,070
I'll give you this little turtle as the compensation.

723
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,670
Don't ignore me.

724
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,110
My mom said this turtle can live long.

725
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,550
It can be with you forever.

726
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,070
It can live long. How long is it?

727
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,030
My mom said it could live till the day when I got married.

728
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,790
Liar.

729
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:05,390
This kind of turtle can't live for 100 years.
