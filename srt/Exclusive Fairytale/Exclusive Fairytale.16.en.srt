1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,590
-Godmother. -Baby.

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,350
-I miss you so much. -I miss you too.

4
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,830
Let's go.

5
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,750
Where are my parents?

6
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:09,870
They went for a checkup.

7
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,870
Why didn't you go?

8
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,590
Our department had a checkup last week.

9
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,670
Everything is fine for me.

10
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,870
Then I'm relieved.

11
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,910
Hello, Grandma.

12
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,110
Hello.

13
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,310
Hello.

14
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,830
Whatever. Let's go.

15
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,789
Young man.

16
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,350
You're a son-in-law, right?

17
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,190
Me too.

18
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,910
Life

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,190
is hard.

20
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,229
Rabbit.

21
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,870
You must be tired after sitting in the car for a whole day.

22
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,310
Go watch TV in the living room.

23
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,350
I'm not tired.

24
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,950
Godmother, why do you always treat me like a child?

25
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,910
I can do this. It's not a big deal.

26
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:48,830
My baby.

27
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,870
You are a child.

28
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,990
Mom.

29
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:53,509
Take a break.

30
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,430
Let me help her.

31
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,430
Okay, I'll go.

32
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,229
I'll leave this place to you two.

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,110
You'd better stand aside

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,950
in case blood splatters on you.

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,150
I've never seen you in that shirt.

36
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,950
Which one?

37
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,310
It's the one on your birthday…

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,870
I know.

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,030
Are you that kind of person

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,150
who doesn't cherish it when they get it?

41
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,310
Who knows?

42
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,590
I don't know.

43
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,550
How about

44
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,950
let me get you first?

45
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,990
I...

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,950
Damn you!

47
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,750
This is aired every winter and summer vacation.

48
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,350
I even memorized the lines.

49
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,270
Left hand or right hand?

50
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,670
Right hand.

51
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,390
Are you tricking me?

52
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,430
Your dad and I have something to ask you.

53
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:19,110
You mean

54
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,990
you like Rabbit?

55
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,550
Yes.

56
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,270
What kind of feelings?

57
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,750
I want to raise a family with her.

58
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,750
Well.

59
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,990
Does Rabbit like you?

60
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,550
Right.

61
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:38,230
This is more important.

62
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,310
Probably.

63
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,070
What does it mean by "probably"?

64
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,750
Have you confessed your love?

65
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,590
Not yet.

66
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,110
When are you going to confess to her?

67
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,870
My daughter-in-law may run away.

68
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,110
He's so slow.

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,550
I'm so worried.

70
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,070
Mom.

71
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,990
Don't you think I'm not good enough for Xiao Tu?

72
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,390
Really?

73
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,430
It's normal.

74
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,270
Rabbit is so cute.

75
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,270
You only bully her.

76
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,630
Besides,

77
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,350
your personality is weird

78
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,550
and unlikeable.

79
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,150
I don't know who you take after.

80
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,269
The biggest regret

81
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,550
for me

82
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,230
is that I don't have a daughter.

83
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,029
So,

84
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,510
I always treat Rabbit as my daughter.

85
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,030
In the past, they were young,

86
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,630
so I didn't think about that.

87
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,830
But that day,

88
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,830
when that boy came to our house for dinner.

89
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,830
It was Yin...

90
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,750
Yin Zihan.

91
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,510
Yes, that was him.

92
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,790
She brought a boy back.

93
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,750
It felt like I'm losing her.

94
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,030
Also,

95
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,750
I met

96
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,630
Yin's mother

97
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,830
when I went to the parent-teacher conference for Rabbit.

98
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,470
She looked unreliable.

99
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,110
I can't imagine

100
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,830
Rabbit marring into their family in the future.

101
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,430
Right.

102
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,590
Your mother is right.

103
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,270
If Rabbit really gets married,

104
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,270
she won't come to our house often.

105
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,630
I'll also feel quite lonely.

106
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,790
Ling Chao, let me tell you.

107
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,750
You can do anything you want.

108
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,870
Be thick-skinned

109
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,150
and thoughtful.

110
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,350
If you can't do it,

111
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,790
you can even cry and make a scene.

112
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,510
I don't care.

113
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,910
You must marry Rabbit.

114
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:19,630
I'll try my best.

115
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,310
Go back first.

116
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,470
If you need anything,

117
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,870
just let us know.

118
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,070
Okay.

119
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,310
Don't worry.

120
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,990
I can do it.

121
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,630
Can he really do it?

122
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:00,870
Hello.

123
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,950
Hello.

124
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,590
Yin Zihan.

125
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,670
What time is it now?

126
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,510
Don't you know I'm suffering from jet lag?

127
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,430
It's nine o'clock.

128
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,470
What's the matter?

129
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,030
Nothing.

130
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,630
Please thank your mother for me.

131
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,710
Good night.

132
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,310
Ling Chao, are you crazy?

133
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,310
You bought so many things.

134
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,110
This is the special tea from Yunhai.

135
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,990
The local students said it's very good.

136
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:35,470
Okay.

137
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,310
Okay.

138
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,470
This is dried fruit.

139
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,070
It's a good snack while you're watching dramas.

140
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:42,790
Try it.

141
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,270
And this is the sweet potato.

142
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,070
I've been feeling cold

143
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,310
around my neck lately.

144
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,110
Let me find something to wrap it up.

145
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,870
This…

146
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,030
A scarf, right?

147
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,909
Let me find it for you.

148
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,830
A scarf.

149
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,030
-Is there any? -Sure, I must have one.

150
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,870
This.

151
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,710
It's my first time knitting.

152
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,030
I saw my classmates knitting.

153
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,030
It doesn't look good.

154
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,790
Why did you knit?

155
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,750
It's tiring.

156
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,910
It's well knitted.

157
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,950
This is so fashionable.

158
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,030
Yes, it is.

159
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,110
They're designed to be ripped

160
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,350
for the ones being sold in the mall.

161
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,870
Yours is much better than that.

162
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,030
Put it on.

163
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,790
Who do your classmates

164
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,790
knit scarfs for?

165
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,550
Their boyfriends.

166
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,710
That means

167
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,950
there must a lot of girls in your class who are dating.

168
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,670
Yes, there are a few.

169
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,990
I'm not sure about that.

170
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,670
Is there any boy

171
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,830
interested in our Rabbit?

172
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,390
Mom.

173
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,270
Are you asking if I'm in a relationship?

174
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,190
Can't I ask?

175
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,950
I'm just caring about you.

176
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,830
No.

177
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,830
It's not that I don't want you to date, right?

178
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,550
You're in college now.

179
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,830
I mean

180
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,150
you are likely to go back to Yidong after graduating.

181
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,030
If you find someone who lives too far away,

182
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,270
you'll be married far away, right?

183
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,910
Yes.

184
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,750
You won't marry far away, right?

185
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,590
We don't want you to marry far away.

186
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,310
Right.

187
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,270
That means

188
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,230
I can find someone from our hometown?

189
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,070
Yeah, it's great to date someone from the same place.

190
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,150
You'll know each other well.

191
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,990
So you mean

192
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,310
you've already found someone from our hometown?

193
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,790
What does he look like?

194
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,790
Do you have a photo?

195
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:23,310
Right.

196
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,950
No, I haven't.

197
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,470
I've asked around.

198
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,110
Later,

199
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,309
Wenhui will come out

200
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,429
through the staff exit at the west gate.

201
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,870
We'll wait for him there then.

202
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:44,350
Okay.

203
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,990
I've contacted a driver.

204
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,230
Once he comes out,

205
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,390
we can catch up immediately.

206
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,790
Great!

207
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,790
Are you

208
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,870
going to follow his car?

209
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,750
None of your business.

210
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,750
If you like him, you can get close to him,

211
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,070
but don't stalk him.

212
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,270
You'll only make him uncomfortable.

213
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,510
What do you know?

214
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,030
We don't simply like him.

215
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,270
This is love.

216
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,590
Shouldn't you care more about him if you love him?

217
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,910
This stage is for his fans.

218
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,790
His life is for himself.

219
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,670
Don't hurt him

220
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,830
in the name of loving him.

221
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,870
Besides, it's dangerous to follow a car.

222
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,110
What if an accident occurs?

223
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,150
Who do you think you are?

224
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,510
How dare you lecture us here?

225
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,310
I'm also a fan of Wenhui.

226
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,670
You guys look about my age.

227
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,630
You should be able to tell right from wrong.

228
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,230
Can you be a rational fan?

229
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,790
It's none of your business.

230
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,510
Are you crazy?

231
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,230
It's none of your business. Watch your mouth.

232
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,870
You can't fight.

233
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,510
The idol has to pay for what his fans do.

234
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,950
I can't let my idol suffer this

235
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,630
because of me.

236
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,990
Are you okay?

237
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,350
I'm okay.

238
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,990
Luckily you showed up in time.

239
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,390
Why are you here?

240
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,630
I was buying glasses there.

241
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,150
I saw this poster.

242
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,590
I knew you've been fangirling him lately.

243
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,630
So I noticed it.

244
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,190
I didn't expect they…

245
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,070
Buying glasses?

246
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,230
Where are your glasses?

247
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:59,030
I ran too fast.

248
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,790
I lost it.

249
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,790
It's okay.

250
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,790
You look good without glasses.

251
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,670
You can also try contact lenses.

252
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,750
The one my idol endorsed.

253
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,750
Is it cold?

254
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,310
A little.

255
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,550
If he says we should go back,

256
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,870
I'll turn against him now.

257
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,070
Hair.

258
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:02,630
No.

259
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,670
I mean you're pressing my hair.

260
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:38,990
All right.

261
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,710
This darn sweetness.

262
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,550
Honey.

263
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,790
Come to me.

264
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,350
You're so sweet.

265
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,750
I've read your proposal.

266
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,230
It's well written.

267
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,550
Just minor changes

268
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,590
are needed.

269
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,230
Okay.

270
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,150
It's okay.

271
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,430
Answer it if you want.

272
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,710
What is it?

273
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,950
Are you still busy?

274
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,790
Let's have dinner together tonight.

275
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,990
Why do you always think about eating?

276
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,790
I'm in a meeting. I'm busy.

277
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,510
Another meeting for that seminar?

278
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,670
It's a psychological health seminar.

279
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,350
Not a random seminar.

280
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,630
They did a great job last year.

281
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,150
This year, the Psychology Department

282
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,910
got enough funds

283
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,190
to co-organize with our News Department.

284
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,150
I'm in charge of a handful of projects.

285
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,270
I also need to train the newcomers.

286
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,230
I'm busy.

287
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,990
Will you gain any credits for this?

288
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:27,910
I think so.

289
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,270
After all, I'm the person in charge.

290
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,350
Fine.

291
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,790
I forgave you.

292
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,030
Talk to you later.

293
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,870
Bye.

294
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,590
I've changed this code several times.

295
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,070
There's still a bug.

296
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,310
Master, please help me.

297
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,230
Master.

298
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,150
You're a pervert.

299
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,870
It just came to me

300
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,590
that there's a competition in Lin City next month.

301
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,470
We need to pick two people.

302
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,470
One is decided, Sun.

303
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,430
The other hasn't been decided yet.

304
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,150
Are you going?

305
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,990
I'm not interested.

306
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,110
If you don't go,

307
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,710
I guess it'll be Jianghu.

308
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,830
Let's double check it.

309
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,550
One second.

310
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,030
What is this?

311
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,030
What's wrong?

312
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,630
I think it got a virus.

313
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,230
Don't worry. Let me see.

314
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,150
What should we do? Can it be restored?

315
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,430
Looks like it can't be fixed.

316
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,030
Fortunately, we have enough time.

317
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,390
We can rewrite it.

318
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,470
Ling Chao, you're dead meat.

319
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,470
We both study Computer Science.

320
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,230
Why can't he do something serious?

321
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,790
What?

322
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,190
It's okay. Take your time. I'll accompany you.

323
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,030
Can you find the first draft?

324
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,790
I don't know where it is.

325
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,430
Let me do it.

326
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,350
My rehearsal is over.

327
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:43,990
Come over.

328
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,110
Let's have milk tea.

329
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,910
Come on.

330
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,390
Have you

331
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,510
prepared well today?

332
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,670
Almost. Almost.

333
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,910
Will there be any problems tomorrow?

334
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,790
No.

335
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:55,910
Don't worry, Senior.

336
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,230
Even if the whole school is out of power tomorrow,

337
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,750
I'll get a generator

338
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,630
to complete this event successfully.

339
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,310
Okay.

340
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,670
Let's call it a day.

341
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,750
Thank you, everyone.

342
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,910
Go back and rest.

343
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:08,910
Okay.

344
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,510
Xiao Tu, you stay for a while.

345
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,470
Let's check the manuscript.

346
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,430
Okay.

347
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,670
Dali.

348
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,230
It's too noisy outside.

349
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,710
Close the door when you go out.

350
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,750
Okay.

351
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,349
Senior.

352
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,230
Should we start from the beginning

353
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,310
or the interview part?

354
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,910
What's the rush?

355
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,670
Are you in a hurry?

356
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,430
I am in a hurry.

357
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,590
I have an appointment.

358
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,310
An appointment?

359
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,950
Is it

360
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,790
Ling Chao?

361
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,310
No, no.

362
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,950
You're so funny.

363
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,590
You're with me,

364
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,110
but you always want to get involved with others.

365
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,430
Stop pretending to be surprised.

366
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,350
I know

367
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,830
you like me.

368
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,550
I knew it

369
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,550
when you asked me for my number.

370
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,870
You can't fool people with your eyes.

371
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,750
Do you misunderstand?

372
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,030
I'm slow-witted sometimes.

373
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,830
I'll apologize to you

374
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,150
if I did something to mislead you.

375
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,870
You know,

376
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,030
many girls like me.

377
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,750
In the past,

378
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,590
you

379
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,270
were really not my type.

380
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,550
Now there are just two of us.

381
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,950
My patience is limited.

382
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,390
Stop playing

383
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,310
hard to get.

384
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,710
I really don't like you.

385
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,430
I just see you as my senior.

386
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,430
Hello?

387
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:02,910
Something happened.

388
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,110
Something happened.

389
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,070
You really don't like me?

390
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,950
Why did you ask me for my phone number?

391
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,270
I've explained it many times.

392
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,910
I lost a game.

393
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:16,830
I don't believe it.

394
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,190
Are you mad at me

395
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,430
because you're shy

396
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,870
after I said

397
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,270
what's in your mind?

398
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,990
I'm gonna go.

399
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,230
If you leave,

400
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,550
I'll take this

401
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,190
as you giving up on credits for this event.

402
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,070
Senior, what's wrong?

403
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,870
What took you so long?

404
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,070
I was bullied by the book.

405
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,350
My fingers got cut

406
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,150
and are bleeding.

407
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,110
Ridiculous.

408
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,350
How dare you say that?

409
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,590
What if

410
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,950
Madam was bullied by something,

411
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,950
then…

412
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,510
Who can bully her?

413
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,550
It's good that she doesn't bully others.

414
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,750
Suck it yourself.

415
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,550
Hey.

416
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,750
Think it over.

417
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,950
Are you

418
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,190
controlling yourself?

419
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,310
I know.

420
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,750
You can't control yourself

421
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,430
when you fall in love with someone.

422
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,390
If you don't like me,

423
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,430
why did you raise your hand

424
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,550
to sign up for this seminar?

425
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,630
I wasn't mean to raise my hand. It was really an accident.

426
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,550
Accident?

427
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,870
Every time you saw me,

428
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,910
you smiled so shyly.

429
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,990
Do you still want to deny that you like me?

430
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,830
Shy?

431
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,350
I smiled because I like to smile.

432
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,790
What does it have to do with being shy?

433
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,030
Then why did you treat me to dinner

434
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,630
and let me be your model?

435
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,390
Why did you give me hints

436
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,150
to tempt me to respond

437
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,030
every time you showed up in front of me?

438
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,270
Senior.

439
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,230
Don't you think too much?

440
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,790
Do you think you're excellent

441
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,430
and every woman should like you?

442
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,670
Isn't it reasonable

443
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,590
for someone to like me?

444
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,190
Don't be shy.

445
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,270
I know.

446
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,110
Are you the scumbag from the Computer Department

447
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,070
in that post?

448
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,510
Yes.

449
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,670
Since you've found out,

450
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,950
can you be more honest?

451
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:48,990
Who is it?

452
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,390
Are you okay?

453
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,190
Let's go.

454
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,150
Hold on.

455
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,510
Let's go.

456
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,830
When did you become so smart?

457
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,070
Take a guess.

458
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,310
I want to be as manly as my master,

459
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,830
so that girls would like me.

460
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,070
Look at my spin kick.

461
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,190
Ling Chao.

462
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:08,510
What are you doing?

463
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,870
Why did the other candidate on the competition list

464
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,110
become you?

465
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,630
Didn't you say you weren't going?

466
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,150
I suddenly wanted to join.

467
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,790
You...

468
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,790
What?

469
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,110
What?

470
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,790
What do you mean by the other candidate changed into Master?

471
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,990
There was only me

472
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,670
on the list.

473
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,350
You were just a spare.

474
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,110
Ling Chao.

475
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,350
Have you gone too far?

476
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,670
Revealing the disgusting truth of the Prince Charming from the Computer Department.

477
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:36,350
We are all in the same department.

478
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,030
Do you really think we are stupid?

479
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,830
Haven't we already found

480
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,990
the IP address of the poster

481
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,110
and not made it public?

482
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,110
The first time, you framed me.

483
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,630
The second time, you harassed Xiao Tu.

484
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,670
You can try the third time.

485
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,750
I suggest

486
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,870
you behave yourself until you graduate.

487
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,430
Don't hurt other girls anymore.

488
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,550
Otherwise, I'll report you.

489
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,430
Ling Chao.

490
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,310
You won.

491
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,310
Let's go.

492
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,910
Sha.

493
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,390
Don't you think

494
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,510
you looked so cool just now?

495
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,950
But I'm on duty today.

496
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,950
I'm on duty. I...

497
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,310
Master, check this post out.

498
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,830
Come on.

499
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,670
We grew up together.

500
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,630
We are kind of like childhood sweethearts to each other.

501
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,110
Ever since you said I like him last time,

502
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,070
I've been confused.

503
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,150
I'm nervous and shy.

504
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,270
I think I've fallen in love with him.

505
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,670
You've been working hard lately.

506
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,110
Eat more.

507
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,110
It's nutritious.

508
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,710
There are only two of us. You ordered too much.

509
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,270
What a waste.

510
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,670
Of course not.

511
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,470
If we can't finish them, we can pack the leftovers

512
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,990
and share them with my roommates.

513
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,350
Thank you.

514
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,110
I haven't seen you eat like this for a long time.

515
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,510
You kept busy recently

516
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,470
every time I asked you out.

517
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,550
I won't go to that seminar anymore.

518
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,670
Whoever wants to go can go.

519
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,310
That scoundrel threatened me with credits.

520
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,590
I don't need it.

521
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,310
From now on,

522
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,030
I'll be free.

523
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,950
I have to eat three bowls of rice every day.

524
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,950
Eat more.

525
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,270
Take your time.

526
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,070
Don't be so excited while you're eating.

527
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,630
If you're not busy,

528
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,950
do you want to go to the competition in Lin City with me?

529
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,790
Lin City?

530
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,590
Two days and one night.

531
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,270
Two days and one night.

532
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,510
Two days and one night.

533
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,310
Congratulations.

534
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,430
It must be exciting.

535
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,990
A strange city.

536
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,590
A hotel in the midnight.

537
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,910
Do you think

538
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,950
something strange would happen?

539
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,870
For example,

540
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,510
something like…

541
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:11,790
By the way,

542
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,470
don’t tell Xu Linglong.

543
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,870
If she tells her mom

544
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,870
and her mom tells my dad,

545
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,990
Ling Chao will be dead meat.

546
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,510
Hurry up.

547
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,350
Here.

548
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,750
Take this.

549
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,990
Take this.

550
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,350
And this.

551
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,510
Brush and stuff.

552
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,670
Bring more lipsticks.

553
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,070
I'll just stay there for one night.

554
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,750
That's too much.

555
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,470
It's not too much.

556
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,390
There you go.

557
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,950
Right.

558
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,110
It's friendly sponsorship

559
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,230
for your first date.

560
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,070
You rarely wear skirts.

561
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,230
Ling Chao must like it

562
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:54,950
if you wear this.

563
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,590
Let's meet in the hall

564
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,750
after we unpack

565
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,710
in our own room.

566
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,870
Let's go to the food street then.

567
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,910
Okay.

568
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,110
Let's go.

569
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,510
Did they forget

570
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
I'm also in the lift?

571
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,110
The sour smell of love

572
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,950
The sour smell of love.

573
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,510
It doesn't matter whether you dress up or not.

574
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,790
What matters is

575
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,470
I can't let my sisters down.

576
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,670
Does it look weird?

577
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,350
Hold on.

578
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,270
-I'll get changed. -No.

579
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,390
Don't.

580
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,190
It looks good.

581
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,230
Let's go.

582
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:14,950
Well...

583
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,030
Where's Wukong?

584
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,750
He said he's too tired.

585
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,710
He won't go.

586
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,790
Let's bring him some food

587
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,190
when we come back.

588
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,150
Let's go.

589
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,030
You are tired.

590
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,270
Your whole family is tired.

591
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,550
Do you really think I'm a monkey?

592
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,750
This is the best stinky tofu

593
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,310
in the universe.

594
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,110
Try it.

595
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,110
Try it.

596
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,390
Is it good?

597
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,430
Not bad.

598
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,310
Your clothes are dirty.

599
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,670
Your face...

600
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,870
I'm not blushing.

601
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,110
I mean

602
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,470
your face is dirty too.

603
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,550
Well, I'm full.

604
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,750
I bought some food for Wukong.

605
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,070
Let's go back.

606
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,830
Cushion foundation.

607
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,110
What is this?

608
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,430
This…

609
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,230
Ling Chao must like it

610
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,030
if you wear this.

611
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,630
Jiang Juanjuan.

612
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,550
Coming.

613
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,990
The electric kettle in our room is broken.

614
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,950
Can I use yours to boil some water?

615
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,790
You're so polite.

616
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,310
Come in.

617
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:05,110
Let me help you.

618
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,990
I can do it myself.

619
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:34,750
You're

620
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,350
a little different today.

621
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,670
Is it that obvious?

622
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,390
I can feel

623
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,590
that you put some effort into it.

624
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,190
Let me explain.

625
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,870
It's not mine.

626
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,550
It's really not mine.

627
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,390
Not mine.

628
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,630
Why didn't you dry your hair?

629
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,750
It's easy to catch a cold

630
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,750
in this season.

631
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,430
It's okay. I'm inside the room...

632
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,310
Don't move.

633
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:28,469
Itchy.

634
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,590
Ling Chao.

635
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,870
I must talk to you.

636
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:12,990
What?

637
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,470
We have a big competition tomorrow.

638
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,750
It's not good to be so tired

639
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,470
the night before the competition.

640
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,710
Go to sleep.

641
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,710
We'll win first place

642
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,830
when we wake up.
