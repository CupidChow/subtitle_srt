1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,470
What is your dream?

3
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,750
So cute.

4
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,110
Dad, let me take a photo for you.

5
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,110
This food is high in sugar,

6
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,270
and it can't make you get full.

7
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,270
I don't understand why you want to eat it.

8
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,470
Dad.

9
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,030
You've spoiled the fun.

10
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,070
The trip we had agreed on was cancelled.

11
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,830
You just wanted to comfort me by bringing me here

12
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,990
to eat some desserts.

13
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,509
But you also kept nagging all the time.

14
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,789
Alright, alright.

15
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,630
I'll stop nagging.

16
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,470
Where are you going?

17
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,950
I'm not leaving.

18
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,310
I'll go get some water.

19
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,590
Okay.

20
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,910
See you at the Garden Hotel

21
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,190
at 5 p.m. tomorrow.

22
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,190
Hello.

23
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:13,830
Juanjuan.

24
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,390
This is your stepmother.

25
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,710
This is your brother.

26
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,110
Call her sister.

27
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,390
Come on. Let's eat.

28
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,550
Here you are. Okay.

29
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:30,990
Chopsticks.

30
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,310
Where is Xiao Tu?

31
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,670
I don't know what is wrong with her again today.

32
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,590
As soon as she came back,

33
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,070
she hid herself in her room.

34
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,110
I asked her to eat,

35
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,150
but she said she had no appetite.

36
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,310
I'll go ask her to eat.

37
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
Time to eat.

38
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,750
I'm not hungry.

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,110
Not bad.

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,950
You've made progress.

41
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,630
You rank the fifth from the bottom.

42
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,670
Those four students who rank  behind you should be the ones crying.

43
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,270
Even if I rank the first,

44
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,790
I can't catch up with Ye Jun.

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,829
It might not be true.

46
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:26,910
Really?

47
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,270
I mean

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,310
it might not be true that you can rank the first.

49
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,950
Come and eat.

50
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,710
Okay.

51
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,070
Look at you.

52
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,270
Didn't you say that you had no appetite?

53
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,950
Only after I get full can I have the strength to study.

54
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,870
Where is Ling Chao?

55
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,230
In the bathroom.

56
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,110
He goes to the toilet when it's time to eat.

57
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,910
What kind of bad habit is that?

58
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,670
Disgusting.

59
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,150
Ye Jun sent me a message.

60
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,950
Just eat, Chao.

61
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,990
-Okay. -Ignore her.

62
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,630
Rabbit.

63
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,830
R-a-b-b-i-t.

64
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,790
Rabbit.

65
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,150
Grass.

66
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,909
Why does Xiao Tu suddenly work so hard?

67
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,830
Is she possessed?

68
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,470
Not all of a sudden.

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,670
Today is the eighth time

70
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,350
for her to study hard this month.

71
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,110
Eat more.

72
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,430
Then you can the strength to sutdy.

73
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,190
Don't disturb me.

74
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,550
I'm memorizing the English words.

75
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,430
Xiao Tu.

76
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,070
For this book of English words,

77
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,150
Jiang Juanjuan has memorized almost all the words in it by your side.

78
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,950
Why don't you get a new one which she has never read before?

79
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,470
What if Jiang Juanjuan is memorizing the words

80
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,870
and I learn them with her by her side?

81
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,870
Does it mean that I'll be the one who makes progress?

82
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,310
You've improved a lot, too.

83
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,310
I think as long as you go on studying hard,

84
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,150
there will no problem for you to rank the tenth from the bottom.

85
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,430
I'm serious this time.

86
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,750
Look.

87
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,430
Xiao Tu.

88
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:26,910
Look.

89
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,230
You'll be a student in the 12th grade soon.

90
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,510
I hope you can face the pressure and challenge with a positive attitude.

91
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,790
Is this a famous quote from a celebrity?

92
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,750
I don't think so.

93
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:35,950
I've never seen this before.

94
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,550
This is a message

95
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,270
which Ye Jun sent to me

96
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,750
in order to encourage me to study hard.

97
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,110
He gave me such a big encouragement.

98
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,030
I can't let him down.

99
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,390
Let me see.

100
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,470
Don't touch it.

101
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,950
You're eating and your hands are greasy.

102
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,470
So petty.

103
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,390
Why aren't you talking?

104
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,510
Eat more.

105
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,870
Here you are.

106
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,990
Come on, everyone.

107
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,630
Turn to Page 46.

108
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,710
In this class, we'll talk about the...

109
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,110
Where is Jiang Juanjuan?

110
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,190
Xiao Tu, where is she?

111
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,070
I don't know.

112
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,270
Xiao Tu.

113
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,670
I know you and Jiang Juanjuan

114
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,470
are very good friends,

115
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,390
and are very loyal to each other.

116
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,750
But Jiang Juanjuan hasn't been missing

117
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,830
for over half a day.

118
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,190
This is not a joke.

119
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,550
Sir, I'm not covering it up for her.

120
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,430
Mr. Xue.

121
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,190
Xiao Tu isn't lying.

122
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,310
The last time I saw her today

123
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,630
was during the lunch break.

124
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,470
After I delivered the homework to the office and went back,

125
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,470
she disappeared.

126
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,670
It was around 1:10 p.m.

127
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,790
to 1:17 p.m.

128
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:53,830
Usually at this time,

129
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,390
she would lie face down on her desk and rest,

130
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,790
or read the Celebrity Weekly secretly.

131
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,750
Celebrity Weekly?

132
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,670
She dares to read the Celebrity Weekly?

133
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,270
She...

134
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,870
Sir, that's not the point.

135
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,150
This is the point.

136
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,030
Today is the launch day for the latest issue

137
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,830
of Celebrity Weekly.

138
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,270
Not only did she not read the magazine secretly,

139
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,350
but also looked very depressed.

140
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,270
She didn't say more than six words today.

141
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,350
Okay. I got it.

142
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,110
You two should go back first.

143
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:13,830
If you have any news,

144
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,670
report it to me immediately.

145
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,550
Yes, Mr. Xue.

146
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,150
Go.

147
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,510
Jiang Juanjuan!

148
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,950
Jiang Juan...

149
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,630
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

150
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,790
A cup of milk tea.

151
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,510
Hello, Ling Chao.

152
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,990
Jiang Juanjuan's range of activity today

153
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,270
was mainly in the Middle Huaihai Road.

154
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,190
Isn't that near Jiang Juanjuan's home?

155
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,870
Yes.

156
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,950
According to the information,

157
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,630
she has been heading south

158
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,550
from Huaihai Park.

159
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,110
South? Which direction is south?

160
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,790
North at the top, south at the bottom, west on the left and east on the right.

161
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,669
-You can just directly... -This way.

162
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,309
This way.

163
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,030
Okay.

164
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,270
Jiang Juanjuan!

165
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,470
Watch out!

166
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,830
Why are you here?

167
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,470
I can't even distinguish the four directions.

168
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,790
I'm afraid I'll have to look for you too later.

169
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,830
I'm here.

170
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,830
She won't go missing.

171
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,470
Let's go.

172
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,550
He always says he is busy,

173
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,950
so he doesn't have time to take care of my mother and me.

174
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,990
He also said that he would find a way to make up for it

175
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,630
and try his best to give us a better life.

176
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,070
People always say that father's love is like a mountain.

177
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,870
Maybe father's love is so deep.

178
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,830
Who would have thought that

179
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,590
those are all his excuses.

180
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:12,950
Calm down.

181
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,190
Maybe it's not like what you think.

182
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,950
You don't have to explain for him.

183
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,710
I only blame myself for being useless.

184
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,910
Due to my bad performance in study,

185
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,430
he and my mother

186
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,390
always quarrel with each other because of me.

187
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,510
It leads to the ending today.

188
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,270
Don't belittle yourself.

189
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,910
This is what you told me before.

190
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,150
But I will never

191
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,310
let this bad woman who has ruined my family

192
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,870
have her way like this.

193
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,350
What?

194
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,430
This is their privacy.

195
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,670
We need to get some evidence for an affair like this, right?

196
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,150
She's so pretty.

197
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,190
Why are you here?

198
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,750
You're doing this so openly.

199
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,550
Yes.

200
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,590
I'll inform Mr. Xue.

201
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,510
Jiang,

202
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,830
though you're not young anymore,

203
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,230
you're still good at

204
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,710
all these tricks.

205
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,750
What are you talking about?

206
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,950
I'm doing this for you.

207
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,910
For me?

208
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,630
You let this woman join your family.

209
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,110
You said it was for me.

210
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,790
How could you talk to your father like that?

211
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,470
I don't have a father like you.

212
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,510
-You... -Mr Jiang.

213
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,670
Since your daughter doesn't understand,

214
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,630
just forget it.

215
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,070
Bao Bei, wait.

216
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,350
Let me deal with it.

217
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,110
Baby?

218
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,670
How dare you call her baby?

219
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,870
Okay.

220
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,590
Whom are you going to deal with?

221
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,310
How are you going to deal with this?

222
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,030
I finally found someone I like.

223
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,270
You scared her away.

224
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,150
Are you satisfied now?

225
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,190
How shameless!

226
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,590
Are you Mr. Jiang?

227
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,750
I have an appointment with you

228
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,870
to see you here at 6 p.m.

229
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,190
Would you please tell me whether we should continue the interview?

230
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,710
Interview?

231
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,910
Now people have to compete for the position of mistress?

232
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,790
Mistress?

233
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,550
What?

234
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,830
Do you want to say that he cheated you?

235
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,590
Shut up!

236
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,470
Listen to me.

237
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,230
How dare you do such a thing with the excuse of

238
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,270
looking for a tutor?

239
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,430
How dirty and disgusting!

240
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,070
Listen to me!

241
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,070
Listen to me.

242
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,910
Tutor?

243
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,910
Stop right there!

244
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,270
Something like this happened,

245
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,030
because I was negligent in disciplining you.

246
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,390
But you also have to reflect on yourself carefully.

247
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,110
Don't do it again.

248
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,870
You'll be a student in the 12th grade next semester.

249
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,670
I just wanted to hire a tutor

250
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,030
to help you with your study.

251
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,390
But it was in a mess in the end

252
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,310
because of you.

253
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,470
You could have told me about it.

254
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,870
Since you wanted to hire a tutor for me,

255
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,350
why didn't you ask me about my opinion?

256
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,510
I just wanted to hire someone who had strong ability

257
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,710
and had no common interest with you.

258
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,710
Well,

259
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,550
you and mom...

260
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,350
Both your mom and I

261
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,390
agreed to hire a tutor.

262
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,750
Please enjoy.

263
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,350
Thank you.

264
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,430
Just eat.

265
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,310
Let's go home.

266
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,550
Wait.

267
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,830
Haven't you seen enough?

268
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,350
I want to eat cakes, too.

269
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,870
Where's Yin Zihan?

270
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,230
How come he's missing after we found her?

271
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,190
Hello, Mr. Xue.

272
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,190
Jiang Juanjusn is with her dad.

273
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,110
She's safe.

274
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,270
Don't worry.

275
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,790
Are you a pervert?

276
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,230
If you keep following me, I'll call the police.

277
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,670
You misunderstood.

278
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,590
The general manager of Yiqi Entertainment?

279
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,190
No talent scout

280
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,870
would find artists in the bathroom.

281
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,110
Right.

282
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,390
The meaning is not good.

283
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,030
He stinks before his debut.

284
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,670
If this is a new way of swindle,

285
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,230
should we call the police?

286
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,230
Did you call the police just now?

287
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,350
Qiyi Entertainment.

288
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,230
Its main business includes these four fields of music, brokerage,

289
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,190
films and television programs, and variety shows.

290
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,190
Their general manager looks like this.

291
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,230
It's him!

292
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,590
But even if it's true,

293
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,030
it has nothing to do with me.

294
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,430
I won't be a trainee.

295
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,390
Why?

296
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,990
Hasn't it been your dream

297
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,670
to be a dancing singer?

298
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,990
I said it was my dream.

299
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,590
It's fine for me to only dream of it.

300
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,390
Just give it a try.

301
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,790
You sing so well.

302
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,630
Your dancing

303
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,230
is very unique.

304
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,670
Maybe you'll be chosen.

305
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,710
There are

306
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,550
many possibilities in life.

307
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,630
Stop it.

308
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,350
It'll get cold if you don't eat.

309
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,070
Don't eat my cake.

310
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,150
I'm back.

311
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,950
You're back.

312
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,830
I have something to tell you.

313
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,710
Sit.

314
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,910
The college entrance exam is coming.

315
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,710
I want to know your plans for the future,

316
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,510
and see if there's anything

317
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,070
I can help you with.

318
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,950
I want to study Computer Science at Yunhai University.

319
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,510
Yunhai University?

320
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,430
With your grades, it’s not hard for you to go to Qingbei University.

321
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,190
Why do you want to apply for Yunhai University?

322
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,550
Although Qingbei University ranks the first

323
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,990
in the whole country in terms of comprehensive capacity.

324
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,310
But I've checked the introduction of teachers and teaching directions

325
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,550
in Yunhai University.

326
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:46,710
There's something I'm interested in.

327
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,430
You've been interested in computers

328
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,470
since childhood.

329
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,910
If you can engage in related professions

330
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,790
and turn your hobby into a career,

331
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,830
this will be a good choice.

332
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,190
Look at that.

333
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,550
What? You don't like it?

334
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,670
No.

335
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,110
Do you think

336
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,070
I want to force you to major in finance

337
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,350
so that you can inherit the company?

338
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,470
If you want to inherit the company,

339
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,550
it's okay.

340
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,350
I'm just kidding.

341
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,110
I've been working hard outside

342
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,310
for so many years

343
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,710
so that you and your mom

344
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,790
can live a carefree life.

345
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,510
Now, my original dream has come true.

346
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,550
It'll be your turn next.

347
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:01,990
Study hard.

348
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,950
I will.

349
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,750
Son, can you work harder

350
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,670
and help me with this?

351
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,270
Okay.

352
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,550
So stupid.

353
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,870
Come on. Have some water.

354
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,310
Thank you.

355
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,670
How come she can have juice?

356
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,030
I don't know what you like to drink.

357
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,950
You can drink mine.

358
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,350
Forget it.

359
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,190
I'll buy it for you.

360
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:45,430
Okay.

361
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,110
Let me taste it.

362
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,350
I heard Yin Zihan had asked for a leave.

363
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,510
How did you know?

364
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,230
Though I'm not good at other things,

365
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,470
I'm indeed quite capable of collecting

366
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,590
and tracking information.

367
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,350
It means I was born to be an entertainment reporter.

368
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,630
I will definitely apply for the major

369
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,670
of journalism.

370
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,630
Next, I'll study hard.

371
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,150
No one is allowed to disturb me.

372
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,430
Fine.

373
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,870
You mistook a tutor for a mistress,

374
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,630
and you'll lose your voice after shouting a few words.

375
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,150
You want to be an entertainment reporter?

376
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,310
According to what you said,

377
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,870
the videos I took

378
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,070
can be used as news material.

379
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,150
Do I also

380
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,590
have the gift for being a journalist?

381
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:27,870
You even shot some videos?

382
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:29,030
Send them to me later.

383
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,350
Well... Well...

384
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,590
Aren't you talking about Yin Zihan?

385
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,830
Yes. What's wrong with Yin Zihan?

386
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,550
Do you miss me?

387
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,390
This is a good thing.

388
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,230
You've passed the preliminary exam.

389
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,510
Why don't you go on with it?

390
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,950
But my parents...

391
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,550
You didn't even ask them.

392
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,190
How do you know they don't agree?

393
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,950
Actually, it's not just my parents.

394
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,110
Although I've always wanted to be a dancing singer,

395
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:55,190
I haven't learnt any basic dancing skills.

396
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,070
Your dancing level

397
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,070
is indeed...

398
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,830
Anyway, you're still young.

399
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,990
You can learn the skills.

400
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,430
It's okay.

401
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,190
Now I know

402
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,790
there are always those who are more excellent than me.

403
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,150
Only in this small place of Yidong,

404
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,470
Ling Chao has always surpassed me.

405
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,110
I suddenly realized that

406
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,230
I'm really nothing.

407
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,870
Let me tell you a secret.

408
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,230
Ling Chao is out of tune when he sings.

409
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,150
Really?

410
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,030
Yes.

411
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,190
Recently, I've learnt that Junhui

412
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,510
has changed his career and become an actor.

413
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,110
He was invited to be the leading actor in many idol dramas.

414
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,710
His fans are looking forward to it very much.

415
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,950
Good.

416
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,550
I also don't think he should rush it.

417
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,710
After all, he's quite famous now.

418
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,750
He should cherish his reputation more.

419
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,630
Instead of playing the role of a handsome and domineering boss,

420
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,830
it's better to spend time selecting a better script.

421
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,110
What do you think?

422
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,950
This exercise...

423
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,790
This exercise is a little difficult indeed.

424
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,670
But as long as we draw the auxiliary line,

425
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,910
it will be easy to do the following steps.

426
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,110
Come on. Let me help you.

427
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,710
No need.

428
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,910
I want to give it a try myself.

429
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,950
You've been studying without talking for three hours.

430
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,830
Eat something and take a rest.

431
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,510
Jia Siwen, can you stop bothering me?

432
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,270
It's not easy for me to take the initiative to study.

433
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,350
Take it away.

434
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,230
These are the key points sorted out by me.

435
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,310
Maybe you can get one more point

436
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,670
if you read one more page.

437
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,990
What are you doing?

438
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,230
Wish you good luck in the college entrance exam tomorrow.

439
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,990
As long as you don't disturb me,

440
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,070
and let me sleep well,

441
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,750
I'll get half success in the college entrance exam.

442
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,110
Right

443
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,470
Come on. Sit down.

444
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,710
Have a good rest.

445
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,390
Ling Chao, have you brought your admission card for the exam?

446
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,110
Yes.

447
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,430
Have you brought some pen cartridges?

448
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,070
Yes.

449
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,310
Have you brought some pencils

450
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,070
and roller pens as well as the cartridges?

451
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,030
Yes.

452
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,430
Have you set the alarm?

453
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,470
How about I wake you up tomorrow?

454
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:27,630
I didn't expect that Ling Chao would really choose Yunhai University.

455
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,990
No.1 High School lost a potential student for Qingbei University like this.

456
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,550
The school leaders must be mad at it.

457
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,430
I think Yunhai is good.

458
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,350
Ling Chao told me

459
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,190
there are five canteens there.

460
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,910
Really?

461
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,630
So many.

462
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,230
Everyone,

463
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,350
I have something to tell you.

464
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,310
Well,

465
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,190
I've passed the test.

466
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:45,590
I'm going to study abroad soon.

467
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,950
Are you going to learn this abroad?

468
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,710
Of course not.

469
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,550
-Square dance. -Like this.

470
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,070
Then you can meet

471
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,030
many senior celebrities.

472
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,870
Don't forget to get their autographs for me.

473
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,790
Why don't you give me yours first?

474
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,630
Don't ask for his autograph.

475
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,710
Let's take a photo together directly.

476
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,590
Okay.

477
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,270
Come on. Let me turn on the beautifying function.

478
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,070
No. You should stand in the middle.

479
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,310
You should stand in the middle.

480
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,830
I'll treat you all to milk tea later.

481
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,710
-Okay. -Let me treat you all to milk tea.

482
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,150
You don't have to be so courteous to me.

483
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,030
I printed a few copies

484
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,870
of Ling Chao's review materials,

485
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,030
and sold them to those in need.

486
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,630
I've earned some pocket money.

487
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:26,870
Turn on the beautifying function.

488
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,310
Come on.

489
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,910
It makes my face look too big.

490
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,950
I think you should do it.

491
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,070
Look at the camera.

492
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,390
So your parents still support you?

493
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,510
If you hadn't encouraged me,

494
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,750
I wouldn't have had the courage to take this step.

495
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,830
If it was not what you wanted to do,

496
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,150
no matter how much others encouraged you, it would be useless.

497
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,790
Now that I think of it,

498
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,430
luckily, I didn't skip a grade back then.

499
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,550
Otherwise,

500
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,350
I might have been unable to meet you.

501
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:14,190
Unfortunately, not long after we met,

502
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,270
we have to say goodbye to each other.

503
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,550
We can still send WeChat messages to each other

504
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,790
or call each other in the future.

505
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,910
After you leave,

506
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,750
who will inherit your family's company?

507
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,470
After you go abroad, you can have the authentic

508
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:27,270
fried chicken and beer, right?

509
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,870
With your level of square dance like that,

510
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,030
you need to practice hard.

511
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,710
You still have a long way to go.

512
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,950
Xiao Tu.

513
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,830
I remember when I caught a cold last time,

514
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,190
you said I could give you any punishment.

515
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,990
Is your promise still effective now?

516
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,790
Gosh!

517
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,350
You still remember that?

518
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,150
Fine.

519
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,710
After all, I stood you up.

520
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:51,230
But don't go too far.

521
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,590
I have my bottom line.

522
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,550
Then I'll

523
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,790
punish you to be my best friend for the rest of my life.

524
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,350
Okay.

525
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,550
But what kind of punishment is this?

526
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,830
I was afraid you would forget me

527
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,510
after you become a big star.

528
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,870
No, I won't.

529
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,630
May your dreams come true,

530
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,390
and may you have a bright future.

531
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,070
Xiao Tu.

532
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:25,910
We'll...

533
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,990
meet again some day.

534
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,270
We will meet again.

535
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,350
Ling Chao, do you have nothing else to do?

536
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,750
You've been rushing me.

537
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,630
Why are you rushing me like this?

538
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,470
Remember to do the past exam papers every day.

539
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,790
When you have your meals,

540
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,110
eat more vegetables and eat less rice.

541
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,270
Then you won't get sleepy easily.

542
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,470
Ling Chao,

543
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,950
you've been admitted into college.

544
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,470
But I still have to suffer for a year.

545
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,390
You texted me during the day, which affected my study.

546
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,750
You called me at night, which disturbed my rest.

547
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,710
Do you understand?

548
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,390
Xue has become more and more serious recently.

549
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,950
He even asked us to write down our target school

550
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,670
and stick it to the desk to encourage ourselves.

551
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,590
It's obvious that he learned it from Ms. Xiao.

552
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,270
Yes.

553
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,150
How can we decide the target school so soon?

554
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,630
Actually, I've almost made up my mind.

555
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,910
Anyway, for the major of journalism,

556
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,510
the Sun Yat-Sen University is more suitable.

557
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,230
I've also made up my mind.

558
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,310
The major of geography at Qingbei University.

559
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,510
What about you, Tu?

560
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,750
I have too many ideas.

561
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,230
I still need to think about it.

562
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:28,790
Yin Zihan, you...

563
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,630
Ma'am.

564
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,430
Yin Zihan has been abroad for two months.

565
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,750
I miss the time we were together.

566
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,870
I wonder

567
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,430
how he's doing over there.

568
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,990
He has started pursuing his dream.

569
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,990
My prospects remain undecided.

570
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:57,270
Can I really be admitted into a good university?

571
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,190
How are your studies recently?

572
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,070
Do you need me to tutor you face to face?

573
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,470
Happy birthday, Ling Chao.

574
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,030
Is it true that everyone set up his goal and dream long ago

575
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,510
except for me?

576
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,750
Ling Chao?

577
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,830
Excuse me.

578
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,230
This is my seat.

579
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,150
Don't be so petty.

580
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,230
Let's share the seat.

581
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,510
Why are you here?

582
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,830
Aren't you in Yunhai?

583
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,910
I was worried that someone would forget her own goal

584
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,990
and couldn't get over her pessimistic feelings.

585
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,870
That's right.

586
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,950
Everyone has his own dream.

587
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,790
Only I don't have a dream.

588
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,910
How can I not be anxious?

589
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,030
Why do you think you don't have a dream?

590
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,670
Who always talked about

591
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,230
going to and leaving school with me forever?

592
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,590
You said that in kindergarten.

593
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,750
Speaking of goals,

594
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,670
you set up a goal earlier than all of them.

595
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,110
That's different.

596
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,710
Besides,

597
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,230
is it because I don't want to to go to Yunhai University?

598
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,950
With my grades, there is big gap

599
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,150
between Yunhai and me.

600
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,190
Don't think too much.

601
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,390
Just focus on one thing now.

602
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:57,630
Do you

603
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,590
want to go to Yunhai University?

604
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,870
Since you said yes,

605
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,150
just go forward bravely.

606
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,230
When you were a kid, your godmother always said that

607
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,870
you learned everything slower than others, right?

608
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,670
But when it comes to eating,

609
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,430
you eat faster than anyone else, don't you?

610
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,990
How can you comfort me like this?

611
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,750
Alright.

612
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,350
I mean,

613
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,270
since childhood,

614
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,190
you've been able to do the things

615
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,550
which you want to finish.

616
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,470
Just like when you were admitted into No.1 High School

617
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:37,510
after overcoming so many difficulties.

618
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,430
This time,

619
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,070
you can make it, too.

620
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,510
Can I...

621
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,230
really make it?

622
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,870
I don't know whether others can make it.

623
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,910
But your luck in exams is really good.

624
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,150
So,

625
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,710
just go forward bravely.

626
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,950
I'll wait for you in Yunhai.

627
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:19,750
What are you doing?

628
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,630
I'm writing down my own dream.

629
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,750
Xue said that

630
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,150
we could encourage ourselves by doing this.

631
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,270
But this is someone else's desk.

632
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,750
Then let's leave now.

633
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,989
I can buy you a cake.

634
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:32,830
Let's celebrate your birthday.

635
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,429
Let's go.

636
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:37,190
At this hour,

637
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,429
the cake shop is closed.

638
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,190
Ling Chao, happy birthday.

639
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,070
No one eats a Wife Cake to celebrate his birthday.

640
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,470
Just make do with it.

641
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,270
Besides, it has a good meaning.

642
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,390
Maybe you can really get a wife after eating it.

643
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,150
I might as well find some fish flesh

644
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,110
in the Fish-flavoured Shredded Pork.

645
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,710
Wait.

646
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:21,670
Make a wish first.

647
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,350
But there are no candles.

648
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,270
All right.

649
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,590
Happy birthday to you.

650
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:46,830
Happy...

651
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,470
So soon?

652
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,110
It looks like you decided what wish to make long ago.

653
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,790
What wish did you make?

654
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,750
I hope that you can be admitted into your ideal university.

655
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,710
You're lying.

656
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,390
Forget it if you don't want to tell me.

657
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,310
Come on. Have some cake.

658
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,390
Where are you going?

659
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,230
Ling Chao, look.

660
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,190
What era is it now?

661
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,190
You're still playing these tricks   aimed at kids.

662
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,910
No.

663
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,350
It's true. Look.

664
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,990
I regret not reading more books.

665
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:43,870
All I can think about now is "How beautiful".

666
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,550
Yes.

667
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,550
How beautiful.

668
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,150
Ling Chao,

669
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,630
you've been admitted into college.

670
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,070
But I still have to suffer for a year.

671
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,030
You texted me during the day, which affected my study.

672
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,390
You called me at night, which disturbed my rest.

673
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,390
Do you understand?

674
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,990
No wonder.

675
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,030
Even though so many girls have asked our master for a date recently,

676
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,350
he has made no response.

677
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,590
It turns out he likes someone with a bad temper.

678
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,870
You have no idea.

679
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,950
Actually, this girl

680
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:46,750
is our master's child bride.

681
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,510
You're back from begging alms.
