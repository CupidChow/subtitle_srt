1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,430
Hello, I'm...

3
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,870
Rabbit.

4
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,750
Juan.

5
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,710
We are in the same dorm room.

6
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,270
Great.

7
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,030
Don't tell me the dorm is arranged according to high school?

8
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,150
How humane.

9
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,830
I only know that we went to the same university.

10
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,030
I didn't expect us to share a room.

11
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,350
Let me tell you,

12
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,509
there are many handsome guys in this school.

13
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,670
Is this the real purpose of you applying the college?

14
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,470
Be reserved.

15
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,990
Junhui is looking at you.

16
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,910
What?

17
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,590
This is Wenhui.

18
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,270
Wenhui?

19
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,670
It's Junhui

20
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,150
with a new hairstyle.

21
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,389
You're really something.

22
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,590
Two months ago,

23
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,350
someone cried and told me

24
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,310
that she couldn't go to Sun Yat-Sen University

25
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,670
and is not good enough for Junhui.

26
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,990
I had to comfort her all night.

27
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,630
Who knew that journalism in Sun Yat-Sen University

28
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,990
suddenly became a popular major.

29
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,230
That's why I got rejected.

30
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,230
Now I got into Yunhai,

31
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,390
and I have to see your face every day.

32
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,270
I can feel sorry for the situation,

33
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,310
at least.

34
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,390
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,310
I'm just kidding.

36
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,150
I'm so happy.

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,030
We went to the same university.

38
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,670
We are also in the same major and in the same dorm room.

39
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,750
Where can we find such a good destiny?

40
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,990
Hi.

41
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,550
It seems that the university is

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,670
not that humane.

43
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,030
Does the crew can only afford

44
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,430
these actors?

45
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,790
Where is your bed?

46
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,470
Here.

47
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,550
Let me help you.

48
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,910
Master.

49
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,150
Didn't you say you'll be back in two days?

50
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,510
I have something to deal with.

51
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,430
Good.

52
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,910
The freshmen start school these two days.

53
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,230
Our big brother has been flirting with girls

54
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,230
in the name of taking care of the juniors.

55
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,950
Brother Sha is always in the library.

56
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,350
I'm so lonely in the dorm alone.

57
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,630
Let's play two rounds later.

58
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,870
What's your room number?

59
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,950
404.

60
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,910
404.

61
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,590
Page not found.

62
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,030
Interesting.

63
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,910
Really?

64
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,190
Are you also interested

65
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,390
in paranormal stories?

66
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,430
It looks like

67
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,790
we are a perfect match.

68
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,590
Let me tell you a classic one, okay?

69
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,470
Sure.

70
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,870
One day,

71
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,590
a delivery man

72
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,430
is delivering a package

73
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,150
to the apartment in the university city.

74
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,270
He followed the address

75
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,110
to find this 404.

76
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,190
He passed 402.

77
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,230
403.

78
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,870
405.

79
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,030
There is no 404.

80
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:25,990
And then?

81
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,150
At this time,

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,670
he repeatedly confirmed

83
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,870
that it's 404.

84
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,230
At this moment,

85
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,070
he heard a sound from behind.

86
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,510
Excuse me.

87
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,670
Are you okay?

88
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,510
She....f-f-fine.

89
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,430
I'm fine. I'm fine.

90
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,630
It's okay.

91
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,790
I'm here, 404.

92
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,270
Good.

93
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,230
Go inside and warm up.

94
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,310
It's cold outside.

95
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,830
You are the new roommate, right?

96
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:05,990
Which major are you?

97
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,950
Classical dance.

98
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,190
You look different from someone else.

99
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,230
My name is Xu Linglong.

100
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,750
I also majored in classical dance.

101
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,030
We'll be friends from now on.

102
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,990
Hi, I'm Xiao Tu.

103
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,670
She is Jiang Juanjuan.

104
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,590
We majored in journalism.

105
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,310
Hello.

106
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,790
Hello, I'm Xia Mo.

107
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,430
This is...

108
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,310
He's a senior from student council who is in charge of the orientation.

109
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,310
Hello.

110
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,870
I'm Sun Shibo.

111
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,830
I'm one year older than you.

112
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,510
I'm from the student council.

113
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,670
I heard you talking.

114
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,070
I think your dorm is

115
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,909
mixed by two schools.

116
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,350
Yes.

117
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,270
There are only a few mixed dorms in this university.

118
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,230
I happened to be assigned in one.

119
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,670
How unlucky.

120
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,870
Don't say that.

121
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,710
Actually, it's good.

122
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,030
You can meet more friends.

123
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,150
Many people envy you.

124
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,830
Maybe your dorm

125
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,470
will be the bridge of friendship between two schools.

126
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,550
You sure it's not a broken bridge?

127
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,870
Haha.

128
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,790
Do you want this?

129
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,710
This is delicious.

130
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,270
Really?

131
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,550
It's really good. Where did you get it?

132
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,390
How about this? I'll give you my number.

133
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,470
You're new here.

134
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,190
You can ask me

135
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,230
anything.

136
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,310
Okay.

137
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,430
I'll scan your QR code.

138
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,870
Okay.

139
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,670
I'll leave you alone.

140
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,870
Tell me if you need any help.

141
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,470
Okay.

142
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,270
Thank you, senior.

143
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:26,990
Thank you, senior.

144
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,910
Keep in touch.

145
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,710
Keep in touch.

146
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,030
You don't have to see me off.

147
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,070
Go back.

148
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,470
I need to use the toilet.

149
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,550
Okay.

150
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,630
There...

151
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,270
There is toilet in your dorm.

152
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,070
Yes, there is.

153
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,510
Senior,

154
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,310
thank you for today.

155
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,909
Let me buy you a cup of milk tea.

156
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,190
How can a senior let his junior buy him milk tea?

157
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:57,950
How about this?

158
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,030
I'll ask the people in our dorm

159
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,110
to have dinner together

160
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,190
with you and your roommates.

161
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,470
So that you can get familiar with the environment.

162
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,190
Okay.

163
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,270
I'll ask them later.

164
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,550
See you tonight.

165
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,950
Let's go.

166
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,790
Brothers.

167
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,150
Just you?

168
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,710
Big brother,

169
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,350
can you stop making a fuss

170
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,790
like the money king causing havoc in heaven?

171
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,870
I have a good news, Zhu.

172
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,950
I'm getting a girlfriend.

173
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,950
Believe me.

174
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,030
It's true this time.

175
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,510
Let me tell you.

176
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,550
Look.

177
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,030
Isn't she pretty?

178
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,190
1.7 meters.

179
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,030
Long legs.

180
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,710
Why are you swiping?

181
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,870
Mine.

182
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,350
Zhu,

183
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,030
don't blame me for not thinking of you every time.

184
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,230
Tonight,

185
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,910
I invited them

186
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,950
to have a gathering.

187
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,990
Is there any pretty girls?

188
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,110
Except Xia Mo,

189
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,390
there is also a girl who learns dancing.

190
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,950
She's pretty too.

191
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,150
The other two...

192
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,990
they are cute.

193
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,110
It's really hard for you

194
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,830
to go one on four.

195
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,110
As your brother, I can't bear it.

196
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,190
That's right.

197
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,710
I'll go with you.

198
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,710
But there's another problem.

199
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,350
Just the two of us

200
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,910
is not enough.

201
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,870
You know

202
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,870
master never attends this kind of gathering.

203
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,710
No problem.

204
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,710
About the master...

205
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,950
I'll take care of him.

206
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,390
Hello, Jia Siwen.

207
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,910
Have you arrived?

208
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,950
Yes, I am.

209
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,030
Let me tell you.

210
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,030
Guess what?

211
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:50,870
Well...

212
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,070
Forget it.

213
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,110
Let me video call you.

214
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,510
Yes, video call.

215
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,830
Hi, Jia Siwen.

216
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,630
Surprised?

217
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,230
Jiang Juanjuan and I share the same dorm room.

218
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,030
And Xu...

219
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,190
Never mind, she's not important.

220
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,350
Shut up.

221
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,510
Let me tell you.

222
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,390
How's Qingbei University?

223
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,350
Are there many handsome guys?

224
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,230
You haven't seen our school, have you?

225
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,230
Let me show you.

226
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,310
I'm going.

227
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,910
I'll show you

228
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,270
a very beautiful place.

229
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,350
Rabbit.

230
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,270
Mom.

231
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,830
Rabbit.

232
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,150
Ling, can you hurry up?

233
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,230
Yes, after this round,

234
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,750
it's getting dark.

235
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,950
Mom.

236
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,510
I thought you would be worried about me

237
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,670
checking in alone.

238
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,310
I didn't expect you to play mahjong.

239
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,990
What are you talking about?

240
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,710
I'm worried about you.

241
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,630
Wait.

242
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,750
Peng!

243
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,270
When I was at your age,

244
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,030
I dragged the luggage alone

245
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,150
and took the green-skinned train for over 20 hours

246
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,990
to go to school.

247
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,950
You know? Hurry up.

248
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,910
Little rabbit,

249
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,350
When you get to Yunhai,

250
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,870
ask Chao to help you.

251
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,310
Like cleaning,

252
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,470
and moving things.

253
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,350
Let him do it.

254
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:12,990
Yes.

255
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,430
Let him take you out more often

256
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,670
to get familiar with the campus.

257
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,270
Hurry up. Your school

258
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,390
has field,

259
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,190
little garden and forest.

260
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,070
You should

261
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,550
go out with Chao.

262
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,310
Okay?

263
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,550
The lakeside is the most romantic place.

264
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,150
Yes.

265
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,430
I want to see you every day.

266
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,270
Who is Ling Chao?

267
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,350
I don't know Ling Chao.

268
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,750
I win.

269
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,950
I'm sorry.

270
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,630
Now I know

271
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,190
there's no room for me in this house, right?

272
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,510
What seat?

273
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,590
Do you have no seat in the cafeteria?

274
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,550
Go and eat.

275
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,470
Hurry up.

276
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,150
I'm hanging up.

277
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:47,910
No, I...

278
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,390
There's no place for me, right?

279
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,630
You still care about your daughter?

280
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,510
Tell me.

281
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,070
Come down.

282
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,950
We agreed to go to school together.

283
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,070
Why are you here alone?

284
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,110
Are you still angry?

285
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,070
Who told you to joke about that?

286
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,270
It's under my bed.

287
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,230
Besides,

288
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,990
in my house,

289
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:28,550
so what if I'm naked?

290
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,950
You are still trying to reason it?

291
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,350
Alright.

292
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,270
It's my fault.

293
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,670
But in the end,

294
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,310
you threw me into the lake first.

295
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,470
We're even now.

296
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,510
You deserve it.

297
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,350
I learned taekwondo.

298
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,390
Don't you know that you can't

299
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,630
get close to martial artists?

300
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,630
How dare you attack me?

301
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,750
Don't even think about it.

302
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,870
Who would attack in the front?

303
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,350
I just want to talk to you.

304
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,990
It's okay to talk,

305
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,190
but why are you getting so close?

306
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,710
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

307
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,350
It's better to keep a distance.

308
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,830
Just say it.

309
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,870
Hello, Juanjuan.

310
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,310
Tonight?

311
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,950
No.

312
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,550
Let's go.

313
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,070
Senior Sun is so enthusiastic.

314
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,910
We must go.

315
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,070
Where?

316
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,470
A good place?

317
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,710
Why does it sound so inappropriate?

318
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,070
Okay, send me

319
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,270
-the location. 
-I've thought about it.

320
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,750
I have nothing to do tonight.

321
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,670
Okay, bye.

322
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,350
I'll have a meal with you.

323
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,070
I have something to do. I have to go.

324
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,230
Let's check it out online.

325
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,230
It's the difference between code zero and one.

326
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:49,990
Hi.

327
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,230
Hi.

328
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,750
Xiao Tu.

329
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,670
Senior.

330
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,430
You really got into Yunhai.

331
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,910
You know each other?

332
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,830
Yes.

333
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,070
She is my master...

334
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,830
and my high school junior.

335
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,150
Ling Chao, what a coincidence!

336
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,950
It is.

337
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,110
The three of them are my high school juniors.

338
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,230
We knew each other before.

339
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,990
It's fate.

340
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,270
We must celebrate it.

341
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,630
Come on.

342
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,470
Everyone, come in.

343
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,430
Please come in.

344
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,150
Please come in.

345
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,710
Please come in.

346
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,590
Let's go. He's so enthusiastic.

347
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,990
Hello. How many of you?

348
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,830
Eight.

349
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,750
Sit here.

350
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,350
Come here.

351
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,950
This place is nice.

352
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,310
Sha.

353
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,910
Are you

354
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,670
going on a pilgrimage for Buddhist scriptures?

355
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,670
This

356
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,070
starts from

357
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,470
the freshman year.

358
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,310
When I first entered the school,

359
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,150
Master,

360
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,470
also your senior Ling Chao,

361
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,830
became the target of all the girls

362
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,990
in a blink of an eye.

363
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,310
Even the goddess senior who is one year older than us

364
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,350
is pursuing master.

365
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,110
Guess what?

366
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,830
What?

367
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,550
Master firmly declined

368
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,230
her pursuit.

369
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,750
Also, he didn't blink at all

370
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,070
with other girls' pursuit.

371
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,990
Almost

372
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,470
was thought to be...

373
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,230
Wukong!

374
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,670
That's enough.

375
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,470
Yes, master.

376
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,830
I'll make it short.

377
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,430
So my master was called

378
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,030
the Tang Monk.

379
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,430
My surname is Sun and his surname is Zhu.

380
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,790
We're a group of master and his disciples.

381
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,870
But this story

382
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,990
has nothing to do with Guan Jiu.

383
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,870
It doesn't matter.

384
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,230
Anyway, Sha thinks

385
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,950
other than reading,

386
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,870
everything else has nothing to do with him.

387
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,670
Right, Sha?

388
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,230
Read, Sha.

389
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,270
Are you ready to order?

390
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,230
I want a pan-fried steak

391
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,110
and a braised beef brisket.

392
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,670
Okay.

393
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,830
No cilantro, please.

394
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,670
And a bottle of coconut juice.

395
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,150
Okay, what would you like?

396
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,630
Junior.

397
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,790
It's such a happy day.

398
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,990
How can you drink coconut juice?

399
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,670
Waiter, a dozen of beer, please.

400
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,270
Okay.

401
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,350
Give her coconut juice.

402
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,590
If you want to drink,

403
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,470
I'll drink with you.

404
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,750
Master,

405
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,950
you care so much about her.

406
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,270
If the madam knew,

407
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,030
won't she be jealoused?

408
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,710
Ling Chao, do you have a girlfriend?

409
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,750
No, no.

410
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,430
He is kidding.

411
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,590
I'm not joking.

412
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,150
What are you doing?

413
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,510
Why are you touching me like this?

414
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,390
I'm not joking.

415
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,510
I'm telling the truth.

416
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,590
You don't know.

417
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,190
Master actually has a child bride.

418
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,390
I didn't expect that after such a long time,

419
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,870
the gossip about the child bride

420
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,510
has spread to Yunhai.

421
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,590
Big brother,

422
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,710
do you know

423
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,230
who is the legendary

424
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,070
child bride?

425
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,670
I really don't know.

426
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,110
But I heard them talking on the phone.

427
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,390
That woman

428
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,390
was so fierce.

429
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,670
Oh, no.

430
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,670
So fierce?

431
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,310
This woman

432
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,910
is fierce.

433
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,110
Amazing. That's something.

434
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,990
Amazing.

435
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,670
Let me repeat the rules.

436
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,150
Each of us counts in turn.

437
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,590
When the number is 7 and multiples of 7,

438
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,630
you need to tap the table and shout "pass."

439
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,310
The loser will perform a talent.

440
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,070
Let's change the punishment.

441
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,830
Okay.

442
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,990
Let's do dare.

443
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,350
Okay? This is good.

444
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,550
Sure.

445
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,950
Starting from me this time.

446
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,790
219.

447
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:41,870
220.

448
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,750
Pass.

449
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,470
I tapped the table.

450
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,710
What does 221 have to do with 7?

451
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,030
Right?

452
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,150
Let me show you taekwondo.

453
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,150
No.

454
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,070
Forget it.

455
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,470
Don't smash the shop.

456
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,670
Sit down.

457
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,390
Okay, go ahead.

458
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,270
What do you want me to do?

459
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,310
I suggest...

460
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,110
I agree.

461
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,550
I haven't said it yet.

462
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,390
What do you think?

463
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,230
Find a man

464
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,510
and get his contact information.

465
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,430
Good idea.

466
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,470
Well, besides our table.

467
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,150
I think it's okay.

468
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,869
Maybe you can be friends.

469
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,430
After all, our top priority in university

470
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,109
-is to have a...
-To study...

471
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,630
a campus love!

472
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,150
A campus love.

473
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,950
It's inappropriate.... we don't know each other.

474
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,030
Does it help if you know each other?

475
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,390
If you don't know him, you can try to know him.

476
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,150
Right?

477
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,310
Yes. Yes. Yes.

478
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,470
Okay. Okay.

479
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,350
Fine.

480
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,350
Pick one.

481
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,510
That one. That one.

482
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,630
I think that's good.

483
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,190
Okay?

484
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,070
That one is really good.

485
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,830
Go!

486
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,870
Hurry up.

487
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,670
Go.

488
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,390
Xiao Tu. Xiao Tu. Xiao Tu.

489
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,750
Hello.

490
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,950
Can I add you on WeChat?

491
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,150
He is very popular.

492
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,790
Wait.

493
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,150
You can go after she's done.

494
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,990
Sorry, it's not convenient.

495
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,790
Okay.

496
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,390
Hurry up.

497
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,510
Your turn.

498
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,390
Go away.

499
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,750
This is social suicide.

500
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,830
Did you lose the game?

501
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,470
It's okay.

502
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,550
Tell me.

503
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,110
What do you want me to do?

504
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,270
Master.

505
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,870
This is vinegar.

506
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,670
Is there a problem?

507
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:33,950
This is what I'm drinking.

508
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,790
Phone.

509
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,110
Here.

510
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,430
It's out of battery.

511
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:43,910
It's okay.

512
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,150
Here.

513
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,070
Oh my god.

514
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,150
Master, are you alright?

515
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,470
Master.

516
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,230
Are you okay? What's wrong?

517
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,190
He was fine just now.

518
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,950
I don't know. I think he's drunk.

519
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,990
He needs some rest.

520
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,470
What are you waiting for? Send him back.

521
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,070
Go back.

522
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,950
Sha, let me do it.

523
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,550
Let's go.

524
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,870
Slow down.

525
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,630
Let's go.

526
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,230
What happened?

527
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,630
What's wrong, Sha?

528
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,590
I think I ate something bad.

529
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,670
You...

530
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,150
Come with me to the infirmary.

531
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,190
Let's go. Wait.

532
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:28,670
Xiao Tu.

533
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,750
I'll leave master to you.

534
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,990
What are you talking about?

535
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,790
How could you leave master

536
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,070
to a weak girl?

537
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:36,710
Don't worry.

538
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,590
Leave master to me. Hurry up.

539
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,430
Big brother,

540
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,550
you have to send the other juniors back to the dorm.

541
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,390
Okay.

542
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,790
Juniors,

543
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,070
I'll send you back.

544
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,150
It's getting late.

545
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,950
It's not safe on the way.

546
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,070
Let me see you off.

547
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,470
Let's go.

548
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,590
How dangerous is it?

549
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,670
Is there any ghosts?

550
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,870
Can you tell us?

551
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,030
This, this, this.

552
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,790
Don't drink if you can't.

553
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,030
Don't throw me into the lake.

554
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,190
Again?

555
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,830
You can't leave me alone.

556
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,590
Okay.

557
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,270
I won't.

558
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,350
I won't.

559
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,030
I won't.

560
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,670
Don't keep distance from me!

561
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:10,710
Is

562
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,590
being drunk also contagious?

563
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,550
Y-Y-You...

564
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,670
Alright, you're here.

565
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,670
Yes.

566
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,150
I'll see you off.

567
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,750
No, my dorm is over there.

568
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,310
Take care of yourself.

569
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,470
All right.

570
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,190
I'm here.

571
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,190
Go back first.

572
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,150
You go first.

573
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,350
Can you do it by yourself?

574
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,470
I'm leaving.

575
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,350
What are you doing?

576
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,790
Watch out for the car!

577
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,870
Oh no.

578
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,190
The alcohol is starting to go to my head.

579
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,190
You're finally back.

580
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,710
Why don’t you go upstairs?

581
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,670
Xu Linglong and I didn't bring the key.

582
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,430
Xia Mo brought it

583
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,390
but she lost it.

584
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,670
We doesn't know where the dormitory supervisor is.

585
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,190
You are the hope of the whole dorm now.

586
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:59,910
I might let you down.

587
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,310
I thought you would bring the key,

588
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,070
so I didn't bring mine.

589
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,510
I told you we can't count on her.

590
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,230
This is great.

591
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,670
We are going to sleep on the street.

592
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,790
Not really.

593
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,230
Xia Mo,

594
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,710
do you remember where you went today?

595
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,310
After I went out today,

596
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,750
I went to the lab building to explore.

597
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,910
Maybe I dropped it there.

598
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,710
It's not far.

599
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,550
Why don't we go along the way?

600
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,630
Maybe we can find it.

601
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,350
How can you find the key

602
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,710
in the middle of the night?

603
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,190
Do you have a better idea?

604
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,990
That's the only way.

605
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,270
Let's go. Let's go.

606
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,990
Let's go.

607
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,310
Is this place haunted?

608
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,710
Really?

609
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,110
I came to Yunhai to see ghosts.

610
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,790
What ghost?

611
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,550
Anything kinds of ghosts.

612
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:53,070
As long as I can take a look.

613
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,350
Why do I feel that this teaching building is a bit creepy?

614
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,510
Because this building has been abandoned.

615
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,750
Why did you come to a abandoned building?

616
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,750
To check in!

617
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,950
I heard that

618
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,470
a human skeleton model was lost at school.

619
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,870
Lost?

620
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,430
Yes, lost.

621
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,230
Let's go.

622
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,030
When the students were taking a lesson,

623
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,710
they thought they needed it the next day.

624
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,350
So,

625
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,870
they didn't put it back to the storage room.

626
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,750
But the next day,

627
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,430
this model

628
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,630
went back to its original place.

629
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,870
This model is a Virgo.

630
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,390
It's okay.

631
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,350
Where are they?

632
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,350
I can't push it.

633
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,230
Let's go.

634
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,830
Let's go back to where we were.

635
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,550
Why are you here?

636
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,790
You're in the way.

637
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,790
Let's go. I'll take you home.

638
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,070
What should we do now?

639
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,710
Wenhui...

640
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,470
It's okay.

641
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,430
I'll protect you.

642
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,550
Where is Xia Mo?

643
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,110
Is she...

644
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,390
She must be in danger.

645
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,630
I'll go save her.

646
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,830
Wait.

647
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,230
Listen.

648
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,830
What are you doing?

649
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,790
Xiao Tu, you...

650
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,910
you aren't afraid, are you?

651
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,710
Why are you walking so fast?

652
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,990
I-I-I'm afraid.

653
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,310
I am afraid because of all your screaming.

654
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,470
Your hands are sweating,

655
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,910
and you still refuse to admit it.

656
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,190
Then don't hold my hand.

657
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,230
No.

658
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,870
I think it's quite interesting.

659
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:30,990
And we haven't found the key yet.

660
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,430
Forget it.

661
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,270
Let's think of another way.

662
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,270
I told you

663
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,110
finding the key at night is unreliable.

664
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,430
It's a little hot.

665
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,230
Can you

666
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,590
stay away?

667
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,150
Let's go. Hurry.

668
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,270
No one is here.

669
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,230
What time is it now?

670
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,950
It's twelve o'clock.

671
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,350
The peak time of paranormal events.

672
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,670
You think too much.

673
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,470
It's time for curfew.

674
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,430
That's all.

675
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,630
Which dorm are you from?

676
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,830
I'm leaving.

677
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,550
You...

678
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,590
W-What are you doing?

679
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,350
Watch out for the car.

680
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,390
Master! Master!

681
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,030
What's wrong?

682
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,550
Are you okay, master?

683
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,270
Are you okay? What happened to him?

684
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,110
Go back now.

685
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,230
Sha, let me do it.

686
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,630
Watch the steps.

687
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,390
Watch the steps.

688
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,590
I think I ate something bad.

689
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,350
Come with me to the infirmary.

690
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,070
Xiao Tu.

691
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,990
I'll leave master to you.

692
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,590
Don't drink if you can't.

693
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,590
Don't throw me into the lake.

694
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,190
There you go again!
