1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,630
Didn't they just become boyfriend and girlfriend yesterday?

3
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,910
Why did she fall in love with someone else so soon?

4
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,390
To be precise,

5
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,550
she and her ex-boyfriend got back together.

6
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,750
Why are these dramas so weird nowadays?

7
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,550
How come every man had a crush on the heroine?

8
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,870
Besides, several men had a crush on

9
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,630
the heroine at the same time.

10
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,590
You're still too young.

11
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,710
As the saying goes,

12
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,510
a man is afraid of choosing a wrong career,

13
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,710
and a woman is afraid of marrying a wrong man.

14
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,550
For example,

15
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,830
if you go to the free market

16
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,070
to buy a radish

17
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,750
or an apple,

18
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,310
you'll compare the products from different stores.

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,070
Right, Ling Chao?

20
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,550
Godfather, don't worry.

21
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,789
I won't choose a wrong career.

22
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,190
Well, hello.

23
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,630
May I ask

24
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,789
whether there's any other flavor?

25
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,230
It's okay if it's not for sale.

26
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,070
For this product, the strawberry flavor and the peach flavor used to

27
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,870
be sold together.

28
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,030
But the peach flavor may be out of stock for now.

29
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,510
This matcha flavor is new.

30
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,509
It tastes good.

31
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,310
Thank you.

32
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,310
Ling Chao.

33
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,550
You happen to be here.

34
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,350
You should go home first by yourself after school today.

35
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,510
I need to go to the bookstore.

36
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,630
Why are you going to the bookstore?

37
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,390
Why did you ask me this question?

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,910
Of course I'm going to the bookstore to buy books.

39
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,710
Yin Zihan will help me select a set of exercises

40
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,750
that are suitable for me.

41
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,750
I don't think it's necessary.

42
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,790
You won't do the execrices after you buy it anyway.

43
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,750
You can say whatever you want.

44
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,829
I'm just here to tell you about it.

45
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:34,470
Goodbye.

46
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,550
The strawberry flavor and the peach flavor

47
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,990
were sold together for so many years.

48
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,390
How come they were separated so suddenly?

49
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:48,510
I'll give it to you.

50
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,910
You're so generous today.

51
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,550
I hate tea.

52
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,990
What a coincidence.

53
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,390
Lan likes it.

54
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,310
Gentlemen, have some fruits, please.

55
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,870
Where is Tu?

56
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,550
In her room.

57
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,470
Is she studying?

58
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,630
Hurry up.

59
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,790
Bring her some fruits. Hurry up.

60
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,230
The show will end soon.

61
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,350
-I'm asking you to do this. -It'll end soon.

62
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,030
I'll go.

63
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,350
Okay. Chao will go.

64
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,829
Sit over there.

65
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,350
I asked you to do something, but you only focused on watching TV.

66
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,070
Is it appropriate for a boy

67
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,150
to enter a girl's room so casually?

68
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,110
Right.

69
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,110
It must be inappropriate.

70
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,310
Then you should sleep on the sofa tonight.

71
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,390
It's different, right?

72
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,950
The cake you took me to eat last time

73
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,870
was quite delicious.

74
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,750
I have something to do. Let's talk later.

75
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,430
Whom were you talking to on the phone?

76
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,070
So disgusting.

77
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,150
Why do you think I was disgusting?

78
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,190
You did this.

79
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,829
And this.

80
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,110
You smiled so broadly that your mouth almost touched your temples.

81
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,630
Your sweetheart wasn't like that.

82
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,630
Your sweetheart...

83
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,670
Can you talk properly?

84
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,190
Yes.

85
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,870
That's the feeling.

86
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:36,950
You're normal now.

87
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,150
What a masochism.

88
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,870
Wait.

89
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,350
Come here and sign the paper for me.

90
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,350
What grade did you get this time which you can't let your parents know?

91
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,670
I really worked hard this time.

92
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,909
It's all thanks to Yin Zihan for tutoring me.

93
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,790
I've improved a lot in my performance of math.

94
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,630
However,

95
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,470
I had to do math exercises every day, and I didn't have time

96
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,830
to write English words.

97
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,870
So, this English exam...

98
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,710
Where's my English test paper?

99
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,630
Your study results

100
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,790
are just like the water in the water tank.

101
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,550
You need to scoop the water out and allocate it to every subject.

102
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,590
But the total amount is always that small.

103
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,630
Sometimes, the water evaporates.

104
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,310
It's very scary.

105
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,190
Evaporates?

106
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,390
Just laugh at me as much as you can.

107
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,630
With my IQ,

108
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,870
maybe I can never surpass you.

109
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,070
But it's okay.

110
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,550
I'll do my best.

111
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,270
But I'm not doing it for comparing myself with you,

112
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,270
but for my own sake.

113
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,830
I can't improve much in a short time.

114
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,670
It's okay.

115
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,150
The college entrance exam is still so far off.

116
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,030
I still have time.

117
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,230
It's Yin Zihan again.

118
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,390
Yin Zihan sorted out the errors I made in these exercises for me.

119
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,510
They're classified according to different types.

120
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,710
It's very effective.

121
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,110
Is this your so-called effort?

122
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,310
That...

123
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,790
This...

124
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,350
It all belongs to Yin Zihan.

125
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,710
Yin Zihan left it in my bag.

126
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,830
So annoying.

127
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,870
It turns out Yin Zihan

128
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,870
is also interested in reading girls' comics.

129
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,950
No wonder even though he always talks about beating me,

130
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,310
he has never succeeded.

131
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,790
Could it be that

132
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,909
after staying with you for so long,

133
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,190
he has also become a stupid boy?

134
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,790
So what even if I'm stupid?

135
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,670
I'm stupid but it's not infectious.

136
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,390
Don't take this chance to laugh at me.

137
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,190
Hello, Xiao Tu.

138
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:41,950
I'm arguing with someone here.

139
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,710
Let's talk later.

140
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,230
Besides, you're also with me every day.

141
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,190
You haven't become stupid.

142
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,710
That means his stupidity has nothing to do with me.

143
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,990
It's Yin Zihan's own problem.

144
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,710
Well,

145
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,230
I can hear it.

146
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,030
Look at this exercise.

147
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,950
Track 1 and Track 2 are tangent to the point q.

148
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,910
Track 2 and Track 3 are tangent to the point p.

149
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,270
For the velocity,

150
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,510
if we consider it as A,

151
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,550
then...

152
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,390
Aren't they in different classes now?

153
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,590
Why are they still together?

154
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,990
As far as I know,

155
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,030
they are studying a biological phenomenon.

156
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,110
Phenomenon?

157
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,910
The possiblity of IQ infection.

158
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,790
According to this trend,

159
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,790
in ten years,

160
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,190
Yin Zihan will be your brother-in-law.

161
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,190
Chao, you're here.

162
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:39,870
Hurry up.

163
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,390
Both your sister and brother-in-law are here.

164
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,030
Brother-in-law?

165
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,710
Go and have a look.

166
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,630
Baby, your uncle is here.

167
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,710
Call him uncle.

168
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,470
Come here.

169
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,150
Call him uncle.

170
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,150
So cute.

171
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,030
He's not as cute as you.

172
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,030
You married Yin Zihan?

173
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

174
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,110
Look.

175
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,070
I've given birth to several children.

176
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,910
Look.

177
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,990
Baby, this is your uncle. Call him uncle.

178
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,430
Kids, your uncle is here.

179
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,590
Kids!

180
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,310
No.

181
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,830
What are you doing?

182
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,710
I need to check whether this spaceship

183
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,950
remains idle all day long

184
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,070
and only goes around the moon.

185
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,830
Do you want to go to the space?

186
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,190
It's boring to do homework.

187
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,750
Let's go out to eat desserts.

188
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,510
Okay.

189
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,429
See you later.

190
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,830
It's my turn. Check mine.

191
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,310
You'll have good luck in your love relationship.

192
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,590
Was that the look of encouragement?

193
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,110
It's the feeling of being respected by my rival.

194
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,710
Wenyu.

195
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,710
Let's go play basketball.

196
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,030
Wait for me. I'll go after dumping the garbage.

197
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,830
I'll wait for you at the court.

198
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,430
Okay.

199
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:47,590
Ling Chao.

200
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,190
Are you free tonight?

201
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,550
I've prepared two tickets of an art exhibition.

202
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,590
All the works there are created by famous painters in our country.

203
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,750
I heard it's good.

204
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,790
Do you want to go with me?

205
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,670
No.

206
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,750
I'm going to look for a book.

207
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,230
What book?

208
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,350
I'll help you look for it.

209
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,630
Omnipotent Algorithm.

210
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,590
The version with the original text.

211
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,430
Okay.

212
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,910
I'll see if I can find it for you.

213
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,270
Thanks.

214
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,390
Will you be free tomorrow or the day after tomorrow?

215
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,430
It's also okay to watch it on the weekend.

216
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,670
The exhibition will continue until this weekend.

217
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,510
If I can't find it today,

218
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,790
I'll contuinue to look for it tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

219
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,070
I don't think I'll have time.

220
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,190
You're leaving?

221
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,750
Lan, you're still here.

222
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,870
Do you know the book Omnipotent Algorithm?

223
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,070
Yes, I do.

224
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,470
It's about computers.

225
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,310
Do you know where to buy

226
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,670
the version with the original text?

227
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,030
It's a bit urgent.

228
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,230
It's better to get it in these two days.

229
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,510
Are you interested in this?

230
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,870
Let me think of a way.

231
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,070
What are you two reading?

232
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,470
Let me see.

233
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,950
Notre Dame de Paris.

234
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,350
Pride and Prejudice.

235
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,350
Well, you two

236
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,350
have had a high awareness recently.

237
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,830
You're even reading world-famous masterpieces

238
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,190
to improve your literature cultivation.

239
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,670
However,

240
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,390
don't read a book when you walk.

241
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,590
It's not safe.

242
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,430
It's fine if you bump into someone,

243
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,150
but if you miss your step, then...

244
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,150
Ms. Xiao.

245
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,150
Let's go together.

246
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:37,950
Here you are.

247
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,990
Study hard.

248
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,670
Bye.

249
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,350
Ms. Xiao.

250
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,030
I was reading about the plot that Mr. Leng and Xue

251
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,430
had signed a love contract.

252
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,670
Luckily, Mr. Xue didn't see the content in the book.

253
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,990
Let's go.

254
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,750
I'll take you to the place which sells famous masterpieces.

255
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,070
Let's go.

256
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,590
Hurry up.

257
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,470
Coming.

258
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,110
Sir.

259
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,630
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

260
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,790
You've been busy lately, right?

261
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,270
It's been three days since we met last time.

262
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,750
I've brought a new friend here today.

263
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:12,950
Sir,

264
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,910
have you got any new book lately?

265
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,430
Yes.

266
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,630
Of course.

267
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,230
These are the new books which arrived today.

268
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,470
This one.

269
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,430
I Married My Idol.

270
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,030
I specially saved it for you.

271
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,190
Sir, you know me so well.

272
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,350
This is it.

273
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,190
-Take your time. Take a look -Sir!

274
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,390
How much is this?

275
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,070
Do you want to go to see

276
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,270
Junhui's new movie with me tomorrow?

277
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,350
What a coincidence. I'm going to see a movie tomorrow.

278
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,670
But I've asked Yin Zihan to go with me.

279
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,550
What?

280
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,350
I just think that he has helped me a lot

281
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,990
in my studying recently,

282
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,510
so I invited him to see a movie.

283
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,910
It's nothing.

284
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,670
What movie are you going to see?

285
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,870
A very touching movie which is full of positive energy.

286
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:08,590
I can take this chance to add some material to my essays.

287
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,950
I'm impressed.

288
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,590
This Les Miserables is a good book.

289
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,310
It's a story about a reserved handsome boy

290
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,270
and a cute girl who is bad at studying.

291
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,430
Take it back home and study hard.

292
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,270
No.

293
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,830
If I suddenly start reading a famous masterpiece,

294
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,390
my mom will definitely think that it is strange.

295
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,990
I think

296
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,430
this

297
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,230
omnipotent...

298
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,510
I don't know how to pronounce it.

299
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,310
It looks like an English book anyway.

300
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,870
It's low-key and luxurious.

301
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,350
My mom won't suspect it.

302
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,550
What a master.

303
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,350
Mu Yehan.

304
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,430
It's the 28th time.

305
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,910
Sorry.

306
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,030
I couldn't help it.

307
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:03,870
How come you have a cold?

308
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,350
If you really feel so unwell,

309
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,670
take a leave and go back home to rest.

310
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,590
I'm fine.

311
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,070
I went to the suburbs to look for something yesterday.

312
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,030
I caught a cold.

313
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,350
The suburbs?

314
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,830
Why did you go to the suburbs?

315
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,830
To look for a book.

316
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,110
What book?

317
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,670
It's not an important book.

318
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,950
I need to go to the toilet.

319
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,470
Ling Chao,

320
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,550
did you find the Omnipotent Algorithm yesterday?

321
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,470
Not yet.

322
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,630
I've found it for you.

323
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,870
See if it's the one.

324
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,910
This is it.

325
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,630
I've been looking for it for a long time, and I couldn't find it.

326
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,790
Where did you buy it?

327
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,910
Actually...

328
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,270
Thank you.

329
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,070
I can't take it.

330
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,870
Why?

331
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,270
Don't misunderstand it.

332
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,510
I merely helped you

333
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,830
as your friend.

334
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,750
Or do you think we are not friends?

335
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,110
It's just because

336
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,190
I think we're only friends.

337
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,350
What do you mean?

338
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,350
Zhu Wenyu

339
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,870
found this book for you, right?

340
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,070
The class is about to start. I'll get some water.

341
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,630
Ling Chao.

342
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,550
Why did you reject her?

343
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:35,950
What about you?

344
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,670
Why did you help her find that book?

345
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,230
Do you think Yin Xinlan

346
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,110
would suddenly get interested in computers?

347
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,390
I knew you wanted that book.

348
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,070
You knew that?

349
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,630
-If you knew it, why did you... -So what?

350
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:57,110
I could pretend that I didn't know. Then it would be fine, right?

351
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,830
It's just a book.

352
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,670
As long as she's happy, she can give it to anyone.

353
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,310
You don't have to always be like this.

354
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,750
You don't owe her anything.

355
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,310
That's not right.

356
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,430
I owe it to her.

357
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,550
In junior high school,

358
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,310
I was very fat.

359
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,990
Everyone laughed at me

360
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,470
and bullied me.

361
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,870
Only she didn't despise me.

362
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,830
She discussed with me about problems.

363
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,430
She smiled at me.

364
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,350
She even asked me if I wanted to drink yogurt.

365
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,790
She's always so perfect,

366
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,070
but she has never looked down on

367
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,510
such an imperfect me.

368
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,030
Therefore, since then, I've made up my mind.

369
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,950
I swore that

370
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,390
I would study hard enough

371
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,550
so as to become a better man.

372
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,750
Only then can I deserve to be her friend.

373
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,790
No one is perfect.

374
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,390
Don't think like that.

375
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,630
Besides, the key of being friends is sincerity.

376
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,550
It has nothing to do with whether you deserve it or not.

377
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,590
Sincerity?

378
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,150
Yes.

379
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,910
You're handsome.

380
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,030
You're also

381
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,069
smart.

382
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,270
Many people want to make friends with you.

383
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:11,710
If you want something,

384
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,349
others will give it to you voluntarily.

385
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,990
Isn't it too easy for you

386
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,349
to get others' sincerity?

387
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,950
It's so easy that you don't even want to take a look.

388
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,390
You even rejected other people's regard for you

389
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,030
so casually again and again.

390
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,589
So you think I consider my rejection to Yin Xinlan

391
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,150
as a pleasure?

392
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,430
Isn't it the fact?

393
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,190
Fine.

394
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,630
If you want to think like this, it's not wrong.

395
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,310
At least, I did everything for myself,

396
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,390
not for others.

397
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,270
What about you?

398
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,870
You did all these things

399
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,870
just in order to make yourself feel touched.

400
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,070
Can someone like you understand how I feel?

401
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,350
You have no right to judge my life.

402
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,830
You are my superstar.

403
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,030
It's a little cold outside.

404
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,590
Wear a scarf.

405
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,150
No, no.

406
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,070
There are heaters in the mall and in the cinema.

407
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,230
I just need to stay at the entrance for a while.

408
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,590
It should be fine.

409
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,950
Hold my hand.

410
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,750
Coming.

411
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:17,470
You...

412
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,790
How come your face is injured?

413
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,830
Did you fight?

414
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,430
No.

415
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,630
I was hit by a basketball.

416
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,310
Did you really get hurt by a basketball?

417
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,110
You played shot-put, right?

418
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,910
Come on. Let me have a look.

419
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,310
Ma'am.

420
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,350
Can you be gentle?

421
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,510
I'm trying to be gentle to you.

422
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,510
Did you catch a cold?

423
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,710
No.

424
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:52,830
My deskmate caught a cold.

425
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,950
Are you going to take that again?

426
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,710
You've been afraid of taking medicine since childhood.

427
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,470
You're a grown man now,

428
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,590
but you haven't made any progress at all.

429
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,990
It's a waste that you've grown so tall.

430
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,830
So don't waste your time.

431
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,150
I won't be tricked.

432
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,350
Just dream of it.

433
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,070
The price of a packet of Mylikes Chocolate has increased to three yuan.

434
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,750
It'll be a waste to let you eat it.

435
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,870
It costs three yuan now.

436
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,070
So expensive.

437
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,910
Should I...

438
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,950
You...

439
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,750
-...give it a try? -No!

440
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,550
Let go!

441
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,030
Don't throw up.

442
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,750
You're as gullible as you used to be when you were a kid.

443
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,990
What's that look on your face?

444
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,350
I just fed you medicine.

445
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,270
Why do you have that expression as if I forced you to be a prostitute?

446
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,510
You pressed my wound.

447
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,230
It seems to be more swollen now.

448
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,870
I'll cook an egg for you so that you can apply it to your wound.

449
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:11,830
After eating this,

450
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,390
you'll get over your cold.

451
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,430
No!

452
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,390
Then eat this.

453
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,430
This is an elixir.

454
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,030
It's not bitter at all.

455
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,430
It's true. It's very sweet.

456
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,230
Taste it.

457
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,150
I didn't lie to you, right?

458
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,350
Eat another one.

459
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,750
It's so bitter.

460
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,310
Godmother.

461
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,350
Chao took the pill.

462
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,630
Actually, I heard

463
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,870
the conversation bwtween you and Ling Chao

464
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,910
on the playground that day.

465
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,390
Thank you for caring about me and taking care of me all the time.

466
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,910
However,

467
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,590
I didn't expect that there was such a plot in the story previously.

468
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,470
I can't even remember it clearly.

469
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,510
Actually, I know

470
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,910
it was just a trivial matter

471
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,390
to you.

472
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,750
But it has really affected me a lot.

473
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,310
In fact, I've been praised a lot

474
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,830
since childhood.

475
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,190
But I know in most cases, people just praised me to show courtesy.

476
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,710
Therefore,

477
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,710
I'm surprised to hear you say that.

478
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,150
Am I really as good as you said?

479
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,950
No matter what others think of you,

480
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,510
you're the best.

481
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,030
Then why don't you think of yourself like that?

482
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,470
Actually, you're very good, too.

483
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,910
You don't have to envy the brightness

484
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,190
of the sunshine in summer.

485
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,030
Though the sunshine in winter lasts for a short time,

486
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,510
it's also very warm.

487
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,590
Actually, I've thought a lot these days.

488
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,150
The sun won't change its regular pattern

489
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,670
because of people's preference.

490
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,390
Therefore,

491
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,790
we shouldn't lose ourselves so easily

492
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,150
because of others.

493
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,390
Will the sun in winter

494
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,470
become the sun in summer one day?

495
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,630
Of course.

496
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,230
It'll be the deadline this weekend.

497
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,630
Do you want to see it with me?

498
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,870
I'll go.

499
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,310
The teacher in Yin Zihan's class delayed the time of ending the lecture?

500
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,390
I don't think so.

501
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,990
Just now I saw Zhang Danian

502
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,310
running faster than being chased by zombies.

503
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,310
Aren't they in the same class?

504
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,990
It took them so long to buy their lunch.

505
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,870
Have they gone to plant vegetables or kill pigs?

506
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,190
Will they be able to have lunch before the end of this year?

507
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,430
Yin Zihan is so pitiful.

508
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,270
He's sick, but no one even cares about him.

509
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,750
He's absent today, but poeple don't even know about that.

510
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,990
I'm such a gossiper. I don't even know the news,

511
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,310
but you actually know it?

512
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,230
What happened?

513
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,790
When I went to the office to deliver the homework,

514
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,190
I heard it from their teacher.

515
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,070
His teacher said that he seemed to catch a cold and have a fever yesterday.

516
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,750
Yesterday?

517
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:19,510
No.

518
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,110
Do you want some?

519
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,630
Do you think I should call Yin Zihan

520
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,550
to show my concern?

521
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,110
If someone has a cold and has a fever, what he needs most is to sleep.

522
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,150
What if he's taking a rest?

523
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,950
As the cause of his illness, you should behave yourself.

524
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,750
You're really something.

525
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,390
You even forgot about your appointment with him.

526
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,430
Well,

527
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,310
I can send a message to show my concern?

528
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,950
That's more like it.

529
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,710
Write the message sincerely.

530
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,790
You should write it so sincerely that he'll forgive you as soon as he reads it.

531
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,830
Yin Zihan.

532
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,390
Are you feeling better?

533
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,990
I'll visit you after school.

534
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:08,350
I didn't mean to stand you up yesterday.

535
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,550
It's not straightforward enough, right?

536
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,110
It's my fault. Do whatever you want to punish me.

537
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,470
It's too hard.

538
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,430
What should I write to show my sincerity?

539
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,270
It's hard to heal a broken heart.

540
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,590
You can only exchange your sincerity for his sincerity.

541
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,710
Where did you go yesterday?

542
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,910
Just tell the truth

543
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,270
and ask for his forgiveness.

544
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,190
It was all because of Ling Chao.

545
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,390
Ling Chao?

546
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,710
You look like a sissy.

547
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,830
No matter how manly you look,

548
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,670
you still have to tie your shoelaces into a bow.

549
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,950
You have a sharp tongue when you argue with others.

550
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,350
How come you look weak while drinking water?

551
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,910
It's because I was hit by someone.

552
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,630
Why do you hold a grudge?

553
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,110
Why don't you let me hit you in return？

554
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:23,590
Just hit me.

555
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,990
Now it's not Lan who is giving this book to you.

556
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,070
I'm giving it to you.

557
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,430
Will you accept it?

558
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,830
Forget it.

559
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,990
This book brought bad luck.

560
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,670
I got one from Xiao Tu.

561
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,710
Xiao Tu?

562
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,070
It's impossible that she would have this book.

563
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,390
Who knows?

564
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,350
Alright, alright.

565
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,150
Take it.

566
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,230
It's inauspicious.

567
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,910
How about this?

568
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,550
Lan has no choice now.

569
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,750
I'll give all these three bottles to you today.

570
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,710
If you don't make a choice,

571
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,830
I can't sleep or study.

572
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,910
You'll have to be responsible for me.

573
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,670
Remember.

574
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,430
I love you.

575
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,190
Lan!

576
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,030
Hello.

577
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,830
Yin Zihan.

578
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,390
Are you okay?

579
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,710
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

580
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,870
I deserve to die.

581
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,550
Just punish me.

582
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,830
You can ask me to do anything.

583
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:05,790
It's all right.

584
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,910
I just have a fever.

585
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,070
I'll get recovered soon.

586
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,390
But you...

587
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:12,950
I'm fine.

588
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,030
My body

589
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,190
needs to be disinfected and sterilized occasionally.

590
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,870
As I'm thinking about this,

591
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,030
I should thank you

592
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:23,430
for stimulating my immunity.

593
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,910
I didn't do it on purpose that day.

594
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,150
I was ready to go out.

595
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,750
But Ling Chao suddenly got hurt and came to my home.

596
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:34,750
I should have called you and told you about it.

597
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,790
Ling Chao is injured?

598
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,630
It's nothing. It's just a skin trauma.

599
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,110
Xiao Tu.

600
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,190
Do you

601
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,030
regard Ling Chao as your best friend?

602
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,470
Of course.

603
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,230
Is he a better friend than me?

604
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,150
Well...

605
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,310
It's okay.

606
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,510
I'm suddenly not interested in it anymore.

607
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,710
I'm a little sleepy.

608
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,630
I'm going to bed.

609
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,110
Haven't you come to my home to do your winter vacation homework?

610
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,030
I was just about to ask the person who invented homework.

611
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,630
Does he have a conscience?

612
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,030
He doesn't even let us feel peaceful in the Spring Festival.

613
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,590
I remember he seems to be a foreigner.

614
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:51,670
He probably doesn't know there's another country

615
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,710
where people need to celebrate the Spring Festival.

616
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,310
You should do some of your homework.

617
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,390
How are you going to explain it after you go back if it's still blank?

618
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,910
You're right.

619
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,750
Xue is so cruel.

620
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,030
He tore off the pages with the reference answers.

621
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,510
Let me ask you.

622
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,310
If you encounter a question that you don't know how to answer,

623
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,750
will you call Ling Chao

624
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,470
or Yin Zihan first?

625
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,590
I'll surely call Ling Chao first.

626
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,230
Ling Chao and I have the Familiarity Numbers.

627
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,870
There are so many questions which I don't know how to answer.

628
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,950
If I call Yin Zihan,

629
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,190
the phone bill will usually be very high.

630
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,510
What if you don't have the Familiarity Numbers?

631
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,910
I'll go find him next door.

632
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,830
I think

633
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,590
the person you really like

634
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,150
is Ling Chao.

635
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,190
Are you crazy?

636
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,070
Don't you know my relationship with Ling Chao?

637
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,950
Right.

638
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,270
First come, first served.

639
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,630
You can become a couple as long as you two are not biological siblings.

640
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,750
You have a special relationship with Ling Chao.

641
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,870
Last year, you told me so confidently that

642
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,470
I liked Yin Zihan.

643
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,150
I really thought I liked Yin Zihan.

644
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,070
Now you're telling me that I like Ling Chao?

645
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,190
So you've been talking nonsense?

646
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,070
I was so young that

647
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,390
I believed your false statements.

648
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,230
Ridiculous.

649
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,390
I'm an amazing fortune teller from Yidong who can predicate everything so accurately.

650
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,230
Would I talk nonsense?

651
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,150
If I can't even judge this,

652
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,710
I would have read these books in vain, right?

653
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,510
What books are you reading?

654
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,070
If there's any question which I don't know how to answer,

655
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,670
I'll call you.

656
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,110
For my phone package, both parties on the call will be charged.

657
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,230
I just want to make your phone bill so high.

658
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,630
Are you really not going to have dinner at my home?

659
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,310
No.

660
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,790
My mom is coming back from a business trip tonight.

661
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,150
I'm going back home to have dinner.

662
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,350
Alright.

663
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,550
Let's have another appointment next time.

664
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,510
Bye.

665
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,150
Bye.

666
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,630
Mu Yehan?

667
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,429
Xiao Tu!

668
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,710
Where is my "Mu Yehan"?
