1
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,171
P’Johan.

2
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:21,453
I really wanna talk to you.

3
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:25,210
Why are you being so nice to me?

4
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:28,217
Because I like you.

5
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:30,091
Then I don’t want your money.

6
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:32,480
What do you mean?

7
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,320
What are you doing?

8
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:37,853
Why? I can’t hug you?

9
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:40,967
From now on, there’ll be only good things happening.

10
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,211
- Come on.
- What?

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,140
We're late. We're late.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,040
Ter! Are you awake? We're late.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,680
Ter!

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,340
Ter. We're running late. Are you up?

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,790
- Still asleep?
- Why are you shouting? I'm sleeping.

16
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,970
This is not the time to sleep.
Get up.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,220
Wake up.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,770
- No.
- You're late.

19
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,730
- Give me 10 more mins.
- 10 mins your ass. Get up!

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,620
Come on.

21
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,110
Get up and go shower.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,660
Still asleep?
Do not slow down. Go.

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,840
Dude.

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,670
I wanna sleep.
Why are you waking me up?

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,340
Come on. You're late.
Don't continue to sleep in there.

26
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,630
Here.

27
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,910
Thank you.

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,860
Enough with that sleepy face.

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,230
Um.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,790
- I know.
- Go to your class.

31
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,560
- Go go.
- I'm gonna go now.

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,460
- Drive safe.
- See you.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,970
You should eat more.

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,800
I already eat a lot nowadays.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,330
Hey Ter.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,520
Why are you looking so pouty here?

37
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,020
I'm sleepy.

38
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,150
Where's Foam?

39
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,080
Dropping a girl off at Science faculty.

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,510
Instead of picking me up.

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,000
- And how did you get here?
- By myself.

42
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,860
Let's go to class.

43
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,710
That's it for today. Class dismissed.

44
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,460
Hey dude.

45
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,040
This is the video of our meds student, right?

46
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,710
Who is it?

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,250
You cannot tell, right?

48
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,980
Maybe I will tell, when I'm successful.

49
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,920
Do you think that person is watching this right now?

50
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,330
Probably.

51
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,550
Would you like to say something to that person?

52
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,380
I miss you.

53
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,440
Which faculty is that person studying?
Can you tell us?

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,180
Do you wanna guess?

55
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,530
Meds students have to be with nurses for sure.

56
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,860
No.

57
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,450
Then management?

58
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,670
No.

59
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,340
Engineering?

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,620
No, I'll give you one more try.

61
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,170
I'll just randomly guess.

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,520
Vet student?

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,380
Correct.

64
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,650
We finally got a clue guys!

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,670
Last question
before I let you continue your study.

66
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,430
If you made it with this relationship,
what would you like to tell this person?

67
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,240
I'll do my best to take care of you.

68
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,950
Why am I not that person?
Thank you so much. Thank you.

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,200
Hey Ter.

70
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,810
Are you still here?

71
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,650
Is your soul out of your body?

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,590
Shit.

73
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm blushing for you.

74
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
What a hot doctor he is.

75
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,990
Yeah I'm going crazy here.

76
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,880
And why did you just breath out like that?

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,610
Guys.

78
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,690
What if people find out that it was me?
What am I gonna do?

79
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,050
Why do you  have to do anything?

80
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,510
You don't have to do anything.
Don't have to be stressed.

81
00:05:16,477 --> 00:05:18,191
Are you done with your class?

82
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:20,388
Yes, I am.

83
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:23,179
I'm watching your interview clip right now.

84
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,542
Ahh. You saw it.

85
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:26,005
Yes, I did.

86
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,951
Who allowed you to say that to the camera?

87
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:30,413
Are you blushing?

88
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,908
No, I'm not.

89
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:38,493
Really?

90
00:05:38,736 --> 00:05:41,568
I bet your face must be so red right now.

91
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:43,204
I wanna see.

92
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,567
No, it's not.

93
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:54,958
Even though I already said it on the video clip,
but let me say it again.

94
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:56,515
Say what?

95
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,035
I miss you.

96
00:06:06,924 --> 00:06:07,638
Um.

97
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,709
Have you eaten?

98
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:12,896
Not yet.

99
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:17,677
Are you done with your class?
Shall we go find something to eat?

100
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,090
My class is done.

101
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,666
Then let's go for some food.

102
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:26,896
Umm.

103
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,950
Hello.

104
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:03,490
Can I get one Americano
and a cocoa drink please?

105
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,270
And also one banoffee please.

106
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,820
Sure. Wait a moment.

107
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,680
- Thank you.
- Look at that guy.

108
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,470
He's so hot like a model.

109
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,470
Lower your voice. He already has a boyfriend.

110
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,110
You're not my boyfriend?

111
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,450
No, I'm not.

112
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,750
And when will you be?

113
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,880
Keep trying until you're successful.

114
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,120
Later.

115
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,480
Is it good?

116
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,010
It is.

117
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,410
Is it as good as my mom's?

118
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,530
Why does it taking so long to think?

119
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,850
Just kidding.

120
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,050
Mom's is the best.

121
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,810
Mom?

122
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,330
I kinda miss that time too.

123
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,430
When I liked to hang out at your cafe after tutoring.

124
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,840
Tutoring?

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,060
Um.

126
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,360
You were tutored too?

127
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,920
Even before that.

128
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,640
Before that?

129
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,280
You've been to my cafe
before you even know me?

130
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,550
Oh umm.

131
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,760
Here.

132
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,130
Here. I give you the banana.

133
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,220
Sir.

134
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,160
What's going on?

135
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,530
Your grandpa is asking to see you immediately.

136
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,700
Oh...I'm drowning.

137
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,910
Over.

138
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,460
Ter. Why are you standing there?

139
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,910
You might get a cold.

140
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,860
It's getting colder outside.

141
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,690
Come inside.

142
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,630
Shut the door when you come in too.

143
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,230
If not, we all will have a cold.

144
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,310
Um.

145
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,790
I'm gonna go shower.

146
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,590
What happened?

147
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,860
You're suddenly gone.

148
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,950
Is everything okay?

149
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,150
Call me when you're free please.

150
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,210
Ter.

151
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,180
You're not going anywhere today?

152
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,130
No. I don't have any class today.

153
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,370
I will be at the faculty today.

154
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,790
Might come home late.

155
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,430
Are you okay?

156
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,680
You don't seem to be okay since yesterday.

157
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,130
I'm not really okay like you said.

158
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,710
About P'Hill?

159
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,780
He's just gone.

160
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,530
I texted him, but he hasn't replied.

161
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,610
I called. He also didn't answer.

162
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,420
You're worried about him, huh?

163
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,930
Yeah that too.

164
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:06,910
And also...

165
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,050
you're afraid that he'll leave you again, right?

166
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,290
Is it so bad that I think that way?

167
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,720
Not really.

168
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,800
You've been through this before.

169
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,040
It's not wrong to be traumatized.

170
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,760
Come on.

171
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,280
It'll be okay. Don't overthink.

172
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,130
If you cannot get in touch of P'Hill,
then contact his friends.

173
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,500
It's not good that you're overthinking like this.

174
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,640
- You should go.
- I'm gonna go now.

175
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,550
- Yeah.
- Don't think too much.

176
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,880
Do not miss me.

177
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,950
You can only miss P'Hill.

178
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,760
- P'Jo.
- Oh Ter.

179
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,520
Have you heard from P'Hill?

180
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,570
Heard there's an emergency at home
but nobody can get a hold of him since then.

181
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,070
I was gonna ask you too
whether you hear anything from him?

182
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,680
I also have no clue.

183
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,230
The other day his family just came to get him.

184
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,560
He just said don't worry.

185
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,570
He'll be back as soon as possible.

186
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,410
He told you that?

187
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,150
Yes.

188
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,300
But he just disappeared like this.
How can I not be worried?

189
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,600
Don't overthink.
If he said he'll be back, he will be back.

190
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,220
Really?

191
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,330
Yeah.

192
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,330
Hey. Answer me.

193
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,440
Why can't I contact you?

194
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,520
Are you okay?

195
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,940
P'Jo also cannot contact you.

196
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,860
You should keep me updated too.

197
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,792
Do you have any idea that P'Jo, P'Fah, and P'Arthit are worried about you?

198
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,080
And I am too.

199
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm worried.

200
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,345
And now I'm almost mad at you if you don't text me back in 2 hrs.

201
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,648
Okay. Now, I'm mad and do not ask me to forgive you.

202
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:53,548
I've been calling you and now my fingers are numb.

203
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,010
You're not there?
And when will you be back?

204
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,980
P'Jo told me he came to see you and you're not there.

205
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,600
You're having a getaway trip?

206
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,060
If you are,
I will never forget you.

207
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,550
When you're back, I'll squeeze every single details out of you.

208
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,360
You'll have to buy me snacks too.

209
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,230
You grandpa scolds at you or something?

210
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,990
Next time, bring me to meet him.

211
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,350
Jo. I wanna see him.

212
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:46,190
Come get him for me. I cannot drive.

213
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:51,170
You're calling me,
but not gonna try to explain anything at all?

214
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,189
Help me.

215
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,940
P'Hill?

216
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:22,570
This is not Hill.

217
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:27,690
P'Johan?

218
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,020
I'm in front of your dorm.

219
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,330
Is your roommate here?

220
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,070
North is not back yet.

221
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,250
He will be home late today.

222
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,270
Oh and...

223
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,990
where are you going?

224
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,880
There's a sudden call...

225
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,910
from the number
that we've been trying to contact.

226
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,180
He just called and ordered me around.

227
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,190
Damn him.
He just called and ordered me around.

228
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,380
Damn him.

229
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,190
He's gone for 2 days
and doesn't explain anything.

230
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,070
The first word he said in the call
was so annoying.

231
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,800
What was the word?

232
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,430
'I wanna see him~'

233
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,880
Let's go. Get in the car.

234
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,470
Sure.

235
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,320
He asked me to do this,

236
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,950
I wanna make sure
that I deliver you to his hands myself.

237
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,720
Knock.

238
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:56,430
I also wanna see a person
who said he cannot drive.

239
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,180
Try again.

240
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,630
P'Hill

241
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,000
That's a little too much.

242
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm still here.

243
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,810
Hello?

244
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,290
Hello?

245
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,850
Hill. Hello?

246
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,420
Hello?

247
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,180
Hello?

248
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,120
Can you see me?

249
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,520
P'Hill. You can let me go.

250
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,380
Thank you.

251
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,180
No problem.

252
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,630
You are okay now?

253
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,350
Fah and Arthit are also worried about you.

254
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,470
I'm okay now.

255
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,040
Let's talk later.

256
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,840
I should've taken some pictures.

257
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,690
Never thought I'd see this side of yours.

258
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,160
I'm gonna leave now.

259
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,500
Wait P'Jo. Are you leaving?

260
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,970
Yeah.

261
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,810
Why didn't you call me when you're back?

262
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,210
I was worried sick.

263
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,880
I wanted to surprise you.

264
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,580
You're too close.

265
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,090
I miss you.

266
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,710
I wanna see you up close.

267
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,030
You want me to dry your hair?

268
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,210
Sure.

269
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,060
Then first of all,
you should put some clothes on.

270
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,210
Please.

271
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,300
P'Hill.

272
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,030
Done.

273
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,810
Thank you.

274
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,750
Sure. You're welcome.

275
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,410
I dry North's hair everyday.

276
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,930
Can I be jealous of him?

277
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,390
No, you can't.

278
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,510
What are you doing?

279
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,260
I wanna hug you.

280
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
I miss you.

281
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,920
That's enough.

282
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:07,440
I can hear your heart beat just fine
without having to use stethoscope.

283
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,040
And why is that?

284
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,170
Are you blushing?

285
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,870
That's cute.

286
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,090
Let me go, P'Hill.

287
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,290
Can I have 10 more minutes?

288
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,240
This is nice.

289
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,730
I can see you whenever I want.

290
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,370
How are you?

291
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,840
I miss you.

292
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,120
I didn't ask about me.

293
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:01,840
I mean what happened when you were gone?

294
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,400
There's a little situation.

295
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,880
Was it good or bad?

296
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,690
It went very well.

297
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,900
My grandma is back.

298
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,600
Back?

299
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,270
- She has woken up.
- Really?

300
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,130
Umm.

301
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,330
I'm so happy for you. That's good.

302
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,200
Thank you.

303
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,120
When I arrived at the hospital,

304
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,880
- Mom!
- Hill.

305
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,820
- What happened?
- Grandma is awake.

306
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,010
- Really?
- Um.

307
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,930
Doctor is now examining her right now.

308
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,900
Grandpa and dad are in front of her room.
Let's go see her.

309
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,840
Let's go.

310
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,230
I was so happy.

311
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,310
I was busy at the hospital.

312
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,540
- so I didn't get to check my phone.
- Ok.

313
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,710
That's great that she's awake.

314
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,850
Right?

315
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,870
But you look so tired.

316
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,020
Cause I haven't slept.

317
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,560
As soon as I'm back here,

318
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:46,220
I called Johan to take you here.

319
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,920
That's good.

320
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
That P'Jo came to get me instead of you.

321
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,760
But to be honest,

322
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,110
you don't have to rush to see me.

323
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,190
- Just calling to let me know is more than enough.
- But I wanna see you.

324
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,500
I don't want you to wait too long.

325
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,050
Here. You're seeing me now.
Now it's time for you to sleep.

326
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,530
But I have so many things I wanna talk to you.

327
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,040
- We can talk later.
- No.

328
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,270
- Yes.
- No.

329
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,310
Fine. Fine.
What would you like to talk?

330
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,050
Do you wanna ask me anything?

331
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,550
Can you tell me?

332
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,480
When you first moved here...how was it for you?

333
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,920
Bad.

334
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,350
Everyday goes by with the feeling of missing,

335
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,600
guilt...

336
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,810
...and also sadness.

337
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,490
Everyday,

338
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,630
I always read books in my room.

339
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,390
Grandpa's aim is for me
to enroll meds school with the 1st rank.

340
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,900
It was not easy.

341
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,690
And you didn't go out anywhere?

342
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,550
Um.

343
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,970
Because of what happened between us,

344
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,920
my grandpa grounded me until I go to university.

345
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,410
I rarely met anyone.

346
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,270
That's why...

347
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:29,390
...you disappeared from me.

348
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,030
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine. Really. It's fine.

349
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,220
You don't have to apologize.

350
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,110
But I really thought that way...

351
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,310
...that you dumped me.

352
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,070
But as soon as I got into meds school,
I tried to contact you.

353
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,500
But I couldn't.

354
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,370
Why did you change your number?

355
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:59,140
Oh...cause I also fought with my family.

356
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,910
That bad?

357
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,260
Umm...yeah kind of.

358
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,550
Actually...

359
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,220
since the day my dad came to pick me up from your place,

360
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,920
we had a very big fight.

361
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,130
And I always fought with him everyday since then.

362
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,660
That's why I decided to left my home

363
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,600
and changed my phone number.

364
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,010
But I actually stayed with a relative.

365
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,620
I think my dad knew.

366
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,840
My mom called me from time to time.

367
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,800
But when I got into this university,
I just moved here right away.

368
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,980
Since that day...

369
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,930
I still haven't gone home.

370
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,190
Oh P'Hill. I also talked to Christ already.

371
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,160
She said my dad is no longer mad at me.

372
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,260
That's good.

373
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,870
So does this mean we are all clear?
Understand everything?

374
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,770
Um.

375
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,150
Then I will continue with my attempt then?

376
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,340
10 mins is over. Let go of me.

377
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,480
A bit more please.

378
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,240
- Can I?
- You quota is gone.

379
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,840
Stop with the clinginess.

380
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,920
What are you doing?

381
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,290
Come sit here.

382
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,470
I already replied your text.

383
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,800
You replied to me now? I will unfriend you.

384
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,750
- I thought you wanted me to reply you?
- Previously yes.

385
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,670
Not now.

386
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,750
You were worried about me.

387
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:22,460
You're not now?

388
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,310
Really? You're not?

389
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:35,040
You sent so many messages.
You said you were gonna squeeze my neck for information.

390
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,940
So?

391
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,180
And do you have anything else to tell me?

392
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,110
You haven't squeeze my neck though.

393
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,160
I'm not telling then.

394
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,350
Come on.

395
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,450
There's no come on.

396
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,340
Let me go.

397
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,610
Do you still want me to buy you dessert?

398
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,550
If you don't let me go, I will have you buy me more dessert,
until your bank account is empty.

399
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,430
I guess I will be buying for you in the next 10 years.

400
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:13,030
Can you be with me for another 10 years?

401
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,510
Stop talking and let me go.

402
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,400
You like to talk nonsense.

403
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,150
Ter.

404
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,790
Yes?

405
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,880
I love you.

406
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,400
I love you too.

407
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,340
Having you by my side like this is like a dream.

408
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,110
I used to think...

409
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,660
if one day I have you by my side,

410
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,550
if one day I get to meet you again...

411
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,390
just once...

412
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,790
I will do anything in my power for you.

413
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:10,950
Give me one more chance
to take care of you once again please.

414
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,570
Will you be my boyfriend?

415
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,390
Yes.

416
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,360
You were gone the whole night.

417
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,340
Left me here alone.

418
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,420
How was it?

419
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,930
Are you guys boyfriends?

420
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,270
You're looking like this...

421
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,270
you guys did it, right?

422
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,640
What?

423
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,660
So?

424
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:02,630
Are you ready to make it official?

425
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,410
Make what official, North?

426
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,310
About you and P'Hill.

427
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,600
Believe me.
Not long until the whole campus finds out.

428
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,450
Let's not talk about my business.
Let's talk our business.

429
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,790
I just met aunty, the owner.
She was asking for our rental payment.

430
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,440
Aunty again?

431
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,950
Always asking for the payment.

432
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,160
I can't be a few days behind at all.

433
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,630
But you can't do that every month, can you?

434
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,830
But I am never not paying her.

435
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,190
I just don't have the money at the moment.

436
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,260
Cause look at the way you spend your money.

437
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,350
Computer. Games.
Models the whole shelf.

438
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:43,690
If you sell all those,
you'll have a lot of money.

439
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,560
I think those are cool.

440
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:49,540
Stop with the ignoring.
What about you?

441
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,850
About me what?

442
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,720
Pretending not to know?
I'm talking about you and P'Johan.

443
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,350
Are you guys together?

444
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,460
P'Jo asked me about you last night too.
So sweet.

445
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,050
Ugh. So Sleepy.

446
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,820
- Why are you sleepy?
- I'm gonna go to bed.

447
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,070
Where're you going? You cannot sleep.
Today is Saturday, you need to work at P'Thun's

448
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,790
I played games all night.

449
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,700
Let me get some sleep.
I'm gonna nap a bit.

450
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,270
North. You're making excuses.

451
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,430
Answer me first!

452
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,670
I know that you guys are actually together now.
Stop pretending.

453
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,180
Answer me first.

454
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,890
Here are your cake and coffee.

455
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,950
Be careful.

456
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,600
Please take this.

457
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,550
You're still stressed?

458
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,110
If you were me,
you would be stressed too.

459
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,750
What's going on these two?

460
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,440
Er...so...

461
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,180
P'Thun.

462
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,940
Yeah?

463
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:08,950
Can I borrow you twenty or thirty thousands Baht?

464
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,020
Huh!?

465
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:15,150
- Twenty or thirty thousands?
- Yes.

466
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,830
Who would lend you that kind of money?

467
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,310
But...

468
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,330
why do you need that much money?

469
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,370
I need to pay for tuition and also for my drorm.

470
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,280
I forgot to pay.

471
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,510
Forgot?

472
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,550
I already used the money to pay for my computer.

473
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,000
- What!? For computer?
- Yes.

474
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,680
Whatever.

475
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,410
You used the money for your gaming computer.

476
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,510
But you forgot to pay for where you sleep.

477
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,350
If the aunty cuts the utilities, I'll kill you.

478
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:47,920
- Why didn't you remind me?
- I told you to talk to P'Johan about this, but you wouldn't do it.

479
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,090
No.

480
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,030
I don't wanna discuss money with P'Jo.

481
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,830
- No way.
- I'm going crazy.

482
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,410
Er....P'Thun also...

483
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,830
when will I get paid?

484
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,180
Your salary?

485
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,960
Yeah I was gonna talk to you about that.

486
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,470
Someone wants to buy my cafe.

487
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,490
Buy this cafe?

488
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,990
Why are you guys surprising?

489
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,450
I actually didn't wanna sell it.
But...

490
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,040
the offer is really good.
I'm preparing all the documents at the moment. It will be done soon.

491
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,220
Can I ask you something?

492
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,390
What?

493
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,090
Who is it? The buyer?

494
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,310
I also don't know
cause he sends someone to deal with this on his behalf.

495
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:39,310
Don't be paranoid.
You still have your job. Just change the owner. That's it.

496
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,550
I'm gonna go check on customers.

497
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:49,150
Dude.
Why is this happening to me when I have a problem?

498
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,430
- Right.
- Are we gonna get paid or not?

499
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,590
Oh hey.

500
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,440
I heard you talked to Ter about Johan.

501
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,180
Are you two like really close?

502
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:21,090
Not exactly, but yeah we kinda are. I guess.

503
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,390
He's been flirting with you, right?

504
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,980
How many times have I warned you about Johan?

505
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,840
Everyone knows that he's a player.

506
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,580
I warn you because I care about you,
you know that right?

507
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,100
I'm sorry,
but I heard that P'Johan stops talking to many people already.

508
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,240
Being a player is not easily stopped overnight.

509
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,480
I told you all these
because I hope the best for you, you know?

510
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,340
I care about you a lot.

511
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,120
You know?

512
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,820
- P'Jo!
- Hey.

513
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,350
Wait.

514
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,310
Where are you taking my staff?

515
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,810
- He's not.
- Not what?

516
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,230
Not yours.

517
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,150
Can I order some drink and dessert?

518
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,170
Er...sure.

519
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,750
How come you're here?

520
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,240
P'Johan.

521
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,810
I'm tired.

522
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,660
Let me take some rest.

523
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,440
Hello, P'Hill.

524
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,210
Hi P'Jo.

525
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,400
You have class today?

526
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,390
Yeah had an appointment with the professor.

527
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,960
Your study is so intense.

528
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,900
P'Jo. North has something he wants to discuss with you.

529
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,920
Ter!

530
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,950
What is it?

531
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,550
Nothing.

532
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,850
- Ter was just babbling.
- Tell me.

533
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,940
Nothing.

534
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,250
Hill. Close your boyfriend's eyes.

535
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,600
Jo...you're too much.

536
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,000
Really?

537
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:59,920
Er...I'll just go help P'Thun downstairs.

538
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:02,830
Ter, I will go with you.

539
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,710
So what do you wanna discuss with me?
You haven't told me.

540
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,920
I will tell you after work.

541
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,610
But right now, I need to go back to work.

542
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,510
P'Hill. I will be back.

543
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,650
What?

544
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,710
Hey Ter.

545
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,840
Don't be quiet.

546
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,200
I'm not. I just don't know what to say.

547
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,230
P'Johan is so--

548
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,310
Even I'm your friend,
I still have never seen you like this before.

549
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,830
You guys are making me blush.
I can't get that off my head.

550
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,210
You should delete it from your head.

551
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:04,700
How much did you see?

552
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,580
A bit.

553
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,670
P'Johan is so daring.

554
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,810
I was like some air to you guys.

555
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,390
Thinking about it makes me blush again.

556
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,050
Stop it.

557
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,600
So what...?

558
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,630
Or do I have to be used to it?

559
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,240
Cause I might be seeing those more often?

560
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,850
Ughhh stop it.

561
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,960
You're so annoying.

562
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,420
North.

563
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,280
Why did you have to followed him like that?

564
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,930
I helped you.

565
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,850
Did you see the way he looked at me?

566
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,020
It was like he wants to kill me.

567
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,590
He just shook my hands off like this.
No manner at all.

568
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,010
Does he have to be that rude if he wants to be with you?

569
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,110
We can tell from these thst he's not trustworthy.

570
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,220
Does he force you to do anything else?

571
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,750
No.

572
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,600
Why don't you just reject him
if he keeps bugging you?

573
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,950
You mean P'Johan?

574
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,490
Yeah of course.

575
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,520
Why do you have to do whatever he tells you to do?

576
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,080
Actually...

577
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,290
he does not force me or anything.

578
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,000
Are you saying that...

579
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,830
you actually have feelings for him?

580
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,960
Wel...

581
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,150
I guess.

582
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,590
North. How many times have I told you?

583
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,020
Well...

584
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,820
I'm not saying that you're lying...

585
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,580
about P'Johan's rumor.

586
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,730
I know that too.
Not that I'm not aware.

587
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:46,750
But at the end...no matter how bad the rumors are,

588
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,350
I don't really care.

589
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,480
Cause he is nice to me.

590
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,840
It's the truth.

591
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,760
So I'm the losing one here.

592
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,780
I'm sorry.

593
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,170
That's okay.

594
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,260
I'm sorry too.

595
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,550
I was...

596
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,020
too hot headed.

597
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,090
I'm sorry.

598
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,290
I'll be back.

599
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,560
What actually just happened?

600
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,480
It's my fault.

601
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,640
for never really saying no to him.

602
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,460
Are you okay?

603
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,120
This is a big cafe.

604
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,020
- Hi P'Arthit.
- Hey.

605
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,250
Hello.

606
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,210
You're working?

607
00:44:58,631 --> 00:44:59,450
Yes.

608
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:01,850
P'Jo and P'Hill are upstairs.

609
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,560
Is this your friend?

610
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,240
Oh this is North.

611
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:09,170
Hello.

612
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:10,260
Hi.

613
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,200
North..?

614
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,780
This is the one?

615
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,810
Yeah this ond I told you about.

616
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,250
Oh.

617
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,490
Hi. I'm Tolfah and this is Arthit.

618
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,340
Yeah I'm North.

619
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,670
Can we order here?

620
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:32,450
Yes you can order here.
We will serve you when it's done.

621
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,680
Ok.

622
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,170
Please.

623
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:43,680
Oh there're customers?

624
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,300
Yes.

625
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,010
This is P'Khim, the new manager.

626
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,030
- Hello.
- Hi.

627
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:56,380
I'm sorry for showing up unannounced.
Prang told me the sooner I'm here that better.

628
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:57,940
Prang?

629
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,830
What's the matter?

630
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:09,300
I just thought Prang is the same name
with P'Johan's assistant.

631
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,080
But it's probably just a coincident.

632
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,070
Does he really doing this?

633
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:18,670
Ms.Khim...let's just go talk overthere.

634
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,620
Sure.

635
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,888
P'Prang...has P'Jo bought any coffee shop lately?

636
00:46:31,611 --> 00:46:34,659
Yes, the one thart you work at.

637
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:38,032
Don't know why. There are so much work.

638
00:46:43,626 --> 00:46:45,565
Wait...for real!?

639
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:48,945
Yeah for real. Not just that one.

640
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:51,797
He asked me to buy the bar too. Don't know why he wants it.

641
00:46:51,887 --> 00:46:53,037
Bar?

642
00:46:53,554 --> 00:46:55,820
Umm SoulOut bar.

643
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:59,512
He also said he wants to buy a Japanese restaurant too.

644
00:47:01,177 --> 00:47:02,330
Hey.

645
00:47:02,496 --> 00:47:03,807
Come on.

646
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,220
There're so many Japanese restaurants out there.

647
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,930
Probably not P'Yha's.

648
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,900
Will I get to actually work?

649
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:14,400
It's fine.

650
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:16,040
P'Johan does this to me again.

651
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,320
I'm going to serve these.

652
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:32,680
You guys are not going to study?

653
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,280
Here are your coffees.

654
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,400
- North.
- Yes.

655
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,550
You made this Americano?

656
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,220
Yes why?

657
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,300
It's so bitter, North.

658
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,510
I think...

659
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:11,910
there's only Jo who can drink this.

660
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,070
If you're complaining, you don't have to drink.

661
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,920
Yeah I'm not gonna drink it.
You drink it then.

662
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,460
Yeah It will be just me drinking.

663
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,190
I'm so sick.

664
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,680
Sick of Arthit's face?

665
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,310
Why me!?

666
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,420
P'Jo.

667
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,470
Let go of me.

668
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,960
Oh Jo.

669
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,040
Why don't you tell us that you bought this coffee shop?

670
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:53,020
Hey. Give me back all the money I spend here.

671
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,880
Why do I have to do that?

672
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:55,950
Hey.

673
00:48:56,030 --> 00:48:58,670
You're not gonna buy your friends coffee sometimes?

674
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:58,680
You can't pay for your own coffee?
You're not gonna buy your friends coffee sometimes?

675
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,610
You can't pay for your own coffee?

676
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,050
You spend all the money on girls?

677
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,190
Get out of my cafe.

678
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,480
Stop arguing.

679
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,250
P'Jo.

680
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,590
I have something I wanna talk to you.

681
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:17,180
Can we talk outside?

682
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,830
Um.

683
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,700
I'll be back.

684
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,910
P'.

685
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,570
You bought this cafe?

686
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,320
So?

687
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,580
I got fired from SoulOut.

688
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:52,520
It was you right?

689
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,230
I know that you have a lot of money.

690
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,080
But don't you think this is too much?

691
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,320
I told you to stop working.

692
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:07,330
But you never listened to me.
I told you to stop working.

693
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:08,920
But you never listened to me.

694
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,530
So now you work for me.

695
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:21,640
I will be going to Boston by the way.

696
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,570
P'.

697
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,130
You're going to Boston?

698
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:28,580
For work?

699
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,700
For how long?

700
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,370
Around 2 weeks.

701
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,130
So you have to take leaves from school?

702
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,410
Um.

703
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,990
And...

704
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,620
you will be okay right?

705
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,380
Well..

706
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,700
why am I not gonna be?

707
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,320
Just in case you miss me?

708
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:59,440
And what does Ter mean when he said...

709
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,110
you have something to tell me?

710
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,640
Well...

711
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:13,400
I don't have the money to pay for my tuition and dorm.

712
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:15,200
So...

713
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,450
I would like to borrow--

714
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,060
Borrow you.

715
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,780
From now on, if you wanna ask me for something...

716
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,000
just follow my conditions.

717
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,770
You want me to kiss you?

718
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,020
No.

719
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,000
I don't wanna borrow you anymore.

720
00:51:58,590 --> 00:51:59,800
This is just a deposit.

721
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,910
Thanks P'.

722
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,700
What's up?

723
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,890
So...

724
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,290
if you wanna be committed to him,

725
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,560
don't treat him like any other people.

726
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,970
I know.
You're acting just like Hill.

727
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,560
But that's good that it's him.

728
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,970
He's cute.

729
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,840
Don't have to be jealous.

730
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:54,450
I didn't mean it that way.

731
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,260
Hill told me...

732
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,700
that he's a chill guy.

733
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,580
Never stressed.

734
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,370
And also a very strong person.

735
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,920
If he's not like this, he can't be with you.

736
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:07,970
Not like that.

737
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,680
It's not good because of him that I'm with.

738
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:15,200
But because it's him...that's why everything is so special.

739
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,960
I never thought I'd get to see this side of yours.

740
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,670
You will go back with me today.

741
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,140
Are you sure?

742
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,710
Yeah.

743
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,900
Have I ever refused?

744
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,500
Yeah.

745
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,760
I probably won't be at the company for awhile.

746
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,650
What's up?

747
00:54:34,143 --> 00:54:36,284
I wanna ask whether have you seen my lab worksheet?

748
00:54:36,299 --> 00:54:39,659
The one I brought to study with Hill today.
I couldn't find it.

749
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,910
Yes.

750
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,376
You have it?

751
00:54:44,444 --> 00:54:45,281
Arthit has it.

752
00:54:45,437 --> 00:54:47,213
Why does he have it?

753
00:54:47,241 --> 00:54:49,077
And you didn't tell me he has it?

754
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:50,592
Cause he's not done.

755
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,274
Even if I asked, he's not gonna give it to me.

756
00:54:53,552 --> 00:54:57,992
Tell him to give it to me tomorrow.
Don't forget. I don't wanna talk to him.

757
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,670
Why me?

758
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,339
Come on.

759
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,540
Fine. Fine.

760
00:55:07,094 --> 00:55:08,474
Another thing.

761
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,157
You look stressed lately.

762
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:13,148
Like you're easily frustrated. Like more irritated.

763
00:55:13,256 --> 00:55:15,334
Hill said you have so much work?

764
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,648
Um just like what Hill said.

765
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:20,765
You have to work that hard?

766
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,740
I have to.

767
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:25,250
He said he'll hand over everything to me

768
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:26,660
before I graduate in a few years.

769
00:55:27,434 --> 00:55:28,456
Alright.

770
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:30,349
Don't work too hard then.

771
00:55:30,669 --> 00:55:31,757
I gotta go.

772
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,862
Don't forget to tell Arthit for me.

773
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,430
Um.

774
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,020
North.

775
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,270
North.

776
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,910
Yes?

777
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,590
Come here.

778
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:13,290
I'm exhausted.

779
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,750
Does this make you feel better?

780
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:26,900
Not yet.

781
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,536
When you said that you like me before we met.

782
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:12,511
What is the reason?

783
00:57:13,462 --> 00:57:14,562
Can you tell me about it?

784
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,616
Will you bring him to Boston with you?

785
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:20,881
I will take you to wherever you want.

786
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:23,237
I'm glad that it was you.

787
00:57:23,562 --> 00:57:25,340
He seems better when being with you.

788
00:57:25,429 --> 00:57:26,466
Go to take a shower.

789
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,315
Or we should take together?
