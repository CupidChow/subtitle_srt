1
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,160
Can you please reduce the interest for me?

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,160
Fine. I won’t charge you.

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,680
Will you do anything that I ask?

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,000
Talk to me please.

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,700
You just tell your story.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,460
Hello. I’m North.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,360
I’m a respectful person and also a good friend.

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,270
- I’m rooting for you.
- Huh?

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,840
About P’Jo.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,690
I think it’s cute when you guys talk.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,030
Since when did you like me?

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,760
Since the very beginning.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,570
Can I start all over again with you?

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,730
- I love you, Ter.
- I love you too.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,590
Run run. Follow me.

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,030
Meet my double guns.

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,800
Upstairs. Upstairs.

18
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,560
Huhh.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,780
You came home so late.
Went on a date?

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,660
There's no date.

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,800
Are you crazy?

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Why is your face so red?

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,400
North!

24
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,420
It hurts.
Don't tell me---

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,380
Umm.

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,040
How? Tell me.

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,770
We just said love to each other.

28
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,500
Damn...

29
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,680
You said you love him?

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,710
So are you guys boyfriends yet?

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,490
- Not yet.
- Hey.

32
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,800
Why not?

33
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,630
He hasn't said anything about that yet.

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,640
Just saying love to each other.

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,340
But not boyfriends yet.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,950
How?

37
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,540
It's like he's gonna do it later?

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,510
I don't know.

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,190
But that's good.

40
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,260
Why?

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,420
Good that you're being honest with yourself.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,150
So he knows that you love him.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,560
Umm.

44
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm also glad that I finally get to tell him how I feel.

45
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,700
Good job, my friend!

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,850
I'm so happy for him.

47
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,890
I think he must be really happy.

48
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,830
Really?

49
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,470
That hurts.

50
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,500
Hey.

51
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,610
By the way.

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,670
What happened?
How come you guys ended up saying love to each other?

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,920
You just suddenly did it out of the blue?
Or the vibes lead you there.

54
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,310
- Tell me. Please tell me.
- No, I won't tell you.

55
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,780
- Please~ Tell me. Please. Please.
- No, I'm too shy.

56
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,770
But I wanna know.

57
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,250
We just went out and then...

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,500
there's a kiss on the hand.

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,390
- Hand kissing?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,750
Don't ask more.

61
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,780
- More kissing anywhere else?
- North!

62
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,760
- Anywhere else? Tell me.
- No, I'm not telling you anymore.

63
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,410
- Or here?
- No.

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,500
Where else did you kiss each other?
Tell me.

65
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,090
Tell me. Just a tiny bit.

66
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,550
Hey what?

67
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,340
Come help me.
Stop procrasinating. Here.

68
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,650
Just a minute.

69
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,540
North.

70
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,440
You bought a new phone?

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,060
Someone actually bought it for me.

72
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,590
Someone bought it for you?

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,050
Who is it?

74
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,950
Do you know P'Johan?

75
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,950
Johan? Yes of course.
He's the popoular one.

76
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,810
Yes that guy bought it for him.

77
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,600
And why did he have to do that?

78
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,600
Are you seeing him?

79
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,720
No, I'm not.

80
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,660
I was in trouble the other day.

81
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,480
And he kind helped me with that.

82
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,230
I broke my phone, so he got me a new one.

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,660
Oh.

84
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,050
I thought you are seeing him.

85
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,980
But I heard that he's a real player, isn't he?

86
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,750
But it's fine.

87
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,300
So you have a debt now?

88
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,670
Yeah.

89
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,860
Unpredictable creditor too.

90
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,100
If you need anything just let me know.
In case I could help.

91
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,760
Okay?

92
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,890
You can increase my salary.

93
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,790
That one is not possible.

94
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,390
Hey but my relatives just opened a new place.
They're hiring too.

95
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,090
It's a bar nearby.

96
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,680
Are you interested?

97
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,960
But you might have to go home late though.

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm in.

99
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,650
I can go home late. it's fine.

100
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,250
But I don't have to work everyday, right?

101
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,910
I don't think so.

102
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,190
Wait a min.

103
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,080
You're working for 2 jobs already.

104
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,160
Are you sure?

105
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,170
I can do it. It's fine.
Are you sure?

106
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,330
I can do it. It's fine.

107
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,720
You're such a hard worker for a small guy.

108
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,400
I'm not a small guy.

109
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,690
Go go. Get to work.

110
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,580
Get to work already.

111
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,660
You're suddenly working hard, huh?

112
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,480
Go go.

113
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,810
Have to mopped here?

114
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,090
Oh North.

115
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,090
When you said you want extra jobs,

116
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,750
are you sure you can handle it?

117
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,170
I can.

118
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,460
I only work here on the weekends.

119
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,180
On weekdays after class, I'm pretty chilled.

120
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,800
How?

121
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,400
You already forgot about P'Yah's?

122
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,290
I only work there 2 days a week.
Not enough to cover my debt.

123
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,250
My creditor is also very unpredictable.

124
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,680
Hey carry this.

125
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,670
"Where are you?"

126
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,540
Shit. Speking of the devil.

127
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,040
Who is it? P'Johan?

128
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,650
Stop it.

129
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,620
At the coffee shop.
The one I told you I work here.

130
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,470
Make me 1 Americano.

131
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,010
Deliver here.

132
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,790
We don't do deliveries.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,540
But YOU do.

134
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,080
I'll give you 30mins.

135
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,180
What the hell?

136
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,580
What do you mean?

137
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,050
I'm blushing.

138
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,160
My ship.

139
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,130
P'Johan wants me to deliver his coffee.

140
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,940
And what kind of coffee shops do delivery?

141
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,510
But some do.

142
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,780
Just shut up.

143
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,780
And where is P'Thun?

144
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,100
What?

145
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,570
What?

146
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,570
You told me to shut up.

147
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,280
You're driving me crazy.

148
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,880
I think he went to the restroom.

149
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,380
There he is.

150
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,980
What's up?

151
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,440
- P'Thun.
- Yes?

152
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,960
Can I go out for awhile?

153
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,720
Sure. We don't have that many customers anyway.
You can go. Why?

154
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,240
And would you mind..?

155
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,350
making one Americano for me please?

156
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,480
Sure but...

157
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,830
do you drink coffee now?

158
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,040
No. It's not mine.

159
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,280
It's P'Johan's

160
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,980
Really?

161
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,610
Umm. I'll make one for you.

162
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,370
Thank you.

163
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,010
I'm here.

164
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,245
Come up on the 12th floor.

165
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,130
Your coffee is here.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,650
Just woke up?

167
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,650
Come in.

168
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,670
Your coffee.

169
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,140
Did you make this yourself?

170
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,330
The owner of the shop made it.

171
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,880
I told you to make it for me.

172
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,130
I haven't learned how to.

173
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:03,910
If there's nothing else, I'll go now.

174
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,400
Not yet.

175
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,840
But...

176
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,200
I have to work.

177
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,120
- Just quit it.
- Huh?

178
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:14,560
Cannot.
And how am I gonna make money to pay you back?

179
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,600
You're not gonna increase more debt right?

180
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,320
Almost.

181
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,320
Good. It was just almost.

182
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,180
Err...

183
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,780
then can I...

184
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,410
sit here then?

185
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,862
P'Thun, I'll be back a bit late.

186
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,150
Why? Is something wrong?

187
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,860
Did he do something to you?

188
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,130
Nothing. Just some errands.

189
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,420
Don't be gone for long,
customers might come in.

190
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,700
You're not done working?

191
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,850
Are you gonna tell me to be quiet?

192
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,770
You know well.

193
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,920
Hello.

194
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,560
North.

195
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,720
My name is Prang.
I texted you the other day. You remember?

196
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,010
Yes.

197
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,100
I only heard your name,
now we finally met.

198
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,140
I went to Johan's this morning.

199
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,200
All the maids are still talking about you?

200
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,900
Really?

201
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,570
Especially Mr.President.

202
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,030
I heard that he's very upset...

203
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,840
that you broke his bottle of wine.
Some of them are very rare.

204
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,320
And Johan got in trouble because of that.

205
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,270
And why did he was in trouble?

206
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,030
It should've been me instead.

207
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,580
Johan took it to his responsibility.

208
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,730
He will have to replace for that bottle.

209
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,590
Probably difficult to find.

210
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,370
Oh but...

211
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,850
you've known Johan for a long time?

212
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,850
You face is not familiar to me.

213
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,900
No.

214
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,800
I just got to know him after an incident.

215
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,940
You guys are not like seeing each other right?

216
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,170
No, we're not.

217
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,340
You already delivered.
You may go.

218
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,640
Don't work to hard.

219
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,850
Work is not that busy, isn't it?

220
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,850
I just wanna clear everything.

221
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,070
Don't work too hard then.

222
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm gonna go.

223
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,750
Bye bye, North.

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,960
See you.

225
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,430
If you're done working,

226
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,190
then I will go now.

227
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,740
Who said you can go?

228
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,110
I haven't drank the Americano.

229
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,130
But it is over there.

230
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,420
You haven't drank it,
and let them melt.

231
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,170
Cause you didn't make it yourself.

232
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,100
I'll only drink the one thst you make.

233
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,540
I haven't learned how to do it.

234
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,530
There's a coffee machine in the kitchen.

235
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,810
Is this my karma or something?

236
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:20,300
I shouldn't have gone to the bar.

237
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,620
And how is this thing work?

238
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,360
Oh.

239
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,180
You scared me.

240
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,980
You're not gonna wreck my house again, are you?

241
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,000
You're exaggerating.

242
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,250
Oh.

243
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,160
About the wine,
why didn't you tell your dad it was me?

244
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,020
You confessed,
then you're the one who's in trouble.

245
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,190
Oh...P'Prang told me.

246
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,330
If I said that it was you,

247
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,330
things woudl be more complicated.

248
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,160
Thank you.

249
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,070
Why are you standing here?

250
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,850
I will serve you at the table.
You can go sit and wait.

251
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,760
Please.

252
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,160
Why does he have to act so cool?
I'm so confused.

253
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,570
Here's your coffee.

254
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,880
My first Americano.

255
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,000
Enjoy.

256
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,630
How is it?

257
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,500
If I were the coffee shop owner,

258
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,540
You'll be the first one to fire.

259
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,450
Hey...why?

260
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,520
- It's that bad?
- Don't make anyone this ever again.

261
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,150
You're so mean.

262
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,930
I wouldn't believe that you're P'Hill's friend,
if I didn't see it with my own eyes.

263
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,930
Why?

264
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,990
You're so different from P'Hill.

265
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,390
I think you should take some soft side from P'Hill.

266
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,040
Because he's such a heart warming person.

267
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,290
What are you guys trying to play?

268
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,440
Last time, Hill was yelling at me.

269
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,720
For when Ter complimented me to him
and now you're--

270
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,310
Never mind.

271
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,830
Then...

272
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,540
I can go now, right?

273
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,950
Go make me another one.

274
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,860
Huh?

275
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,750
Make it until it's good.

276
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,100
Why are you still standing?
Go make one.

277
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,280
Here it is.

278
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,200
Not good.

279
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,820
Too bland.

280
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,320
Go make another one.

281
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,140
What?
You haven't taken a sip.

282
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,920
I can tell by looking at the color alone.

283
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,830
All coffees are the same, you should just---

284
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,210
It might be differ from one another.

285
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,490
Not good at all.
No matter how many times I've tried.

286
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,740
The smell alone is so sweet.

287
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,840
(You're doomed)

288
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,640
Please. This one is good for sure.

289
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,300
- You can go now.
- Hey.

290
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,840
What is up with you?

291
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,020
Why? Or you'd like to stay?

292
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,050
Who wants to be with a teaser?

293
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,220
I heard that.

294
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,610
I will go then.

295
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,620
You have no right to scold at me
or even bump up my debt.

296
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,920
I'm going now.

297
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,140
Try that.

298
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,900
This time
you might want to open a coffee shop for me.

299
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,980
Drink it up.

300
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,060
Why is it so sweet?

301
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,510
- Then remove it.
- Aha.

302
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,560
Then take it... distributor.
Say it after me.

303
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,330
Distributor

304
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,620
- Distributor
- With a bit of accent.

305
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,190
Put it here.

306
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm back.

307
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,010
Hey you were gone for so long.

308
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,760
Should I deduct your salary?

309
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,990
Ughh P'Tun.

310
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,750
Please have a mercy on me.

311
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,540
You kinda deserved that.

312
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,430
Come here.
Come and learned how to make coffee with me.

313
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,900
Making coffee? Be my guest.

314
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,530
I will take a break for now.

315
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,330
Oh North.
I already talked to Chen, my relative, for you.

316
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,610
About the extra shift you want to take.

317
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,290
I will give you his contact, okay?

318
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,460
Thank you P’Thun.

319
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,850
You’re always so kind.

320
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,540
But are you gonna be okay?
It'll be late night shift everyday?

321
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,100
I think you should let me take you there for the first few times,
what do you think?

322
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,080
It’s fine.

323
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,140
I can find my own way.

324
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,290
But this is a bar…a drinking place kinda.

325
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,440
It’s not a club, more like sitting down and chill.

326
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,800
But let me take you still. I know the owner, okay?

327
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,480
Sure.

328
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,880
I will text the owner.

329
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,800
And if he answered, I will let you know.

330
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,720
Thank you, P’Thun.

331
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,610
No problem.

332
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,080
You can drink it.

333
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,700
You made it.

334
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,160
Okay.

335
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,840
I'll go pick you up today, okay?

336
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,160
What time will you be done with the class?

337
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,730
4pm.

338
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,030
You will be working again at 7pm.

339
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,890
Then we should have dinner first
before going to work.

340
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,200
Sure. See you.

341
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,600
Who’s that?

342
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,590
You scared me!

343
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,970
Who was that?

344
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,760
P’Thun.

345
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,250
3rd year. Management student.

346
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,610
He’s the owner of the coffee shop I work at.

347
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,060
He’ll take me to my new job today.

348
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,220
And why does he have to take you there?

349
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,030
He’s a relative to the owner.

350
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,020
He said he’ll take me there
for the first few times.

351
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,430
And how can I say no?

352
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,520
How are you going back today?

353
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,200
Are you gonna have him come pick you up too?

354
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,490
Yeah.

355
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,380
I guess so.
If not, how am I gonna go back?

356
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,750
Hey wait a min.

357
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,280
Is he trying to hit on you?

358
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,010
So? Is he?

359
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,010
Between 2nd year meds student.

360
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,780
and 3rd year management.

361
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,080
So what’s the verdict?

362
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,510
It has to be 2nd year meds student.

363
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,790
Cause I’m a shipper for these two.

364
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,130
I’m not choosing anyone.

365
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,920
P’Johan will be disappointed you said that.

366
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,960
Never in a million years to let us go early,
but today she does.

367
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,790
Yeah.

368
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,780
What are you guys doing after?

369
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,720
Do you wanna go have lunch? I’m hungry.

370
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,860
Sure. What about you, North?

371
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,030
You guys go ahead. I will go with P’Thun.

372
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,360
Huh?

373
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,930
I think he’s definitely trying to hit on you.

374
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,690
What about you?
Do you wanna come hang with us first?

375
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,080
You guys go.
I think I will stop by at the club.

376
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,030
See you.

377
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,490
What is up with him?

378
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,100
Did I just upset him or something?

379
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,280
No, you didn’t.

380
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,750
What the hell?

381
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,480
Is that dragon? Looks fun.

382
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,870
It's the cloud. The sky. Look.

383
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,040
- The sky is there. Stays there.
- Hey.

384
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,880
Just move!

385
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,800
- You'll get paint on me.
- Why do you have to be overprotective.

386
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,500
Aren’t you bored of drawing, Dao?
You do it everyday.

387
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,710
No.

388
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,150
Who would play around everyday like you?

389
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,600
You deserve that.

390
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,900
I wouldn’t let that pass,
if I were you.

391
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,950
Hey guys.

392
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,360
Let’s have dinner together this evening.

393
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,440
- Sure.
- Okay. Deal.

394
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,040
Yeah.

395
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,580
I already have a plan.

396
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,670
With who? P’Johan?

397
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,670
No, P’Thun.

398
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,360
He will take me to work.

399
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,350
And he asked me to join his dinner.

400
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,320
Hey scoot over. I wanna sit.

401
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,860
- There’s also space over there.
- You're talking too much.

402
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,710
Do you think P'Thun likes you?

403
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,500
Shipper spirit has already possessed you, huh?

404
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,280
What?
I only ship Johan and North only.

405
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,200
But really?
You don’t feel anything?

406
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,110
He padded your head
and always give you this kinda look.

407
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,440
To be honest,

408
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,860
I think deep down you know…

409
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,430
that he likes you.

410
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,830
Yeah.

411
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,580
Let's don’t think about it.
It might be awkward for everyone.

412
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,320
He might not trying to hit on me.

413
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,300
But we’re just thinking for ourselves.

414
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,440
And…

415
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,930
what if he really likes you,
what are you gonna do?

416
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,070
We’ll just brothers.

417
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,740
My ship has not sunk yet.

418
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,230
That’s great.

419
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,410
Why are you that happy?

420
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,420
Nothing.
sI just think it’s cute when you’re with P’Johan.

421
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,540
Are you done with your class, North?

422
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,590
Jo.

423
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,980
- You don’t have work anymore?
- Yeah. I cleared out some already.

424
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,990
Right.

425
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,160
Normally, we rarely sees your face in the class.

426
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,080
I’m surprised that he showed up today.

427
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,080
If I’m free, I’m always here.

428
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,880
Normally, you’re never free.

429
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,260
Always ask Hill to work for you.

430
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,220
Or should I ask you instead?

431
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,360
I know that you don’t wanna study.
But you’re already enrolled, you should be more responsible.

432
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,340
His fatherhood spirit is here.

433
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,930
You’re such a whiner.

434
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,140
- I’m gonna go.
- Hey.

435
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,680
To where?

436
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,670
Buy some coffee.

437
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,030
I’m out front.
At the gear courtyard.

438
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,730
I’m sorry to keep you waiting.

439
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,420
I wanted to be the one who waits.
Not you.

440
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,860
Why?

441
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,220
I wanna score some points with you.

442
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,110
Just kidding.
I just don’t like people to wait for me.

443
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,730
See you.

444
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,160
Yeah.

445
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,960
Where are you?

446
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,170
At the faculty.

447
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,010
Buy me a coffee. I will pick you up.

448
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,030
What coffee?

449
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,310
I'm not free,
but I guess I'll buy one for you.

450
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,900
Why are you not free?

451
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,730
Forget it. I'll pick you up.

452
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,120
On my way.

453
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,120
Ughh does he ever listen to people?

454
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,020
- Can I please have one americano?
- Sure.

455
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,020
- Please wait a moment.N- Yes.

456
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,650
I'm sorry, P'Thun.
I don't think I could make it.

457
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,200
Oh why? I'm almost there.

458
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm so sorry.
I have something urgent came up.

459
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,710
Do you still want me to take you to the bar?

460
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,540
I'll go there by myself. I'm sorry.

461
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,460
You owe me a meal.

462
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,540
Sorry.

463
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,020
Here's your coffee.

464
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,260
- Here.
- Thank you.

465
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,610
I've arrived. At the front.

466
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,110
Your coffee.

467
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,260
Thank you.

468
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,550
And who did you have a plan with?

469
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,480
P'Thun, but you probably don't know him.

470
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,740
Um. I don't.

471
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,020
And where were you plan to go with him?

472
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,080
Dinner.

473
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,800
He's the owner of the coffee shop I work at.

474
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,880
He was gonna take me to work today.

475
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,500
Work?

476
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,340
Yes.

477
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,340
I got a new job.

478
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,440
He's a relative to that one place too.

479
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,880
Which place?

480
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,060
SeoulOut.

481
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,830
A bar?

482
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,250
Yes. You know?

483
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,650
Um.

484
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,060
And where are we going?

485
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,430
Get out.

486
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,500
Are we having dinner?

487
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,200
You want to have dinner, right?

488
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:53,580
P'Hill always bring me here.

489
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,580
Didn't know
that you always come here too.

490
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,260
What does Hill normally buy you?

491
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,370
Just normal stuff.

492
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,320
Meals, snacks.

493
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,500
But I normally don't order a lot.

494
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,280
I feel bad.

495
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,450
That's why money never ran out.

496
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,360
Huh?

497
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,830
What was that?

498
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,710
Can I borrow your phone?

499
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,840
I forgot mine in the car.

500
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,910
Why are you with Johan?

501
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,910
Is he doing anything to you?

502
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,260
Do you want me to pick you up?

503
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,510
Excuse me.

504
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,480
You're not gonna eat?

505
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,180
I will.

506
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,180
And you're not?

507
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,590
I'm not hungry.

508
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,030
You've been busy?

509
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,290
Even so,

510
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,810
I want you to eat something.

511
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,100
I only see you drink coffee
whenever I meet you.

512
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,500
Why?
Are you trying to reduce your debt?

513
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,500
Ugh.

514
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,070
I'm just worried about you.

515
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,540
How can you
take my kindness for granted?

516
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,850
But it's not working right?

517
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,770
You always watch me eat.

518
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,100
And always drink coffee when I see you.

519
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,850
i just want you to eat too.

520
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,060
I will eat later.

521
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,670
Just hurry up and eat.
I will drop you off after.

522
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,970
At work?

523
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,970
Just eat.

524
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,970
Then..

525
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,150
I won't hold back.

526
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,100
Are you taking me to work?

527
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,160
Hey wait.

528
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,360
This is not the way to my work.

529
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,360
And who told you I'm gonna take you to that bar?

530
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,060
And where are you taking me?
I have to work.

531
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,500
Back to your dorm.

532
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,090
Why?
I already told then I will start my first day today.

533
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,450
What did I tell you?

534
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,780
I won't ever let you work in a bar.

535
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,620
Oh.

536
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,070
Why did P'Johan dropped you off?

537
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,640
I thought it was gonna be P'Thun?

538
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,790
Hmm?

539
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,030
Why are you smiling like that?

540
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,040
Nothing. You guys are cute.
Why are you smiling like that?

541
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,580
Nothing. You guys are cute.

542
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,850
Long story.

543
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,650
It's okay. You don't have to tell me.

544
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,020
But I know that P'Johan picked you up.

545
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,930
That already makes me happy.

546
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,770
What a good captain for my ship.

547
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,610
And why are you not working?

548
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,190
Because of your Johan.
He won't allow me to work there.

549
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,940
And he just dropped me off here.

550
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,990
He also threaten to add more debt.

551
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,460
Why would he do that?

552
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,620
Yeah.

553
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,370
I also don't understand.

554
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,070
Or should I just sneak out and go to work?

555
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,400
Well...

556
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,000
I already told them that I'll be working there tonight.

557
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,300
P'Thun gave me the reference too.

558
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,560
If I don't go,
that is like I break my promise.

559
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,180
But if you go, P'Johan will be super mad though.

560
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,290
Why would he be mad?

561
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,840
It's a good thing.
I get to work and make money to pay him back.

562
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,250
He cares about you. That's why.

563
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,230
He doesn't want Nong North to work hard
and get home so late.

564
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,390
What if something dangerous happened?
What would you do?

565
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,390
Dude.

566
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,730
You're so taking his side.

567
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,380
I have to be a loyal shipper, right?

568
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,920
Oh snd P'Thun texted me too.

569
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,540
He asked whether you're okay or not.

570
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,350
He said you replied him oddly.

571
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,840
- Text?
- Um.

572
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,830
What text?

573
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,250
How am I supposed to know?

574
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,520
Check your phone.

575
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,897
- Why are you with Johan? Is he doing anything to you?
- F*ck off.

576
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,570
Shit!

577
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,880
P'Jo. P'Jo.

578
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,020
Hello P'Chen.

579
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,020
North, where are you?

580
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:54,640
Er...I don't think I can go in to work today.

581
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,570
Oh why? What's wrong?

582
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,040
Nothing...it's just...

583
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,080
If it's not urgent please come help me.

584
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,540
I really need some help. I don't have enough people. Too late to find one now too.

585
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,100
Please North.

586
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,480
Fine.

587
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,880
I will go in.

588
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,730
Hey thank you so much, North.

589
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,270
See you.

590
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,140
Ter.

591
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,160
Ter.

592
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,090
Help me.

593
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,980
I'm not asking you to do anything.

594
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,390
But just...

595
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,930
don't tell anyone that I will go to work today.

596
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,940
North. I'm gonna be honest with you.

597
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,940
I care about you.

598
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:39,620
You work in a bar, go home late at night.

599
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,920
I actually don't want you to go.

600
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,670
It's fine. I can take care of myself.

601
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,260
You know that.

602
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,750
Last time you also said this.

603
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,660
And came back with how many wounds?

604
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,120
- It's all gone now, isn't it?
- You want a new one?

605
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,010
I think a few more wounds would be nice.

606
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,170
But please...don't tell anyone.

607
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,650
Paan.

608
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,380
He's the new guy. First day here.

609
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:20,380
Please look after him.

610
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,410
Hey relax.

611
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,690
Just serve and clean the table.
Nothing much.

612
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,210
If you have any questions, ask Paan.

613
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,280
- Okay?
-Okay.

614
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:32,710
See you.

615
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,490
Hi.

616
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,160
I'm Paan.

617
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,030
Hi I'm North.

618
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,950
Are you still in school?

619
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,520
1st year.

620
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,020
Woah and you're not tired working while studying?

621
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,410
Not really.
I normally do part time jobs all the time.

622
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,940
Pretty relax.

623
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,350
Then..

624
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,210
you go change at the back first.

625
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,340
And you'll come help me serve today.

626
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,490
You can ask me anytime.

627
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:01,790
Okay.

628
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,530
- This way?
- This way. This way.

629
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,980
- Order please.
- Yes.

630
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,830
Where's my food?
I've been waiting for so long already.

631
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,960
Please wait a moment.

632
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,910
It's fine. I'll handle it.

633
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:40,380
Thank you.

634
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,530
So? Are you exhausted?
We have many people today.

635
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,810
Still manageable.

636
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,960
Oh.

637
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,310
He's new?

638
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,490
This is Day.

639
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,720
He also works here.

640
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,820
And this is North.

641
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:12,360
He just started today.

642
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,880
Hello.

643
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:16,620
What are you studying?

644
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,300
Engineering.

645
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,510
Wow.

646
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,380
You must be popular.

647
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,420
Not really.

648
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,140
You're not seeing anyone?

649
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,140
No.

650
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,070
Then I can hit on you then?

651
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,720
- Please don't.
- Why?

652
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,070
You said that you're not seeing anyone.

653
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,620
Can you give me a chance?

654
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,620
- Cause you're cute.
- Hey I'm sorry.

655
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,870
I think...

656
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,780
let's not do that.

657
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,020
I just...

658
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,700
don't like it.

659
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,060
Stop teasing him.

660
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,190
I'm not.
I actually want to go out with him.

661
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,190
Day.

662
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,120
Why?

663
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,570
Excuse me.

664
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,740
Where are you?

665
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,750
Outside.

666
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,900
At 10pm?

667
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,900
With who?

668
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,940
With friends.

669
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,520
Where are you?

670
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,610
North.

671
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,060
Serve table 6 and clean table 8 too.

672
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:49,610
Sure.

673
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,860
What's up?

674
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,490
Why are you draging us out?

675
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:12,820
I'm bored.

676
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,700
You're bored?

677
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,140
Stop it, Mr.Know it All.

678
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,620
Jsut order and eat.

679
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,340
What happened earlier this evening?

680
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,860
Coffee from Engineering is that good?
Good 'til you have to rush there?

681
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,040
My business. Not yours.

682
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,840
And why do you want us here tonight?

683
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,890
I said I'm bored.

684
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,470
I'm sorry.
The number you have dialed cannot connected at this time.

685
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,890
Shit.

686
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,890
3 Missed calls.

687
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,890
I'm f*cked.

688
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:04,390
P'Prang,
did P'Johan add more debt to my account?

689
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,900
No.

690
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,640
What did you do?

691
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,910
Nothing. I just forgot to text him back.

692
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,110
It's just some texts. You'll be fine.

693
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,070
I once didn't text him back for a day.
Nothing happened.

694
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,050
If it's urgent, he will usually call.

695
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,750
But he called me 3 times.

696
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,630
That's odd.
Normally, he call once only even if it's urgent.

697
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,640
Oh you're still here?

698
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:51,430
I will soon.

699
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,760
Okay. Get home safely then.

700
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,080
Yes.

701
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,950
You guys are just gonna stay quiet like this?

702
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,670
Do you like liars?

703
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:18,900
You wanna speak now?

704
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,900
Hey don't ingterrrupt him.

705
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,900
He's finally speaking.

706
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:25,220
Why?

707
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,300
Who lies to you?

708
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,300
Is it what I think it is?

709
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,620
Probably.

710
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,520
Then you don't need to ask him further.

711
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,060
Why?

712
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,450
What are you guys talking about?

713
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,430
Can you help make me understand?

714
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:43,460
He wouldn't answer you, even if you asked.

715
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,180
Excuse me.

716
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:51,750
Can I have your LINE?
My friend likes you.

717
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,290
No, you cannot.

718
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,450
There you go.

719
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,660
Hill, what's wrong with you?

720
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,520
- Are you jealous?
- Jealous your ass.

721
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,650
Why didn't give her his LINE?

722
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,573
The tiger is about to remove his fangs and claws.
(Idiom: Quit being a player)

723
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,260
Why are you home so late?

724
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,250
The bar closed at midnight.

725
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,090
I had to ride my motorcycle here too.

726
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:38,830
It was so dark.

727
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,090
And the road was so secluded.
Not sure anybody was riding on the back with me or not.

728
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,130
Stop it. What are you talking about?

729
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,920
Dude look.

730
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,580
P"Johan went out tonight.

731
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:55,890
- Hey.
- But that's not your bar.

732
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,670
If he came to my bar,
I would have more debt by now.

733
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:05,390
I think I'm gonna call P'Hill.

734
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:09,460
So I can ask him
whether there's anyone hitting on your Johan.

735
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,710
Hello?

736
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,390
- Why did you put him on speaker?
- Cause I'm gonna ask him about P'Johan for you.

737
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,170
Yes. How is it?
Are you having fun?

738
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,720
Not really.

739
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,910
The one who dragged me here
just sit here and being pouty.

740
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:39,930
You mean P'Johan?

741
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,120
Um.

742
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,550
But never mind.

743
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,230
P'Hill.

744
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,620
Has there been anyone hitting on P'Johan?

745
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,110
Yes there was.

746
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,110
But I got rid of them.

747
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,930
Why do you ask?

748
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,220
Oh.

749
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:00,450
Nothing.

750
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,110
Well...

751
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,370
I asked for my friend.

752
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,170
Oh I see.

753
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,690
And what are you doing?
Why aren't you asleep?

754
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:16,030
Just chilling.

755
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:21,070
What about North?

756
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,100
He's with me here.
Why? What's the matter?

757
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,790
Nothing. Just wondering a little.

758
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:38,190
- You have a class at 9am, right?
- Yes.

759
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,600
I will pick you up. You sohuld go to bed now.

760
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,770
Sure. Sweet dream.

761
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,190
Sweet dream.

762
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,570
That's it.
You can now be at ease.

763
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:57,160
There's no one can hit on P'Johan.

764
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,330
P'Hill is a cockblocker.

765
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:02,870
You can be rest assured now.
No worries.

766
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,990
When did I get worried though?

767
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,150
You're so tight lipped.

768
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:13,370
I just wanna tease you and all.

769
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,220
This one?

770
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,090
Is the reason you have to go out of you way
to get coffee from Engineering?

771
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,380
What did he lie to you about?

772
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,970
He sneaked out to do part time job.

773
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,970
And how do you know that he's lying?

774
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,750
Right.

775
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,000
I drove passed.

776
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,530
Or drove by to check?

777
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,930
Wait.

778
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,800
Sneaking out to work late,
drives my friend crazy this much?

779
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,360
It's a bar.

780
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:50,380
But he tries to make money
to pay you back, doesn't he?

781
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:51,750
Yes, but...

782
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,130
bar is a risky place to work.

783
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:57,290
Then you send someone
to watch over him in your 'son of a mafia' way.

784
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,830
You're talking too much, Hill.

785
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:06,910
You guys don't understand.

786
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,730
Is it that difficult to say that you care?

787
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,990
Yeah.

788
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,990
I think your friend is in deep trouble.

789
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,090
Go in the woods.

790
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:35,810
Hide there. Here they come!

791
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,880
Ugh. You don't listen to me. They're coming!
Nice!

792
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,380
Nice. Come on.

793
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,740
- Woah.
- North.

794
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,460
- Dude.
- Huh?

795
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,980
Have you seen this?

796
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,680
I'm outside of your dorm.
Get down here.

797
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,550
I told you to not go anywhere, didn't I?

798
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,740
Ter.

799
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,220
Where are you taking me?

800
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,220
You sleep here.

801
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,420
You're gonna borrow mine, aren't you?

802
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,550
So protective. That?s the shirt of your soon-to-be boyfriend huh?

803
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:30,470
Stop it right there.

804
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:31,840
Why this one?

805
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:35,300
He's the type that Jo has a soft spot for.

806
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,160
Ter, you don?t know anything about Hill's grandma, do you?

807
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,750
About P'Hills grandparents,

808
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,790
Can you please tell me?
