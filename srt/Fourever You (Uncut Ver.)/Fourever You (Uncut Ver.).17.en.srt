1
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,220
I'll leave from here then.

2
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,620
- P' Hi.
- Hi.

3
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,880
- See you.
- Yeah see you.

4
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,870
Come here.

5
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,700
- I was gossipping about you.
- How come you're here?

6
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,680
Did you wait for long?

7
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,410
The professor just released me too.

8
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,460
He's here now. Shall we go?
Let's go.

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Hey wait wait.

10
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,480
Where are we going?

11
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,460
What? To drink.

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,620
To celebrate for the two of you.

13
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,390
Did you know that I almost cried
when I heard that the two of you are together?

14
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,420
How can we not celebrate?

15
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,950
Do you wanna go?

16
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,690
We haven't seen each other for awhile,
so we wanna hang out.

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,080
I'm fine with everything.

18
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,150
But it's fine, if you wanna hangout among friends.

19
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,600
Hey.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,250
How can we go without you?

21
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,870
We're celebrating for the two of you.

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,910
How can you let Jo go alone?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,630
Yeah right. Let's go drink.

24
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,170
Go go. Let's get some drinks.

25
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,640
You two are finally together.

26
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,550
North...did you know that Frank and I
are one of your first shippers?

27
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,310
You're exaggerating.

28
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,720
Hey, I'm telling the truth.

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,810
You know how it was back then.

30
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,500
- I was so sad like it was my own story.
- You liked him.

31
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,330
When he had a girlfriend...

32
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,010
and was soooo in love with her~

33
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,900
You made my friend really heart broken.

34
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,490
So drink this!

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,150
Hey don't pressure him.

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,490
Yeah do it for the sake of what you did to Jo.

37
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,670
Yeah.

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,410
What about you, Jo?

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,820
You're not gonna drink?

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
I have to drive.

41
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,690
Then North can.

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,750
Cheers.

43
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:54,750
Just drink a little.

44
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,750
- Come on.
- Cheers.

45
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,080
Bottom ups.

46
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,720
Give me that.

47
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,530
You're so rushed.

48
00:03:11,663 --> 00:03:13,710
Finish that first.

49
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,790
And follow with this.

50
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
Yeah.

51
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,830
Cheers.

52
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:47,330
Hey. You almost spill it.

53
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:48,630
Cheers then.

54
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,160
You're so drunk already.

55
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,800
No, I'm not.

56
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh Jo, you're out tonight!?

57
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:13,730
Wow. You're acting so cold.
Unlike when you were with me back then.

58
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,270
I miss you, Jo.

59
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:28,200
So he's just gonna do that.

60
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,190
Sitting on him now.

61
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,310
Just like that.

62
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,740
Why...

63
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,240
are you so hot?

64
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,690
You are mine only.

65
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,990
Yes.

66
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,970
I'm all yours.

67
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,640
Jo!

68
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,390
- P'. I think you should go.
- What's going on?

69
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,330
You better go.

70
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,320
Let's go.

71
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,890
Let's just go home first. See you. Bye bye.

72
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,240
Why do you have someone else?

73
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,620
Are you normally like this when you're drunk?

74
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,230
Cause I'm jealous.

75
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,020
Why are you...

76
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,780
so cute like this when you're drunk?

77
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,180
North.

78
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,470
North.

79
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,710
I think he's falling asleep.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,280
Um. I know. Long ago.

81
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,740
- I will go home first then.
- Um.

82
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Drive safe, my friend.

83
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,280
- See you.
- Good luck.

84
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,180
Bye bye.

85
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,770
P'Johan.

86
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,750
I'm not the jealous type.

87
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,130
But when it's you...

88
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,020
I don't anyone to look at you at all.

89
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,920
Can you just don't have anyone else?

90
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,760
Can you?

91
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,700
You don't want me too?

92
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,910
You have me only.

93
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,720
You can't have an eye on other people, just on me.

94
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,160
You know what to do right?
if you wanna ask me for something?

95
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,510
You're mine only. Only mine.

96
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,010
Nobody can mess with what's mine.

97
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,340
Do you realize that you're drunk?

98
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,470
I'm not drunk.

99
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,810
This way.

100
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,130
Answer my question!

101
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,590
Are you mine only?

102
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,010
Yes.

103
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm yours only.

104
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,400
Why? Are you shy?

105
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,710
I didn't initiate this last night.

106
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,090
It was P'James. He forced me to drink.

107
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,750
So you just...

108
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,980
Stop talking.

109
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,760
Oh P'Johan.

110
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,610
Are you free this coming break?

111
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,490
So...

112
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,940
My mom actually invites you to visit my home.

113
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,040
Yeah sure.

114
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,040
Well then...

115
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,100
do you wanna visit my home as well?

116
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,870
Can I?

117
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,480
You can.

118
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,980
But I don't want you to see my mom.

119
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,460
Why? Is she strict?

120
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,640
No.

121
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,940
And...are we gonna spend the night there?

122
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,060
Probably.

123
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,570
Are you gonna spend the night at your place or mine?

124
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,830
Yours.

125
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,060
Why are you blushing?

126
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,100
Enough.

127
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,560
That's enough.

128
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,800
It's been so many semesters,
I still cannot draw properly.

129
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,460
If I'm not better,
I swear I will switch to other clubs.

130
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,130
You need to practice.

131
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,120
And when am I gonna excel?

132
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,780
- Hey Ter.
- Amen.

133
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,370
- What are you guys doing?
- Eating maybe.

134
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,750
Where? Is there anything for me to eat?

135
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,630
What do you think we're doing?
We're drawing while waiting for you.

136
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,690
What? But you said eating.

137
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,920
Oh I haven't seen Foam around lately.

138
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,810
How dare he sign up
but rarely be at the club?

139
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,520
I think that one is with a girl.

140
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,010
- Hmm?
- Oh North.

141
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,010
Come here.

142
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,630
Sit down.

143
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:32,110
You and P'Johan are official?

144
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,850
- Um.
- Heyyy~

145
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,140
I wish your relationship to last very long.

146
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,890
Awww.

147
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,990
Another one sold.

148
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,670
You're jealous huh?

149
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
- Ter.
- Hmm?

150
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,510
- The cat is jealous.
- Wow.

151
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,110
Woww. The cat is jealous.

152
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,450
The cat is so jealous. Wow.

153
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,030
What cat? Why the cat?

154
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,970
Cause your face looks like a cat.

155
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,680
A sleepy one too.

156
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,390
Let me ask you. Really.
How many hours do you sleep in a day?

157
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,650
- Do you ever rest?
- I do sleep, North. This is my normal face.

158
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,950
- This is your normal face?
- Yeah.

159
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,870
Then you'll be forever looking sleepy.

160
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,190
Hey Dao. Did you bring the cards?

161
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,980
I wanna see my fortune.

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,890
Huh? Again!?

163
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,880
Again what? I haven't done it for a very long time.

164
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,500
I wanna check my faith
...like how's it going to be this time around?

165
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,770
I might win the lottery.

166
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,770
Ohh...did you win the last time?

167
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,400
You are talking too much.

168
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,050
Please Dao~
Do fortune telling for me.

169
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,050
Please. Please.

170
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,090
North. You'll have some luck with money lately.

171
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,140
Hey I'm gonna be rich. I'm gonna win the lottery.

172
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,830
But if you said lottery, I'm not gonna believe you
cause you only win once in your life.

173
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,730
You always burst my bubble.

174
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,890
Cat.

175
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,930
You try it.

176
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,410
Cat. Open a card.

177
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,660
- Open a card.
- Do it.

178
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,840
Fine.

179
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:11,850
Do it. Do it.

180
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,590
- ***

181
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,570
You should make some merit now.

182
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,150
Hey why? His fortune is that bad?

183
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,350
No. Just kidding.

184
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,400
Dao! You scared me.

185
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,250
Your love game looks good.

186
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,270
Hey! The cat is gonna be in love.

187
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,010
He's gonna have a partner.
He's gonna be a cat in love.

188
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,970
How?

189
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,870
How what? It's nothing.

190
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,330
You're making this up.

191
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,120
- Are you lying?
- So am I gonna be rich or not?

192
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,890
Oh Dao.

193
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,900
Why is your name Dao even you are a male?

194
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:13,590
Oh that's because my parents used to make a wish
from shooting stars that if they conceives a child,

195
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,820
they're gonna name the baby 'Daotok'  regardless of the baby's gender.
(Daotok = shooting stars in Thai)

196
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,670
Why did they make a wish from shooting stars?

197
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,420
What if your parents make a wish froma shrine,
your name is not gonna be 'Phraphum'?

198
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,830
You're asking such a stupid question.

199
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,310
Yeah just like that.

200
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,230
- But shooting stars are a bunch of dirty rocks on fire?
- You cannot name a baby with that, can you North?

201
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,020
You can do it English. Mete...

202
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,450
Meteor, right?

203
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,250
Southern ghost or whatever.
(It's a Thai myth name for shooting stars)

204
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,090
Who's gonna have that kind of name?

205
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,300
And why is your name 'North'?

206
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,110
Cause my mom said North means north region in Thai

207
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,400
I'm also confused why didn't she just named me Nuer.
(Nuer = north in Thai)

208
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,060
She probably wanted to sound international.

209
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,920
What about you Ter and Phoon?

210
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,440
Easter is from Easter holiday.
My mom loves it when she was traveling.

211
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,680
For my sister too, Christmas as in the holiday.

212
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,770
For me...

213
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,070
they just made it goes with my sister's name.

214
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,410
Hey you've got a sister?

215
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,850
What's her name?

216
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,020
Torfhun.

217
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,920
Torfhun?

218
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,800
How does that go together?

219
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,850
Well...

220
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,510
Phoon and Fhun.

221
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,930
Sounds similar.

222
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,560
Phoon and Fhun?

223
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,880
How are these two similar?

224
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,760
It is. Just go with it.

225
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,910
- Oh yeah it is. I think it is.
- Um.

226
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,450
Oh I'm hungry.

227
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,540
- Shall we go find some food to eat?
- Hey.

228
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,070
- You're just hungry out of the blue.
- Yeah.

229
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,200
We opened 2 cards only.

230
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,450
Cause you guys kept talking too much.

231
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,550
I'm hungry now. Shall we?

232
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,190
You're gonna be rich soon,
then you should pay.

233
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,370
Rich your ass.
I'll be poor again after I pay for my meal.

234
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,850
The card says you're gonna be rich.
Then you should pay.

235
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,760
- Yeah. Let's go.
- Yayy~

236
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,620
- You pay. Come on. You're gonna be rich soon.
- No.

237
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,830
Dude. Ask him.

238
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,990
Oh...

239
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,040
I will do it myself.

240
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,430
We will be tutoring tonight.

241
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,240
North is also coming. Wanna join us?

242
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,880
- Wanna join?
- Where though?

243
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,470
At P'Jo's coffee shop.
Do you wanna come with us?

244
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,520
Umm sure. I will join you guys.

245
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,150
Good. Do you want me to pick you up?

246
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,700
It's fine. I will go there myself.
Just send me the location.

247
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,710
Are you sure?

248
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,760
Cat.
Are you leaving?

249
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,570
I have to go.

250
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,310
What is up with him?

251
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,750
How long have you been here?

252
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,970
For a while already.

253
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,020
I'm sorry. We just got off work.

254
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,210
It's fine. We can wait.

255
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,710
Do you wanna have anything else?

256
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,630
You guys go ahead. We're full already.

257
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,710
- Do you want something?
- No.

258
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,940
Jeen.

259
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,070
It was good. So full.

260
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,460
If it's good, then why didn't you finish it?

261
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,260
You need to eat more vegetables,
you're still young.

262
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,600
Another bite. Come on.

263
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,980
Please.

264
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,360
Come with me.

265
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,180
It doesn't taste good.

266
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,010
Good?

267
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,610
Where are they going?

268
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,780
Why are you staring like that?

269
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,770
Can't I just look?

270
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,400
Jeen.

271
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,160
Ok fine. I'll stop.

272
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,490
I just wanna look at how cute he is.

273
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,240
You make him obsessed with you.

274
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,650
He's so cute.

275
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,640
Hey! I also cannot touch him?

276
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,980
No.

277
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,040
Fine~

278
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,750
He's protective of you. I guess.

279
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,260
He waited for 3 years

280
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,340
And why are you here exactly?

281
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,300
I drove past, so I just wanna stop by.

282
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,310
Oh...

283
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,430
I should introduce myself first.

284
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,330
I'm Johan's mom.

285
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,750
Hello ma'am.

286
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,050
You're North, right?

287
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,120
Yes.

288
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,770
You two are dating, right?

289
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,760
I was so happy when I found out.

290
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:20,950
He used to come home
looking sad and depressed everyday.

291
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,230
But nowadays...

292
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,140
I'm so relieved.

293
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,840
Hey North.

294
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,330
Did you also know...

295
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:35,770
that he's been working hard for you?

296
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,580
Huh..yes?

297
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,980
He said...

298
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,180
he wanted to be someone who you can rely on.

299
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,280
When he accepted his father's proposal,

300
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,910
I was shocked.

301
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,260
Cause I have someone
I need to look after.

302
00:19:59,290 --> 00:19:59,880
Oh.

303
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,430
On my. Too bad.

304
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,330
I have to go. I'm so sorry.

305
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,810
No worries.

306
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,300
Let's have a meal together sometimes, okay?

307
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,430
Can I have a hug?

308
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,160
No.

309
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,390
Hey. I'm just so happy.

310
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,110
- Can I get a hug from him?
- No.

311
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,120
Fine. No hug.
I will see you later, son.

312
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,310
I have to go.

313
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,830
- Sure.
- Bye bye.

314
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,620
You're always like this.
That's why I don't want you to see him.

315
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,900
Yeah~.
I know that you're protective of him.

316
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,300
Hey.

317
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,540
Phoon will be here soon.

318
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,050
- North.
- Hmm?

319
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,650
I need your advice.

320
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,280
About what?

321
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,220
About P'Fah and Phoon.

322
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,760
What about them?

323
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,260
I don't know whether I just overthink or not.

324
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,510
But I feel like there's something up between them..

325
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,000
..from what I've observed.

326
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,310
What do you think?

327
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,540
To be honest,

328
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,340
- I think there's something weird going on too.
- Right!?

329
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,930
Nothing.

330
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,210
Right?
I didn't just think for myself.

331
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,790
Or you and I are overthinking?

332
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,390
Why don't we just ask cat?

333
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,070
I wouldn't dare to ask.

334
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,850
Why not?

335
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,100
Phoon always look sad when he sees P'Fah.

336
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,230
But it's not only when he looks at P'Fah though.

337
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,460
I think Phoon is a kind of person...

338
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,710
that he likes to keep everything to himself.

339
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,280
Umm..

340
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,850
Or he has something in his mind
that he can't tell anyone?

341
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,060
But if he doesn't wanna tell,
then we shouldn't ask him.

342
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,500
Yeah I know.

343
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,840
But I'm just worried about my friend.

344
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,610
- Yeah.
- What should we do?

345
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,750
- Oh he's calling me.
-Speaking of the devil.

346
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,250
Hello? What's up?

347
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,790
Ter. I don't know where I am.

348
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,390
What? You're lost again?

349
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,460
I just sent you the location.

350
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,840
Just look at the map. Where are you on the map?

351
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,820
North is also there?
North. Help me.

352
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,640
How are you getting here? Motorcycle?

353
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,260
Yeah I borrowed from a friend.

354
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,400
Ughh. Cat is riding a motorcycle?
That's way too dangerous.

355
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,990
Ter. What should I do?
Hey guys. It's raining. Help.

356
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,030
Raining!?

357
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,410
Yeah just give me a min.
I'm trying to figure it out.

358
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,880
What should we do?

359
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,990
Is something wrong?

360
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,100
It's Phoon.
He's lost and riding a motorcycle.

361
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,170
It's raining heavily too.

362
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,150
Ask him to send the location.
We can pick him up.

363
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,440
Who's picking me up?

364
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,440
Err....

365
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,620
Fah.

366
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,570
I will pick him up.

367
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,570
Ter. Come with me.

368
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:27,650
Yes. Yes.

369
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,780
I will go pick you up.

370
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,780
- Hurry and come back.
- Yeah. Yeah.

371
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,210
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

372
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,210
Fah.

373
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,870
What?

374
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,330
I'm one who needs to ask you
what's going on?

375
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,370
Yeah.

376
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,320
I just don't wanna be ignored anymore.

377
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,640
North.

378
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,860
Dude.

379
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,270
Hey you're soaking wet.

380
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,870
Like a kitten fell in the water.

381
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,380
- Hey are you cold?
- Here here. I will take care of you.

382
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,330
Sit. Sit.

383
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,870
Thank you, P'Hill.

384
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,940
Sit down first.

385
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,740
Do I have to put so much effort to tutor here?

386
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,570
I told you to pullover, and wait until the rain stops.

387
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,080
I was afraid of getting lost.

388
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,110
It's really dark there too.

389
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,490
Life is tough on you, huh?

390
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,550
The nature is punishing you.

391
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,730
Hey what's that, cat?

392
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,080
Stop going through my stuff.

393
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,510
Hey. Meds book?

394
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,820
Huh!?

395
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,510
Are you gonna re-applying for meds school?

396
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,430
Um.

397
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,490
Huh!?

398
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,120
If you got in, then you'll become our freshman then?

399
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,240
I guess so.

400
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,710
- Hey~
- If I got in.

401
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,440
So you're not gonna be with us anymore then?

402
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,420
Hey.

403
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,110
But this is cool, cat.

404
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,110
I think you can do it. Keep going man!

405
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,660
Thanks.

406
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,830
- Let's go home.
- Sure.

407
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,450
P'Hill.

408
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,210
Hmm?

409
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:42,838
When you said,
you'll take me out of town during the break...

410
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:44,030
I know now...

411
00:25:44,226 --> 00:25:45,422
where I'd like to go.

412
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,890
Where would you like to go?

413
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,000
Home.

414
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,980
I wanna go back home when exams are over.

415
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,850
Can I go with you?

416
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,990
Of course.

417
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,900
I would like to you see my grandma as well.

418
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,860
After visiting your home, let's visit my grandma too.

419
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,680
But if you don't wanna go, it's fine.

420
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,500
It's not like that, P'Hill.

421
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,900
But...

422
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,600
are you sure I can go there?

423
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm sure.

424
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,030
My grandma really wants to see you.

425
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,440
Really?

426
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,020
Err what about...

427
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,730
your grandpa?

428
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,180
Sure.

429
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,490
I will go.

430
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,920
Thank you for dropping me off.

431
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,310
This is your last exam,
stay focused okay?

432
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,150
Don't stress. Understand?

433
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,090
Sure.

434
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,020
I have to go.

435
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,430
Bye.

436
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,290
We're done with the exams!!
Woohoo~

437
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,060
Where are you guys going during the break?

438
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,370
I wanna travel, but still don't know where.

439
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,360
What about you, North?

440
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,390
Do you have any plans with P'Johan?

441
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,150
Me? I'm going back home.

442
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,020
What? You're not gonna ask him to travel somewhere?

443
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,990
Hey why not?
You don't wanna be on a honeymoon?

444
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,810
Heyyy.

445
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,240
There's no such thing.

446
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,580
I wanna travel. Do you wanna join me Sket?

447
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,250
Huh!? You and me again?

448
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,890
- You two again?
- Always.

449
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,490
Dude, I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

450
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,550
Let's go.

451
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,920
Hey you guys go ahead.

452
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,980
- Yeah. Yeah.
- See you.

453
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,170
Nao. Wait up.

454
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,900
Hey.

455
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,010
What's up?

456
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,590
Ter, are you done with your exam?

457
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,420
Um. I am.

458
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,350
What's going on?

459
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,460
The break is about to begin,
don't you wanna come have a meal with me before leaving?

460
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,560
I'm sorry. I'm already out with P'Hill.

461
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,020
Umm~ Understood.

462
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,290
- My love for you is an old love.
- What?

463
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,680
The break is so short, I will see you again soon.
Stop being pouty.

464
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,890
Right. Have fun on your break.

465
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,690
I'm so sick of someone being in love.

466
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,390
Stop being sarcastic.
You should go see your Johan.

467
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,580
Oh right. I have P'Johan.

468
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,530
Then I better go see him.

469
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,700
- See you dude. Enjoy your break.
- Yeah. Bye.

470
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,830
Okay. Bye.

471
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,300
You're still working?

472
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,850
Um. It's urgent.

473
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,700
You can go to bed first.

474
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,840
No.

475
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,630
I wanna be here.

476
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,820
You're stubborn.

477
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,630
You're so attached to me now.

478
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,540
Do you realize that?

479
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,230
I know. I'm so attached.

480
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,050
Oh P'Jo.

481
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,230
Can we travel during the break?

482
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,580
You wanna travel?

483
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,550
But if you have work to do,

484
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,020
then it's fine.

485
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,560
Where do you wanna go?

486
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,620
I will take you.

487
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,370
Are you sure?

488
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,230
Then...

489
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,490
after we visit our homes,

490
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,400
let's go to the beach.

491
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,090
Sure.

492
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,750
Really!?

493
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,370
Thank you.

494
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,770
Are you okay?

495
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,030
Nothing.

496
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,800
P'!!

497
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,680
I've been waiting for you!

498
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,480
- Hello, P'Hill.
- Hi.

499
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,510
You looks so much more handsome
since I last saw you.

500
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,740
If I didn't know you before, I would think that you're a celebrity.

501
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,410
By the way...

502
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,590
are you guys officially dating?

503
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,640
By the way you react, I guess you are.

504
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,300
For how long?

505
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,310
Nobody tells me this.

506
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm so jealous.
I wanna have a handsome boyfriend like this.

507
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's enough, Christ.

508
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,850
You're being shy again. That's so annoying.

509
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,930
Let's go inside.

510
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,920
Mom and dad are waiting.

511
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,590
When she found out that you're coming,

512
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,510
she went to the market since 5am.

513
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,120
My son.

514
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,000
- I miss you.
- If you miss me, why haven't you been visiting?

515
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,620
Cause I've been busy.

516
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:39,570
University is so tough and tiring.

517
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,350
Really?

518
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,790
Has my son been paying attention to all the classes?

519
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:46,760
I have. My grades are also great.

520
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,190
If you don't believe me, ask P'Hill.

521
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,690
Hello ma'am.

522
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,360
Hi. I haven't seen you for so long, Hill.

523
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,690
You're more handsome everyday.

524
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,170
You must have a lot of people
wanting to date you, right?

525
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,060
They can't. He's taken.

526
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,930
His boyfriend is right here.

527
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,640
Huh!?

528
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,520
Are you guys together?

529
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,040
Yes.

530
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,990
What? These two?

531
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,860
Am I missing something?

532
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,020
Yeah right.

533
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,490
Or when he came to help around here often...

534
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,110
was because he wanted to date P'Ter?

535
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:27,860
Right. He was here every weekend.

536
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,800
Oh yeah.

537
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,180
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

538
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,420
Um.

539
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,930
You two are dating?

540
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,080
Er...

541
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,730
Yes.

542
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,820
Um.

543
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,910
I hate your facial expression and your gaze...

544
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,500
like you're never afraid of anything

545
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,230
...since back then.

546
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,860
Why do you have so many issues with Hill?

547
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,530
I don't have any issue with him.

548
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,570
Stop acting so cool, apologize to our son.

549
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,290
Babe. Fine. Fine.

550
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,080
I'm sorry, son.

551
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,130
What!?

552
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,150
You're still acting like a child
even when you're a grown man.

553
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,420
I'm not a grown man. I'm still a kid.

554
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,750
Then you can't date anymore, right?

555
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,390
Fine. I'm a grown man.

556
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,850
These two...

557
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,960
You guys used to be so tight-lipped.

558
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,480
Suddenly, very understanding of each other.

559
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,240
I'm not.

560
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,490
Really?

561
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:02,680
Carry on. I will go prep dinner.

562
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,210
Sure.

563
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,260
- I will go help mom.
- Sure.

564
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,400
He stopped being mad at you long time ago.

565
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,360
He said he shouldn't have said harsh words to you.

566
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

567
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,950
I have been worried.

568
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,710
From now on, you don't have to worry anymore.

569
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Yeah.

570
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,160
I've been worried for so long.

571
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,750
I'm afraid he won't accept me.

572
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,100
I'm afraid he would still be mad at me.

573
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,010
This is nice.

574
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,550
I think your parents are so nice.

575
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,660
Really?

576
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,600
Er...

577
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,270
I think I better go help mom.

578
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,700
I don't wanna be a thirdwheel here.

579
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:54,890
Christ.

580
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,550
I think mom doesn't recognize that you're P'New.

581
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,360
Yeah right.

582
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Let's go.

583
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,770
Let's go sit.

584
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,600
I will make you cocoa drink.

585
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,940
It's here.

586
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,600
The best cocoa drink in the world.

587
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,600
I haven't had your cocoa for a long time.

588
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,970
I miss it.

589
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,040
Try it.

590
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,810
But...

591
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,080
I'm not making it for P'New, my old friend anymore.

592
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,700
I made...

593
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,000
for P'Hill...my boyfriend.

594
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,220
Is it good?

595
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,690
P'Hill!

596
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,450
Is it 1good?

597
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,100
Hey where are you going?

598
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,320
What are you writing?

599
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,020
Let me see.

600
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,530
It's so good.

601
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,760
That's nice to hear.

602
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,940
I will make you this drink everyday from now on.

603
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,380
Okay?

604
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,840
Forever me, okay?

605
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,470
Yes.

606
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,940
Forever you.

607
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,070
Thank you.

608
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,450
I think you're too skinny.

609
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,920
Thank you.
Everything looks so good.

610
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,930
- I miss home cooking so much.
- If you miss it, then eat up.

611
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,030
- Sure.
- Thank you.

612
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,820
- P'Ter.
- Hmm?

613
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,270
You're here only a few days only.

614
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,130
Please stay longer next time you're home.

615
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,390
Um sure.

616
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,320
Yayy~

617
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,460
How's your school?

618
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,210
It's good, dad.
I'm taking all the basic subjects right now.

619
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,250
Luckily, I have P'Hill to help tutoring me.

620
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,660
That's nice. Someone tutors for you.

621
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,400
And also takes good care of you.

622
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,790
- Yeah right.
- Christ.

623
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,300
- Enough.
- Why don't you give P'Hill some of those?

624
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:47,990
I will. Of course.

625
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,050
Thank you.

626
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,150
Wow.

627
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,220
Can you tell us?
Who confessed the love first?

628
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,510
- Christ.
- Wow~

629
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,250
- Yeah right!
- We also wanna know, right?

630
00:39:58,330 --> 00:39:59,470
I also want to know.

631
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,850
Can I be the one who tells?

632
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,490
- Oh! That's good.
- Good.

633
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,110
I'm all ears.

634
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,780
- Err...back then...
- Here~

635
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,830
Hey. I wanna hear him talk.

636
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,350
Is it yummy?
Food at my home is the best.

637
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,070
Bye bye.

638
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,460
I haven't had enough time with you.

639
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,160
I know. Me neither.

640
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,450
I don't wanna leave.

641
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,840
I have to say goodbye now.

642
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,690
Yeah.

643
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,470
Please look after him for us.

644
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,400
He' a bit cray cray.

645
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,600
- Don't take it seriously.
- Dad!

646
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,700
Don't worry. I will do my best.

647
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,130
Um.

648
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,340
Don't be stubborn with him too.

649
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,270
Sure.

650
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,560
- Please, look after him.
- It's my pleasure.

651
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,160
No worries, mom.

652
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,540
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

653
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,100
- Can I have a hug?
- Come here,

654
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,130
Take care of yourself, son.

655
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,590
Sure. You too.

656
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,270
Gotta go.

657
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,540
Bye bye.

658
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,120
Bye bye.

659
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,570
I don't wanna go.

660
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,060
- I have to go.
- Bye bye, son.

661
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,610
- Safe trip.
- Sure. Thank you.

662
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,740
Bye.

663
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,160
- I don't wanna go.
- Have a safe trip.

664
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,190
Sure.

665
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,700
P'Ter.

666
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:31,930
Hmm?

667
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:39,130
Send me lots of pictures, okay?

668
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,120
Um sure.

669
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,260
Be good in school.

670
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,670
Ok, I will.

671
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,780
Bye bye. I really have to go.

672
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,000
- I'm leaving.
- Bye bye.

673
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,750
-  See you.
- Bye bye.

674
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,830
I'm still missing him.

675
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,710
Bye bye, Ter.

676
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,120
When will I get to see him again?

677
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,010
Mom, I wanna have some cake.

678
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,270
- Let's go.
- What cake?

679
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,460
- Coconut cake.
- Okay. Let's go.

680
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,330
- You want some cocoa too?
- Sure.

681
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,050
Are you nervous?

682
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,460
Yeah. Why I wouldn't be?

683
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,640
Seeing your grandpa again.

684
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,980
It's alright. I will be with you.

685
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,620
Yeah.

686
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,870
Hello.

687
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,560
Hello.

688
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,940
This is your boyfriend?

689
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,690
Let me see. Come closer.

690
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,570
Yes.

691
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,190
What's your name?

692
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,460
Easter.

693
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,560
Sounds familiar.

694
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,890
Is this the kid?

695
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,830
I was rooting for you.

696
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,540
You know me?

697
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,980
I know.

698
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,270
He used to tell me so many of your stories.

699
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,160
That he had a crush on a kid.

700
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,420
But he couldn't approach or talk to you.
I didn't know what to do either.

701
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,500
Grandma.

702
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,620
You don't have to be shy anymore.

703
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,100
- Is this true?
- Yes.

704
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,360
He was so shy back then.

705
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:45,190
I didn't know how am I gonna help him.
He always said that you're cute here and there.

706
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,970
When you eat, you're cute.
When you laugh, you're also cute.

707
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,290
He couldn't approach you.

708
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,830
I was so hopeless.

709
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,230
But congratulations.

710
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:56,700
Thank you.

711
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,320
How are you, grandma?

712
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,360
I'm better, but I still cannot walk properly.

713
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:09,020
But it's fine, grandpa is taking care of me.

714
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,050
I stopped working now.

715
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,790
That's good, so you won't stress and put it on the kids.

716
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,160
Hill has a issue because of you.

717
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,100
You shouldn't bring that up again.

718
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,530
Now, you're regretting what you did.

719
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,050
I have to apologize on behalf of grandpa.

720
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,480
It's fine.

721
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,890
You don't have to apologize.

722
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,260
I'm also old. I wanna see my only nephew be happy.

723
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,790
Hill has grown up differently from other kids.

724
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,330
I would never ask for anything else, except for him to never be like the old days.

725
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,850
If grandpa does anything to you again, tell me.
I will handle him.

726
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,320
Hill.

727
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,810
- Yes, grandma?
- Come in fornt of me please.

728
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,230
Here. I have a gift for you.

729
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,490
I don't have anything much for you.

730
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,420
I also gave your dad a necklace like this.

731
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,300
Here.

732
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,340
Give it to someone you love.

733
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,540
That's why your mom has it.

734
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,370
You mean...

735
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,010
I think this necklace suits him.

736
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,030
And don't take it back from him.

737
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,440
Grandma!

738
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,960
Thank you.

739
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,940
Grandma. P'Hill.

740
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,140
Why are you running? You could fall.

741
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,080
Grandpa wants me to bring you guys this.

742
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,080
I was wondering where were you.
You went for some snacks.

743
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,460
No, I did not.

744
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:57,960
Grandpa wants me to prepare this for grandma.

745
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,240
Let me see.

746
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,970
Let me try whether it's good or not.

747
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,450
Try it.

748
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,090
Good?

749
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,150
You try it.

750
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,630
Thank you.

751
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,560
Here...your turn.

752
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:17,250
Good?

753
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,000
So you can answer it yourself.

754
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,510
A bit too sweet.

755
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,620
Then you need to tell grandpa. Don't tell me.

756
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,430
This is your room?

757
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,010
I actually never liked this room.

758
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,190
When I first moved here,

759
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:50,940
my grandma was still in a coma.

760
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,170
I was always grounded in this room.

761
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,200
I had to study for the exam...

762
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,790
in this room.

763
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,450
Didn't go anywhere.

764
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:01,600
I was always in this room.

765
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,360
But now that I have you here with me,

766
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,100
I feel like...

767
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,320
it's feels so much better in here.

768
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,030
It would be nice
if I could be here with you back then.

769
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,790
So you didn't have to face that alone.

770
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,590
Buti it's all good now.

771
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:27,530
Seeing you here with me,
already fulfills how much I've missed you in the past.

772
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:35,030
But if we have to be apart again,

773
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,120
I don't think I can handle that.

774
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,310
P'Hill.

775
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,950
Me either.

776
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,270
You can't run away from me again.

777
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:50,730
I promise.

778
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,800
You still have it?

779
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,570
What is it?

780
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,470
The wishing bottle
I gave you at the last orientation.

781
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,260
I do. It's important for me.

782
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,570
This is nice. It took a lot of time to do this.

783
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,240
You did all the foldings?

784
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,690
Yes..

785
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,530
It took forever.

786
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,260
Had to practice for awhile.

787
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,820
Thank you.

788
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:27,680
Thank you too.

789
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,110
Hey Jo.

790
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,040
You actually brought him.

791
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,280
- Hello.
- Hello.

792
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,190
Let's go inside.

793
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:07,310
Everyone is waiting in the living room.

794
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,130
Let's go.

795
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,080
Are you nervous?

796
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,950
To be honest, yes. I'm super nervous.

797
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,730
You'll be fine.

798
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,400
If you said so.

799
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,190
Hello.

800
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:52,540
This is the one?

801
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,940
Don't stare at him for too long.

802
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,480
Our son is very protective.

803
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,850
Come. Come sit with me.

804
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,200
I cannot see you clearly.

805
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,650
This is the kid that you told me about?

806
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,290
Yes, mom.

807
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,210
You live nearby?

808
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,850
Yes.

809
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,060
He's got you under control, huh?

810
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:25,750
It's good that you have someone to monitor.
I'm tired of tracking you.

811
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,560
I told you.
If you're tired to do, then stop tracking me.

812
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:30,230
You're still arrogant like usual.

813
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:32,670
That's not the only thing that I'm good at.

814
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,430
Again. These two.

815
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:37,540
Never stayed true to yourself.

816
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,870
You are actually..

817
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,750
glad about this, right?

818
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,280
I have to go.

819
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:52,360
What!?
You only get to talk to him for only a few mins.

820
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,690
Too bad  we have urgenet work.

821
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,810
So we didn't get to talk much.

822
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,120
Please come visit us again.

823
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,860
Sure, ma'am.

824
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,100
Let's go babe.

825
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,360
Yes.

826
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:09,150
Come give me a hug.

827
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,870
Jeen.

828
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,220
Just one hug.

829
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,970
See you later.

830
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,140
I have to go.

831
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,660
See you, son.

832
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,520
Bye.

833
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,080
Your family is so adorable.

834
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,110
I'm getting nervous to meet your family now.

835
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,350
Why do you have to be?

836
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,950
My family is nice.

837
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,850
Woah.

838
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,550
I still remember clearly
when your mom dragged your ears out of the internet cafe.

839
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,940
Let's go inside. Your grandma is waiting.

840
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,170
To be honest,

841
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,530
I used to drive pass your house a lot.

842
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,410
Never thought I would get to see the inside.

843
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,670
And it's actually more beautiful than
what I had imagined.

844
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,240
Mom.

845
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,570
You're here! I miss you so much.

846
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:30,610
Wait wait. I miss you.
Miss you so much!

847
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,460
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet. I'm waiting for you.

848
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:34,930
Hello ma'am.

849
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,860
Hi.

850
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,980
My mom wants me to give you these.

851
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,140
Thank you.
You guys actually didn't have to do this.

852
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,510
Miss you so much.

853
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,980
Let's go inside. It's too hot out here.

854
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:53,460
Let's go inside. It's cooler in there.

855
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,780
You're Johan, right?

856
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:58,570
- Can I just call you Jo?
- Yes.

857
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,580
You're a second year? Then you're his senior.

858
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,850
Is he stubborn?

859
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,150
He is.

860
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,790
Like really stubborn.

861
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,600
Hey! Me? Stubborn?

862
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,550
You're making that up. Here.

863
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,160
He's always been stubborn since he was a little kid.

864
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,970
You need to scold him a lot.

865
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,270
If you don't,
he's not gonna listen to you.

866
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,180
Sure.

867
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,650
He's always been stubborn, huh?

868
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,940
Yeah, since he was young. Always got in a fight.

869
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,590
Others wanted to fight him.
Sometimes he started the fight.

870
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,130
Always been like that when he was young.

871
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,730
That's why..

872
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:37,020
How did you two meet?

873
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,440
- He actually got into a fight at a bar.
- Hey P'!

874
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,160
Don't be a snitch.

875
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,010
You did something again!?

876
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,760
You always hide it from me.
Never told me anything.

877
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,750
It's a long time ago, mom.

878
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:51,280
Mom. I wanna eat now.

879
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,570
You always do like this
when I caught that you got in trouble.

880
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,600
Let's go. I'm hungry.
I miss your cooking. Go. Go.

881
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,470
Yeah. You're always like this.

882
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:59,650
-  Please. I want to eat your Pak kad jor.
- You never told me anything.

883
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,700
Cook for me first, mom.

884
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,570
When he was young,
he was the leader of the gang around here.

885
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:11,010
Used to cause trouble for me to solve everyday.
People around here know.

886
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:13,650
Oh and this is not it.
I almost forgot to tell you.

887
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,880
North is someone who likes to shows off his partner.

888
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:19,010
Ugh. That's enough mom.

889
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,500
Really? And what did he tell you?

890
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:26,550
He said
'My boyfriend is so handsome, mom'

891
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,220
Really?

892
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,960
- That's not it. There're more.
- Mom!

893
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:37,370
He called me and said
'he's so nice to me like this and that.'

894
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,340
'What should I do?'

895
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,790
'North loves him. North likes him a lot'

896
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:48,960
'Did you know that he's the first person
that makes me wanna change and be a better person?'

897
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,370
'And I will also do better in studying.'

898
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,240
Mom. I won't tell you anything anymore.

899
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,790
Ughh. Just let me.

900
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,260
Why have you never told me that?

901
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:03,080
Yeah why not?
So he knows how you feel.

902
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,080
Let's eat. Let's eat.

903
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,070
Ughh. Why are you so shy?

904
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,210
Your face and your ears are all red.

905
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,020
I'm being honest. I didn't lie.
I'm telling P'Jo the truth

906
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,530
You're like that.

907
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,890
- Not done yet.
- You're the one who called me and told me all those.

908
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,910
What did you talk to my mom after the meal?

909
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,230
Gossiping about you.

910
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:37,120
It's nothing. I just asked for her permission to take you out of town.

911
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,030
Oh.

912
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,110
And are you okay with my family?

913
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,670
Of course.

914
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,700
But my mom seems to love you.

915
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,670
Probably more than she loves me.

916
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:57,550
What am I gonna do if she loves you more?

917
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,060
What about you?

918
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,860
Hmm?

919
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,490
Do you love me?

920
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:11,520
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

921
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,330
I do love you.

922
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,920
That's more than enough for me.

923
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,850
Why is Tiger calling me?

924
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,520
Put him on speaker.

925
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,120
What's up dude?

926
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:46,840
It's Nao. Nao.

927
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:49,050
What's wrong with Nao? Are you drunk?

928
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,980
No, I'm not.

929
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,100
What's going on?

930
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,000
Nao...

931
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:59,500
It's Nao.

932
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:02,570
- He's--
- Duennao. What the hell are you talking about?

933
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,970
Am I gonna find out today what do you want?

934
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,080
I don't wanna be like this.

935
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,940
I'm--

936
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,950
- What do you need?
- Oh hey P'.

937
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:14,310
You're also there?

938
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,660
That's nice. You two are together.

939
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,770
- What you actually need just tell me?
- Forget it.

940
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,660
Oh P'Jo.

941
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,570
North...

942
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:28,660
actually owes me money.

943
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:31,210
He blackmailed me for a hundred thousand.

944
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:32,760
Hundred thousand.

945
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:40,320
He threatened me.
Always threaten me about Nao. Same topic.

946
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,750
That's funny.

947
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:44,770
You're talking nonsense when you're drunk.

948
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,890
Nonsense what?

949
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:51,800
- What!?
- Hello? Sorry. Ger is too drunk.

950
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,990
Over Nao?

951
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,870
I guess so. He's wasted.

952
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,610
But I think it's nothing.
He probably just misunderstood.

953
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,180
Misunderstanding what?

954
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,390
Yeah I need to hang up.
Sorry to bug you man.

955
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,290
Yeah.

956
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,530
You borrowed his money?

957
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,700
You got me curious.

958
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,130
How scary were you when you threatened him..

959
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,540
..and got a hundred thousand?

960
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,020
Show me.

961
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:26,520
I didn't threaten him or anything.

962
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,590
I just asked him to buy me some drinks.

963
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,310
And why you've never asked me?

964
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,350
I won't ask you.

965
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,700
I will just steal..

966
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:36,070
...when you're asleep.

967
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,490
I will steal your wallet and disappear without any trace.

968
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:43,000
- Disappear?
- Yeah gone.

969
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:44,780
You won't be able to find me.

970
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,530
If you want my wallet, then take it.

971
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,160
I can give you anything.

972
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,540
But I won't let you go anywhere.

973
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,400
Er...

974
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,980
Have you ever...

975
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:06,240
seen me play a guitar before?

976
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,950
You play guitar?

977
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,750
I play a little.

978
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:14,310
But I'm not a professional or anything.

979
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:18,970
Come to think of it...

980
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:21,910
we never had a flirty moment at all, did we?

981
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:26,510
I will play the guitar to flirt with you then.

982
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,390
I will make you blush so hard.

983
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,830
Not forgetting anything?

984
01:00:18,830 --> 01:00:22,160
- Probably not.
- No, you always forget.

985
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:25,820
- You know me too well.
- Have a safe trip, son. Have fun.

986
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:26,670
Sure.

987
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:30,220
Jo.
If he's stubborn to you, come tell me.

988
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,370
Ugh mom. I've never been stubborn.

989
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,980
Really?

990
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,780
Ma'am. Would you excuse us?
We have to go.

991
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:39,700
Sure. Good luck.

992
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:40,930
Come here.

993
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,310
Let me kiss you.

994
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:46,590
I'm leaving.

995
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:47,930
- Safe trip son.
- I'll travel for you too.

996
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,950
Sure.

997
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,150
Drive safe.

998
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:04,940
Hey!

999
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,420
Wow~

1000
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:12,080
It's so beautiful, P'Jo.

1001
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,880
Come take a look.

1002
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:16,690
Look.

1003
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,090
There's a boat too.

1004
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,780
Do you come to the beach often?

1005
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,910
I don't know what to do here.

1006
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,200
Well...

1007
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,860
Right...maybe cause you have to work.

1008
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:30,710
So you don't have much time to travel often.

1009
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,790
Then let's take this opportunity to do it.

1010
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:36,730
Over there.

1011
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,860
Surprise!!

1012
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:54,660
- How did you guys get here?
- Beause of P'Johan...

1013
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,420
so we got a free trip.

1014
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,980
I was gonna invite everyone,

1015
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,410
but these are all the people who can.

1016
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,640
Thank you.

1017
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,820
Come on. Let's eat.
I'm hungry.

1018
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,220
Sure. Sure.

1019
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,370
Being at the beach like this is so nice.

1020
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:06,630
Um.

1021
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:11,470
Oh Nao.

1022
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,320
- Hm?
- About the Boston trip to see your brother...

1023
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,020
Why? You changed your mind?

1024
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,320
- Really!?
- Yeah.

1025
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,340
But...

1026
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:36,570
I still need to save more money. A long way to go.

1027
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,670
It probably wont't be anytime soon.

1028
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,580
Actually...

1029
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,700
you can borrow me first
and pay me back later.

1030
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,850
What?

1031
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,250
- For real?
- Yeah.

1032
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,020
- Wait. Wait.
- Hmm?

1033
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:01,000
- What are you doing?
- To record as a proof.

1034
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,760
In case you changed your mind.
What am I gonna do?

1035
01:04:03,890 --> 01:04:05,420
Here. I'm about to record.

1036
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,810
- Say it again.
- What do you want me to say?

1037
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,890
Just say umm...

1038
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:17,900
Suer will lend Nao some money to go see his brother in Boston.

1039
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:20,650
Here we go.

1040
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,620
Come on. I'm recording.

1041
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:31,730
Suer will lend Nao some money to go see his brother in Boston.

1042
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:34,410
Happy now?

1043
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:37,580
I am.

1044
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,510
Thank you.

1045
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,440
Here. Take a bite. It's dripping.

1046
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,360
Do you like it?

1047
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:19,560
I do.

1048
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:35,210
Smile. Come on.

1049
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:41,590
You like to take pictures of me.

1050
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,520
So I wanna take pictures of you too.

1051
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:44,780
Really?

1052
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,030
Can you take when I'm over there too?

1053
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:50,030
Please.

1054
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,550
P'Jo.

1055
01:06:24,450 --> 01:06:26,380
Now, I understand...

1056
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,610
why Ter likes to take pictures of P'Hill everyday.

1057
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:32,370
I have always wondered that.

1058
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,330
Even though P'Hill looks the same everyday.

1059
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:41,150
But it's because he wants to keep and see the pictures for himself.

1060
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:43,910
And it never gets old.

1061
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,230
You're so sweet.

1062
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:55,430
- Do you like it
-What?

1063
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,190
Do you like it here?

1064
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,150
I do.

1065
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,280
I like it a lot.

1066
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,190
Thank you, P'Jo.

1067
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:10,550
For everything you have ever done for me.

1068
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,750
P'Jo.

1069
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,570
Do you have any idea...

1070
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:29,030
that everything right here right now is really good.

1071
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,310
It's too good and it makes me scared.

1072
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,430
Scared of what?

1073
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,750
Scared that you might be bored of me someday.

1074
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,160
I cannot imagine.

1075
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,800
I felt like this once
when someone warned me about you.

1076
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,080
I thought I can handle it.

1077
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:53,260
No matter what I have to face.

1078
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,960
I will love you like I'm not afraid of anything.

1079
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,390
But at the end...

1080
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,950
I still feel afraid.

1081
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:06,250
Um.

1082
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:10,030
Have you ever thought about your future?

1083
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:12,770
I have.

1084
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,480
I wanna have a family. Have a house.

1085
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,760
I want my mom to live comfortably.

1086
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:19,780
And...

1087
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,610
what about your dreams?

1088
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,200
It's you.

1089
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:35,330
You've always been my dream.

1090
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:40,400
I never wanted to be someone or do something.

1091
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:43,450
If I didn't meet you,

1092
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:46,270
I would have probably just live my life day by day.

1093
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,780
And...

1094
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:49,750
live without life goal.

1095
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,740
P'Jo.

1096
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,990
I just wanna have you by my side...

1097
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,750
no matter what's gonna happen in the future.

1098
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:01,270
Wherever you would like to go, I'll take you.

1099
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:06,010
Whatever you wanna do, I will support you.

1100
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,350
If it's not you...

1101
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:12,950
I probably couldn't love anyone anymore.

1102
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,350
So...

1103
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:19,870
can you be with me forever?

1104
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:24,390
Yes.

1105
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,780
Forever.

1106
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:29,490
I love you, North.

1107
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,100
I love you too.

1108
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,310
The stars are so beautiful tonight.

1109
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:43,130
Yeah.

1110
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,900
Are there gonna be any meteors?

1111
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,470
I don't know.

1112
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:53,130
Why?

1113
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,440
I just thought...

1114
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,330
it would be so pretty if we get to see meteors.

1115
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,970
If we don't get to see it tonight...

1116
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:12,400
then...

1117
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,340
let's make a wish from the moon instead, shall we?

1118
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,900
The moon is so pretty tonight.

1119
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,990
What kind of wish would you like to ask for?

1120
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:31,950
I would wish for smartness,

1121
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:37,390
diligence, and prosperity.

1122
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,990
or I can eat as much and never gained weight.

1123
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,290
Oh...

1124
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,830
and maybe a bit taller in terms of height.

1125
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,010
What about you?

1126
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,090
What would you like to wish for?

1127
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,650
Me?

1128
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:55,720
I don't wanna wish for anything else.

1129
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,580
Just for me having you by my side like this...

1130
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:02,370
and won't go anywhere.

1131
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,540
I'm more than happy with these.

1132
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:16,100
The moon says...

1133
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,880
the person right here...

1134
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:20,970
won't leave or go anywhere ever.

1135
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:24,680
Really?

1136
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,640
Then...

1137
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:31,900
can I change my wish?

1138
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:34,750
Change to what?

1139
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:41,250
I'd like to wish for....

1140
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,830
both of us to see the moon...

1141
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,310
like this every year.

1142
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,530
Sure.

1143
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:04,150
The moon is so kind.

1144
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,190
I took them for you.

1145
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:32,350
Both meteors,

1146
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:33,770
and the moon.

1147
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:37,720
You're a liar. That's not possible.

1148
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,260
They're so beautiful.

1149
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,820
My grandma gave me this necklace.

1150
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,590
She told me to give it to a person
who's really important to me.

1151
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,300
P'Hill.

1152
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:23,820
I love you.

1153
01:14:27,910 --> 01:14:29,830
I love you too, Ter.

1154
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,340
But I love you more.

1155
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,860
But I love you more.

1156
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:39,690
I do more.

1157
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,680
How much?

1158
01:14:45,530 --> 01:14:49,110
Like as much as the stars in the sky right now.

1159
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,490
Stars in the sky?

1160
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:54,780
Then I love you more.

1161
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,420
Not true.

1162
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,020
I love you more. No more arguing.

1163
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:01,680
Why not?

1164
01:15:04,016 --> 01:15:05,160
Do you know...

1165
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:06,560
who I am?

1166
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,570
You're my boyfriend, right?

1167
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,760
Yes.

1168
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:16,590
Hence, you can't argue with your boyfriend.

1169
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,680
Fine. I surrender.
