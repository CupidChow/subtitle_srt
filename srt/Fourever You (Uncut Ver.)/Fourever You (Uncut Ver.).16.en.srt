1
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,490
I...

2
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,490
miss you.

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,690
You miss him that much?

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,510
Yeah.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,240
Then call him.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,600
I do not dare to call him, P?Hill.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,620
I'm afraid that I might disturb him.

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,640
I miss you.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,110
I miss you so much.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,140
Having you by my side,

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,260
makes everything better.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,790
Will you be my boyfriend?

13
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,190
P'Jo

14
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,730
Why do you like me?

15
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,050
There are many people who have a crush on you.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,410
But why me?

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't even see anything interesting in myself.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,470
I like you since forever ago. Why?

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,980
Can you tell me more?

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,140
About what?

21
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,320
About since when did you start to like me.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,780
You wanna hear it?

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,320
Come sit here.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,340
Kiss me one time and I'll answer you one question.

25
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,740
No freaking way.

26
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,870
Why not?
Don't you want to know anymore?

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,560
I don't have to tell you then.

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,010
What do you want to know?

29
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,910
Well...

30
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,320
I want to know...

31
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,580
how long have you liked me?

32
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,210
Like since when?

33
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,820
It's been so long. Like since 3 years ago.

34
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,250
3 years!?

35
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,680
That means...

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,570
since I was in grade 10 then?

37
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,330
That's also another question.

38
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,740
You're cheating.

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,410
I had a big crush on you back then,
you know that?

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,710
-  But you rejected me.
- Huh!?

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,850
Me?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
Rejecting you?

43
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,230
- I've gotta leave for school.
- You're late again today.

44
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,820
- You're so beautiful again today.
- Hmm. My grandson is such a player.

45
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,290
- Rong. Don't forget to buy Jo as usual.
- Yes ma'am.

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,430
Can I just skip it?

47
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,590
No, you cannot
cause you neve wake up in time for breakfast.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,980
And come back for the dinner this evening too.

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,290
- Sure. Sure.
- There.

50
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,550
- I really have to go.
- Yeah.

51
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,750
Wow. How rich must I be to have a house this big?

52
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,310
Can't I just skip it?

53
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,770
You may not, sir.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,830
Your grandma already ordered me.

55
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,910
Don't let that kid make it.

56
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,730
Cannot. We also cannot choose who to make.

57
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,530
Did you tell him not to make it sweet?

58
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,140
Yes, I normally do.

59
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,460
He always make it so sweet.

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,030
- Please make sure that he doesn't make it sweet.
- Sure.

61
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,490
All done. Thank you.

62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,800
Oh uncle again.

63
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,420
- You want the usual?
- Yes, but don't make it sweet.

64
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,390
Sure sir.

65
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
How can I make it good If it's not sweet?

66
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,980
All set.
I also give you free fried dumplings cause you're my regular customer.

67
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,440
- Enjoy the food.
- Sure.

68
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,450
Here uncle.

69
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,460
There you go sir.

70
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,690
Ughh. So sweet.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,540
That kid made this soy milk again?

72
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,700
Next time, don't let this kid make my soy milk please.

73
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,600
But we can't force other people to do or not to do, sir.

74
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,220
But he's such s sweet kid,
he gave me free fried dumplings.

75
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,940
He told me it's because I'm his regular customer.

76
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,650
Hey.

77
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,980
Why do you like this stall so much?

78
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,310
Eat it everyday.

79
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,530
I don't have a choice.
My grandma makes me.

80
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,230
Oh and do you remember the kid who sells?

81
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,380
He comes to my shop so often.

82
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,850
Who?

83
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,220
You drink his soy milk everyday,
but you don't remember him?

84
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,870
Do I need to memorize who he is?

85
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,130
Johan.

86
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,340
You should pay attention to your surroundings too.

87
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,570
Wanna read?

88
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,400
This?

89
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,380
Hey.

90
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,050
Why are you two dressing like this?

91
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,280
Your shirt is not tucked in, the ties are undone.
And you're not even wearing one.

92
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,510
For the hair,

93
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,690
why don't you guys get a nice hair cut?

94
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,130
Ugh miss. People do not care
or be conservative on how you dress anymore.

95
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,470
Stop talking!

96
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,320
Frank is also just like you guys. The three of you...

97
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,340
always bend the rules.

98
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,340
What are you looking for?

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,840
It's just the two of us sitting here.
Where's Frank?

100
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,500
Stop fooling around.

101
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,490
Come see me at my office.

102
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,290
Lucky us!

103
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,530
- Let's chill at the nice A/C room.
- Yeah. We don't have to be in the class too.

104
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,860
You guys!

105
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,160
What now?

106
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,000
Would you like us to be in your office or in the class?

107
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,470
Come see me at my office at noon, lunch break.

108
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,190
Now, go stand for the morning national flag.

109
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,700
- Get up! Why are you still sitting? Put these stuff away too.
- Go. Go.

110
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
You are always stay out of the line.

111
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,380
Don't let me see you two in these conditions again.

112
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,120
You're sure she's not gonna be pissed?
She wants to see you in her office, doesn't she?

113
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,090
- I'll do that some other days.
- Going to my cafe?

114
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,840
Let's play some chess.

115
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,950
7 rounds of chess.

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,180
- Huh?N- Come play  the chess with me. Just a min.

117
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,400
- You're at the internet cafe, Frank.
- But I wanna play chess.

118
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,570
- Hey but I wanna play games.
- Play with me first. Just for a minute. Play games later.

119
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,620
- You can't play games just yet!
- I'll hit you!

120
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,770
Dude!

121
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,140
You guys are playing chess?

122
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,630
- Ask him. I was playing video games,
- You're at an internet cafe, but you're playing chess?

123
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,910
Yeah.

124
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,590
I'll be back.

125
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,440
There we go.

126
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,080
Johan. Are you skipping class again?
The teacher called me.

127
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,740
Why do you ask since you already knew?

128
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,490
Why don't you be in class?

129
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,260
I'm lazy.

130
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,580
When are you gonna stop acting like this?

131
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,460
I'm okay if you're not gonna pay attention in class or whatever.

132
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,480
If you don't wanna study, then resign and come work with me.
Don't act like this.

133
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,900
What I do is my business, doesn't it?

134
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,770
Aren't you so sick of hearing people tell you
that don't know anything in life?

135
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,910
Always rely on your parents like this?

136
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,020
And how many times have you said this?
Aren't you so sick of saying it?

137
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,760
I am! I'm so sick of disciplining you.

138
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,170
Yeah then that's it.

139
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,250
Hey Frank!

140
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,880
- There.
- Here. Here. I'll capture all of them. I'm done playing.

141
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,770
You cheated!

142
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,130
- Your dad called?
- Um.

143
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,720
Hey.

144
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,760
Let's play some games to cool down your mood.

145
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,650
Shall we?

146
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,890
- I'll go with you guys.
- You just play your chess.

147
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,850
- You're done at 6.30pm, right?
- Yes.

148
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,250
- I'll come pick you up.
- See you.

149
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,580
Be have okay?

150
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,150
Bye bye.

151
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,620
She's blushing.

152
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,180
Oh you come so late today.

153
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,700
I got caught up a bit.

154
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,540
- As usual.
- As usual.

155
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,910
This one too.

156
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,930
Hello. What's up?

157
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,553
North, where are you? At home?

158
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,615
No, I'm at the internet cafe.
What do you want?

159
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,774
I need help with my homework. Have to hand in tomorrow.
Are you free?

160
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,610
I guess I am. Come see me here then.

161
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:53,631
Ok. I'll be there.

162
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,370
Okay okay.

163
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,990
Come on.

164
00:11:59,406 --> 00:12:01,530
Let's play some games.

165
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:06,760
Help me. Help me.

166
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,710
Hey.

167
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,350
Let's do some homework for me, my friend.

168
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,240
Which subject?

169
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,750
The survey.

170
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,120
I need people to fill out the survey for me,
but hasn't reached the number yet.

171
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,270
So I think...

172
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,820
I'll just ask them myself.

173
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,170
What's the topic?

174
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,930
Their opinions towards rich or poor people.

175
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,240
Something like that.

176
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:38,020
- Damn. Your topic is actually interesting. Do you wanna know mine?
- What is it?

177
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,000
- Kibble food that dogs like.
- For real?

178
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,720
Yeah.

179
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,190
- Shit.
- It's for people who are new to owning a dog.

180
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,410
What do you wanna ask me?

181
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,930
What do you think of rich people?

182
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,650
What do other people say?

183
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,790
Mostly jealous.

184
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,120
They are born with golden and silver spoons.
They're good in life, yeah?

185
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,750
But some people also say that those who are rich by self-made,

186
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,550
those are more respectable than
who are rich because of their parents,

187
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,540
Those are not the real rich.

188
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,870
- Why?
- Hey.

189
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,980
Because those who are born in a rich family,
they're already living comfortably.

190
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,970
They don't have to study. Don't have to work.

191
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,040
Unlike you that you have to work your ass off for yourself.

192
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,460
What do you think?

193
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,810
Me?

194
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,240
To be honest, it depends.

195
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,660
If...

196
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,350
their parents are rich and they're happy with it...

197
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,630
it's their business.

198
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,290
Don't you think it's unfair?

199
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,590
Those who are rich,

200
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,710
they can be successful easily.

201
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:50,820
Loot at you.
You have to work so hard.

202
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,770
It's never fair in this world, isn't it?

203
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,060
It's not like you're born rich
and you'll be successful.

204
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,040
You need to use your ability
and your skills to make it happen to.

205
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,140
I actually think those people,
they might have a different kind of pressure

206
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,810
that we would never expect either.

207
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,220
Think about it, being rich...

208
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,060
you exist in the society.

209
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,700
You are being judged and compared...

210
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,540
Life like that is not easy.

211
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,120
But...

212
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,660
rich people might have a better start in lives than others.

213
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,630
Like if they wanna start a business,

214
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,460
even if they fall or fail,
they would never really hurt that much.

215
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,830
cause they have all the support to support them.

216
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,610
It's like they fall onto the their own bed.

217
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,240
And what do you think of those
who still ask their parents for money?

218
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,250
Umm..there's nothing wrong with that actually.

219
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,660
If their parents are okay,

220
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,330
and they are happy doing that,

221
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,090
it's their business.
But If I were them,

222
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,450
if I have the support and a good start,

223
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,380
I would wanna start doing something.

224
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,470
And if people look down on me,

225
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,610
I will do it and prove them.

226
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,340
That I have skills and I can do it.

227
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,550
- You're so cool!
- For sure.

228
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,900
- Quote me on that too.
- Of course.

229
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,070
- I need to quote you on that.
- Put a picture of me crossing my arm over my chest like a life coach.

230
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,940
- Isn't that too much?
- Hey do it.

231
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm so cool, am I not?

232
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,020
Why are you standing there, Jo?

233
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,840
Don't you go inside and eat.

234
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,130
Hmm?

235
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,760
Grandma.

236
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,720
Do you think I'm useless?

237
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,970
Why do you think that way?

238
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:46,870
Cause...

239
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,890
I have never done anything.

240
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,520
Never studied.

241
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,990
Always fooling around.

242
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,290
People probably think I jsut use my parents' money everyday.

243
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,200
It's your father again, isn't it?

244
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,530
And do you think you're that kind of person?

245
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:07,850
You're never useless in my eyes.

246
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,110
You're my grandson. I would do anything for you.

247
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,060
I love you.

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Yeah, grandma.

249
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,380
But if I were them,

250
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,800
f I have the support and a good start,

251
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,480
I would wanna start doing something.

252
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,490
And if people look down on me,

253
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,670
I will do it and prove them.

254
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,660
That I have skills and I can do it.

255
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,820
What are you reading?

256
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,020
Such a wimp.

257
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,410
You look stressed.

258
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,430
- Oh James.
- Hmm?

259
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,930
Do you remember that kid from soy milk stall?

260
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,440
Yeah why do you ask?

261
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,660
Tell me more about him.

262
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,010
- About North?
- The guy who always come play games at your cafe.

263
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,410
- Um.
- His name is North?

264
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,460
Um his name is North.

265
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,340
Why do you ask?

266
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,240
Nothing.
t's just that I heard him talking to his friend yesterday.

267
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,550
Why?

268
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,140
It went right through your heart huh?

269
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,370
To be honest, he's actually the opposite of you.

270
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,980
From what I heard, his dad died.

271
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,520
he lives with his mom and his aunt.

272
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,710
Their family is not well off.

273
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,140
He has to do extra jobs.

274
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,200
Isn't he like in grade 10 only?

275
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,730
He's been working since junior high.

276
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,670
And what's he like?

277
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,430
He's a pretty chill guy.

278
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,740
People can be themselves around him.

279
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,120
- He's really like that?
- Yeah.

280
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,370
North is very lively.

281
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,370
- Follow me.
- On my way.

282
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,880
- Fire. Fire.
- I got one down.

283
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,780
Nice.

284
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,080
- I got it.
- Nice.

285
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,540
- Alright. Alright.
- Hey. Hey. Shh.

286
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,900
My mom. My mom.

287
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,970
Hello, mom?

288
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,170
Have you eaten, North?

289
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,430
I did.

290
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,160
What about you?

291
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,940
I also did.

292
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,180
Oh mom.

293
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,250
I will spend a night at my friend's today.

294
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,210
Why?

295
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,290
We will work on a group project.

296
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,940
Ok. Take care then.

297
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,660
Sure mom. Don't miss me though.

298
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,780
Sure~

299
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,390
Sure mom.

300
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,160
- Go in.
- North.

301
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,710
Are you sure lying to your mom like that?

302
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,230
Yeah I'm gonna work on my group project.

303
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,850
But our project is done.

304
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,990
Cause I wanna play games.
I can't stop playing here.

305
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,770
Up to you then.

306
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,880
- North.
- Why are you calling me? Just walk there.

307
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,740
- North!
- Oh mom!

308
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,100
You said you're working on a group project?

309
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,270
Tae. Ball.

310
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,850
Yes?

311
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,390
I already called your parents to come pick you guys up.

312
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,100
They will be here soon.

313
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,660
Thank you.

314
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,240
- And for you, come here.
- Ow. Mom.

315
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,470
- Come here.
- Mom. Mom.

316
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,400
You're lying to me now?

317
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,350
I'm fine with you addicted to playing games,

318
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,720
- But this is too much. Not going home. People do worry, you know?
- Ow. Mom.

319
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,450
Don't fool around like this.

320
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,640
Ow. Mom.

321
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,700
- You're embarrassing me.
- I'm not embarrassed.

322
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,580
You should be.

323
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,040
I was wrong.

325
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,160
Don't say sorry now.

326
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,600
You're twisting my ears like this.

327
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,510
Are you hurt? i do care about you.

328
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,780
Let's go find something yummy to eat, shall we?
So you might be in a better mood.

329
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,330
Please mom.

330
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,970
Eat something yummy.

331
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,260
So you can be in a better mood, shall we?

332
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,880
Hey you're smiling now.

333
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,730
- Let's go eat.
- Um. Fine.

334
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,960
- Something yummy, okay? Let's go.
- Yeah.

335
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,540
Stop being mad at me, yeah?

336
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,110
- Wait mom.
- What?

337
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,990
I forgot my bag.

338
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,290
Hurry and go get it.

339
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,280
Ok mom.

340
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,460
I'll be right back.

341
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,780
Hey guys.

342
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,290
See you.

343
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,690
I will go deal my mom first.

344
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,070
Good luck.

345
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,080
- I'm back.
- Come on. Hurry up.

346
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,670
Let's go eat.

347
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,260
Which restaurant shall we go?

348
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,740
- The meatball is also good.
- is it?

349
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,780
- It is.
- Sure.

350
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,740
And what kind of a person is he?

351
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,080
He's a pretty chill guy.

352
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,260
People can be themselves around him.

353
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,310
Right. Right. Done!

354
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,390
There're so many ways dude.
Hey hey. I found one.

355
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,560
Oh.

356
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,990
Here. Here. Behind me. Go in.
Behind me.

357
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,630
Be careful. Behind you!

358
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,400
Hey.

359
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,850
Dude. I'm hungry.

360
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,860
I will go use the restroom. Be right back.

361
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,910
I'm back.

362
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,280
Whose snacks are these?

363
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,650
If no one claims it, it will be mine now.

364
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,560
I'm back. Wait a minute.

365
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,770
Yeah just like that. I got you.

366
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,910
I'm going in! There!
Sorry mate.

367
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,890
Come on.

368
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,460
Feels like someone is following behind me.

369
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,430
Hey how can you jump and shoot me?
What are you? A bird?

370
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,040
Thank you.

371
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,830
Please P'James.

372
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,220
I already gave you a few minutes.

373
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,670
A bit more please.

374
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,070
How long did you play just now?

375
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,960
- 2 hours.
- And you want more?

376
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,410
2 more.

377
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,910
What a way for me to make so much profits.

378
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,840
Please. I don't normally ask you this.

379
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,150
I just gave you some.
Fine. I'll give you 2 more.

380
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,300
- 2 hours?
- 2 minutes.

381
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,580
I cannot even log into the game just 2 mins.

382
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,780
What!?

383
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,250
Can I ask you something?

384
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,080
If...

385
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,020
If...

386
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,500
What!?

387
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,510
Do you think...

388
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:37,720
is it weird if I like someone even that person has never done anything for me?

389
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,580
What are you actually asking?

390
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,680
And what do you think?
What do people do if they like someone?

391
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,090
Are they gonna take bullets for each other like the movies?

392
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,990
Bang. Bang.

393
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,440
I don't know.

394
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,660
It's not weird.
You can just see someone and fall for them too.

395
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,830
Why? Who are you having crush on?

396
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,030
Yeah...a person like you, Jo?

397
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,860
- Who is it?
- How am I supposed to know?

398
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,840
He's a Nong.
(Thais use Nong to call someone younger)

399
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,460
Nong?

400
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,120
North!?

401
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,720
Yeah.

402
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,410
I knew it!

403
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,270
You always check him out.

404
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,480
And you've been coming to my cafe a lot too.

405
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,300
You really like him for real? Why though?

406
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,100
I'm not sure why either.

407
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,470
That's why I ask whether it's possible for someone to like a person that has never done anything to you?

408
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,520
But it's not totally true that he's never done anything to me.

409
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,980
He's the reason why I wanna change myself.

410
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,050
I wanna see him smile.

411
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,180
I don't wanna see him being cute with anyone else.

412
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,650
I don't think you just like him, but you're obsessed with him.

413
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,840
Let me take care of this for you.

414
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,780
Are you gonna make it work or worse?

415
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:08,260
We're rooting for you.

416
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,310
What are you doing?

417
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,000
Trust me.

418
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,280
- What are you gonna do? Tell me first.
- Just stay still.

419
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,010
- North.
- Yes, P'?

420
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,180
- I have question.
- What is it?

421
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,810
My friend really likes you.

422
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,410
He actually wanna tell you himself,

423
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,090
but I think I should ask you first.

424
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,660
Whether you're dating someone?

425
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,540
I am actually.

426
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,800
Oh really?

427
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,660
Um.

428
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,970
How come I don't know?

429
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,260
Last time, you said you're not dating anyone.

430
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,280
I was trying to pursue her back then.

431
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,620
We just made it official a few days ago.

432
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,490
I'm sorry.

433
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,320
But...

434
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,940
my friend really likes you...like a lot.

435
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,210
Don't you wanna try talking? Just a little?

436
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,860
Ugh.

437
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,330
I told you. I'm already seeing someone.

438
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,350
If I agree to do that, that means I'll be cheating.

439
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,840
Um.

440
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,450
but my friend really likes you, North.

441
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,530
Wrong timing I guess.

442
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,090
- I'm sorry bro.
- Um.

443
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,010
- You'll find soon.
- Run. Run.

444
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,970
- You need to use your pinky.
- Pinky finger?

445
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,970
It looks more professional.

446
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,910
- Oh it's more professional?
- Yeah.

447
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,460
- Run. Run.
- Using your thumb doesn't look professional.

448
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,090
- This?
- Here. Found it.

449
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,340
- Go in.
- Okay. Oh.

450
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,830
Why?

451
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,550
Run. Run. Like that.

452
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,010
So?

453
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,940
He's always here playing games with his girl everyday.

454
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,830
You're sitting there like a sad dog.

455
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
I give you that.
Seeing him with his girlfriend everyday.

456
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,540
I wanna see him. Not his girlfriend.

457
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,580
You're always here looking at him for months.

458
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,070
Does he have any idea that...

459
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,300
there's someone
so obsessed with his smile like this?

460
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,250
He can do anything just to see his smile. Wow.

461
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,350
So romantic.

462
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,300
I thought I should be fine at first,

463
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,850
but how come it hurts a little.

464
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,660
When you love someone,

465
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,500
you need to spare your feelings.
It can be hurtful too, Jo.

466
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,040
But for a person who's never been in love with anyone,

467
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,300
I know...

468
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,830
that it must be difficult.

469
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,560
Damn.

470
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,950
I feel bad for you.

471
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,350
Even...

472
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,750
there's someone for you to love,

473
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,180
but...

474
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:13,720
you don't even have the chance to at least try.

475
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,100
He rejects you all the way,

476
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,610
But that's good.
At least you know that he's faithful to his partner.

477
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,190
Um.

478
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,980
What are you gonna do now?

479
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,410
Giving up?

480
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,850
I think...

481
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,020
it's less likely that he'll breakup with his girl soon.

482
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,780
I think so too.

483
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,450
I probably won't be able to see him again.

484
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,530
- I ask my dad to work too.
- Huh?

485
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,890
I get the not seeing him part.

486
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,520
But you're gonna work!?

487
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,630
Are you sure?

488
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,020
Um.

489
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,180
It's because of him.

490
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,900
I wanna try doing something meaningful too.

491
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,710
What was your dad reaction?

492
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,470
He was surprised.

493
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,900
But he said If I take it seriously,
he will let me live with my uncle in LA.

494
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,050
LA?

495
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,180
And...are you going?

496
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,220
Um.

497
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,500
I'll probably go there for a year.

498
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,140
Then come back for university here.

499
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:25,520
It's the only way that I can move on from him.

500
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,820
Go. Go.

501
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,520
Nice. Oh.

502
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,920
What?

503
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,090
P'James.

504
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,610
P'James.

505
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,910
Hey who allow you to walk in?

506
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,910
The sign says staff only.

507
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,560
I'm not an outsider.

508
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,150
This is like my second home already.

509
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,150
What do you need?

510
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,980
Hey. You're playing guitar?

511
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,400
Um.

512
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,690
I'm actually practicing it.

513
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,610
Really?

514
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,400
- You wanna try?
- Sure.

515
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,380
What song do you wanna play?

516
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,540
Umm...

517
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,060
I'm into country songs about life lately.

518
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,290
You are?

519
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:39,600
Um.

520
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,290
Kinda tired and feeling hopeless.

521
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,240
So I need to listen to songs that inspire me.

522
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,300
Also, I have a problem with my girlfriend.

523
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,870
About what? Tell me.

524
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,890
I don't know.

525
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,420
I've been dating her for 2 months already.

526
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,570
But seems like she's never been happy being with me.

527
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,800
She's tired after class sometimes,

528
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,230
and she doesn't wanna see me.

529
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,920
I understand that she's tired,

530
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,140
but....

531
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,340
I wanna be someone who helps with her tiredness.

532
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,010
So you feel like...

533
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,570
you're useless to her?

534
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,250
I guess so.

535
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,970
If I date someone, I wanna be like a sanctuary for them.

536
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,940
Being together
and improving each other's lives.

537
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,480
Um.

538
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,140
I wanna help her no matter what happens,

539
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,440
But...

540
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,880
I can't help her with anything.
Even if...

541
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,640
I tried so hard already.

542
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,760
So I think...

543
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,500
It would be nice if you're with someone
who really wants you to be in their lives.

544
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,120
Hey.

545
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,220
Why am I telling you all those?

546
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,180
I actually wanted you to fix the computer.

547
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,380
The screen is blacked out.

548
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,310
- Um. You go wait outside. I'll be there in a sec.
- Hurry up please.

549
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,840
- Um.
- My hour is running.

550
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,520
Right. I'll do it.

551
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,430
- i'm losing my hour here.
- Go.

552
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,360
- Still not coming?
- You go ahead.

553
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,660
- Hurry up, P'.
- Yeah.

554
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,530
You heard that right?

555
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,850
Um.

556
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,150
You said you wanna move on.

557
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,420
But heard something like that...

558
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,370
are you sure you can?

559
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,020
Someone he wants to be with...

560
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,620
Someone who will improve each other's lives...

561
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,460
That's you.

562
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:58,150
But what can I do?

563
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,110
I can't do anything.

564
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,420
Should you just steal him from her?

565
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,000
- Why would I do that for?
- Hey.

566
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,700
If I do that,

567
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,060
he will be the one who disappoints the most.

568
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,640
I don't want to take his smiles away.

569
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,340
What a good guy.

570
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,810
You're leaving tomorrow?

571
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,490
Um.

572
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,840
Call us sometimes.

573
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,310
Maybe this is for the best,

574
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,340
taking time to heal yourself.

575
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,390
If you live here, you wouldn't be able to move on.

576
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,200
True.

577
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,780
I think this is enough already for this one.

578
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,440
I wanted you to wait for him actually,
but I don't think you should anymore.

579
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,680
I also don't wanna wait anymore.

580
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,090
It hurts.

581
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,670
James, please look after him.

582
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,460
Yeah.

583
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,590
I will.

584
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,860
- Oh. That was easy.
- Here. Here. There's one more.

585
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,380
- Same spot.
- Here?

586
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,140
So that was from someone who said he wants to move on.

587
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,200
Why isn't he running?

588
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,710
Jump.

589
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,690
Uncle.

590
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,150
- Hmm?
- The uncle doesn't come anymore?

591
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,800
Yeah, he doesn't come anymore.

592
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,360
You make it too sweet for him.

593
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,690
It's not. I always taste it first.

594
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,060
Or he switched to buy from some other places?

595
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,580
Yeah, just hurry, close up, and go to school already.

596
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,970
Come on. Hurry up.

597
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,900
There. There. Pack it all up over there.

598
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,600
- P'James.
- Um?

599
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,990
Same one for 2 hours.

600
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,200
Ok same table.

601
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,790
Thank you.

602
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,100
And how's everything with your girlfriend?

603
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,670
Good.

604
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,300
We're together for almost a year now.

605
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,220
Really?

606
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,850
Last time you said she doesn't wanna be with you?

607
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,870
Well...

608
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,340
now we're okay.

609
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,270
That's good.

610
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,840
- I have to go.
- Um.

611
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,910
- Oh, P'James.
- Hmm?

612
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,020
You know...

613
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,520
there's is this one guy who always gives me snacks.

614
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,740
Do you know who is this?

615
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,260
Does he....?

616
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,710
still come around?

617
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,820
Why do you ask?

618
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,380
I haven't seen him for so long already.

619
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,180
When I stay here really late,

620
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,530
he's always hang around with me.

621
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,760
Nothing...I just...

622
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,090
wanna give him back some snacks too.

623
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,000
Cause he's been giving me so often.

624
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,950
I will tell him for you if I see him.

625
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,600
- Sure. I'm really gonna go now.
- Um.

626
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,320
I brought you some snacks too.

627
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,990
That's mine though, but thanks.

628
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,300
All done.

629
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,170
Thank you.

630
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,260
Oh hey uncle!
I haven't seen you for so long.

631
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,850
My boss actually went to study abroad.

632
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,640
Boss?

633
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,900
You normally buy for someone else?

634
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,580
I thought you always buy it for yourself.

635
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,980
No, I always buy it for my young boss.

636
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,850
I can make less sweet soy milk now.

637
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,570
Yummy for sure.

638
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,300
I will give you free fried dumplings as usual.

639
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,440
Since you haven't been here for awhile.

640
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,710
It's fine. This time is on me.

641
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,880
Please tell your young boss 'Welcome home' for me.

642
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,330
Sure.

643
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,310
He told you that?

644
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,190
Yes.

645
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,150
You ran aways for a year,

646
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,060
but fall for him again because of a few fried dumplings?

647
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,830
I've been hearing the word 'wait' everyday.

648
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,180
'When is he gonna come?'

649
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,560
My friend is so into it.

650
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:25,350
Oh he was asking for you
when he came to my cafe too.

651
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,630
Why did you tell him that?

652
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,840
Hey.

653
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,920
You didn't see anyone when you were in LA?

654
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,920
I couldn't do it.

655
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,320
I tried to open my mind,

656
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,450
but I always miss him.

657
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,560
So...

658
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,350
you went away for a year...

659
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,060
but you cannot move on still?

660
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,570
If you're still like this...

661
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,020
you will stuck with him your whole life.

662
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,320
When I go to university and no longer see him,

663
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,850
will I be able move on from him?

664
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,220
You went to La, which is very far, you still cannot.

665
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,570
What do you think then?

666
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,590
Yeah.

667
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:07,980
Right.

668
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:15,690
Are you trying to kill me?

669
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,190
Oops. Sorry from the behind.

670
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,690
Shit!

671
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,060
There's no one left here.

672
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,890
Am I gonna meet any ghosts here?

673
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,240
I have to go.

674
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,530
Yeah see you.

675
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,450
Hey dude.

676
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,330
I can continue playing now.

677
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,820
There's someone just walked in.

678
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,630
Let's play until the sunrise.

679
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Yeah do it.

680
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,710
Come behind me.
I heard. I heard.

681
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,560
What time is it now?

682
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,050
Huh!?

683
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,660
For real?

684
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,800
I have to go for real.
My mom will probably yell at me now.

685
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,060
Thanks for hanging around with me.

686
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:30,900
Gotta go.

687
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,230
You'll be here alone now.

688
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,400
Please hang with me at night like you used to do it.
I'm scared of ghosts.

689
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,120
It's like you're trying to mess with me,
when I'm trying to move on here.

690
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,920
At the end...

691
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,330
I still cannot do it.

692
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,380
But when I got into meds faculty,

693
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,960
I met Hill, Fah, and Arthit.

694
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,510
I decided not to see you again.

695
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,860
Just live my life.

696
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,690
Never care about anyone.

697
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,900
Acted like a player. Never approached anyone first.

698
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,480
I thought I could move on from you.

699
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,270
It's Trigonometry.
You asked me this during the class too. Memorize it.

700
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,890
Jo. Have you heard of  the new?

701
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,650
He got a scholarship to study in the US.

702
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,860
Hey Jo. Where are you going?

703
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,640
I know that you wanna move on from him.

704
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,020
But today is his last orientation.

705
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,850
Don't you wanna go see him a little?

706
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:48,340
To at least congratulate him.

707
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,730
After today, you might not get to see him ever again.

708
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,510
We should break up.

709
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,200
Good luck.

710
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,680
James.

711
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,120
He just got dumped.

712
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,470
What happened?

713
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,410
What should I do? I don't wanna see him cry.

714
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,730
Go comfort him.

715
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,460
He doesn't even know me.

716
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:46,180
Then buy something for him.

717
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,320
You can make him smile...maybe.

718
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,560
Do you have any other dolls?

719
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,130
No, I sold it all. This is the only one left.

720
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,160
- I'll take this one then.
- THB250.

721
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:23,290
I don't have any cash. Do you take credit card?

722
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,050
I don't know how it use that.

723
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,150
I will transfer to pay you then.

724
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,640
I take cash only.

725
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:40,070
I will pay with this then.

726
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,550
Oh. It's too much.

727
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,720
No, you can't do this. It's too expensive.

728
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,680
Also...do you have any pen and paper?

729
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,050
Yes.

730
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,080
Here.

731
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,700
Err...your watch is too expensive son.

732
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:19,430
Nong.

733
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,640
Can you give this to that guy?

734
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,670
Someone wants to give you this.

735
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,450
Smile please :)

736
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,420
Why do you look so silly, huh?

737
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,570
Hey North.

738
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,370
What did Jah talk to you about?

739
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,080
Oh...

740
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,180
- I just got dumped.
- Huh!?

741
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,940
- How!?
- Like broke up?

742
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,720
- Hey.
- Are you okay?

743
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,810
Forget it.

744
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:51,600
Are you sure you're okay?

745
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,510
You just got dumped.

746
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,850
Her look.

747
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:57,080
It's cute, isn't it?

748
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,540
Looking so silly.

749
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,050
- Someone gave you this?
- Yeah.

750
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:02,390
It's so damn cute.

751
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:03,400
Shit.

752
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:04,880
But it actually looks like you.

753
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,200
Suits you.

754
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,590
- You said I look liks this duck?
- No. No.

755
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:11,350
- Look at him.
- But it's cute.

756
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,510
Cute. Cute.

757
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:13,980
- Let's go.
- See you.

758
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,400
Yeah.

759
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,670
I am smiling. Thank you.

760
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,380
Where have you gone?

761
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:17,700
Where are you now?

762
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,900
At a bar.

763
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,230
Alone?

764
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,330
Um.

765
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,830
Where are you? I'll see you there.

766
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:53,750
What's going on?

767
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,620
Why are you so drunk like this?

768
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,510
I don't know, Hill.

769
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,300
I don't understand either.

770
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,950
Why?

771
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,460
- Why?
- Hey Jo.

772
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:19,810
Calm down.

773
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,620
I don't like the way I feel like this.

774
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,780
I don't like myself for being like this.

775
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,050
Hill.

776
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,820
Do you ever have someone you want to be in your life,

777
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:35,900
but you just can't?

778
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,830
You can give him everything,

779
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,500
literally anything...

780
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,540
just to see him smile.

781
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,260
But why...

782
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,760
why can't I have him by my side?

783
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,630
Dude...

784
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,620
What if I say I have someone like that...

785
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,460
are you gonna believe me?

786
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,690
Easter?

787
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,540
East means like where the sunrise.

788
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,320
That's nice.

789
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,780
North also means like in the north.

790
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,610
Yeah.

791
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,290
And he's going to America soon?

792
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,520
Too bad.

793
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,100
the fact that he's not seeing anyone anymore.

794
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,900
Um.

795
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,070
What about you?

796
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,310
He probably hates you now.

797
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,470
I think so.

798
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,370
Not surprising if that happens.

799
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,190
I even hate myself.

800
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:20,120
God is not on our sides, Hill.

801
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,180
What are you gonna do now?

802
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,330
What can I do?

803
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:25,890
But actually...

804
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,440
you've been waiting for him for so long too.

805
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,140
How did you do it?

806
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,920
It's nothing, Jo.

807
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,890
I just can't move on from him.

808
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,650
I'm stuck there.

809
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:46,060
Not that different from you.

810
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,200
Hill.

811
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,910
When tomorrow comes,

812
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,260
can you forget everything that happens today?

813
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,630
Like everything.

814
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,260
Including what I told you too.

815
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,030
Why?

816
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,980
I just don't wanna think about it anymore.

817
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,640
Wow.

818
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,490
Why are they this drunk?

819
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:51,760
I actually asked Hill to look after Jo.

820
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,120
- And why did he end up like this?
- I don't know.

821
00:52:56,370 --> 00:52:57,840
I will go pay the bill.

822
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,970
Let's take them home.

823
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,580
Yeah.

824
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,050
Let's go. That's enough.

825
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:06,820
Hill.

826
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,570
Since that day, I cannot remember anything about Ter.

827
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,360
But Hill can remember everything.

828
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,960
At the end...

829
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,270
I couldn't move on from you.

830
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,940
And then you got into a fight...

831
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,090
because of the new boyfriend of your ex.

832
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,570
I'm sorry.

833
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:35,360
And thank you...

834
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,080
If I knew you're gonna end up crying like this...

835
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,300
I wouldn't tell you the whole story.

836
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,290
How can you not?

837
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,740
This is big.

838
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,850
Bigger than my story is you crying right now.

839
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,040
Why are you so good to me and love me this much?

840
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,210
It's been too long.

841
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,580
You must be in so much pain.

842
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,220
Not as bad as seeing you cry now.

843
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,060
Forget it.

844
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,300
Stop crying.

845
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,050
Ok. I will.

846
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,610
That's good...

847
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,080
that I didn't go to America.

848
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,520
If I went to America,

849
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,140
I don't know how everything's gonna turn out.

850
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,580
I'm just gonna go to the US more often.
That's all.

851
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:43,900
Thank you so so much.

852
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:46,570
Thank you for waiting for so long.

853
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,380
Thank you for never moving on from me.

854
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:53,230
I love you, P'

855
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:55,970
I love you so much,

856
00:54:58,270 --> 00:55:00,150
I love you too, North.

857
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,150
North.

858
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,430
You don't have to call my name anymore.

859
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,880
If not by your name then what?

860
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:22,930
Babe?

861
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:23,910
Hey!

862
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,900
- Babe~
- No.

863
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:34,150
But I actually don't know what to do either...

864
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:37,250
I always take from you.

865
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,560
That's not true.

866
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,860
You make me want to change myself.

867
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,960
You are my inspiration.

868
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,710
and you are also my happiness.

869
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,650
Even you said so...

870
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:51,860
You don't have to do anything.

871
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,260
Just being here by my side...

872
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,310
forever like this, can you?

873
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,650
I promise...

874
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:04,180
...that I won't go anywhere.

875
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,050
I promise you everything.

876
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,740
Stop crying.

877
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,710
My mom invites you to visits my home.

878
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,130
Shall we go to my place too?

879
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,180
I have a present for you.

880
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,190
Give this to someone you love.

881
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,520
This is for you, Ter.

882
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,320
Both shooting stars and the moon.

883
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,140
Just only you by my side, no matter what’s gonna happen in the future.

884
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,900
Surprise!
