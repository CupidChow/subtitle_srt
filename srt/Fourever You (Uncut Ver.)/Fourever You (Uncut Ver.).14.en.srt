1
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,740
Why did you walk in the rain?

2
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,980
If you catch a cold,

3
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,700
you’ll be in a lot of trouble.

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,420
Can I ask you something?

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,130
How’s it going with you and Johan?

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,460
You came here even with the rain?

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,740
What did you just say?

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,240
You're alone, aren't you?

9
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,150
I’m not a kid anymore, Suer.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,790
When you said you like me,

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,020
why is that?

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,710
Hey.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,480
Wait.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,450
You’re New!?

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,430
You woke up so early.

16
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,770
You're up?

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,580
What are you looking at?

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,750
Nothing.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,430
Hi.

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,440
Why are you looking at me?

21
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,180
I'm so happy.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,960
Happy?

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,760
To have you here.

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,630
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,330
Can I see that?

26
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,440
Tutoring? That one out there?

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,930
Even my parents force me to do tutoring, I just ignore it.

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,410
Thinking about it already gives me goosebump.

29
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,340
You like coconut cake?

30
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,690
No, I saw it as a recommendation.

31
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,710
What's wrong with people recognizing you?

32
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,010
Do you wanna have cocoa drink?

33
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,490
Fine.

34
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,050
You remembered now?

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,940
Hey.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,460
Wait.

37
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,300
You're New!?

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,040
Why didn't you tell me your real name back then?

39
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,560
I don't know how to tell.

40
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,940
I'm so glad.

41
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,530
I thought you wouldn't remember me.

42
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,190
Who's gonna remember?

43
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,270
I couldn't even see your face.

44
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,830
Then you were just gone.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,100
And moved to Singapore.

46
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,780
I lived there for around 1 year.

47
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,160
Before moving back to Thailand.

48
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,920
When you moved and didn't keep in touch with me,

49
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,370
I thought that you probably forgot me already.

50
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,730
I will never foregt you.

51
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,010
I always missed you.

52
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,340
I always wanted...

53
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,210
to come back here as soon as I can.

54
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,060
So...

55
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,850
you moved back and transferred to the same school with me?

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,900
Yes.

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,800
That's why you said you have had a crush on my before.

58
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,140
So before is this?

59
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,340
Here we go.

60
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,060
Then...

61
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,900
What?

62
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,580
Yes?

63
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,560
Why are you moving closer to me?

64
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,340
What are you doing?

65
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,590
It's a morning kiss.

66
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,050
Now, I have all the strength to work.

67
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,220
Stop it.

68
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,590
Hey.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,610
If you don't stop making cute face,

70
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,070
I'm gonna kiss you again.

71
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,540
I know. I know.

72
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,440
Scoot over there.

73
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,900
Are you hungry?

74
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,070
Not yet.

75
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,430
Are you?

76
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,250
Not yet.

77
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
Is something wrong?

78
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,780
Nothing.

79
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,240
I'm just so happy.

80
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,550
It's like I'm dreaming...

81
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,290
that we get to be boyfriends like this.

82
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,780
Me too.

83
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,950
It's like a dream.

84
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,570
Maybe...

85
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,110
we're both dreaming.

86
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,550
Yeah.

87
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,770
Then...

88
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,720
I would never want to wake up.

89
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,090
- Really.
- Um.

90
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,330
Me too.

91
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,980
- Ter.
- Yes?

92
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,810
Wanna travel when the semester is done?

93
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,600
Travelling?

94
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,710
Really!? Where?

95
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,130
Where do you wanna go?

96
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,650
I can take you anywhere.

97
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,140
Really!?

98
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,930
You're so generouse. Whose boyfriend is this?

99
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,510
Yours.

100
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,220
Where should we go?

101
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,840
Let me think about it.

102
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,760
I will let you know once I know where I wanna go.
I wanan go to so many places.

103
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,700
Oh tonight I'll be tutoring with my friends at Johan's cafe.

104
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,180
Do you wanna com with me?

105
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,460
Can I ask North to come too?

106
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,820
Sure.

107
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,240
Are they normally this stressed?

108
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,970
Um why?

109
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,070
You're worried about P'Jo?

110
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,680
Yeah.

111
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,130
A shipper like me, is probably losing my job huh?

112
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,100
Cause he's been so busy lately.

113
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
And he has to also go to Boston too.

114
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,660
Huh? P'Jo? Going to Boston?

115
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,640
Yeah for work.

116
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,590
Is my friend gonna be okay?

117
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,770
Oh.

118
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,310
I have something for you to see. Almost forgot.

119
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,270
Have you been on Instagram today?

120
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,630
Not yet.

121
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,470
You need to see it with your own eyes.

122
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,870
Makes me blush thinking aboout it.

123
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,000
What are you talking about?
Let me see.

124
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,550
What's the hurry?

125
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,450
Cute right?

126
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,060
Johan's little puppy.

127
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,480
Cute.

128
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,680
Look. Your picture is the only picture on his IG.

129
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,440
Right.

130
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,440
So cute.

131
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,160
Oh.

132
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,850
- When the semester is done, I'll travel with P'Hill.
- Hey!

133
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,150
Really!?

134
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,670
Can I go?

135
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,770
Don't forget.

136
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,440
I'm one of your boyfriend.

137
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,350
Ugh!

138
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,530
You wanna go but have you asked your owner?

139
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,220
Hmm?

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,190
Little puppy.

141
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,080
I'll bite you.

142
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,270
Now you're accepting that you're a puppy?

143
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,490
Cute.

144
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,230
I'll take a break.

145
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,560
Good.

146
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,130
Hey. I'll be back.

147
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,040
Where are you going?

148
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,410
I'll go downstairs for a bit.

149
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,350
Ok.

150
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,100
Are you stressed?

151
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,560
Um.

152
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:45,980
Here.

153
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,500
It's already late, so i mae you a not so strong one.

154
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,860
I think you might need it.

155
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,100
Thanks.

156
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,180
P'Johan.

157
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,320
If you think you're carrying everything on your shoulder alone,

158
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,450
I...

159
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,430
will always be here...by your side.

160
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,620
When I go to Boston,

161
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,660
are you gonna miss me?

162
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,950
Of course. I will.

163
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,270
Let's go inside. It's chilly out here.

165
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,280
You might get sick standing here in the wind.

166
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,960
You seem fine.

167
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,390
I'm fine. I don't get sick easily.

168
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,990
Cause I'm strong.

169
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,820
But you just sneezed.

170
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,320
Lots of dust.

171
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,980
Don't let me see you get sick.

172
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,390
Go inside.

173
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,370
Hey hey.

174
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,850
North.

175
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,380
What's the matter?

176
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,590
You look a little pale.

177
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,700
Just a bit dizzy.

178
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,570
Hey.

179
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,550
Why are you still drinking cold drink then?

180
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,130
You might get a fever.

181
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Hey North.

182
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,670
You're on fire.

183
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,960
Dude.

184
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,540
I think you should tell P'Johan to take you back.

185
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,260
You're having a fever.

186
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,900
No. He's studying with his friends,
I don't wanna bug him.

187
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,260
North!

188
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,410
- I'll tell him myself then.
- Hey Ter. No.

189
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,840
- Ter!
- What!?

190
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,260
Hey North.

191
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,300
I'm cold.

192
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,280
What are you doing?

193
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,690
I'm cold.

194
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,970
P'Johan. Hug me.

195
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,660
You're so--

196
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,250
P'Jo.

197
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,180
Is your arm tired?

198
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,900
No.

199
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,940
You're cold, aren't you?

200
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,610
Are you feeling better?

201
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,470
A bit.

202
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,590
You said you're not gonna get sick, huh?

203
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,160
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,940
How shou;d I punich a stubborn kid?

205
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,230
Hmm?

206
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,720
That's it?

207
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,980
I don't know.

208
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,680
I don't know how.

209
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,760
You...

210
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,630
start first then.

211
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,660
Start what?

212
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,090
Kissing.

213
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,450
Ask me nicely.

214
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,780
P'.

215
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,950
Can you please kiss me?

216
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,270
I have an exam, so I had to leave early.
P'Prang will come see you.
Don't go anywhere. i'll be back.

217
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,290
Johan told me to look after a patient.

218
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,030
Here. I bought you some food too.
Let's eat, so you can take your meds.

219
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,160
Thank you.

220
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,550
Here.

221
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you~

222
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,340
You're still having a fever.

223
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,270
Better now.

224
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,990
Okay.

225
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,250
Eat up then. After this you can take some rest.

226
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,070
Oh Jo also wants me to give you the key card.

227
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,420
Normally, he's very protective of his place.

228
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
You're extraordinary.

229
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,190
Are you guys like together now?

230
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,530
Not yet.

231
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,370
Why?

232
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,600
You don't like him?

233
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,130
I do.

234
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,230
Hey if you like him
why aren't you guys officially together then?

235
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,400
The timing is not right yet.

236
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,100
He seems so busy lately.

237
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,290
Both school and also work.

238
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,430
You understand him too well.

239
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,110
Have you ever told him that you like him?

240
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,900
Never.

241
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,010
Err...

242
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,510
P'Prang.

243
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,420
Can you tell me more about P'Jo?

244
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,730
You probably know a lot already.

245
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,460
Ohh!

246
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,520
He's the only son of his father.

247
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,170
So he's kinda a hope of the family.

248
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,540
His mother told me that Jo used to be such a naughty kid..

249
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,490
..until he got into university.

250
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,850
Now, he's better.

251
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:17,860
Really?

252
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,130
Um.

253
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,270
And also...

254
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,170
normally Jo doesn't live here.

255
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,730
He has another house with his grandparents.

256
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,620
A provinc nearby here.

257
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,270
He lived there during high school.

258
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,060
Oh wait wait.

259
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,930
Ahh.

260
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,200
North are you done? Come down here.

261
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,940
I'm done. I'm done.

262
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,500
Come on.

263
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,970
I'm leaving.

264
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,380
- Bye bye.
- And you're not gonna eat first?

265
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,010
It's fine. I'll just eat from uncle's.

266
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,980
Soy milk and some deep friend dough.

267
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,170
It's free.

268
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,290
- Again?
- I'm gonna go now.

269
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,690
Kiss first.

270
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,460
Gotta go. Bye bye.

271
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,610
Bye bye.

272
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,290
Wow.

273
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,030
How rich they must be in order to have a house this big.

274
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,990
Really?

275
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,450
You drove pass everyday?

276
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,130
Yes, it's on the way back to my home.

277
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,780
Ahh...that means Jo must have seen you before then.

278
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,930
If not, he wouldn't be this obsessed wih you.

279
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,730
But I'm not familiar with him at all.

280
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,830
Hey.

281
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,160
You might bumped into each other somewhere else.

282
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,360
Hey. I have to go back to work.

283
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,930
You will be okay alone right?

284
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,950
- Sure. I'm fine.
- Okay.

285
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,950
Get lots of sleep.

286
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,840
- Yes.
- Gotta go.

287
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,820
Thank you.

288
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,870
She didn't tell me it's hot.

289
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,780
Hello?

290
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,420
Are you going?

291
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,660
To where?

292
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:52,860
We have the Gear ceremony today.

293
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,740
Can I not join?

294
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,150
I'm still stick.

295
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,690
And I'm at P'Jo's too.

296
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,670
I didn't tell him in advance that I will go out.

297
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,070
I don't want him to be mad.

298
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,910
I'm also sick.

299
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,870
Tell him you'll go get something for him to take with while he's gone.

300
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,290
He's going to Boston soon.

301
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,800
Give him your gear. That's it. He won't be mad.

302
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,480
Are you coming or not?

303
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,810
Fine. I'll go.

304
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,530
Okay. See you.

305
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,090
Oh North.

306
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:56,960
Oh P'James.

307
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,680
You said you're gonna study in America.

308
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,090
You're lying.

309
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,820
I was gonna go P'.

310
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,650
But I'm worried abut my mom.

311
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,320
I don't wanna leave her behind.

312
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:10,440
I didn't know that you're my faculty freshman.

313
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,750
We need to catch up.

314
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,470
What's your ID?

315
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,280
212.

316
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,560
North.

317
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,000
224.

318
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,800
North!

319
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,150
Be serious.

320
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,030
- 249.
- Yeah.

321
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,710
Go there. Behind all your friends.

322
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,540
Hey! My name is gone.

323
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,820
Flip it!

324
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,510
- Go!
- I'm going.

325
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,170
Yeah.

326
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,180
This row stand up please.

327
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,690
P'.

328
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,110
I actually have some errand to do.

329
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,370
Can I please take the gear and leave first?

330
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,830
No, you have to wait until all your friends finish too.

331
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,450
Why are you in a hurry?
You wanna go see P'Jo?

332
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
I actually sneaked out.

333
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,270
- He's gonna be upset then?
- No doubt.

334
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,310
He just really care about you I guess.

335
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,850
P'. Can't I just take it and leave first?

336
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,070
No, you have to wait for everyone.

337
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,450
Next, this row please stand up.

338
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,760
Ok. You all received your gears, right?

339
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,900
Okay? All good?

340
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,620
Here.

341
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,630
Just give him your gear, he won't be mad.

342
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,320
Or you're gonna ask him to be your boyfriend with the gear?

343
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,600
Why are you talking about that?

344
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,120
You came this far.

345
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,290
Or you're waiting for him to ask you instead?

346
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,080
I've never told him that I like him.

347
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,060
What!?

348
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,030
Huh?

349
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,420
Nothing.

350
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,420
Trust me. There's no better chance than this.

351
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,180
Trust me.

352
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,350
You should stop talking.

353
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:23,660
Like I said earlier about the rules,

354
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:25,720
You need to follow the rules.

355
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,400
Any questions?

356
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,630
Anyone with the ID starts with 249?

357
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,150
Is it you? 249? She's looking for you.

358
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,310
Anyone with 249 ID, please raise your hand.

359
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,920
What's going on?

360
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,290
The one with 249 ID, please go.
Someone is here to pick you up.

361
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,050
This is the chance.

362
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,590
Go!

363
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,960
How come you're here?

364
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,050
Why do you think I do all these?

365
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,530
I went back home and didn't see you there.
Do you how worried I am?

366
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,710
Can you don't leave
or be out of my sight like this ever again?

367
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,180
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,150
Today we have a Gear ceremony.

369
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,690
I didn't mean to worry you.

370
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,640
Can you please don't be mad at me?

371
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,510
Are you're not sick anymore?

372
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,500
You're still warm.

373
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,800
Since you're done, go get some rest.

374
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:42,850
Well...

375
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,430
can you come with me first?

376
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,890
What's the matter?

377
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,000
You probably know the meaning of this already?

378
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,840
I'm sorry for not listening to you so often.

379
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,910
But you're still with me.

380
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,280
I've actually...

381
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,550
never had anyone taking care of me

382
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,820
or do things like what you've done to me.

383
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,040
So that's why I think...

384
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,020
my life is already good in a way

385
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,120
but since the day I have you in my life

386
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,790
everything has suddenly been better.

387
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,520
P'Johan...

388
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,560
I like you.

389
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,560
How can I possibly leave you?

390
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,650
We'll take the exam in a few minutes.

391
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,870
Why are you reading it now?

392
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,980
- Do you think it's enough?
- I'll do whatever I can do.

393
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,770
Don't stop it.

394
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,620
If he could eat the worksheet, he probably would.

395
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,540
If you're this desperate,

396
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,270
I think you should just pray.

397
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,370
Yeah.

398
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,850
I was kidding, but he's really doing it.

399
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,310
Long prayers too.

400
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,140
Amen.

401
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,740
Yeah...

402
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,570
Can you memorize everything?

403
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:22,980
No.

404
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,180
I was shocked since the first question.

405
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,170
- Yeah.
- What did you answer?

406
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,900
I couldn't even remember.

407
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,870
You want a full score or something?

408
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,340
You too.

409
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,410
So?

410
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,980
No full score. I couldn't do it.

411
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,140
What? Then why sitting there for so long?

412
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,030
Oh tomorrow we have Physic exam.

413
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,650
- Do you wanna study together?
- Sure.

414
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,480
Sure. Let's find a place.

415
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,990
- Sure.
- Go. Find a play to study.

416
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,290
Wow! Smiling to the screen like this,

417
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,660
you're so madly in love.

418
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,160
You're falling for him.

419
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,710
Let us see.

420
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,180
We'll go study after. Are you joining us?

421
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,020
Probably not.

422
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,840
- Sorry gotta go.
- Hey.

423
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,610
- What?
- Hey Kyu, give me the bag.

424
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,770
- Gotta go. See you.
- Yeah.

425
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,790
Bye bye.

426
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,510
Just like that.

427
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,180
- Why is he in a hurry?
- We waited for him.

428
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,710
- He wants to leave. He just leaaves?
- Someone is in love.

429
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,650
And why did we wait for him then?

430
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,780
- No, why did we wait for him?
- I'm going crazy, we waited for him.

431
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:10,850
You're nuts.

432
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,100
Go go. Let's finda a place to study.

433
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,690
How was your exam?

434
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,220
It was okay.

435
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,740
You?

436
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,150
A student like me?

437
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,980
Probably didn't make it.

438
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,410
How can I pass the test?

439
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,290
And when you said that you're tutor me, are you for real?

440
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,610
Um.

441
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,460
- Really?
- Yeah.

442
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah but we will do it at my place,
I have to buy some food for the boys first.

443
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,370
- Shall we?ss
- Sure.

444
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,880
Have you ever tried this place?

445
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,510
Not yet, but I think it's good.

446
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,040
You need to try.

447
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,260
They're here.

448
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,730
You're here.

449
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,040
- What did you order?
- Salmon.

450
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,710
This is mine.

451
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,630
Here.

452
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,010
P'Jo. The change from the store.

453
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,120
You keep ti.

454
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,040
Wow. You always keep a thousand bill huh?

455
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,060
There'll be too many.

456
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,700
You also have too many thousand bills anyway?

457
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,080
I don't want to go to the ATM so many times.
Some store still only take cash too.

458
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,960
Why don't they make ten thousand bil?

459
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,790
You're so annoying Jo.

460
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,980
Shit.

461
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,090
PJo. Did you bring my gear?

462
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,350
I bought you the bracelet.

463
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,640
Jo? Wearing gear?

464
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,560
Why? What's wrong with me?

465
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,700
Nothing. That's good.

466
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,770
Before this happened,

467
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,590
how many times do you have to scold him?

468
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,660
Right?

469
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,400
But from now on, you don't have to do that.

470
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,550
Cause I'm committed now.

471
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,320
- Cannot believe it.
- My potato suddenly becomes so sweet.

472
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,960
Oh P'Jo. I have something to tell you.

473
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,760
He likes to snuggle.

474
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,380
Snuggle what?

475
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
Cause you always sleep walking and snug on my bed.

476
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,940
And he always like snug and hug me.

477
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,550
And what do you do?

478
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,240
- I have to hug him, if not he'll keep moving.
- Ter.

479
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,530
It's true,

480
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,950
- For real?
- Yeah.

481
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,140
Jo.

482
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,830
I don't think this is right.

483
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,560
Um.

484
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
Wait until I come back from Boston.

485
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,030
What do you mean?

486
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,670
Here the fork. Take another one.

487
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,460
You like this one.

488
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,050
Um.

489
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,870
He's jealous.

490
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,130
I give this one for you.

491
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:51,690
You like vegetables?

492
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,960
North. I'm sorry.

493
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,188
I washed it. Bathed your stupid duck.

494
00:38:15,188 --> 00:38:16,850
Don't forget to put some powder on.

495
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,580
Sure 5555

496
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,470
Okay.

497
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,200
If everything is done, please send me the details.

498
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,890
Sure.

499
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,370
Why are you smiling?

500
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:36,750
Ter sent me something funny.

501
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,970
Shall we study?

502
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,150
Sure.

503
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,800
You try to solve this question first.

504
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,660
It can be on the exam.

505
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,150
Sure.

506
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,280
This one?

507
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,140
Um.

508
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,950
Are you tired?

509
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,290
Aren't you gonna be more tired
when you go to Boston?

510
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,050
Um.

511
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,940
But after Boston, there's probably nothing much.

512
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,940
Tomorrow I have an exam.

513
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,260
I can't send you off at the airport.

514
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,460
It's okay.

515
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,000
Just get ready for the exam.

516
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,100
Hmm?

517
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,260
Look at you.

518
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,410
What's wrong?

519
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,020
Why are you making that face?

520
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,630
I wanna be at the airport.

521
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,410
Yes, P'Prang?

522
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,380
I'm on my way.

523
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,160
Yes.

524
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,850
Gotta go.

525
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,300
Don't you have an exam?

526
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,200
Yes.

527
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,510
But I still have some time.

528
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,380
I think it would be bad...

529
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,880
if I can't say good bye to you.

530
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,470
Never thought, going to Boston would be this difficult.

531
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,080
Don't drunk just the coffee.

532
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,730
Eat some food 3 meals a day too.

533
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,730
I will miss you a lot.

534
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,190
Come back as soon as I can.

535
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,370
Should I stay?

536
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,390
You can't!

537
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:45,210
Have a safe trip.

538
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:46,740
I will go take my exam now.

539
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,560
Good luck with the exam.

540
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,350
Hm?

541
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,400
Sure.

542
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,420
Go.

543
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,730
North.

544
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,970
North.

545
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,680
What!? You scared me.

546
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,650
You're gone after the exam. I've been looking for you.

547
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,650
You're wearing a gear?

548
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,640
Yeah. It's Nao's.

549
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,860
Hey. Really? You guys swap each other's?

550
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,050
- No.
- Oh.

551
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,180
I...

552
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,410
did it behind his back.

553
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,880
How can you do that?

554
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,020
And why were you looking for me?

555
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,470
Yeah.

556
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,860
You led me off the topic.

557
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,120
So what do you need?

558
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,120
I need your help with something.

559
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,050
About what?

560
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,800
About Nao.

561
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,760
Guys. After this, there'll be my friend joining us too.

562
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:16,340
Do not leave yet.
Thank you for sending me stars.

563
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,040
Do not leave please.

564
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:20,650
See.

565
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,660
He's broadcasting his game, right?

566
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,390
But then there're so many people sending him stars to flirt.

567
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:26,710
Can you stop him?

568
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,180
Are you crazy? We can't stop them.

569
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,570
He always wanted to do broadcasting.

570
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,760
I know....at first....

571
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,600
it looks fun and everything.

572
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,890
But lately...it's not okay.

573
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,000
- You're jealous.
- Yeah I am.

574
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,080
- You don't understand me.
- What do you want me to do?

575
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,470
North.

576
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,480
- HuH?
- Come here.

577
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,800
Come on.

578
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,340
- Handle this.
- Come on.

579
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:54,750
I'm about to lose.

580
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,270
Nao. What are you doing there?

581
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,260
I can't get out. I'm surrounded by them.

582
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,450
Just get whatever guns.

583
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,690
I went there. It doesn't have.

584
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,980
North....

585
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,610
I told you to help me.

586
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,190
Ended up playing with him.

587
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,100
North.

588
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,970
Read the comments. I'm playing. Can't read properly.

589
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,960
I miss you P'Suer.

590
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,810
P'Suer is not joining?

591
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:33,970
Ger played with you before?

592
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,540
Yeah used to.

593
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,650
Suer. People wanna see you.

594
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,190
Do you wanna join us?

595
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,350
No.

596
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:52,708
Is P'Suer seeing anyone?
I'm willing to do anything for him. I love you, P'Suer.

597
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:54,760
He's single now.

598
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,700
I want my friend to date someone too.

599
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:58,200
You can try.

600
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,670
You can try.

601
00:45:03,272 --> 00:45:06,990
Why are you online so early? You just finished your class.

602
00:45:07,897 --> 00:45:10,260
Thank you 1,000 stars from P'Guitar.

603
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,630
Thank you 1,000 starts from...

604
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,020
What's the name? I can't read.

605
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,110
Why the hell you need to read it out loud?

606
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,540
Thank you P'Gun.

607
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:39,440
You know that person?

608
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,230
Of course. Send me stars so often.

609
00:45:42,758 --> 00:45:44,390
Been following me since day 1.

610
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,920
I asked for the name.

611
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,490
But he told me to call him...

612
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,740
P'Gun.

613
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,249
He called me P'! So cute~

614
00:45:57,131 --> 00:45:59,862
It's you!?
And why the name Gun?

615
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,980
It came from my first name, Gunnatee.

616
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:16,533
Today's class is so tiring.
But you heel me a lot. All the tireness is gone.

617
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,820
What's wrong with him?

618
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,940
Why do you need to mind other's people business?

619
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,820
Nao.

620
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,310
Look.

621
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,790
Hey thank you all of you,
but please don't fight.

622
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,370
Love each other.

623
00:46:42,994 --> 00:46:44,930
What are you doing?

624
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:48,550
Stop him.

625
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,750
Hello P'?

626
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:15,230
Are you busy?

627
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:21,142
Does North normally play games? Come play with Duennao.

628
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,820
So cute. 2 guys playing games.

629
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:25,750
I normally play with Nao too.

630
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,192
These stars are for you, North. You're so cute. Can I flirt with you?

631
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:41,280
Thank you for the starts, but you can't flirt with me.

632
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,400
I'm gone not long ago, now you're naughty?

633
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:55,650
- Nao. I'll be back in a bit.
- Yeah yeah.

634
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,680
So...now you're not in the mood?

635
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,450
It was you, right?

636
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,790
I asked you to help me.

637
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,565
You ended up playing with him.

638
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,060
What are you doing?

639
00:48:13,954 --> 00:48:18,144
Just playing games with my friend.
I also earn some money too.

640
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,927
You want money?

641
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,036
Send me your video clip. I will pay you THB100 a second.

642
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,780
Come on. I'm gonna go work soon.

643
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,340
Ger.

644
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,070
And what do I have to do in te video clip?

645
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,370
Why do I have to do this?

646
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,250
He wants to see your face. That's why.

647
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,780
He's always working. Rarely have the time.

648
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,460
He can see this video whenever he's free.

649
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,740
- What should I say?
- Anything. Just talk.

650
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:59,980
THB100 per second. 1 minute, you'll earn THB6,000.

651
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,710
Write me a script, will you?

652
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,670
- Just say whatever. He will like all of it.
- Are we starting?

653
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,820
I'm recording.

654
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,860
Err...

655
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,220
P'Johan.

656
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,120
Err...enjoy your work there.

657
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:15,640
I will always be here to support you.

658
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,340
Take care of yourself cause it's cold overthere.

659
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,610
Don't forget to eat some food too.

660
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:25,910
Don't drink just the coffee.

661
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,330
And also...

662
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:36,890
I...

663
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,950
...miss you.

664
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,520
I'm waiting for you to come back.

665
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,820
What’s the matter? Why are you looking so stressed?

666
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,500
It’s won’t be long. Only 2 weeks. He'll be back soon.

667
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,770
P’Hill. Have you been talking to P’Jo lately?

668
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,310
You can call him.

669
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,120
If he’s busy, he just won’t answer.

670
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,350
Gear event is for you to come with your couple.

671
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,910
But his probably won’t be back in time.

672
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,320
Ughh. I don’t even have one.

673
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,640
You guys are not boyfriends yet?

674
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,910
Or he hasn’t asked you?
