1
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,736
The team that works on campus filming
needs a photographer.

2
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:22,730
Do you think you can do it for us?

3
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,315
You?re finally my photographer.

4
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,645
Can I please have your LINE ID?

5
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:29,392
Cat burglar.

6
00:00:29,425 --> 00:00:32,268
Is this the guy you were talking about?

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,118
I will just go get to know him a little.

8
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,527
Hey Arthit!

9
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:39,080
I have something I wanna talk to you.

10
00:00:39,117 --> 00:00:42,297
I think we've tried enough to run away from the past.

11
00:00:42,328 --> 00:00:43,576
I just want to start things over.

12
00:00:43,604 --> 00:00:45,305
Since when that you like me?

13
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,576
Probably before you even know me.

14
00:00:47,605 --> 00:00:48,930
How is that possible?

15
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:51,334
Cause I have had a crush on you for so long.

16
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,840
Not as long as I do.

17
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,720
How much do you want?

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,660
What?

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,790
Is a hundred grand enough?

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,770
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,300
You're probably the one who's dating Hill.

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:27,930
No, I'm not.

23
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,930
- You're misunderstanding.
- Liar!

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,450
Stop seeing my grandson.

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,660
- I think--
- Just tell me how much do you want and get out of my grandson's life.

26
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,470
I don't want any.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,930
Are you alright?

28
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,840
Why?

29
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,840
You're upsetting with me or something?

30
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
Would you like me to be honest with you?

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,490
Stupid kid!

32
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,490
You're being fooled by him,
you know that?

33
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,840
Hill!

34
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,340
Where are you going!?

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,820
Hill!

36
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,160
What was that just now?

37
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,860
It's nothing.

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,060
It's just a little misunderstanding.

39
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,530
Was that your grandfather?

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,680
Yes.

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,890
I'm not trying to fool you.

42
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,530
I know.

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,620
It's fine.

44
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,080
I will try to make him understand.

45
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,580
Are you sure everything will be fine?

46
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,790
Don't worry.

47
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,230
Ok.

48
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,980
What is this?

49
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,710
My grandpa wants to give you this.

50
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,080
He understands now, Ter.

51
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,770
He's apologizing for that day with this.

52
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,560
That's a relief.

53
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,340
It was really a misunderstanding.

54
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,340
Don't worry about it, okay?

55
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,690
Okay.

56
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,690
Thank you.

57
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,660
If what you mean by that is 'I like you'...

58
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,660
Then yes.

59
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,280
Since when?

60
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,100
Probably before you even know me.

61
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,340
Back then...

62
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,940
He liked Christ, wasn't he?

63
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,740
Is something wrong?

64
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,380
I'm fine.

65
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,380
Are you sure?

66
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,050
Well...

67
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,620
I have someone I love and really care about.

68
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,300
But I haven't talked to her for a year.

69
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,050
I don't know what to do.

70
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,380
Why don't you just talk?

71
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,430
We had a bit of a issue back then.

72
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,650
I thought turning back to each other
was the best way out.

73
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,620
So we wouldn't hurt each other any more.

74
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,580
Has it been successful?

75
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,060
Not at all.

76
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,390
I believe...

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,390
that time will heal something.

78
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,610
But...

79
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,610
it does not.

80
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,770
I cannot move on from the past

81
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,860
and start over.

82
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,050
I think the way for you to overcome this,

83
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,860
is to let go of the past.

84
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,150
Especially when it's the past that hurt you.

85
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,520
No matter how long it has been,

86
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,520
it can't be healed.

87
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,020
I think it's the kind of wound,

88
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,570
that you have to heal by yourself.

89
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,250
Um.

90
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,560
Um.

91
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,700
So are you really gonna sit there
and see me draw?

92
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,410
I'm just waiting for North to be back.

93
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,950
After he's done,
we will go find something to eat.

94
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,110
Do you wanna join us?

95
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,990
No.

96
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,990
I want to finish this drawing.

97
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,620
Are you sure? It's yummy.

98
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,870
I've never seen you eaten anything.
You always draw and draw.

99
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,930
You mean he likes you
even before you know him?

100
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,130
It's impossible, isn't it?

101
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,130
I still remember the day
he transferred to my school.

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,760
Or...

103
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,950
you guys probably met before that?

104
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,330
Really?

105
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,620
Love at first sight?

106
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,180
I don't think so.

107
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,830
Another thing is that
when he first transferred,

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,830
we've never even talked.

109
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,040
Are you saying that...

110
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,040
he's lying to you?

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,710
I don't think he's lying.

112
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,980
He might have something hidden.

113
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,100
Did he say anything else?

114
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,600
He actually wanted to tell me everything.

115
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,600
But it's me,

116
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,400
that didn't want to hear the whole truth.

117
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,740
So you're here
thinking it all in your head?

118
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,480
Fine fine.

119
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:48,130
Next time,
I will ask him everything I wanna know.

120
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,740
Including...

121
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,080
when he ghosted me.

122
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,310
You're lucky.

123
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,310
He came back to answer your questions.

124
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,540
Mine is long gone after we broke up.

125
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,900
Huh!?

126
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,900
You were in a relationship before!?

127
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,900
- Yeah.
- For real?

128
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,640
How come I didn't know?

129
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,660
She's from other university.

130
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,170
That's why I never told you.
But we already broke up.

131
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,490
It's okay.

132
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,090
Are you alright?

133
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,090
I have to be, even if I don't.

134
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,810
It's fine dude.

135
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,360
Go on.

136
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,360
Eat up.

137
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,110
Oh hey hey.

138
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,920
Why are you sad instead of me?
Just eat.

139
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,700
- I cannot stop thinking.
- You have to be on set soon.

140
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,130
- They are filming today, right?
- Yes.

141
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,860
Anyway,
you're gonna drop me off there, right?

142
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,480
You're such a burden.

143
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,730
Please. You cannot have me walking there.

144
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,000
I can't do it. The faculty is so far.
Please take me.

145
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,000
Fine.

146
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,330
- You're the best!
- What a burden.

147
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,640
Come on. Let's get started.

148
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,440
Go ahead and pose.

149
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,300
I want like twist yourself a little. Turn to each other.
Right.

150
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,970
Oh nong Ter.

151
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,610
- Hello. P'Mei Li.
- Hello~

152
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,780
We only need to take a few scenes today.
When you're done, you can leave whenever you'd like.

153
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,700
Sure.

154
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,190
Oh or...

155
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,820
you have to wait for someone
to take you home?

156
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,020
P'Mei Li!
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,270
Someone is blushing.

158
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,850
Hill. Someone here is blushing.

159
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,840
Stop it, P'Mei Li.

160
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
Oh he's coming.

161
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,530
Yes?

162
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,750
Have you eaten?

163
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,820
Yes, I did.

164
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,490
I already ate with my friend.

165
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,680
Do you wanna have something more?

166
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,410
I will take you.

167
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,730
It's fine.

168
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,470
Ok, fine.

169
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I will leave him to you now.

170
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,990
Sure thing.
I will look after Easter as much as I can.

171
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,640
Oh and Mild won't be here today.
Has she called you?

172
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,480
She did.

173
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,000
It's okay. We just have pick up some of the scenes.
She doesn't have to be here.

174
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,410
Okay.

175
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,290
See you.

176
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,290
Sure.

177
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,710
What are you looking at?

178
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,690
No. Nothing.

179
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,270
That's a high pitch voice for nothing.

180
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:58,340
I don't know. Not sure.
Maybe someone would like to tell me something.

181
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,370
I just wanna know stuff.

182
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,630
What kind of stuff you would like to know?

183
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,620
Just tell me already.
The guy that Hill posted with is you, right!?

184
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,500
Right!?

185
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,350
Yes.

186
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,350
Yess!

187
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,170
Do not tell anyone please.

188
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,190
Oh why?

189
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,330
You don't want other people to know?

190
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,570
I don't.

191
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,420
So...

192
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,780
you are not ready or...

193
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,260
...something?

194
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,610
I'm not ready at all.

195
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
Umm...

196
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,040
But I finally know now that it's you.

197
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,740
Do you have any idea that
the whole campus are talking about this?

198
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,550
My mouth was so itchy from gossiping,
do you have idea?

199
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:58,010
- Itchy?
-I asked everyone from my faculty. I asked all of them.

200
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,480
Come on guys. Gather here please.

201
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,710
Before we take a break,
can I get a group photo?

202
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,520
Chop chop.

203
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,940
Good.

204
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,510
Junior!

205
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,980
We haven't taken anything.
Don't have to look at the camera.

206
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,990
Why are you smiling like that, Hill?

207
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,810
Look at the camera. Not your boyfriend.

208
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,040
All: Boyfriend?

209
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,180
Cause the photographer is cute.
I can't take my eyes off of him.

210
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,230
1 day 1,000 situations.
Everyone please be silent.

211
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,150
Right.

212
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,200
When people are in love,
you can't hide it from the world.

213
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,430
Oh.

214
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,660
Hill just looked at you,
now your hand is as cold as a corpse.

215
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,760
Is this the guy that you're trying to date?

216
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,360
Yeah.

217
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,800
He's a real deal.

218
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm blushing for him.

219
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,050
Hill is all in.

220
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,460
What now, Junior?
Are you up for a fight?

221
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,900
You guys are ridiculous.

222
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,460
This is nothing.
I can totally beat him.

223
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,830
Nong Ter.
I also cannot take my eyes off of you.

224
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,800
This one is okay,
but I think it's a little too bright.

225
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,430
Or we can adjust it?

226
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,930
I will adjust it on my laptop.

227
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,150
Okay. The overall looks ok already.

228
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,460
So this one is the owner of the watch?

229
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,960
I can't say no now, can I?

230
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,220
No, you cannot.

231
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,350
Let's just be honest, my friend.

232
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,560
It depends.

233
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,560
Whether he's okay with it or not?

234
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,110
And are you guys officially together?

235
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,110
Not yet. I'm trying.

236
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,490
Even Dr.Hill still has to try?

237
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,060
Oh and why did previously,

238
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,540
you wouldn't tell us,
but you just suddenly told us today?

239
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,580
So unpredictable.

240
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,770
I just wanna let some cat burglar know.

241
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,000
That Ter is mine only.

242
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,930
So what now?

243
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,980
He's very public about it.

244
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,540
I don't know.

245
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm so confused.

246
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,680
You don't have to rush.

247
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,000
I think he can wait.

248
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,330
Really?

249
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,330
He said

250
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,500
he can wait?
But he's out there letting the whole world know already.

251
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,600
Why did he do that?

252
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,600
Yeah right.

253
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,250
How jealous he must be.
That's why he announced his ownership like that.

254
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,920
P'Mei Li!

255
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,780
Please I'm begging you.

256
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,630
You're so adorable.

257
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,990
I'll stop giving you a hard time for a moment.

258
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,490
Yes, that's good.

259
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,360
Ok times up.

260
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,360
I will continue harassing you.

261
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,940
But I really am rooting for you.

262
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,690
Just think about it. Take your time.

263
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,870
You're Easter?

264
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,510
Yes.

265
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,470
Do you wanna go celebrate?

266
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,560
Celebrate?

267
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,540
Hey, celebrate you and Hill.

268
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,020
It's not just him,

269
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,020
we don't even know whether Hill is going?

270
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,880
He has to.

271
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,220
We have to celebrate such a good news.

272
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,630
You just wanna drink. Let' be honest.

273
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,430
We're also in.

274
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,010
If someone pays.

275
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,400
Right.

276
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,140
Let's go.

277
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,980
Good opportunity like this doesn't come often.

278
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,560
And anyways,
when you're drunk, the whole vibes will lead you there.

279
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,700
So Hill doesn't need to waste his time
to go out with you.

280
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,680
Hey.

281
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,680
That was a bit too much, wasn't it?

282
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,210
Too much what?

283
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,210
I was just teasing him.

284
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,860
And Ter doesn't mind.

285
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,240
Right?

286
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,470
Hey!

287
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,210
You don't have to be so serious.
It's not fun.

288
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,720
But it's true, isn't it?

289
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,020
You're playing hard to get,
when you're actually trembling with joy.

290
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,010
P'Hill!

291
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,530
What the hell is wrong with you?

292
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,360
I have to ask you that instead.

293
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,360
P'Hill.

294
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,130
Hill!

295
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,130
- Motherf*cker.
- Hey.

296
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,400
Calm down.

297
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,950
- Take Ton away.
- Why are you guys locking me?

298
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,660
I'm not wrong here.
He just barged in and punched me.

299
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,830
You're the wrong one, Ton.

300
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,550
Why are you on their side, Junior?

301
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,530
You're not the upper hand,
so now you're bowing to them?

302
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,640
This shit head.
I might just punch you too.

303
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,780
- Come at me!
- Ton, enough.

304
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,970
Let's go.

305
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,970
Go.

306
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,500
P'Hill.

307
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,900
You're bleeding.

308
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,610
Ton.

309
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,610
Apologize to Ter now.

310
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,250
What did I do?

311
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,250
Hill punched me first.

312
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,140
Hill was also wrong about being physical.

313
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,180
But you were also wrong.

314
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,030
Be careful with things that you say.

315
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,910
You're so bad.
Apologize now.

316
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:55,240
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,220
Hill.

318
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,220
I cannot hide this from the professor.

319
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,220
They might call you in to talk.

320
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,470
since you're also the union's president.

321
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,310
Yes.

322
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,110
Both of you,

323
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,140
don't let anything like this happen again.

324
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
Do you understand?

325
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,580
Would you excuse me?

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,460
So Hill doesn't need to waste his time
to go out with you.

327
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,140
Wasting his time?

328
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,360
(Christmas)

329
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,390
Christ!

330
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,450
P'

331
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,220
What's wrong, Christ?

332
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,850
Why are you crying?

333
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,530
I thought that...

334
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,880
you would never answered my call again.

335
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,380
I should have called you first.

336
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,410
P'.

337
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,250
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,890
I'm sorry.

339
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,820
I'm sorry too.

340
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,200
You're not mad at me anymore?

341
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,190
I've never been mad at you actually.

342
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,360
Really?

343
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,320
Yes, really.

344
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,800
What about you?
Are you done being mad at me?

345
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,410
I did long time ago.

346
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,150
Really? That's nice.

347
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,740
Thank you.

348
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,860
And how are you Christ?

349
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,730
Are you doing alright?

350
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,180
Well...

351
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,320
I'm fine.

352
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,240
But it's been really tough with my school stuff.

353
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,050
I have made my decision to become a nurse.

354
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,440
That's great.

355
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,440
You finally made a decision.

356
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,010
What about you?

357
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,860
Has the semester started?

358
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,170
Um.

359
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,660
Almost.

360
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,280
I've been busy myself too
with all the university stuff.

361
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,730
So many activities.

362
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,450
Oh Christ.
I'm also the photographer of the university production too.

363
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,090
That's nice.

364
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,220
Nobody takes pictures as good as my brother.

365
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,170
Woah. Nice saying.

366
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,900
And how are you doing up there?

367
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,900
Is it cold yet?

368
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,640
No, not yet.

369
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,590
How are things at home?

370
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,240
It's really hot over here.

371
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,160
Let's...

372
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,180
go to the beach together,
when you're back in town.

373
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,550
Sure.

374
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:26,930
And also...

375
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,610
I heard that...

376
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,960
P'Hill is also in meds school there.

377
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,070
Um yes.

378
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,960
And...

379
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,600
...have you guys met?

380
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,280
We did.

381
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,250
I'm sorry.

382
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,250
I shouldn't mention him.

383
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,400
Hey it's fine, Christ.

384
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,190
I'm fine.

385
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,060
But..what about you?

386
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,590
Are you okay?

387
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,980
It's my fault.

388
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,980
Christ.

389
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,980
Really.

390
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,380
If it wasn't because of me,

391
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,080
you two were probably,

392
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,360
Huh?

393
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,430
You mean...

394
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,610
Me and Hill?

395
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,130
Yes.

396
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,250
Not you and Hill?

397
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,820
Huh?

398
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,220
Don't tell me...

399
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,620
that you have no idea?

400
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,570
Know about what?

401
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,420
About P'Hill, that he...

402
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,550
For this question, you will...

403
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,110
have to plug this equation here.

404
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,140
Then you take all of these,
minus from the this part.

405
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,620
- and all these, plug in another equation.
- P'Hill.

406
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,520
Yes?

407
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,520
P'Hill...

408
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,040
are you dating someone?

409
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,020
Why do you ask?

410
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,800
Well...

411
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,420
So...

412
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,230
- I kinda--
- I'm not.

413
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,120
-But...
-Yeah?

414
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,920
I already have a crush on someone.

415
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,280
Oh.

416
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,100
Really?

417
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,300
So you've always known?

418
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,050
Yes.

419
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,440
Everyone can tell.

420
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,210
It's just you that have no idea.

421
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,380
Know what?

422
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,600
P'Hill always take good care of you.

423
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,060
But P'Hill has always been nice like this to everyone.

424
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,630
But with you, it's more special.

425
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,800
And you're okay with that?

426
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,800
With all these?

427
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
I am.

428
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,770
I already moved on from him long time ago.

429
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,290
Are you sure?

430
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,160
I am.

431
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,480
The two persons that I love are happy.

432
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Then I am happy for you.

433
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,640
Now, It's up to you two.

434
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,340
Christ.

435
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,500
You guys are ugh.

436
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,650
Anyways,
are you coming home any time soon?

437
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,210
I will.

438
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,660
I miss home so much.

439
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,100
But I still don't know when.

440
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,160
Dad's not mad at you anymore too.

441
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,330
Really? For real?

442
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,820
Um.

443
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,820
But he keep his lip tight.

444
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,080
I guess that's how old people are.

445
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm so happy.

446
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,230
Okay okay.

447
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,780
I will visit you guys when the semester is over.

448
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,480
Yayy~ That's great.

449
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,480
I'm looking forward to it.

450
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,820
Why are you smiling with yourself?

451
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,890
Hey...so you cleared things up with your sister?

452
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,810
Um.

453
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,810
You and Hill are officially together?

454
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,440
Why not?

455
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,790
You can tell me everything.

456
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,860
Ughh North.
What am I gonna do? I'm stressed.

457
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,190
There's something happened on set today.

458
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,170
Someone said that
P'Hill shouldn't waste his time going out with me.

459
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,120
F*cker.
What a foul mouth.

460
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,880
Then P'Hill barged in and punched him.

461
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,880
Good.
That shithead deserves that.

462
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,780
But that guy punched him back too.

463
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,580
How is he feeling then?

464
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:26,430
Right. I'm also confused.
What should I do?

465
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:30,100
When I heard that,
I was mad so I just ran away.

466
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,100
I just left him there.

467
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,530
It's okay.

468
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,200
I think you have a lot going on lately.

469
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,070
It's okay dude.

470
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,310
Is he gonna be okay?

471
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,480
Is he gonna be alright?
How hurt is he?

472
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,100
- I'm afraid that he'll be mad at me too.
-It's okay. Calm down.

473
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,690
Easy for you to say!

474
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,050
Where is that d*ckhead?

475
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,540
He thinks he's cool huh?
He deserves more than just a punch.

476
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,780
Forget it.

477
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,780
I don't want to make a big deal.

478
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,970
You never thought of telling your friends
when you were in trouble?

479
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:22,980
I'd never found out,
if P'Mei Li didn't call.
You never thought of telling your friends
when you were in trouble?

480
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,510
I'd never found out,
if P'Mei Li didn't call.

481
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,060
I don't want to make a big deal as I said.

482
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,460
Please don't tell Arthit and Fah.

483
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,590
Fine fine fine.

484
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,200
Dr.Hill.

485
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:36,200
Professor is looking for you.

486
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,220
Are you gonna get punished?

487
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,360
Probably not.
Might be just a warning....I guess?

488
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,690
P'Mei Li said so.
It might be just a warning.

489
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,690
Don't worry.

490
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,430
I'm not worried about that.

491
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,430
Oh then what are you worrying about?

492
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,650
I'm worried about nong.

493
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:02,770
He didn't answer my call.
Don't know what's happening.

494
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,860
You should take care of your business first.

495
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,400
Jo. Can you go see him for me?

496
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,180
Why me?

497
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,980
Please. Just go check on him.

498
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,410
What if I said no?

499
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,920
You'll see something nice there.

500
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,600
Trust me.

501
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,640
Who are you here to see?

502
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,550
Is Ter here?

503
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,550
He is in the shower.

504
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,590
I will let him know.

505
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,830
Do you wanna come in?

506
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,450
No. Please tell him for me.

507
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,210
Sure.

508
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,350
Are you just gonna wait there?

509
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,990
- Ter.
- What's up?

510
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,680
- Someone is here to see you.
- Who is it?

511
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,020
I don't know.
Hurry and come out to see him.

512
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,080
Fine fine.

513
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,910
Bam. Ow. Ow.

514
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,970
- That's it.
- Who is it?

515
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,440
- Huh?
- Who came to see me?

516
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,440
I don't know. He's outside.

517
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,520
I told him to come in, but he wouldn't

518
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,400
Hey. Hey. I'm stuck.

519
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,600
Hey!

520
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,080
Do you wanna get slapped?

521
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,670
P'Johan. What's the matter?

522
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,060
Someone asked me
to come check on you.

523
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,330
You're alright?

524
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,810
Yes, I'm fine.

525
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,400
Is P'Hill alright?

526
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,300
Just bleeding on the lip.

527
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,370
And the professor called him in.

528
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,540
And where is he now?

529
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,980
Do you wanna go see him?

530
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,820
Let's go.

531
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,820
Wait wait. Give me a moment.

532
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,520
North, I'm going out, okay?

533
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,940
- Where're you going?
- I don't know. Bye.

534
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,770
What?

535
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,040
You can drive slower.

536
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,100
Am I a bad driver?

537
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,630
Is he gonna get punished?

538
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,540
No.

539
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,830
I called me and said it's just a warning.

540
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,950
That d*ckhead was wrong. Not him.

541
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,030
P'Hill.

542
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,880
I'm done here.
I will leave now.

543
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,880
Did you see him?

544
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,120
Yeah I did.

545
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,120
Face to face.

546
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,460
How was it?

547
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,400
Well...

548
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,790
Good. I guess.

549
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:46,200
Talks later. I'm gonna go.

550
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,120
- Wait P'.
- Talks later. Please talk to him.

551
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:12,730
About Ton,

552
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,130
I'm sorry.

553
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,260
You were not the one who said all those things.

554
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,220
I actually have to thank you instead for stopping him.

555
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,030
But you have to feel bad
because of me.

556
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,220
I just wanna be transparent with my commitment.

557
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,390
But when Ton did that...

558
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm not sure anymore that the way I make it public
is the right thing to do.

559
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,240
But anyways...

560
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,690
I already did it.

561
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,300
I will try.

562
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,000
Try?

563
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,370
what?

564
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,410
With what about to happen.

565
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,660
You mean..?

566
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,660
Stuff like P'Ton?

567
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,950
That's part of it.

568
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,580
But something bigger might be coming too.

569
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,780
Don't worry.

570
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,100
It should be me who says that.

571
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,530
I don't want you to be in trouble like this.

572
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,730
Hang in there.

573
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,400
Okay, kiddo?

574
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,790
Don't act like I'm a kid.

575
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,790
I'm not a kid.

576
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,150
Look.

577
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,880
You're pouty like one.

578
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,880
I'm a grown up.

579
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,810
And...

580
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,730
does it hurt?

581
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,570
No.

582
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,060
When I said I like you,

583
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,310
I mean it.

584
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,890
About when you said that you like me,

585
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:59,070
even before you know me.

586
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:07,080
That means there are some other things
you haven't told me, right?

587
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,840
I will tell you everything,
when you become my boyfriend.

588
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,210
Okay?

589
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,210
You're forcing me.

590
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,690
Not exactly.

591
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,210
But if you really want to know,

592
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,810
you can say yes now.

593
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,810
What are you talking about?

594
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,760
Stop smiling.

595
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,140
Oh P'Hill.

596
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,140
How's your grandfather by the way?

597
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,780
He's good.

598
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,890
That's good.

599
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:54,740
And when you told me that he was misunderstanding,

600
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,100
it was not true, right?

601
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,060
Why are you asking that?

602
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,380
Come to think of it,

603
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,130
you might just told me that
to make it less stressful.

604
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,060
didn't you?

605
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,360
P'Hill.

606
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,070
P'Hill.

607
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,380
What do you mean?

608
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,380
You guys are not dating?

609
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,700
No.

610
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,280
Are you telling me that...

611
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,010
you guys are like brothers?

612
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,010
Something like that.

613
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,250
But what I've heard,

614
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,830
is not that.

615
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,330
We're not together. Really.

616
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,040
Then why do you have to care him so much?

617
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,820
I love him.

618
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,310
How dare you...

619
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,430
to say such things!?

620
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,860
I'm telling you the truth.

621
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,630
Damn it!

622
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,430
All the kids in this house are gone mad.

623
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:10,600
Dad.

624
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,600
Calm down.

625
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,040
You guys are all the same.

626
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,040
Useless.

627
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,420
Don't worry, son.

628
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,980
He's always like this.

629
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,850
But this time, he went over line.

630
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,770
He just have high expectation
to the only grandson he has.

631
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,810
Just like when he did to you, right?

632
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,500
I guess so.

633
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,070
What should I do?

634
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,190
I believe that....

635
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,860
at the end...

636
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,090
you'll choose the best thing for yourself.

637
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,930
Right?

638
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,100
Yes.

639
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,690
May I come in?

640
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,970
Yes grandma.

641
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,970
Thay boy...

642
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,990
you love him that much?

643
00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:09,390
You knew!?

644
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,170
Your grandpa was loud.
I heard everything.

645
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,040
But don't worry.

646
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,600
I will talk to him.

647
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,990
Thank you.

648
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,990
This is nice.

649
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,180
My grandson is capable...

650
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,420
...to love someone.

651
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,510
I thought that
my grandson doesn't know how.

652
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,510
Grandma!

653
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,160
Bring him over to see me sometime.

654
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:43,250
Sure grandma.

655
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,000
Your grandpa...

656
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,590
has always been tough.

657
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,560
He was worse back in the days.

658
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,890
I don't know how come I married a guy like this.

659
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,960
Grandma...

660
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,110
Let's buy some snacks for that boy, shall we?

661
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,920
To apologize to him.

662
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,430
Your grandpa caused a scene with him, didn't he?

663
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,200
Yes, he did.

664
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,760
Let's just tell him
the snacks are from grandpa.

665
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:23,550
I think your grandpa
must feel guilty more or less

666
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:25,860
about what he did based on his anger like that.

667
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:30,170
You're so understanding.

668
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,230
we've been together for 40 years.
That's why.

669
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,100
Under his kindness,

670
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,770
there's suspicious lie below.

671
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,990
Really?

672
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,590
But he's never be mean to me though.

673
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,930
So that's why I feel I'm special to him.

674
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,980
He's mean to the rest of the world,

675
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:00,990
but only nice to the only one person.

676
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,080
But I have an instinct,

677
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,920
that you might be like grandpa.

678
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,900
Grandma...no.

679
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,510
I don't want to.

680
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,190
Thank you.

681
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,560
I love you.

682
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,530
I love you too, grandma.

683
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,480
I knew it!

684
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,480
It was actually your grandma.

685
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,440
My grandpa is difficult to understand.

686
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,100
I'm sorry.

687
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,100
Fine.

688
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,470
And how are you feeling?

689
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,470
It's fine.

690
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,470
You can't say that you're fine.

691
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,150
Why?

692
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,150
I don't care.

693
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,250
You cannot say that you're fine.

694
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,470
This is an order.

695
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,170
From now on it's a forbidden word for you.

696
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,770
Understand?

697
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,600
What are you talking about, Ter?

698
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,600
I'm talking about everything.

699
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,610
I meant for everything, about you, me, and us.

700
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,820
P'Hill.

701
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,830
Well...

702
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,140
you take such good care of me.

703
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,730
Always be nice to me.

704
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,990
But I've never known anything.

705
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,320
It's fine really.

706
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,470
I said you can't say that.

707
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,870
Okay.

708
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,770
From now on,

709
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,180
when I say 'it's fine',

710
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,600
the meaning will be, 'we're both fine'.

711
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,510
Okay?

712
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,590
Okay.

713
00:49:03,977 --> 00:49:06,502
I think P'Hill take care of you very well.

714
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,601
Why you don't date him yet?

715
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:10,968
He didn't ask me yet.

716
00:49:11,004 --> 00:49:13,534
I think he's waiting for you.

717
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:16,980
Thank you so much for taking them here.

718
00:49:17,094 --> 00:49:18,217
My pleasure.

719
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:20,829
Do you know P'Johan?

720
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:26,557
Hello Easter! North is in trouble at the club!
