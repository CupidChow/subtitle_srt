1
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:20,330
P'Hill has contacted you?

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,511
I heard that there was am emergency at his family.
No one had been able to contact him.

3
00:00:28,912 --> 00:00:29,774
Hill.

4
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:31,654
Cover your boyfriend's eyes.

5
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:36,736
I'm going to Boston.

6
00:00:37,213 --> 00:00:39,491
Are you going to Boston?

7
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:42,903
I'm so tired.

8
00:00:43,322 --> 00:00:44,847
Are you feeling better yet?

9
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:46,595
Not yet.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,310
Hello, P’Hill?

11
00:01:07,405 --> 00:01:08,840
Is Jo there?

12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,160
Yeah, but he’s still sleeping.

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,640
Do you want me to wake him up?

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,896
Wake him.

15
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,680
Sure. I will wake him for you.

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,750
P’Jo.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,120
P’Jo.

18
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,540
P’Hill wants to talk to you.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,910
He doesn’t wake up.

20
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:39,020
Can you put me on speaker? I will talk to him myself.

21
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,390
Sure.

22
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,510
You’re on speaker now.

23
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:45,034
Jo.

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,140
What?

25
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:51,659
You’re so attached to North.

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,245
What do you want?

27
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:54,924
Come to class.

28
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,090
No.

29
00:01:57,465 --> 00:02:03,680
Are you gonna cuddle with him all day? Come to the class.
I won’t keep the work sheet for you this time.

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,540
Fine. I will be there. Hang up now.

31
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,230
P’Jo.

32
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,420
You said you’re gonna go to class.

33
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,200
I just wanna sleep a little bit more.

34
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,900
Wait. We're late. Come on.

35
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,550
I’ll wait inside. See you.

36
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,200
What?

37
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,200
is it okay that you skip the cheer room like this?

38
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,180
It’s fine. I wanna be here for the tryout.

39
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,080
Black tee faster! Faster!

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,100
Be steady. Come on.

41
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,480
- Oh North.
- Hello P’Arthit.

42
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,950
Hi. Hi.

43
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,240
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,210
- You’re here for the tryout?
- No actually.

45
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,890
- I’m here with my friends.
- Oh ok.

46
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,550
I’m just gonna go.

47
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,980
I’ll follow you later.

48
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,530
P’Arthit.

49
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,390
- Meds students also do tryouts today?
-Um.

50
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,807
I’m waiting for the first year. Don’t know when are they gonna come.

51
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,200
- North.
- Yes?

52
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,820
Can I take a picture with you?

53
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,630
One pic.

54
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:47,680
Yes.

55
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,130
- Can I post it?
- Sure.

56
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,140
Can I have your IG?
I will tag you.

57
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,450
Why did you take a picture with me though?

58
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,800
Come on.

59
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,420
I just wanna tease someone.

60
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,810
Okay.

61
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,260
North. Come here.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,610
Would you excuse me?

63
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,990
Go go.

64
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,930
Hello~ What's up?

65
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,010
Delete the picture.

66
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,530
So now you're quick.

67
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,360
Thit.

68
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,930
I won't. Why do I have to delete it?

69
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,930
Are you messing with me?
Where are you?

70
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,080
At the football field. Are you coming?

71
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,470
I can't.

72
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,380
But you need to delete the picture.

73
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,820
If you want me to delete, transfer me money.

74
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,280
You're that poor to begging me for money?

75
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,540
No, I just want your money. That's all.

76
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,330
Just transfer me.

77
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,080
How much?

78
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,600
Err around....

79
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,300
2,000 then.

80
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,280
No no actually. 20,000.

81
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,470
No no.

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,370
I think that's too little.

83
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,500
Can I have 200,000?
More suitable for Mr.Johan.

84
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,380
What the f*ck?
Stop messing with me.

85
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,230
What are you guys doing?

86
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,750
I'm not asking about you.

87
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,262
Don't think for yourself.

88
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,970
Well....

89
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,870
he's with his friends.

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,880
Watching people trying out.

91
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,140
Send me a picture.

92
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,720
And not your picture. Don't you dare.

93
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,010
Sure~

94
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,660
So how much are you gonna pay me?

95
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,360
How much for each picture?

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,420
How much do you want? Just tell me.

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,520
Let's do this. 2,000 per picture.

98
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,340
I will send you the full album.

99
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,180
Okay? Do we have a deal?

100
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,300
Fine. Just take some good pictures.

101
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,440
Okay. Deal.

102
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,010
Stretch. Stretch.

103
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,080
Football?
but they are stretching their arms?

104
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,170
Oh Nao.

105
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,650
- What?
- Your brother is in Boston, right?

106
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,790
Nuea? Yes, he is.
Why?

107
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,930
Well...

108
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,310
P'Johan is going to work there.

109
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,340
What's the time difference between here and Boston?

110
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,780
Umm...11 hours.

111
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,980
Like our daytime would be their night time.

112
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,810
Really? You don't miss your brother at all?

113
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,920
I do.

114
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,170
I wanna visit him. Saving up for that now.

115
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,270
But I've never been abroad before.

116
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,490
Am I gonna make it?

117
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,040
Ask Ger to go with you.

118
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,400
I did.

119
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,710
He said no. He's busy.

120
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,960
- A person like Ger says no?
- Yeah.

121
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,640
Try asking him again.

122
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,400
He might thought that you asked for the sake of politeness.

123
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,510
I will try and ask him again.

124
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,080
- Let's go to the field.
- So hard-working.

125
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,200
Look at how they run.
Are they alright?

126
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,440
They're gonna fall.

127
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,860
Hello, P'Prang?

128
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,140
Hello, North where are you?

129
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm at the football field.

130
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,060
Why?

131
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,030
So...

132
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,420
Jo asked me to pick you up.

133
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,450
Pick me up?

134
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,110
To where?

135
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,770
To see him.

136
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,640
I gotta go. I'm almost there.

137
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,910
Where are you going?

138
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,230
Well...

139
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,590
To see the doctor.

140
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,420
Huh? Are you sick?

141
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,530
Are you okay?
Are you having a fever?

142
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,760
- Or stomachache?
- What are you doing?

143
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,760
Or back pain? What's wrong?

144
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,100
You're not having a fever.

145
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,150
I don't know. That's why i'm going to see a doctor.
See you.

146
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,050
Why don't you tell me?

147
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,820
Hey.

148
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,770
- North.
- Hello P'Prang.

149
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,950
Hello

150
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,930
You drove all the way here?

151
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,460
I had some errands nearby anyway.

152
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,120
And Jo called me. Asked me to come pick you up.

153
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,220
He's probably at the tryout.

154
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,890
- Yes.
- Oh.

155
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,740
You know that he will be going to Boston, right?

156
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,990
P'Jo already told me that.

157
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,910
This trip is a big customer.

158
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,650
Wow.

159
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,050
He's such a hard working person.

160
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,830
Umm..previously was not this much.

161
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,910
But his father said he's gonna let him take over the company
after he graduates.

162
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,220
I actually think it's too early for him.

163
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,670
But Jo insists to do it.

164
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,590
Give him the company?

165
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,880
Yes.

166
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,120
Jo was not an easily frustrated person like this.

167
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,880
He's more cheerful than this.

168
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,950
But lately,

169
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,280
he's stressed and rarely hangout with anyone.

170
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,860
I don't know how someone this age can handle all these.

171
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,770
But...

172
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,190
Jo is really good.

173
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,600
He's studying and working at the same time.

174
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,300
I told you all these..

175
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,520
cause I actually wanna tell you...

176
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,350
that it's good that it's you.

177
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,940
Jo told me...

178
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,940
I don't know...but...

179
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,270
he's better when he's with you.

180
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,280
Really?

181
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,110
Let's go. I will drop you off.

182
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,330
Sure.

183
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,400
Ugh...it's raining like this.

184
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,960
I don't have an umbrella too.

185
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,920
Umm.

186
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,780
It's okay. I will just run over there.
It won't take long.

187
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,270
Are you sure?

188
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,570
Do you want my jacket?

189
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,050
No, it's fine.

190
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,190
Thank you for picking me up, P'Prang.

191
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,770
I'm gonna go then.

192
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,090
Thank you.

193
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,720
P'Hill. Hi.

194
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,880
Oh you're here to see Jo?

195
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,690
Hi P'Tonfah.

196
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,080
You were out in the rain?
You're soaking wet.

197
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,660
Jo looks tired.

198
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,320
Probably didn't get enough sleep.

199
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,760
You can wake him up.

200
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,230
It's fine.

201
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,900
Okay.

202
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,820
Hey Fah.

203
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,160
Oh you're here.

204
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,300
Yeah it's raining outside.

205
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,580
Now, I can't even do my tryout.

206
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,730
Oh I see you again.

207
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,410
You should have come with me.

208
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,050
No, I would be all wet if I came with you.

209
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,750
Wake him up.

210
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,900
No, why do you want him to wake up.

211
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,440
I'm gonna ask him for my money.

212
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,140
He owes me 15,000.

213
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,340
He owes you money?

214
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,220
Jo owes you?

215
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,420
Yeah.

216
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,590
For the pictures.

217
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,770
What pictures?

218
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,460
I can't.

219
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,680
It's a secret.

220
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,580
Why? Tell me.

221
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,270
Just wake him up.

222
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,570
Hey. Wake Jo up.

223
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,430
It's time for the tryout.

224
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,960
P'Jo.

225
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,150
P'Johan.

226
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,530
It's raining?

227
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,480
Yeah. It's raining outside.

228
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,300
Who let you walk in the rain?

229
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,970
What if you catch a cold?

230
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,530
You can die!

231
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm not gonna get a cold easily.

232
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,550
Yeah we will see.

233
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,090
Wear this.

234
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,170
Thank you

235
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,140
Hey.

236
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,140
Hey Jo.

237
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,980
My money?

238
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,240
What for?

239
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,460
Hey. For the pictures.

240
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,220
You took like you used your feet to take.
Still dare to ask for my money?

241
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,150
Hey.

242
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,040
You asked me to take those pics.

243
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,920
Fine. You're so annoying.

244
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,220
That's it.

245
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,840
You transfer me in the first place and it's done.

246
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,200
Happy?

247
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,600
Are we done?

248
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,100
Go. Hill is asking for you.

249
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,780
I'm so lazy.

250
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,060
You go do it for me, Arthit.

251
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,800
Wait. Can't you see my condition?

252
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,900
It won't be long.

253
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,010
Fine.

254
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,310
Bye.

255
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,860
Wait. Where's Jo?

256
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,170
It's fine. You do it for him then.

257
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,070
Let's go.

258
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,620
We're ready.

259
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,220
Thank you.

260
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,900
Oh you're going to Boston after the midterm right?

261
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,410
Um.

262
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,970
I heard that Arthit is also going to America.

263
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,950
But just a few days for holiday.

264
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,390
- Going to America?
- Um.

265
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,790
Miami.

266
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,790
Not surprising.

267
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,360
Come here.

268
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,890
Jo. There're lots of people here.

269
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,110
I don't mind.

270
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,540
So...are you taking him to Boston too?

271
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,810
No.

272
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,100
Or you wanna go?

273
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,160
I have class.

274
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,470
But if I really wanna go, you can take me?

275
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,900
Um.

276
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,780
Wherever you want, I will take you there.

277
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,920
Hey. You should go down now.

278
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,360
Hill is calling you.

279
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,330
This is your club.

280
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,270
Go.

281
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:10,860
This is already worn.

282
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,440
Yeah.

283
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,070
I did help with the tryout instead of you.

284
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,220
Come on Jo.

285
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,120
Do I really have to wear this after you wore it?

286
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,580
What's up?

287
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,750
Jerk! Where are you?

288
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,610
I'm at the basketball court.
Why're you calling me a jerk?

289
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,420
My bike key is with you.
How am I supposed to go back? I'm all wet.

290
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,110
Why do you have to be hot headed when the weather is so cooling? Ask Ger to come get you.

291
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,760
It's not cooling. What if my scooter got stolen?

292
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,170
You can come get it later. Just park there.

293
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,820
You're at the basketball court right?
I'll see you there.

294
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,440
Hey.

295
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,370
- North.
- Yes?

296
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,330
Can I ask you something?

297
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,750
How's it going with Johan?

298
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,090
How's it going?

299
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,500
He seems stressed lately.

300
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,040
But when he's around others,

301
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,390
he doesn't show.

302
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,600
That's why I wanna know how is he when he's with you.

303
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,080
- When he's with me?
- Um.

304
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,820
He looks tired.

305
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,940
Doesn't talk much.

306
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,760
But he talks a lot when he's around you guys.

307
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,090
Then it's probably how he is himself lately then.

308
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
How he is himself?

309
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,610
Like how?

310
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,830
Like a person doesn't have only one side.

311
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,930
When we're really stressed,

312
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,660
sometimes they just don't wanna talk to anyone.
And Jo is probably like that.

313
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,630
But he...

314
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,110
rarely shows that side to anyone.

315
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,280
With other people, he talks normally, right?

316
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,130
But with you, he doesn't talk much, correct?

317
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,670
Then that means...

318
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,790
he's willing to show you that side of him.

319
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,880
Without having to pretend or force himself.

320
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,940
Because with some people, he has to pretend

321
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,620
to show everyone that he's okay.

322
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,490
When in reality deep down...

323
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,800
he might feel really bad inside.

324
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,890
And do you think...

325
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,550
which one is better?

326
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,840
I think...

327
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,640
whatever how he feels or think,

328
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,440
let him be.

329
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,900
If he's stressed, he can say he's stressed.

330
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,640
He doesn't have to pretend at all.

331
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,120
I understand.

332
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,430
When people say Jo is better because of you,

333
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,500
it's true.

334
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,360
- Better?
- Um.

335
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,930
Because of me?

336
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,200
Um...how?

337
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,700
Let me ask you.

338
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,340
Have you ever thought?

339
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,640
With this kinda situation,

340
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,130
it's like he puts stressed on you.

341
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,650
Not really.

342
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,160
He's really stressed.

343
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,950
And there're so many things for him to do.

344
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,670
There.

345
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,770
It's good that it's you.

346
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,300
I'm not thinking too much.

347
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,900
No matter what it is.

348
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,740
You don't have to be pretend to be okay.

349
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,980
You can just show...

350
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,540
how you feel.

351
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,110
If possible,

352
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,700
I want you to

353
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,430
stay by his side like this.

354
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,580
If...

355
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,460
P'Johan is better when he's with me,

356
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,720
then I won't go anywhere.

357
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,610
You make me wet.

358
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,770
Hello, Suer?

359
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,630
Where are you?

360
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,180
Why?

361
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,330
Can you come pick me up?

362
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,310
My key is with North.

363
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,600
I'm at the side of the football field.

364
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,810
Who are you with right now?

365
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,950
I'm alone. Ikkyu and Get left me.

366
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,160
I'm just telling you.
You can come pick me up when the rain stops.

367
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,670
I'm just giving you a heads up that--

368
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,220
Um. You just wait there.

369
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,300
Hey.

370
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,150
What the hell? Hey.

371
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,510
You're still gonna come pick me up right?

372
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,730
You're done?

373
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,230
Not yet. Too many people.
I need do continue some other days.

374
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,580
What are you guys talking about so much?

375
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,710
I saw that.

376
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,650
Why?

377
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,260
Are you jealous?

378
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,550
I will tell you later.

379
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,300
It's all about you.

380
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,650
What about Hill?

381
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,640
He's gone. Probably went and pick Ter up.

382
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,960
I should go too the.

383
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,840
If we wait for the rain to stops, it will be a long time.

384
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,290
Are you also going back?

385
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,400
Sure.

386
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,570
- Riding a bike in the rain is not a problem.
- Bye.

387
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,600
Bye. See you.

388
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,620
What about you?

389
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,240
I can.

390
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,550
The problem is not that.

391
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,320
I should have asked him to take him too.

392
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,470
You take the big bike today?

393
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,830
Umm.

394
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,300
Actually....

395
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,250
I can be out in the rain as well.

396
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,980
- I'm very good at that.
- Stop acting like you're so strong.

397
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,460
- I really can.
- Just be quiet.

398
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,510
Arthit, you've got a raincoat?

399
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,760
If I have one,
I wouldn't be in this condition, would I?

400
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,750
I will just wait until it stops.

401
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,690
I'm gonna go then.

402
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:07,400
See you.

403
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,410
He likes to flex his muscle yeah?

404
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,470
Are you tired?

405
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,620
Doing tryout with the 1st year?

406
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,150
Just in general.
About working and studying at the same time?

407
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,260
Umm..

408
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,290
And you are going to Boston for busines talk?

409
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,720
P'Prang told you?

410
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,380
Yes.

411
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,530
She told me so many things.

412
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,620
And...

413
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,080
will it be a tough for this Boston trip?

414
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,650
It's probably one of the hardest that I've done.

415
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,330
You can do it.

416
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,050
Um.

417
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,100
You drove in the rain?

418
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,770
Why did you do that?
I told you to wait until the rain stops.

419
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,830
You said you're alone, didn't you?

420
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,010
I'm not a kid anymore, Suer.

421
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,510
Now, you're stuck in the rain with me.

422
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,390
How's the tryout?

423
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,860
What do you think? With my skills?

424
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,310
- You're weak.
- F*ck you.

425
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,360
Why are you looking at me like that?

426
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,920
Nothing.

427
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,610
You're awake.

428
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,720
Why didn't you wake me up?

429
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,720
I saw you were exhausted.

430
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,950
Has the rain stopped?

431
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,610
Probably yes.

432
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,970
Shall we go?

433
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,700
Sure.

434
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,900
Go take a shower.

435
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,500
You go first.

436
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,000
You shower first.

437
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,560
Or....

438
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,520
do you wanna do it together?

439
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,170
Er...I will go shower first then.

440
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,860
Hello? What's up?

441
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,940
Where are you?
I came to see you at the basketball court. You're not here.

442
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,970
I'm...

443
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,980
I'm at P'Jo's.

444
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,730
Great.

445
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,260
Why are you doing this to me, North?
I told you I'm gonna be here.

446
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm sorry. I didn't think you would actually come.

447
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,830
What am I gonna do now?

448
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,550
Come get the key here.

449
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,950
Or...

450
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,000
Can you wait? I will bring it to you tomorrow.

451
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,580
My scooter will probably got tolled.

452
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,500
Send me the location. I will go get it.

453
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,120
Yeah.

454
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,050
Wow.

455
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,630
You're so bad.

456
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,020
That's his clothes yeah?

457
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,500
Fine fine. I won't be mad at you.

458
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,080
For the sake of the ship that I'm rooting for.

459
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,880
Rooting your ass!

460
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,570
Where is my key?

461
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,860
You got a lot of people in trouble, you know?

462
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,980
I'm sorry. Here.

463
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:29,840
Fine.

464
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,540
Why..

465
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,160
are you blushing?

466
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,070
Shit what are you doing?

467
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,950
Hey are you having a cold?

468
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,810
Yeah probably.

469
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,810
It's your fault, North.

470
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,140
I didn't mean to.

471
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,130
Fine.

472
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,480
I'll inform the professor for you tomorrow.

473
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:53,960
Go get some rest.

474
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,460
Ger. Take good care of him.

475
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,880
Um.

476
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,470
Oh wait..

477
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,000
you normally you take care of each other really well.

478
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,930
What?

479
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,010
-What?s
-Let's just go.

480
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,780
I wanna shower so badly.

481
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,320
- Take care of each other.
- Go.

482
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,860
- Drive safe.
- Yeah.

483
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
What is up with him?

484
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,180
What are you doing?

485
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,280
Checking some work for P'Prang.

486
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,660
Have you ever been to Boston?

487
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,440
- Yeah, of course.
- Really? What is it like?

488
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,200
Is it beautiful?

489
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,260
I always want to go there.

490
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,180
But to be honest,

491
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,720
I've never really been out of the country.

492
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,920
You wanna go?

493
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,680
I would love to.

494
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,680
But it's gonna be awhile until I can.

495
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,720
I need to save up more.

496
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,020
When the semester is over then.

497
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,160
Semester is over?

498
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,420
Where would you like to go? I will take you.

499
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,920
Really!?

500
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,120
Thank you!

501
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,240
Are you gonna thank me for everything?

502
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,120
Yes.

503
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,420
Everything that others do it for me.

504
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,500
I got this habit from my family.

505
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,080
If someone give me somethings or if I see elders and do not wai them,

506
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,480
my mom is very strict.

507
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,040
I've seen that.

508
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,860
You've seen it?

509
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,150
You mean..

510
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,340
See my mom being strict?

511
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,280
- Come here. Come.

512
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,800
- Come here now. You lie to me now?
- Ugh. Mom.

513
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,180
You're glued to your games. I'm fine.

514
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,360
But you don't go home like this worries people at home.

515
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,480
- Don't be like this.
- Ugh mom.

516
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,780
You embarrass me in front for my friends.

517
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,480
I'm not.

518
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,040
Please be.

519
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm sorry.

520
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,240
I was wrong.

521
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,500
Don't apologize to me now.

522
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,900
You twisted my ears with your hands.

523
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,900
Does your wrist hurst?
I'm worried about that.

524
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:34,240
Shall we go find some yummy food to eat?
So you'll be in a better mood.

525
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,870
Please mom.

526
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,270
Just eat something good.

527
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,340
So you're in a better mood, shall we?

528
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,500
Oh look. You're smiling.

529
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,940
- Let's go eat please.
- Fine.

530
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,380
It'll be so yummy, yeah?
Let's go.

531
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,840
When you said you've seen it...

532
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,530
how?

533
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,550
I have something I wanna ask you too.

534
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,430
When you said you had a crush on me,

535
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,920
why?

536
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,430
Tell me more about that.

537
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,850
Please~

538
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,920
Tell me.

539
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,290
You wanna know that bad?

540
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,740
Yeah I wanna know.

541
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,820
I won't tell you.

542
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:29,960
Hey.

543
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,350
Look at your face.

544
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,380
Hey.

545
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,530
It's almost campus sport day already.

546
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,850
I'm so excited.

547
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,930
For what?

548
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,830
Well...

549
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,920
I don't have to be in class that's why.

550
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,400
Don't have to study. So chill.

551
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,570
When is this gonna start?

552
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,960
Almost.

553
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,590
Foam. Why do you have to fan so much. It's cold.

554
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,180
It's so damn hot.

555
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,670
I'm so sticky right now.

556
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,630
Why are you so frustrated?
Or it's because you're not with girls?

557
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,350
Don't be Mr.Know it all. I'm done here. Bye.

558
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,300
Hey.

559
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,300
Where is he going?

560
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,980
Probably go see his girls. Forget him.

561
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,370
Let's go to the stage, shall we?

562
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,430
Sure.

563
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,820
Now, it is medicine faculty turn.
Here we go.

564
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,790
Too bad I didn't bring the camera.

565
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,930
I wanna take pictures.

566
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,270
Huh?

567
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,050
You wanna take pictures? Besides sky picture?

568
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,870
Taking pictures of the sky at night with some lights from the stage...

569
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,830
probably turn out beautifully.

570
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,570
Do you think it's gonna rain?

571
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,310
Probably. Always rain around this time of year.

572
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,230
But...

573
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,720
it should be fun, if it rains.

574
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,010
Yeah sounds fun.

575
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,350
How is it?

576
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,880
Yeah. I'm having fun.

577
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,390
When you were on the stage just now,

578
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,250
Ter couldn't not take his eyes off you.

579
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,390
Phoon!

580
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,020
Um. I saw.

581
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,850
I didn't.

582
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,620
I'm happy enough with you not looking at the others.

583
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,840
I will go se Foam.

584
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,700
- You stay here.
- Why do you have to go?

585
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,780
You just stay here.

586
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,700
- I'll leave Ter to you then.
- Sure.

587
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,700
Hey.

588
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,100
Your legs are probably tired standing.
Let's find somewhere to sit.

589
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,840
Sure.

590
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,750
You're bringing him out officially huh?

591
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,430
Can't underestimate my friend.

592
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,790
Guys. Look at Hill's boyfriend.

593
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,760
What are you looking at?

594
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,400
Nothing.

595
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,070
i just thought...

596
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,840
that I would do absolutely anything....

597
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,210
to not lose your smile like that.

598
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,200
That's enough, P'Hill.

599
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,700
I won't let you see anymore.

600
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,780
Stop teasing me.

601
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,790
It always rain like this every year?

602
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,190
Yes. It was also like this during my year.

603
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,780
It's part of the sport day already.

604
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,130
Shal we go?

605
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,980
Let's go.

606
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,560
What are you doing, P'Hill?

607
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,620
Let me hug you.

608
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:32,920
P'Hill.

609
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,900
It's tickling.

610
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,360
You're not used to it yet?

611
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,090
- No.
- Not yet?

612
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,510
P'Hill.

613
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,900
Is it good?

614
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,530
It is.

615
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,630
- You give me all of it?
- Yes all.

616
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,870
Good?

617
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,240
- Too sweet.
- Why?

618
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,230
You don't like it?

619
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,190
- Then spit it out. I'll eat it myself.
- I like it.

620
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,170
I was kidding.

621
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,180
Show me your cute face.

622
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,580
Smile.

623
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,230
Pouty.

624
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,770
Duck face.

625
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,550
Duck face.

626
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,460
Go go.

627
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,360
You're such a cheater.

628
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,240
That rain has stopped.

629
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,730
Grey clouds are gone.
We can see the stars clearly.

630
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,030
So beautiful.

631
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,160
Yeah.

632
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,050
Then...

633
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,850
Are you interested to see this view everyday?

634
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,930
You mean you want me to move in with you?

635
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,660
Um.

636
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,570
Are you crazy? No.

637
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,570
Why not?

638
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,600
Please.

639
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,320
I cannot afford this place.

640
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,990
Hey.

641
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,230
I won't let you pay. Okay?

642
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,100
You will let me live here for free?

643
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,080
Sure.

644
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,360
But that's okay.

645
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,880
I feel bad.

646
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,400
It's fine.

647
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,800
People'd want to take good care of their lovers, right?

648
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,840
Right?

649
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,160
I can't. I'm worried about North.

650
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:38,060
He cannot live by himself.

651
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,410
North?

652
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:42,350
I will handle that.

653
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,240
Handle? Handle how?
What are you gonna do to him?

654
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,970
- I'm not okay with that.
- Hey.

655
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,870
If you do anything to him, I'll be so mad.

656
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,170
I won't do anything to North.

657
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,840
You think I'm that mean?

658
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:55,720
Hmm?

659
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,470
Who knows?

660
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,200
I think...

661
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,760
North might move to live somewhere else too.

662
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,410
How do you know?

663
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,320
Just my guess.

664
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,910
North? Moving where?

665
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,060
He never told me.

666
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,620
He doesn't tell me.

667
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,340
P'Hill. What are you doing?

668
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,960
P'Hill.

669
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,580
Stop it. P'Hill, No.

670
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,870
- A few more.
- No

671
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Let me see.

672
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,190
That's cute.

673
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,470
Delete it. Delete it.

674
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,770
Come here. I will show you.

675
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,250
Smile.

676
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,150
Smile.

677
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,640
Let me see.

678
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,750
Let's see.

679
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,600
- Looks good?
- That's cute.

680
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,760
You took it really good.

681
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
Can I post it?

682
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,857
I didn't smile for the camera. I smiled for the photographer.

683
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,800
What are you doing?

684
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,440
Are you being shy?

685
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,780
No, i'm not.

686
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,260
You're not?

687
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,020
- Um.
- Are you sure?

688
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:17,720
No.

689
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,860
Really?

690
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,700
- No.
- Let me see when one is shy.

691
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:22,810
What?

692
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,410
Where?

693
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,110
Cute though.

694
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,680
P'Hill.

695
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,900
- Are you blushing now?
- No, I'm not.

696
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,820
P'Hill.

697
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,350
- You're not blushing?
- No.

698
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,150
Don't do this to me. No.

699
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,290
- Are you sure you're not blushing?
- P'Hill.

700
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,440
Stop it.

701
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,810
Are you sure?

702
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,550
P'Hill. That's enough.

703
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,510
The person who gets the highest score in this round is...

704
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,170
Ratchakit got 60 points. Full score.

705
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:39,720
Everyone please him a round of applause.

706
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,930
Hill you're so damn good.

707
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,080
Only half of the class passes the test,
but you got full score.

708
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:56,330
Ratchakit, please come see me after class.

709
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:58,000
Sure.

710
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:05,950
You did really well.

711
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,120
You're the only one who got full score
out of the whole class.

712
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,350
This time. The test is really difficult.

713
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,560
Well done.

714
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,570
Keep it up.

715
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,020
I will send your score to your grandpa.

716
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,560
You must be under a lot of pressure, right?

717
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,490
Have you ever done anything that makes me proud?

718
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,650
It's not relevant at all dad.

719
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,270
How is it not relevant?

720
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,400
I'm planning a future for my nephew.

721
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,740
So he won't stay out of the line.

722
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,580
But it's his future.

723
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,460
You need to let him choose.

724
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,520
But what?
You're forcing him to get extra tutoring?

725
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,940
Isn't this too much?

726
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,480
If I do as you asked,

727
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:14,840
will you two stop fighting?

728
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:19,650
No no.

729
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,420
It's not like that son.

730
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,760
I just...

731
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,490
don't want you to have a life that I had.

732
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,120
I want you to live normally and have fun like other kids.

733
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:38,780
I'm fine.

734
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:44,290
Hey.

735
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,220
Wait.

736
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,520
Why are you standing there alone in the dark?

737
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:56,560
Waiting for your parents to pick you up?

738
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,710
You can go wait inside.

739
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,000
It's so dark here. Dangerous.

740
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,960
Come on in. D
on't have to be afraid. Let's go.

741
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,140
Let's go wait inside. Come.

742
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:20,540
Let' go sit inside.

743
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,380
There're lots of mosquito outside in the evening.

744
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,680
Let's sit inside and make yourself at home.

745
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,210
Are you hungry?

746
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,770
I have some dessert here at my cafe.

747
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,470
Do you wanna eat something?

748
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,090
Here. Take a look.

749
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,040
Whether you wanna order something.

750
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:48,850
Coconut cake?

751
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,550
Hmm...i'm not sure whether I have some left.
Wait a minute.

752
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,830
Ter.

753
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,280
Ter, can you check whether there's any coconut cake
left in the fridge?

754
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,060
Yes. There's 1 left.

755
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,260
Good. Bring it down please.

756
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:06,780
Ok. There's one left.
Go sit there and I will bring it over.

757
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,980
Make yourself comfortable. Don't have to feel bad.

758
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,090
Here.

759
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,580
Stay and hand out with him first.

760
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,800
He's waiting for his parents to pick him up.

761
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,060
I think he's around your age.

762
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,870
I'll clean up the cafe.

763
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,000
So..hi.

764
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:50,720
Um.

765
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:53,570
What's your name?

766
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,650
I'm Easter or you can just call me Ter.

767
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,290
Are you sick?

768
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,960
Why are you wearing a mask?

769
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,520
You have a sore throat that's why you can't speak, right?

770
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,690
Can you write then?
I will bring you some pens and papers.

771
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,680
Wait a minute.

772
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,350
Here.

773
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,240
Where do you go to school though?

774
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:00,460
Poranusorn school.

775
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,800
Wow. That's a big school, right?

776
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,640
You guys have a swimming pool too.

777
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:09,050
So nice.

778
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,490
I've only got to swim in the pool a few times only.

779
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,340
By the way...

780
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,840
you have a nice handwriting.

781
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,500
How can I write like this?

782
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,760
Teach me.

783
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,050
My handwriting...

784
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,740
is so bad.

785
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:32,460
Sometimes I can't even read my own handwriting.

786
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,630
And why are you going home so late at night?

787
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,660
Tutoring.

788
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:47,340
Tutoring? That one out there?

789
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,480
You're so hard working.

790
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:55,520
Even my parents force me to do tutoring, I just ignore it.

791
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,130
Thinking about it already gives me goosebump.

792
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,870
Even it's not that far from my home.

793
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:07,810
You like coconut cake?

794
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,830
No, I saw it as a recommended.

795
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,690
Recommended?

796
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,350
Do you try my cocoa drink?

797
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,800
On me.

798
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,740
Normally, my mom wouldn't let me make for customers.

799
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,900
It will be so good I guarantee.

800
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:34,280
Don't make that face. You're the first lucky person.

801
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,680
Wait a moment.

802
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,840
Here it is.

803
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,620
Here.

804
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,760
Try it.

805
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,280
Try it.

806
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,560
How is it?

807
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,180
Why is your face like that?

808
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,480
Oh I forgot that you're having a sore throat.

809
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,880
Then you don't have to drink anymore.

810
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,560
It's not so good, right?

811
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,520
It would be better if you put more milk.

812
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:22,020
It would be better if you put more milk.

813
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,120
Oh add more milk.

814
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,500
Um sure. I will try that next time.

815
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,160
Come back and by lab rat for—

816
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,240
Err…

817
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,900
I mean come back and try it again for me.

818
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,100
Please come try it again for me.
Wait until your throat is better. It should be better.

819
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,140
Get well soon then.

820
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,380
Ter. Dad is calling you.

821
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,880
Yes?

822
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,820
I’ll be back.

823
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,100
What do you need, dad?

824
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,740
- Hill! You’re here!
- Mom!

825
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,080
How do you know that I’m here?

826
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,440
People from the tutor said they saw you walked here, so I just followed what they said.

827
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,660
You came here to pick me up?

828
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,840
Oh cause I’m free today.

829
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,960
I wanna pick my son up too sometimes.

830
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,480
Let's go back with me.

831
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,600
- Sure.
- Let's go.

832
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,380
Oh this is your mom?

833
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:47,240
Yes. Not sure if my son disturbs you or anything?

834
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,680
No. Not at all.

835
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,500
I always welcome all customers.

836
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,880
- Do you want anything else?
- Oh no more. We will go now.

837
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,040
- Oh okay. I will walk you out.
- Sure.

838
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,680
Let's go.

839
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,600
- Please come back.
- Sure.

840
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,140
Come son.

841
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,080
Would you excuse us? We'll leave now.

842
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,080
See you around kid. You can always hangout here.

843
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,080
Sure.

844
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,280
Oh by the way, what's your name?

845
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,380
Hill-- Oops. Sorry. My car blocks you.

846
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,040
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

847
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,260
Next time you can sit here.

848
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,220
It's better than sitting at the tutoring place.

849
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,920
I tell tell the driver for you.

850
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,420
- Mom.
- Hmm? What?

851
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,200
That aunty, the owner we met just now...

852
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,060
- he has a son around my age.
- Really?

853
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,740
You met his son?

854
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,220
He came and talked to me.

855
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,420
Did he talk to you badly?

856
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,340
No.

857
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,740
And he was he?

858
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,840
He talks a lot.

859
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,760
Even I didn't really answer anything.

860
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,120
Kinda weird.

861
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,160
But he seems nice.

862
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,680
Cheerful.

863
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,480
and...

864
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,620
smile a lot too.

865
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,040
Hill...I think...

866
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,840
I haven't seen you smile like this for a very long time.

867
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,040
Really?

868
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:00,920
I'm glad. I think he can become your friend.

869
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,980
Let's do this. Next time, you can stop by that cafe again before I pick you up.

870
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,300
Do you think that's a good idea?

871
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:14,120
It's fine.

872
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,280
Go wait for the driver there.

873
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,280
And I will find the time,

874
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,280
to pick you up more ofthen, should I?

875
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,340
Sure.

876
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,640
But...

877
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,660
what is his name? That kid.

878
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,080
Easter.

879
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,340
Easter. That's a cute name.

880
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,020
I kinda want to meet him now.

881
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,760
What kind of kid is he to make my son smile like this?

882
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,140
Oh he's back?

883
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,220
Um. They're gone. His mom came and picked him up just now.

884
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,240
Too bad he's already gone.

885
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,220
I haven't said goodbye to him.

886
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,440
But his mom is so beautiful.

887
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,740
If she didn't say, I would thought that she's the sister,

888
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,060
Don't know how old is she. Her face is so young.

889
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:25,040
I think if you don't complain so much, you might look younger ad well.

890
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,020
- There. Come help me clean up.
- Sure~

891
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:35,660
Oh did he say that he will come back?

892
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,880
Not sure.

893
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,280
But I told them they're always welcome to come back.

894
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,200
They said sure.

895
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,020
I think he's a bit weird.

896
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,640
I haven't see his whole face.

897
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,640
I don't even know his name.

898
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,800
Seems so mysterious.

899
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,880
- But I know his name.
- Really!?

900
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,820
- He told me.
- What's his name?

901
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,300
If I hear it correctly, it was...

902
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,380
New...I think.

903
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,440
New?

904
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,280
What did dad call you to do just now?

905
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,040
To wax his shoes.

906
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,640
- I wax until it's so shiny. He can see his refelx on the shoes.
- Really?

907
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:21,080
- What about Christ?
- Doing her homework.

908
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,380
Whose sister is that? So hard-working.

909
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,740
I'm so proud of her.

910
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:32,760
- Don't know when her brother is gonna be like that too?
- Yeah right?

911
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,920
Mom!

912
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,880
Put this away and wash it.

913
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:39,940
Sure. I will let them sit in the water.

914
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,540
- Ugh. Just wash it right away.
- I'm too lazy.

915
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:48,400
- Do it now.
- Fine.

916
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,860
Oh hi welome.

917
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,180
Make yourself comfortable.

918
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,040
Oh New!

919
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,100
I thought you are not gonna come back anymore.

920
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,480
Mom. Please take this.

921
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,320
Sure.

922
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,320
We have coconut cake to day too.
Do you want some?

923
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,280
That's good. I will leave some coconut cake for you everyday from now on.

924
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,840
If you don't come, I will just eat it myself.

925
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,160
Let's go sit.

926
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,860
You're still sick?

927
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,140
Yeah all good.

928
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,600
If you're are better, why don't you speak?

929
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,540
I don't wanna speak.

930
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,680
I get it cause sometimes I also don't wanna talk.

931
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,280
But when I get to speak, I can't stop talking.

932
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,340
And...

933
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,720
you're wearing a mask
because you don't wanna speak?

934
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,440
I just don't want people to recognize.

935
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,560
What?

936
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,000
What's wrong with people recognizing you?

937
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,640
When people recognize me, they will approach to take advantage of me.

938
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,720
Yeah right.

939
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:32,620
There're something like that out there huh.

940
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,680
- Do you wanna have cocoa drink?
- No.

941
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,240
What do you mean?

942
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,840
it's not that good?

943
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,240
Fine.

944
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,180
What?

945
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,380
Fine.

946
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,000
Fine fine.

947
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,040
Because you wanna have it, I will make one for you.
I don't normally make drinks for anyone.

948
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:20,400
Wait a minute. I will make one for you.

949
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,740
Singapore?

950
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,560
Yeah. My family has to work there for awhile,

951
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,240
We have to take my son to attend the school there too.

952
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,740
Oh my. Then we won't be seeing each other for a very long time then.

953
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,880
That's why he's here to day good bye to his friend.

954
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,300
Oh...too bad.

955
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:46,780
Ter went to school already. He will be home in the evening.

956
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:49,280
Umm...can you wait for awhile?

957
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,680
We have to go to the airport actually.

958
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,240
Then can you say goodbye to him for my son?

959
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,560
Sure. Have a safe flight.

960
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,040
Let's go.

961
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,640
- Good bye.
- Yes.

962
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,180
Good luck, son.

963
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,780
I'm home.

964
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,360
Do you need any help?

965
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,500
Umm...not yet. Are you hungry?

966
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,280
Oh New and his mom stopped by in the afternoon.

967
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,200
They came to day goodbye before they fly to Singapore.

968
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,740
Singapore?

969
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,120
Too bad when they were here. You weren't here.

970
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,140
New's mom said...

971
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,380
they have urgent business there. And seems like they'll be there for a long time too.

972
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:03,040
You go put your stuff away upstairs and come help me.
Go.

973
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:06,680
- Sure.
- Hurry up.

974
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:07,840
Sure~

975
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:32,340
- You woke up so early.
- You're up?

976
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:38,360
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

977
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:40,240
Hi.

978
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,720
Why are you looking at me?

979
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,220
I'm so happy.

980
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,840
Happy?

981
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,600
To have you here.

982
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,840
What are you talking about?

983
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:27,960
Can I see that?

984
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,020
You remembered now?

985
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,520
Hey.

986
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,240
Wait.

987
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,640
You're New!?

988
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,330
Are they usually this stressed out when studying?

989
01:07:12,631 --> 01:07:14,051
Are you worried about P'Johan?

990
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:16,191
Because he's been working a lot lately

991
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,718
and has to go to Boston.

992
01:07:18,964 --> 01:07:20,779
Is P'Johan going to Boston?

993
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:22,287
Yes, for working.

994
01:07:22,528 --> 01:07:25,499
If you think you're carrying everything by yourself,

995
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:29,022
I'll be by your side.
