1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,240
I heard the president is a med student, right?

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,100
I know right. So talented.

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,647
You have to also work at the Student union, right?
You might meet him there

4
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:26,640
Excuse me.

5
00:00:28,179 --> 00:00:32,465
Do you remember that person I told you?
He's in the union as well.

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,734
Hill. You have someone you want to be serious with?

7
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:37,730
See you soon.

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,420
Hey!

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,370
Ter!

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,910
What?

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,090
Come check this out.
Hurry!

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,890
Isn't that...?

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,510
Isn't that your hand?

14
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,510
Right?

15
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,030
You know P'Hill,
med student?

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,470
You also know him?

17
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,810
Yes, he's famous.

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,830
Really?

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,460
"If I can take care of you..."

20
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,470
"...will I pass the test?"

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,060
He's a bit cringe.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,060
But still cool.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,130
Has he been flirting with you?

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,470
I don't think so.

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,470
Don't think so?
He's posting it.

26
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,450
Ughh. I don't know!

27
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,490
But to be honest...

28
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,490
I think he's already dating someone.

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,610
Right? I think so.

30
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,900
And how come you know him?

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,060
So...?

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,820
Hmm?

33
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,140
Fine. That's the guy.

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,140
Who's the guy?
Which guy?

35
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,220
The guy I told you about.

36
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,510
Oh...the guy you told me that story.

37
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,640
Yeah.

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,480
- Huh!?
- Huh!?

39
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,140
That guy you said you hate him so much?

40
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,210
- That's right.
- Shit!

41
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,980
How come?

42
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,180
So you hate him
because he's trying to flirt with you?

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,280
- It's not like that.
- Then why?

44
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,710
I don't know anymore.
I'll tell you about it later.

45
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,970
- Hey come back and tell me first.
- No.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,310
This is for sure.

47
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,850
<i>How are you, Ter?</i>

48
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,470
I'm good, mom.
You?

49
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,580
<i>I'm also good</i>

50
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,580
<i>Is it cold over there?</i>

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,140
Not so much right now.

52
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,370
<i>Take care of yourself too.
Don't get sick.</i>

53
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,650
Sure mom.

54
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,660
<i>You'll be alright overthere, right?</i>

55
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,850
Yes. All good.

56
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,690
There're only mountains here.

57
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,690
I miss the beach back home.

58
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:24,120
<i>Then come visit us sometimes.</i>

59
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,410
<i>What the hell is wrong with you?</i>

60
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,240
I can't face other people now.
Aren't you embarrassed of yourself?

61
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,360
Sure. If you're so embarassed
having me as your son,

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,750
- I will leave.
- Ter!

63
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,230
Ter! Son!

64
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,990
Let him be.
If he wants to leave, let him leave.

65
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,270
- But he's your son!
- Don't follow him.

66
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,250
Ter!

67
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,530
Ter!

68
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,940
Ter!

69
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,610
Ter!

70
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,390
Ter!

71
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,270
Ter!

72
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,540
Ter!

73
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,300
Ter!

74
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,330
What about Chris?
How is she?

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,860
<i>She's fine.</i>

76
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,620
<i>Just finished her exams.</i>

77
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,820
<i>You haven't talked to her?</i>

78
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,330
No.

79
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:39,700
I need to hang up now.
Gotta go mom.

80
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,310
<i>Ok. I miss you, son.</i>

81
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,460
I miss you too mom.

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,580
Damn it, Song!

83
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,300
You should go play retro snake.

84
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,020
I will download it for you.
Look at that.

85
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,220
Hill.

86
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,950
Hill.

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,880
Hill.

88
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,950
Hmm?

89
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,380
Why do you look distracted?
Not studying anymore?

90
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,390
Yeah...always on your phone.

91
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,030
You also haven't read, Jo.
You also, Arthit.

92
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm too lazy. Damn it.

93
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,790
I'm just gonna quit med school.

94
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,530
That's good. You should quit.
Always increase class average.

95
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,010
Me? Increase the bar?
It's more like him.

96
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,310
Sitting there looking distracted.

97
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,670
I almost got an F last final
'cause of him.

98
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,030
Had to do my best, hadn't I?

99
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,090
Just make it good enough.
Damn, if it's norm referenced, we're gonna fail.

100
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,900
You got what? 98?
Tonfah got 90. He got a B.

101
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,520
I got 84...almost down to D grade.

102
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,260
What? Hmm?

103
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,130
You seem off lately, Hill.

104
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,760
Do you have something to tell us?

105
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,010
Distracted...

106
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,010
always on your phone...

107
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,020
Like he's in love, isn't he?

108
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,860
Hill.
You can talk to me about everything.

109
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,950
Nope.

110
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,860
That means he's really falling in love.

111
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,330
Who is it?

112
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,780
I will introduce to you guys soon.

113
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,880
Like are you currently dating?

114
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,180
Why are you so nosy?

115
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,270
What?

116
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,790
Don't act like
you don't wanna know.

117
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,790
I don't know...

118
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:02,330
A guy like you?
Make the first move?

119
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,410
Why?
What's wrong?

120
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,050
Thought you are dead inside.

121
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,910
If you're a player like Johan,
that's another story.

122
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,910
Why am I mentioned?

123
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,330
Cause you're a player.

124
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,330
- What are you talking about?
- Hey guys.

125
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,330
Stop fighting.

126
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,900
Each one of you...

127
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,050
So our friend,
Hill, is about to be married.

128
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,710
So it's just us left
...Jo...Ton.

129
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,350
It's probably not just me.

130
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,350
Right?

131
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,920
- What?
- You too?

132
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,770
He's babbling.

133
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,030
Hey.

134
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,820
Just keep studying.

135
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,030
I gotta go.

136
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,980
Oh.

137
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,520
Where are you going, Jo?

138
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
I have to be somewhere.

139
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,150
Three?

140
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,510
Do you need my help?

141
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,440
It's fine.

142
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,210
P'Hill.

143
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,130
P'Hill.

144
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,420
Let me help you carry.

145
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,780
Don't be stubborn.

146
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,620
Anything else you need?

147
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,350
No more.

148
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,300
Thank you.

149
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,680
Can I have my books?
I'm going home now.

150
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,600
Just these two then.

151
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll take you home.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ter!

153
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,870
Ter!

154
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,430
Let me take you home.

155
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,290
Let go of me.

156
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,290
I can go back myself.

157
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,820
If you don't let me take you home,

158
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
I'm not gonna let you go.

159
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,360
Let me go, P'Hill.

160
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,790
Don't be like this please.

161
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,860
Please~

162
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,850
Please.

163
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,650
Fine.

164
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,420
Good boy.

165
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,280
Let's go.

166
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,320
Let me go then.

167
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,970
Thank you.

168
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,580
Your welcome.

169
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,840
By the way...

170
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,940
did you have the answer?

171
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,780
What answer?

172
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,880
About my post.

173
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,700
So...

174
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,540
Do I pass the test?

175
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,960
Would you excuse me?

176
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,980
Hey dude.

177
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
Why are you making that face?

178
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
You met the person you hate?

179
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,210
So what now?

180
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,440
About you and P'Hill?

181
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,380
I'm only telling you
because it's you.

182
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
Really?

183
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,510
Come on.

184
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,950
Tell me.

185
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,060
So?

186
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,080
Well...

187
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,960
We went to the same school.

188
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,410
11 syllables poem
has the following characteristics.

189
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,910
1 verse has 2 lines.

190
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,960
Why are they playing so loundly?

191
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,470
Don't pay attention to them.

192
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,470
Focus on the class.

193
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,470
Each line has 2 verses.

194
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,470
There you go.

195
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,650
Any one of you
are good like my friend here?

196
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,040
Ok. They do not respect us at all.

197
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,440
You guys!
Can't you play quietly?

198
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,800
Oh...miss.

199
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,570
How can we play basketball quietly?

200
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,060
Just play some other times.

201
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,220
Can't you see that
they are studying?

202
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,790
Are you arguing with me?

203
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,720
No, we're not at all.

204
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,110
These kids. I swear...

205
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,190
Go! Go!
Put it away. Play some other days.

206
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,190
Yes ma'am~

207
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,310
So you knew each other before?

208
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,240
I never thought
we'd meet each other again.

209
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,510
Kinda surprising.

210
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,430
Let me guess.
You ended things badly, right?

211
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,540
Were you two super close?

212
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,700
Ever talked to each other?

213
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,640
A bit.

214
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,120
And...did he show any interest
or giving you any hint?

215
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,480
No.

216
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Then why do you hate him?

217
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,430
He posted a picture like that.

218
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,150
If it's not flirting,
then what do you call it?

219
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,550
It's up to you now.

220
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,380
What's your feelings towards him?

221
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,490
My feelings?

222
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,550
Why don't you just give it a try?

223
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,270
It's Hill, we're talking about.

224
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,400
He might just fooling around.

225
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Probably not.

226
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,730
You like to think for yourself.

227
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,730
How can I know for sure?

228
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,390
He also works at the union, right?

229
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,390
It must be very awkward.

230
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,890
That's why I'm stressed here.

231
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,350
I don't know
what exactly happened between you two.

232
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,930
But I'd suggest you to be honest with yourself.

233
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,420
If you don't like him,
then tell him you don't like him.

234
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,750
Please.

235
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,750
Understood?

236
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,230
Yes.

237
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,590
Fine.
Go back and play your games.

238
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,000
Forget it.

239
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,650
What the hell is wrong with you?

240
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,650
You scared me.

241
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,910
You don't understand.

242
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,600
(Drawing club)

243
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,690
Ter.

244
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,690
Are you bringing me to the right place?

245
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,970
Yes, I am.
There's only one drawing club, right?

246
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,580
Why is the vibes so spooky?

247
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:59,160
Cause the term hasn't started yet.
Nobody's here.

248
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,380
I think we should go, Ter.

249
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,080
Why are you so scared?

250
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,180
I'm scared of that thing.

251
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,130
Terrr~

252
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,490
Stop hanging on to my arms.

253
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,490
- Ter.
- What!?

254
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,490
Stop calling me.

255
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,690
Or the reason why
there's no one sign up for this club 'cause...

256
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,770
there're...

257
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,770
Hello!

258
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,500
Let's pray.

259
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,930
I will lead...Namo Tassa.

260
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,930
Repeat after me.

261
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,190
North.
Calm down.

262
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,450
North! Calm down.
That's a human. Not ghost.

263
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,880
Open your eyes, North!

264
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
Look at that.

265
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Here.

266
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
Hi.

267
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,630
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,090
- He's scared of ghosts.
- Just tiny bit. Not much.

269
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,770
North?

270
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,590
Is this another friend,
you said he'd like to join?

271
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,530
Um. Yes yes. This guy.

272
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,950
It's me.

273
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,230
Anyways...nobody's here at all?

274
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,990
Um...
all the seniors are busy with the orientation.

275
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,990
So they don't have time to be here.

276
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,870
Then you're probably here alone?

277
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,560
Umm
I'm not participating in the Welcome Back camp.

278
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,080
I like to be alone here.

279
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Must be real lonely.

280
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,800
You guys are here to sign up, right?

281
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,120
- Err--
- Yes yes.

282
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,530
We're here to sign up
cause we don't want to find any other to join.

283
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,170
Dude. Should we reconsider
and think it through again?

284
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,480
What?
We agreed to join this one.

285
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,030
I didn't know it's gonna be this quiet.
If I knew, I wouldn't agree with you in the first place.

286
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,010
I think we should check
whether there's any history here.

287
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:56,640
There's gotta be something 100%.
Believe me. I have a feelin'

288
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,430
What kind of sense is that?
You're talking nonsense.

289
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,560
What about the other 2 guys?

290
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,750
Phoon and Foam?
They'll come later.

291
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,750
They will join too.

292
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,470
- They will come later.
- Good.

293
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:16,160
Don't be scared, North.
There's no ghost here.

294
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
You can rest assured.

295
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,010
I'm not gonna rest assured 'cause of him instead.
More scary than a ghost.

296
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,270
Are you sure?

297
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,270
I'm sure.

298
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,870
See, North?
I told you there's no ghost here.

299
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,420
You're scared of no such things.

300
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,980
Huh.
You were screaming with me just now.

301
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Cause you made me!

302
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,520
Pleased to be here.

303
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,080
My pleasure.

304
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,370
Let's go.
I will give you a tour of the club.

305
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,730
Um sure.

306
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,730
Come on.

307
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,740
Let's go.

308
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:57,374
You're stiff like a rock!

309
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,580
Here?

310
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,020
Why is it so eerie here?
Is there anybody here?

311
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,020
I think you can go check out yourself.

312
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,850
Hey...but Ter said...

313
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,230
he will be waiting here.

314
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,580
Really?

315
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,230
Just go in.

316
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,540
- You come with me.
- Go together.

317
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Or you just go alone?

318
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:36,417
These motherf*ckers!

319
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,150
What the hell are you doing?

320
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,270
- His idea.
- Don't look at me like that.

321
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,270
Here.
It's Ter. His idea.

322
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,740
- You're blaming me now?
- It's both of you!

323
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,740
Yeah both of you.

324
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,060
Dao.
Can we be done for today?

325
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,940
Yeah sure.

326
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,220
I'm hungry.

327
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,290
Daotok...aren't you joinig us for some food?

328
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,470
No, I'll have to close the club.

329
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,280
You want me to stay with you?

330
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
It's fine.
I can stay by myself.

331
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,400
I believe you.

332
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,230
What about you?

333
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,300
Are you joining?

334
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,950
I have to be at the faculty.

335
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,350
But I'll drop Ter
behind the campus first.

336
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,920
Okay.

337
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,150
- Shall we go? I'm hungry.
- Let's go.

338
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,150
Let's go

339
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,840
- I'm gonna go now, Dao.
- Ok see you.

340
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,110
Bye bye~

341
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,110
Get home safely.
See you later.

342
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,730
- Are you sure you can stay?
- I can.

343
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,730
Don't scare the ghost.

344
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,893
- Just kidding~
- Dude!

345
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,340
Pull over here.

346
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,820
Thank you.
Find something to eat too.

347
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,020
- See you.
- See you.

348
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Bye bye~

349
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,090
What's up?
Hello?

350
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:14,546
Where are you now?

351
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm at the back of the campus.
Where are you guys?

352
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,998
I don’t know. Phoon is kinda lost.

353
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,400
Huh? Again?

354
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,823
You go ahead and choose the restro. We’ll be there.

355
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,430
Alright. Okay.
Just come on down.

356
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,710
Left! I said left! That’s the right, Phoon!
I gotta go, Ter.

357
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,310
Right. Drive safe.

358
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,370
Oh Ter!

359
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,540
Hello P'Thunmild.

360
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,720
Never thought I would see you here.

361
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,790
Thought you'd be studying in Bangkok.

362
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,390
Never thought
I would meet you here either.

363
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,000
Haven't seen you for so long.

364
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,130
Yeah.

365
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,730
Which faculty are you in?

366
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,110
Oh.

367
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm a vet student.

368
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
What about you, P'Mild?

369
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,690
Med school.

370
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,910
Ah~

371
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,740
And...how long have you been here?

372
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,570
Just a few days ago.

373
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,460
Are you adjusting okay?

374
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,460
You can get lost easily here.

375
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,130
I was confusing too
when I first arrived.

376
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,130
Lost here
and there all the time.

377
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm not used to all of it yet.

378
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Get lost quiet often too.

379
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,500
Hill is also here.

380
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,500
Really?

381
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,670
Yeah same university.

382
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,670
You might bump into him somedays.

383
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,610
Yeah.

384
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,260
Well...

385
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,060
I'm gonna get going.

386
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,860
If you need anything,

387
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,860
text me anytime.

388
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,940
Sure. Thank you.

389
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,610
See you around.

390
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,160
How do you pronounce that?

391
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,770
Gene.

392
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,750
is the basic unit of heredity.

393
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,040
If our grandparents have it...

394
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,360
That was one hell of a ride.

395
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,680
What?
You told me the wrong direction.

396
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,270
So daring. I told you to go left, you went right.
Told you to go right, you turned left.

397
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,050
i won't let you drive next time.

398
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,750
Good.

399
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,750
I'll tell you the direction instead.

400
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,530
That's worse.
You should just sit quietly and let me drive.

401
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,000
Enough enough.

402
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Why are you guys arguing so much?

403
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,230
All day. Everyday.

404
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,730
Did you order?

405
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,730
Umm. Also ordered for you guys.

406
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,630
Why are you making that face?

407
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,580
Hmm?

408
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,040
Nothing.

409
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,650
Like we're buying that.

410
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,670
I just met a person
I didn't wanna see.

411
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,500
Thank you.

412
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,940
Who is it?

413
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,290
Is it the union guy,
that you're trying to avoid?

414
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,640
You can tell!?

415
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,770
It's obvious.

416
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,970
Am I that obvious?

417
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,970
Yes.

418
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,520
But I just don't know who it is.

419
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,680
Is it the same person?

420
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,020
No no.

421
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,320
Then who is it?

422
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,320
You know him before?

423
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,390
Umm. Kinda.

424
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,790
Haven't seen each other
for a year though.

425
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,900
Let's just eat.

426
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,190
P'Peem,
can I be excused from the union tomorrow?

427
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,390
Why?
Are you okay?

428
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,470
I'm just not feeling well.

429
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,110
Nothing serious, right?

430
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,270
No, I will just get some rest.

431
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,180
Oops.

432
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,790
Is something wrong?

433
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,620
Last night, Easter texted me.

434
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,020
Seems like he's taking leave today.
Probably sick.

435
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,260
What's the matter?

436
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
How am I supposed to know?

437
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,240
Give me his number.

438
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,930
So....

439
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,010
Hmm?

440
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,080
The picture that you posted.

441
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,430
You took it
at the restaurant the other day, didn't you?

442
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,760
Umm.

443
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,700
Is this why
he doesn't want to be here today?

444
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,200
Are you saying that....

445
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
it's because of me?

446
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Isn't it?

447
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,130
I will talk to him myself.

448
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,650
Do you like Easter?

449
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,060
So?
I'm not giving this back to you, if you don't tell me.

450
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,060
Or should I delete his number?

451
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,420
Fine.

452
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,510
Just don't tell anyone.
I don't want him to be uncomfortable.

453
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,520
I knew it!
Bua and I have been suspecting you since that day.

454
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,300
I'm such a psychic.

455
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,640
Gotta go.

456
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,460
Be nice.

457
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,870
Our president is in love~

458
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,070
Bua!

459
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,780
You need to know this.

460
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,960
Hello?

461
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
Are you sick?

462
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
I will take you to the hospital.

463
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,510
I'm fine.

464
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,510
I actually have errands to run anyway.

465
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,180
But if you're not well,
you should rest at home.

466
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,370
I gotta go. Got many things to do.
I'm hanging up now.

467
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,370
Are you lying
that you're sick?

468
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,820
I'm not.

469
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,330
If you don't show up at the union,
your points will be deducted. You know that right?

470
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,680
Will I?

471
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:16,890
Um.

472
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,300
So...are you really sick or not?

473
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,300
I am.

474
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,860
Then I will come get you.

475
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
No.

476
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,340
Why not?

477
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Gotta go.

478
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,310
What's up, sick boy?

479
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,550
You don't seem to be sick.

480
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,080
That's good.

481
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,020
- Let's go. I will take you.
- No, I'm not going.

482
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,970
Don't be stubborn.

483
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,470
I'm not going.

484
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,550
Fine.

485
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,270
Fine fine.

486
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,140
Where are you taking me?

487
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,450
- You'll let me now?
- You still haven't told me, where are you taking me?

488
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,450
You'll find out.

489
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,450
You're so devious.

490
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,450
With stubborn kid only.

491
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,490
Let's go.

492
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,330
I can walk myself.

493
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,130
Is that hurt?

494
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,630
Yes it is.
Why did you ask?

495
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,630
Stubborn kid deserves that.

496
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,230
P'Hill!

497
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:52,230
I should have gone my own way.

498
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,260
Where are we going?

499
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,340
Where would you like to go?

500
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,700
I didn't want to go anywhere.

501
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,510
I thought you want to go take some pics.

502
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,570
I know a place.

503
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,570
Really beautiful.

504
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,100
That beautiful?

505
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,680
Umm yes.

506
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,600
You never changed.
Still love taking pictures

507
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,850
Have you been here before?

508
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,260
Never.

509
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,540
I will be your guide for today.

510
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,300
This is an old temple.

511
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,950
It used to be a forest here.

512
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,600
That's why this temple is very big.

513
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
And it's also very close to the nature.

514
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,590
All these are Lanna Architecture.

515
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,250
The walls are made from mostly bricks.

516
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,010
Rarely renovated or built anything new.

517
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,330
They still remain Lanna style.

518
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,880
I think it's fasinating.

519
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,200
Wait up!

520
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,460
Then catch up with me.

521
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,350
That's beautiful.

522
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,350
Hey don't look.

523
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,990
Can you be a photographer for me?

524
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,470
No.
You'll waste my SD card space.

525
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,610
Please~

526
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,060
Please.

527
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,900
I never let anyone
take a picture of me.

528
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:03,910
Really?
I never let anyone
take a picture of me.

529
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,930
Really?

530
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,930
I saw many took pictures of you.

531
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,380
You check out my photos?

532
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,370
Nice!

533
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,480
I do not.

534
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,020
People share it.
I just see it on my timeline.

535
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,480
But at least you see it?

536
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,430
Right?

537
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,880
What are you talking about?

538
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,830
Do you wanna go pray?

539
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,250
Ter.

540
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,590
You might get sick.

541
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,390
Thank you.

542
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,320
Your welcome.

543
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,680
Ter.

544
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,820
Can you do me a favor?

545
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,710
No.

546
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,690
Please.

547
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,310
Please.

548
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,100
Please.

549
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,270
Please~

550
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,810
What is it?

551
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,690
Can I hold your hands?

552
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,060
Can I ask for one more thing?

553
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,640
What?

554
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,930
Can I be with you?

555
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,170
Who is this?

556
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,300
- He's my nong.
- Oh.
<i>(Nong is used to call someone younger in Thai.)</i>

557
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
Nong that I'm dating.

558
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,060
That's not funny.

559
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,940
I'm serious.

560
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,910
Shit!!

561
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,910
-Look!
- So what now?

562
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,090
- Try to be opened.
- Be opened is not easy to do.

563
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:32,780
Cause I've been hurt so much before.
