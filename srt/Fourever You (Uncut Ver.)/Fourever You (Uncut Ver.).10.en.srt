1
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,395
If there's nothing else,
I'll go to bed now.

2
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,290
Sleep here.

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,290
Your friend is about to quit being a player.

4
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:28,625
You know that I have a crush on Hill, right?

5
00:00:28,685 --> 00:00:31,995
If you made it with this relationship,
what would you like to tell this person?

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,535
I'll do my best to take care of you.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,470
he's not like this with the others,

8
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,625
But why this one?

9
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,408
What time do you get off work?

10
00:00:46,374 --> 00:00:48,229
Normally around 10pm.

11
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:51,776
But it depends on when P'Yha wants to close too.

12
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:53,151
P'Yha?

13
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:55,260
She's the owner of the restaurant.

14
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:58,219
You can go back with Hill.

15
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:00,285
He's gonna come take Ter home anyway.

16
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:01,720
Sure.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,314
Call me if you need anything.

18
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:06,300
Thank you for dropping me off.

19
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:09,682
I gotta go.

20
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:19,567
Oh my word.

21
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:23,244
Ughh. I just missed it. Too bad.

22
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:24,859
What's going on, P'Yha?

23
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:26,850
The guy just now.

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,810
I came out to see your boyfriend.
I know that he's hot only just one look from behind.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,020
My boyfriend?

26
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,805
And who's that?

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,533
It's P'Johan.
He's a friend of P'Hill.

28
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:37,768
Really?

29
00:01:37,826 --> 00:01:39,508
Is he single?

30
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,274
I'm not sure about that.

31
00:01:42,358 --> 00:01:45,878
Oh cause if he's single, then I can flirt with him, right?

32
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:46,820
Can I?

33
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:50,422
- I guess you can. Just flirting a little.
- Just kidding!

34
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:52,943
Anyways, but you do you have a picture of him?

35
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,684
I wanna see his face.

36
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:57,040
- I don't.
- Don't keep it to yourself. Come on.

37
00:01:57,081 --> 00:02:00,471
I know just from the behind.
If I get to see his front--

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,537
What are you guys talking about?

39
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:04,530
The guy named Johan.

40
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:07,690
He dropped North off just now.
So handsome. I only got to see him from behind.

41
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,720
Oh...North's boyfriend?

42
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,480
Boyfriend!? So what's the truth?

43
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:17,402
Oh...not yet.
But in the future maybe?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,469
For real!?

45
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,274
Do you have a picture?
I wanna see his face clearly.

46
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:26,680
- Yeah. There're so many on the page.
- Really? Let me see.

47
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,997
So hot!

48
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,645
Oh my gosh. Why is he so hot?

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,189
I told you. North is deepdown a badass.

50
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,063
I'm gonna go change.

51
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:39,122
Are you blushing?

52
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,315
- No.
- Haa!

53
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:44,703
He's so handsome.

54
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,171
- Here.
- Yeah?

55
00:02:46,185 --> 00:02:47,851
- Can you save it for me?
- Sure.

56
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,709
- All of them?
- Sure.

57
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,397
Jhaja: How are you, North?

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,294
I'm good. What's up, Jah?
I'm about to work.

59
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,285
I have something I wanna talk to you.
Are you free tomorrow?

60
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,087
Let me see.

61
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:41,186
What's going on?

62
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,434
Nothing.

63
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,352
Are you sure?

64
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:47,567
Sure.

65
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:51,862
I better go sweet the floor.

66
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:53,875
- Sweet the floor.
- What sweet?

67
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:57,351
I'm gonna go get some plates.
There's no plate here.

68
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,875
No plates there. The plates are over there.

69
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,733
Over there.

70
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:04,256
These guys...

71
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,970
..are so weird.

72
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,660
Hi. I'm going home.
Bye bye.

73
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,220
You have something you haven't told me, right?

74
00:05:32,558 --> 00:05:33,860
What?

75
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:36,321
You and P'Yha hide something from me.

76
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,300
Don't you think that I also know?

77
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:43,229
What? Nothing.

78
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:45,534
You're so smooth, huh?

79
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:48,419
You're a bad liar. You know that?

80
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:54,797
Alright. Fine.

81
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:59,303
Promise me that if I tell you,
you're not gonna be upset?

82
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
What is it?

83
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:03,198
Promise me first.

84
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:05,780
Promise. Fine. I promise.
Can you tell me now?

85
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,430
Hot news! Someone spotted P'Johan's rode a big bike to campus.

86
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:22,950
He's so hot, but there's also a mysterious guy with him.
Anyone know who he is?

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,615
Ugh. I wanna see P'Johan on a big bike with my own eyes.

88
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,580
Don't tell me that there were together last night
that's why they're there together?

89
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,705
Above comment is so harsh. I can't.

90
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,880
Hey hey. Today Tiger, our faculty's moon, also rode a big bike.
I wanna be on a bike with him too.

91
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:43,715
But you guys notice someone on the bike with him too? Weird...right?

92
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,700
Same jacket with the guy who was with P'Johan.

93
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:50,145
He's dating two guys? I really wanna know who is this guy?

94
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,950
Enough. Don't read further.

95
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,348
These are just comments on the internet.

96
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,342
Don't overthink about it please.

97
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,312
When have I ever overthought?

98
00:07:00,865 --> 00:07:02,210
Who knows?

99
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,242
I'm afraid that you might be.

100
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,980
I shouldn't have let you read it.

101
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,671
I'm not really.

102
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,299
I'm not like what people say.

103
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:12,450
There's nothing between me and P'Johan.

104
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,019
Ger is also my friend.

105
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,320
Really?

106
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:19,829
Yeah.

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,357
Really?

108
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:24,400
Don't let me find you crying in the bathroom alone later.

109
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,601
You're the one who might be, not me.

110
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,330
Cause I'm worried. I don't want you to feel bad.

111
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,632
You're worried about me?

112
00:07:33,103 --> 00:07:35,040
Stop being so pouty.

113
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:38,850
Forget about my stuff. What about you?
Are you alright?

114
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:41,398
I saw you were absent-minded today.

115
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,897
I kinda misunderstod P'Hill a bit.

116
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:48,614
About what?

117
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:51,379
Well...

118
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,558
about when I thought he left me.

119
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,715
What? Left you? There.

120
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,290
He's here. Left you how?

121
00:08:04,008 --> 00:08:05,386
Go.

122
00:08:06,502 --> 00:08:09,330
- Are you sure you'll be okay?
- Yeah.

123
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,801
Hi P'Hill.

124
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,380
P'Hill.

125
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,610
You need to talk to P'Jo for my friend.

126
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,760
Ter.

127
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:32,198
What did he do?

128
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:34,124
- Well--
- It's nothing.

129
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,192
Ter is just babbling.

130
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:41,028
Cause in Cute Boy and Girl page...

131
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:43,042
posted a picture of P'Johan.

132
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:46,869
And the comments are not so good.

133
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,288
Are you overthinking about it?

134
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,797
No not at all, P'Hill.

135
00:08:54,626 --> 00:08:55,896
I will handle it.

136
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:02,377
If P'Jo makes my friend regret,
I won't let he dates him anymore.

137
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:05,133
Sure~

138
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,380
Let's go.

139
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,480
Are you sure you're okay?

140
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:11,845
- Are you crazy?
- I'm just curious.

141
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:13,985
Why can't I worry about you?

142
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,351
Dude look.

143
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,690
The page has apologized.

144
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,940
About the picture we posted earlier,

145
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:43,730
we have to apologize to everyone in the pictures.
Apologize for the misunderstanding.

146
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,810
Also for posting your pictures without asking for permission.

147
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:51,985
From now on, we will stop posting.

148
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:55,745
Thank you for supporting us.

149
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,530
Shit. They shut down their page.

150
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:00,765
That's good.

151
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:02,894
Yeah.

152
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:03,853
Good.

153
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:07,380
They post shitty thing
and made the whole internet talks bad about my friend.

154
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,706
Shut down for good.

155
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:14,432
Do you guys wanna stop by somewhere to buy stuff?

156
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:22,278
Don't feel bad.
I'm also ordered by someone to do this.

157
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:29,001
I'm fine. Up to North.

158
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:30,914
It's okay. I don't want any.

159
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:36,059
Umm..and how are you guys...
North and Johan?

160
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:39,405
Good.

161
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,835
But I haven't paid him anything.

162
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:44,465
Don't rush.

163
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,362
I think he doesn't even remember...

164
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:47,767
how much does North owe him.

165
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:51,420
He doesn't?
But he keeps adding more debt for me.

166
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,232
Just pay him back when you can.

167
00:10:56,374 --> 00:10:57,717
He's adding more everyday.

168
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,946
Right?

169
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,008
Why are you calling me here?

170
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:16,028
Did you drop him off?

171
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:17,785
Yeah.

172
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,300
Don't tell me
you want me here just to ask that?

173
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,140
When are you gonna use all the money?

174
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,128
Stop transferring me.

175
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:33,358
Are you buying him a car or something?

176
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,290
Do you think he has a driver license?

177
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,315
I was being sarcastic.

178
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:42,760
I already asked him.

179
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,309
He doesn't want anything.

180
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:48,500
You're very good at spending money.
But please be nice to him too.

181
00:11:48,807 --> 00:11:50,642
I'm trying.

182
00:11:51,558 --> 00:11:53,743
I'm doing my best right now.

183
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:58,200
And shuting down that page was you, right?

184
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,085
Umm.

185
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:02,185
It's so nonsense.
I've seen they do it so many times.

186
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,962
Ter said if you break North's heart,

187
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,380
he won't let his friend date you anymore.

188
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:14,709
North is upset?

189
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,321
No.

190
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,940
He's not overthinking
and not even thinking about you either.

191
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:23,450
F*ck you.

192
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:27,773
You also send someone to check up on him at the bar, right?

193
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:33,038
But seems like he's hiding you.
Cause Ter also never told me anything.

194
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:35,859
Um.

195
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:38,145
Yeah I have someone there.

196
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:41,247
Why don't you just tell him that you know?

197
00:12:41,437 --> 00:12:44,380
He doesn't want me to know, so I won't.

198
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,613
You're suddenly so behaved.

199
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:48,190
What about girls in your stock?

200
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,314
Have you talked to them?

201
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,900
Ter said he won't allow that,
if you're still talking to other people.

202
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:54,525
I'm taking care of it.

203
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,228
You chose North?

204
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,360
Um.

205
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,151
Since long time ago, yeah?

206
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,580
- Oh Jo.
- What?

207
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:13,087
He knows about my grandma, right?

208
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:26,037
He's really worried about you.

209
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,820
And when are you gonna tell him?

210
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:33,059
When we talk about my family,

211
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:35,257
I'm getting scared suddenly.

212
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,161
You mean...

213
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,508
He just disappeared
when his grandma got into an accident?

214
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:01,690
Um something like that.

215
00:14:02,737 --> 00:14:05,454
But he just disappeared without telling you?

216
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:07,240
I think it's a little weird.

217
00:14:09,564 --> 00:14:11,228
I also don't know.

218
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:14,322
I will just wait until he's ready to tell.

219
00:14:17,454 --> 00:14:19,080
Oh North.

220
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,062
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

221
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:25,091
Do you...

222
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:27,721
have feelings for P'Johan?

223
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:30,644
You're in the mood to ask me that?

224
00:14:30,862 --> 00:14:33,711
Cause normally you're my adviser.

225
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:36,025
I wanna be a good adviser to you too.

226
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,755
More like...
you're just wanna be nosy?

227
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,831
Yeah I kinda am.

228
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:43,831
But I saw you guys talk a lot.

229
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,542
Always out and about together.
Pick you up. Drop you off.

230
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,093
Also spent a night together.

231
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,789
Also borrow each other's clothes.

232
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,395
Hmm?

233
00:14:52,522 --> 00:14:54,767
and why do you suddenly ask me this?

234
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:56,536
You normally only ship us.

235
00:14:57,992 --> 00:15:01,109
Cause from what happened today, I'm not okay.

236
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,570
You're bad mouthed by people
when you actually did nothing.

237
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,893
Don't think too much.

238
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,185
And when I ship, I never told anyone.

239
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:14,872
I just wanna tease you that's all.
Just wanna get back at you.

240
00:15:15,034 --> 00:15:18,696
Right. I'm not overthinking or anything,
Stop with that pouty face.

241
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,949
And...

242
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,032
Do you think he has feelings for you?

243
00:15:26,162 --> 00:15:27,530
How am I supposed to know?

244
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,000
What kind of question is that?

245
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,080
Cause I see you guys are together a lot.

246
00:15:31,162 --> 00:15:33,580
Cause you also notice
for P'Thun case.

247
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:36,668
It's not the same.

248
00:15:39,414 --> 00:15:42,869
But there're times when I kinda doubt too.

249
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,229
What kind of a person is he?

250
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:48,845
If he likes me, but do all these to me?
It's not right.

251
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:50,496
Come on.

252
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,207
Maybe it's his style of flirting.

253
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,322
Dude.

254
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:00,632
What if he really likes you?

255
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,677
What are you gonna do?

256
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,485
What can I do?

257
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:07,983
I cannot do anything.

258
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:11,700
You really don't have any feelings for him?

259
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:27,657
I just...

260
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:29,874
...don't know.

261
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:32,943
I don't even know myself.

262
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:36,063
But if one day I really fall in love with someone,

263
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,140
you know that I am not a complicated person.

264
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:42,663
I will do my best to show them.

265
00:16:45,469 --> 00:16:46,791
I think..

266
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:50,222
I also don't see P'Johan with anyone either.

267
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,605
He might really like you one day.

268
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:56,179
He lends you money
and always take you to places.

269
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,254
He does a lot for you though.

270
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:01,140
Why don't you try to open your heart for him?

271
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,848
There's nothing wrong with that.

272
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,880
Drawing club.

273
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:22,469
See you this evening, North.

274
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,030
- Hey North!
- Ghost. Ghost.

275
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,870
What are you doing here alone?

276
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,070
Ter and phoon are in class.

277
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,770
I don't wanna be at my dorm.

278
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,640
What about you?
Drawing again?

279
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:50,120
Do you think drawing will hlelp ease my mind?

280
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,690
Forget it.

281
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,590
It actually does help.

282
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,650
It will help you concentrate.

283
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,550
You have something on your mind?

284
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,750
Yeah a bit.

285
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,810
Do you wanna borrow my tools?

286
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,375
I've never seen you drawn anything
since you joined the club

287
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,380
Better not.

288
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,690
I think I will just eat something
and that will ease my mind.

289
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,570
I should just watch you draw.
You are pretty good at it.

290
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,720
I will continue my drawing then.

291
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,250
Umm.

292
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,550
I shouldn't compliment you huh.
Cause now you're drawing.

293
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,250
Hey, I'm gonna get going now.

294
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,960
You have a class?

295
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,530
Um.

296
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,130
I will go buy some drink first. I still have time.

297
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,420
Okay.

298
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:59,360
- See you.
- See you.

299
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

300
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,140
Don't scare the ghost here.

301
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,630
Just kidding.

302
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,080
- You're gonna be okay alone?
- Um.

303
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,970
What are you doing there?
Filming a music video?

304
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,480
Where's Nao?

305
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,930
He's buying some drink out front.

306
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,450
I have something to show you.

307
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,390
So damn cute.

308
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,460
What do you mean cute?

309
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,430
He looks like he's gonn eat you alive.

310
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,690
Cute like a kitty showing their claws.

311
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,670
Let me ask you something.

312
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,360
What?

313
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,670
When you like someone?
What does it feel like?

314
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,440
You sound like...

315
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,450
you've never liked anyone before?

316
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,530
I have.

317
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,680
I just don't understand.

318
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,040
What makes someone like someone so much?

319
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,890
Like what you have now.

320
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,350
You just like them.

321
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,990
Like who they are.

322
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,110
Their characters.

323
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,130
Their look, their behavior and all the stuff.

324
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,890
It's...

325
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,670
he's born to make me fall for it.,

326
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,930
You ever heard of...

327
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,840
'it's more than just a type' concept.?

328
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,460
You're madly in love too.

329
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,570
Why? Do you like someone?

330
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,150
Hey.

331
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,590
- Hey.
- Hey what?

332
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,670
North!
Let's go to the class.

333
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,970
Let's go.

334
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,300
Where?

335
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,210
To class.

336
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,000
We don't have the combine section.

337
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,720
Why can't I go to your class?

338
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,260
- No, you can't.
- Yes.

339
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,450
- Let me go.
- Sure.

340
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,720
- Let me come with you.
- Ow.

341
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,720
- Let me go with you, Nao.
- Don't follow me.

342
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,080
That's it for today.

343
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,710
Don't forget to go home and study.
Especially you. Please pay attention.

344
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,090
You might fail.

345
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,520
Yes sir.

346
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:39,610
I'm here.
I will wait for you at the cafe in front of your faculty.

347
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,800
Hey I gotta go. Jah is waiting for me.

348
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,600
Wait what did you say?

349
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,720
Jah is waiting for me.

350
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,780
Wait for what?

351
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,750
She came to see me.
She needs to talk to me about something.

352
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,260
Talk about what?

353
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,330
I don't think you need to talk to her.

354
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,440
No, I have to.

355
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,240
She came all the way for me.

356
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,690
She's probably wanna get back together with you.

357
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,370
I think she knows that at the end, there's only you who treats her well.

358
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,050
Probably not.

359
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,660
What if she really asks you to go back to her?

360
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,490
You can't go back to her.

361
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,110
Don't you remember what she did to you?

362
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,180
Right. I'm not going back to her.

363
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,730
I know you won't, but your heart maybe not?

364
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,260
Right. I won't.

365
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,590
I will just go talk to her and go home. See you.

366
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,910
Gotta go.

367
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,050
You guys think he's okay?

368
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,850
I don't think so.

369
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,770
Do you wanna order anything?

370
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,390
No, I won't be here long.

371
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,970
I never saw you in a uniform like this before.

372
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,010
So unfamiliar.

373
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,450
Um. Probably.

374
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,330
You cut your hair?

375
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,590
Um. I did cut it a little.

376
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,060
Does it look weird?

377
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,600
No, it suits you.

378
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,710
Thank you.

379
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:56,650
You need to talk to me with something?

380
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
Well...

381
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,080
I already broke up with Temp.

382
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,080
He cheated on me like you said.

383
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,350
You punched him because of this reason, right?

384
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,960
It's already in the past.

385
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,210
Let's not talk about it.

386
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,360
I'm sorry

387
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,770
for not believing you in the first place.

388
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,840
There's only you who wish the best for me.

389
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,970
Um... Never mind.

390
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,290
I heard that Temp also transferred to other university.

391
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,210
What did you do to him?

392
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,450
A person like me?
How can I do anything to anyone?

393
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,250
Most that I can do is to punch him.

394
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,920
If it's not you, then who did?

395
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,400
North...

396
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,810
I know that this is bad to say it...

397
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,970
but...

398
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,920
do you...

399
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,380
wanna start thing over again between us?

400
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,500
Can you give me another chance?

401
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,450
Please don't.

402
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,930
It's better this way.

403
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,470
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,300
I didn't expect you to be this cold to me.

405
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,350
I get it.

406
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,630
If you don't have anything else to talk, I'll go.

407
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,930
Oh hey how come you're here?

408
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,630
I followed you.

409
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,370
So what..?

410
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,010
She wants to get back together with you?

411
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,700
Are you going to?

412
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,550
I understand.

413
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,230
Eventhough we don't want you to do that,

414
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,240
but it's your life.

415
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,420
I'm not gonna do that.

416
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,950
Oh.

417
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,950
So what's the matter then?

418
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,510
I...

419
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,230
just feel weird.

420
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,520
Previously...

421
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,990
I couldn't bear just to think about her...

422
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,570
but when she asked to get back together,

423
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,600
I actually rejected her.

424
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,830
I don't think it's weird.

425
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,930
That means
you don't have feelings for her anymore.

426
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,670
Or...

427
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,610
there's someone who you have more feelings for.

428
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,860
Sit sit.

429
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,080
It's time to reveal your student mentor.

430
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,080
If you already know your mentors,

431
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,940
please get up and go see them.

432
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,980
Do you know yours?

433
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,110
Not yet.

434
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,950
Me neither.

435
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,020
Me too.

436
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,930
Shit. What are we gonna do?

437
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,280
Please, those who got punished, move to the side.

438
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,270
Yeah.

439
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,250
What the hell is that, Ter?

440
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,500
Eggplant devil?

441
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,400
Yeah. It's so itchy because of these leaves.

442
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,640
The eggplant. Can I take a picture with you?

443
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,660
- Me?
- Yes.

444
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,240
Sure.

445
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,390
- Both of you also.
- Oh ok.

446
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

447
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,830
- Ter.
- Huh?

448
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,000
- Your doctor is here.
- Huh?

449
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,150
How come you’re here?

450
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,290
Can I take a picture with you?

451
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,880
Sure.

452
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,780
3 2 1

453
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,990
He’s so handsome.

454
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,750
You’re not jealous at all?
Having a hot boyfriend like that?

455
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,890
No! We’re not boyfriends yet.

456
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,620
If I were you, I would be so damn jealous.

457
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,350
Thank you.

458
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:08,980
P’Hill.

459
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,890
I’m hungry already. Let’s go eat.

460
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,240
Sure. I will take you.

461
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,600
Yeah.

462
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,180
Let’s go.

463
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,580
What?

464
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,540
What about us?

465
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,670
He’s gone. You’ll be his substitute.

466
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,620
- Stand there. Let them take pictures.
- I might outshine him.

467
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,760
No.

468
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,850
Nong eggplant is so cute.

469
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,270
Stop teasing me.

470
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,190
I’m not.

471
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,780
I’m telling you the truth.

472
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,490
You have so many rashes.

473
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,980
Really?

474
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,770
I'll put some medicine on for you.

475
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,230
Sure.

476
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,850
Do not scratch.

477
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,820
It will get worse if you do.

478
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,110
This reminds me of that time…

479
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,160
When?

480
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,310
Well…

481
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,700
you used to clean the wound for me just like this.

482
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,070
Be careful.

483
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,220
Are you alright?

484
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,910
- I’m sorry.
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?

485
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,280
- I’m fine.
- Are you sure?

486
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,120
Yeah.

487
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,250
I will go talk to that motorcycle first.

488
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,760
Yes.

489
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,110
I’m sorry. Are you okay?

490
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,370
- Are you hurt somewhere?
- I’m fine.

491
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,640
What about Ter?

492
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,210
I’m fine.

493
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,040
But you’re bleeding.

494
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,270
Oh it’s just a little. I’m fine.

495
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:48,650
Do you wanna go clean the wound first?

496
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,140
Sure. I will clean it at home.

497
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,390
Where are we going?

498
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,310
Sit here. I will clean it for you.

499
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,850
Sure.

500
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,310
Does it hurt?

501
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,380
A little.

502
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,490
I’m so sorry.

503
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,040
And thank you so much for saving me.

504
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,260
You’re welcome.

505
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,590
Were you about to go home?

506
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,600
Yes, I am.

507
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,380
You go home so late.

508
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,000
I have to work at the library.

509
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,850
That’s why I go home a little late.

510
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,950
And you also. Why do you go home so late?

511
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,090
I have to study with my friends.

512
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,870
Wow.

513
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,200
That’s nice.

514
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,860
You are so hard-working.

515
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,500
Which class are you in?

516
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,760
Class 7.

517
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,370
Class 7...

518
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,210
You’re also a science student too?

519
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,290
Yes.

520
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,970
Is it difficult?

521
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,290
Kinda.

522
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,970
Especially those subjects that I’m not good at.

523
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,120
It’s even more difficult for me.

524
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,450
Which one that you're not good at?

525
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,280
There are…

526
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,960
Physics, Chemistry, Biology,

527
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,500
and also Math.

528
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,620
Aren’t those main science subjects?

529
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,680
They are.

530
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,220
What about you?

531
00:35:58,335 --> 00:36:00,470
Any subjects that you like in particular?

532
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,050
Me?

533
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,870
Nothing in particular.

534
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,540
How's your senior year?

535
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,670
Is it tough?

536
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,920
Yes when it’s close to the exams.

537
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,610
Oh.

538
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,980
That must be real tough for you.

539
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,100
And…

540
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,230
do you have any faculty in mind?

541
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,650
Which one that you would like to study?

542
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,580
I…

543
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,260
am not sure either.

544
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,330
Which one do you think suits me?

545
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,980
I don’t know.

546
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,120
Depends on what you’re good at.

547
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,530
Oh.

548
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:15,410
I think I know which one suits you.

549
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,900
I think...

550
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,570
you should become a doctor.

551
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,730
Really?

552
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,020
You know what you're doing.

553
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,540
Also very good at small talk.

554
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,160
Come on. Almost done.

555
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:37,630
Yes.

556
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,990
You're right.

557
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,520
And now you really become a doctor.

558
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:01,410
Doesn't matter it's back then or today...

559
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,650
you still make me worry as usual.

560
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,140
You're such a complaining doctor.

561
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,130
See.

562
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,490
You need to let me look after you forever.

563
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,560
Sure.

564
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,620
P'Hill.

565
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,480
Yes?

566
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,790
I need to ask you something.

567
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,710
Sure.

568
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,380
So...

569
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,240
about back then...

570
00:38:45,335 --> 00:38:46,910
when you disappeared from me.

571
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,330
Can you tell me what happened?

572
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,390
I don't know where to start.

573
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,130
About...

574
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,830
your grandmother, right?

575
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,940
How do you know?

576
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,200
My friends told you?

577
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,840
Please don't be mad at them.

578
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,740
They're so worried about you.

579
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,140
Please don't be mad at them. Please please.

580
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,310
I'm not.

581
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:38,930
That day was when everything started.

582
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,260
Ter.

583
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,700
Yes? What's up?

584
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,830
Me and my friends will have a little party at my place.

585
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,300
Come join us.

586
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,720
Can I?

587
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,830
Yes, of course.

588
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,210
Ahh.

589
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,670
But I will have to pick up Christ first.

590
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,480
Can I take her with me?

591
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,610
Sure.

592
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,610
Okay.

593
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,160
Just a blink of an eye,
you're now graduating.

594
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,870
Congratulations.

595
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,560
Thank you.

596
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,090
Yeah.

597
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,020
You're here.

598
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,020
Hello, P'Hill.

599
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,970
Hi Christmas.

600
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,300
Here. This is my present.

601
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,390
Don't forget me when you're in university.

602
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,460
Thank you.

603
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:01,560
What about you?
Anything for me?

604
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,840
Yes actually.

605
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,700
But I will give it to you later.

606
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,810
Umm okay. Come on in.

607
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,320
Cheers.

608
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,860
Yayy~

609
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,480
Christ. Would you like to try?

610
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,080
I will drink for her.

611
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,050
Let's take pictures.

612
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,570
Come on.

613
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,590
So cute. Here.

614
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:00,350
So cute.

615
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,860
I'm gonna use the restroom.

616
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,430
I'll be back.

617
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,260
P'Hill.

618
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,770
Yes?

619
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,010
A present for you.

620
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:44,770
Thank you.

621
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,160
I will keep it really well.

622
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,580
Yeah.

623
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,570
P'Hill. Please don't forget me.

624
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,940
I won't.

625
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,070
I promise.

626
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,300
Promise.

627
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:43,900
P'.

628
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,440
I...

629
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,240
I actually...

630
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:52,170
have had a crush on you for a very long time.

631
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,520
You're mine now.

632
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:58,180
Ter.

633
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,230
- Dad.
- Shut up!

634
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,300
Just discuss this at home.

635
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,150
Sir.

636
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,860
It's my fault.

637
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,780
Really?

638
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,450
Dad don't.

639
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:24,430
- Stop!
- Go. Go home.

640
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,060
P'Hill.

641
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,050
Let's go.

642
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,630
Where is that boy?

643
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,270
His dad took him home.

644
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,950
It was you, right?

645
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:03,380
What did I do?

646
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,450
Are you saying that
his father just dropped by out of the blue?

647
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,360
I thought you said...

648
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:13,810
you're gonna have a graduation party
with your friends?

649
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,620
- How come that boy was here?
- Why can't I invite a junior friend?

650
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,300
A junior friend?

651
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:25,310
You brought him here
to do some nasty stuff under this roof.

652
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,870
How dare you say that?

653
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:31,300
You said you're gonna apply for medical school
and get in with the 1st rank?

654
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,790
Why are you wasting your time...

655
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,450
- with that boy?
- They're not relevant.

656
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:40,430
I will get in with the 1st rank score for you anyway.

657
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:42,560
We will see.

658
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,790
But to punish you,

659
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,180
you're now grounded.

660
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,140
Cannot go out without someone with you.

661
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,110
You're not allowed to use your phone.

662
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,500
Cannot contact that boy or go see him ever again.

663
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,730
Grandpa!

664
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,870
But if you resisted,

665
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,760
I cannot promise you...

666
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:07,070
...that the boy is gonna live his life peacfully.

667
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,140
Sir.

668
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,910
Misses got hit by a car.
She's now at the hospital.

669
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:19,940
Grandma...

670
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:44,910
She'll be okay.

671
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,920
She'll wake up soon.

672
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,630
Oh mom already finished her work in Singapore.

673
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,820
I guess she'll arrive this evening.

674
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,580
What about grandpa?

675
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,210
He won't eat. He cannot sleep.

676
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,780
He's with grandma all day.

677
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,200
He won't go anywhere either.

678
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,000
Oh and I talked to grandpa already.

679
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,000
We might have to take grandma back to Chiang Mai.

680
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,790
Can you live here alone?

681
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:32,560
I will go with you guys.

682
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,030
What about university?

683
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,610
I'll just go to university there.

684
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,650
About the promise that you made with him
regarding the 1st class score,

685
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:50,140
just forget it.

686
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:51,930
Don't think about it too much.

687
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,180
No.

688
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,120
I will make it happen.

689
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:07,060
I'll talk to grandpa for you.

690
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:08,940
About the grounding,

691
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:13,220
he's probably busy with grandma.

692
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,740
He won't have the time to pay attention to you.

693
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,770
Uncle.

694
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,500
Yes?

695
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,260
Can you please take me to this one place?

696
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,610
But he already ordered me to take you straight home.

697
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:43,760
Please help me for once.

698
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:50,460
Sure.

699
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,470
Ter.

700
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,030
Ter.

701
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,450
Ter.

702
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,750
Sir.

703
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,190
Is Ter home?

704
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,830
Why are you here?

705
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,350
Go back.

706
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:15,480
But...

707
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,870
I need to talk to him.

708
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,620
He doesn't wanna see you.

709
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,460
Sir but...

710
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,930
Just go.

711
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,220
Remember this...

712
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:31,060
you're not welcomed here.

713
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,250
Don't let me see your face again.

714
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,660
Go!

715
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,940
Sir!

716
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,500
Sir!

717
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,920
Let's just go.

718
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:54,010
If your grandpa doesn't see you at home,
we'll be in trouble.

719
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,630
Dad never told me you came to see me.

720
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:51,120
I tried to contact you so many times,
but you didn't answer me.

721
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,730
Until I thought you really don't wanna see me anymore.

722
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,580
Cause before that...

723
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,720
you just disappeared.

724
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,730
I thought you dumped me.

725
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,470
I would never leave you, Ter.

726
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,170
I'm sorry.

727
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,640
I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

728
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,250
I never knoew that you were gone cause...

729
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,370
you were grounded.

730
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,800
and you grandma too.

731
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,380
What about you?

732
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,850
Your dad looked so angry that day.

733
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:46,170
Well...

734
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,360
Yes.

735
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,410
We got into a big fight after we got home.

736
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,680
After that, I rarely speak to my dad.

737
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,150
I'm sorry.

738
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:02,810
No.

739
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,920
It's not your fault entirely.

740
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,860
It's me...

741
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,030
that I had no idea what you had to go through.

742
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,790
I actually never really told you the truth.

743
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,330
I just left things unclear until today.

744
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,620
But from now on...

745
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,100
I won't let go of your hands anymore.

746
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,500
Me too.

747
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,510
Where is my phone?

748
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,990
Where is it?

749
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,820
Are you looking for this?

750
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,400
You never took care of your stuff.

751
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,260
I dropped it?

752
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,020
Thank you.

753
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,250
Shoul I give it back to you or not?

754
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,940
Can I have my phone back?
I'm going home.

755
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,640
Give it to me.

756
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,560
I'm not fooling around.

757
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,470
I'm not also

758
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:24,770
- P'!
- I told you already. Don't let me have the chance.

759
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,750
What are you doing!?
Stop!

760
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,110
Stop!

761
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,950
Why are you playing hard to get?

762
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,310
Hey!

763
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,490
- You think you can get away from me?
- Hey! Let go of me! What are you doing?

764
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,380
What am I doing?

765
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,840
I'm gonna make you mine.

766
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,050
Let see...

767
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,200
whether you will have a smart mouth again this time?

768
00:57:19,055 --> 00:57:20,580
Hey!

769
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,420
What!?

770
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:25,610
Step back.

771
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:27,190
Turn around.

772
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:28,765
Put your hands on the wall.

773
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,660
P'Jo.

774
00:57:44,555 --> 00:57:46,100
Take care of the rest.

775
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,040
P'Jo.

776
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,890
I told you not to work here anymore.

777
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,940
I can get up myself.

778
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:04,175
North.

779
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,420
Don't be stubborn with me.

780
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,230
Why you're so nice to me?

781
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,770
Because I like you.

782
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:31,335
Can I kiss you?

783
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,500
I won't let you work anymore.

784
00:58:35,565 --> 00:58:38,345
Please let me. I still have a lot to pay you back .

785
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,535
If you kiss me I give you 1,000 Baht.

786
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:42,120
But if you give me more than that...

787
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,920
Sir, your grandpa needs to meet you now.
