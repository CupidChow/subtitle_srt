1
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:19,638
Hey but my relatives just opened a new place.
They're hiring too.

2
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:21,988
- Are you interested?
- I'm in.

3
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,650
North. I'm gonna be honest with you.

4
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,186
You work in a bar, go home late at night.

5
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:27,703
I actually don't want you to go.

6
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:30,278
You're not seeing anyone? Then I can hit on you then?

7
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:31,269
Excuse me.

8
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:34,517
Sneaking out to work late,
drives my friend crazy this much?

9
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,114
You guys don't understand.

10
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:38,635
Is it that difficult to say that you care?

11
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:42,121
- Dude! Did you see this?
- Huh?

12
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,222
Ter!

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,170
Ter!

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,460
What?
You scared me.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,720
Check this out.

16
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,380
P'Jo said he's waiting for me out front.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,420
Huh!?
You invited him over?

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,020
Why would I do that?

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,020
- And why is he here?
- How am I supposed to know?

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,140
Why are you here?

21
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,460
I'm here to get you.
I give you 10 mins.

22
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,200
Can I shower first?

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,650
Sure. Pack for a sleepover too.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
Sleepover?

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,710
Dude.
Ask him where is he taking you?

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,790
Wait...where are you taking me?

27
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,570
Ter.
He read but doesn't text me back.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,810
What should I do?

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,570
What are you gonna do now?

30
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,510
Can I say no to him?

31
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,630
North...
do you think you have that kind of option hmm?

32
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,380
Do I have to come up there to get you?

33
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,950
He's rushing me now.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,920
Fine fine. Let me just shower for a sec.

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,800
- Ter.
- Huh?

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,980
Put my stuff in the bagpack for me.
I have to shower.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,830
But...what stuff do you want me to pack?

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,380
Anything. Just pack for me.

39
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,370
This one first then.

40
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,370
What do you need, North?

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,660
Uniform, books, and...

42
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,290
Err...some shoes for me too.

43
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,230
And what else?

44
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,340
Whatever you think it's necessary.

45
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,960
Here.

46
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,200
- My books?
- Already in there.

47
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,270
- Portable charger?
- All good.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,680
- I also pack sunscreen and repellent for you.
- Huh?

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,640
Why did you pack me those?

50
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,360
Cause you said
you have no idea where's he taking you.

51
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,960
You have to be prepared for all kinds of situation.

52
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,100
That's crazy.
I have a class tomorrow. How can I go out of town?

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,590
You never know.

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
Just take it.

55
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,420
Hurry up.

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,120
He's rushing me again.

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm gonna go now.
See you.

58
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,590
Will you be alright?

59
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,910
Weird.

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,490
This is so not you.

61
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,290
You would normally be so happy
if I go out with P'Johan.

62
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,010
Huhh. Why?
Are you sad that I don't ship you guys?

63
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,890
It's not like that.

64
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,330
It's not that I don't ship,
but I'm just worried for you.

65
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,980
If there's anything happened,
first one to call is me. Okay?

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,360
Sure.
You'll be the first person I'll call.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,900
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

68
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,560
Why so slow?

69
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,500
I tried my best.

70
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,280
Get in the car.

71
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,750
- Where are you taking me?
- I said get the car.

72
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,070
Buckle up too.

73
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,430
Your phone?
Do you want me to pick up?

74
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,760
Who is it?

75
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,100
May.

76
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,760
You don't have to answer.

77
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,860
It's fine. I can answer it.

78
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,750
Hello?

79
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,210
Jo why don't you text me back?

80
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,840
He's busy. He's driving.

81
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,430
And who is this?

82
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,970
You probably don't know me.

83
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,000
Can you put him on speaker? I wanna talk to him.

84
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,590
You can actually talk to me.

85
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,590
P'Johan is driving.

86
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,750
Can you ask him why he doesn't text me back?

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,910
P'Jo.

88
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,300
- Why don't you text back?
- You don't text me back. Not me.

89
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,460
No!

90
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,200
It's she who asked why you don't text her back.

91
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,990
He's busy.

92
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,130
Busy? Working?

93
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,300
and why did I see him at the bar?

94
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,830
I don’t wanna be over the line, cause we made an agreement.

95
00:06:39,346 --> 00:06:40,023
But it’s like…

96
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,400
P’May…

97
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,760
Huh?

98
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,730
You should stop talking to P’Jo.

99
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,870
And start talking to me instead.
I’m still single.

100
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,550
Wait up.

101
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,540
Are you mad at me or something?

102
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,330
Are you jealous?

103
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,460
Well…

104
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,360
I was just kidding.

105
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,520
Yeah I'm jealous.

106
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,180
Wait for me.

107
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,210
Where have you been?

108
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,470
I…

109
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,170
- was out side.
- Where?

110
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,310
- To a restaurant.
- With who?

111
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,600
With friends but…

112
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,050
You probably don’t know them.

113
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,020
Is he gonna put more debt on my account?

114
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,410
Hey!

115
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,410
Where is it?

116
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,090
What are you doing?

117
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,040
Looking for my wallet.

118
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,940
But I think I forgot it at home.

119
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,030
You forgot your wallet...

120
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,340
But you brought a mosquito repellent?

121
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,000
Well…

122
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,790
I thought
you might take me camping on the mountain.

123
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,160
So I brought this just in case.

124
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,550
And..

125
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,750
you’re not working.

126
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,560
Why are you asking?

127
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,490
Cause…

128
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,360
I thought that you want me to hang with you
while you work.

129
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,300
Then why am I here?

130
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,430
Am I right?

131
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,900
Err…so…

132
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,710
Do you have a blanket?

133
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,780
I'm kinda...

134
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,890
sleepy already.

135
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,730
It’s in the closet.

136
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,870
Sure.

137
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,270
Why don't you go the other way?

138
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,380
What?
Are you gonna sleep on the couch?

139
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,900
Yeah.

140
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,980
And…

141
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,260
you think you’ll be okay there?

142
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,260
Sure.

143
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,620
This couch...

144
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,130
...is softer than the cutting board
back in my dorm.

145
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,120
He's giving me headache.

146
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,460
What’s wrong with him?

147
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,000
Amen.

148
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,270
- Nao. On your right.
- Yeah yeah. I saw.

149
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,030
- Help me.
- Yeah I’m coming.

150
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,180
Yeah like that.

151
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,480
Damn-- Ugh.

152
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,540
Hello what’s up?

153
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,830
Why are you calling me so late?

154
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
I know that you’re still awake.
Help.

155
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,530
I can’t sleep.

156
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,340
Hey hey, Suer.
I got shot.

157
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,580
There!

158
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,580
Okay so what’s up?

159
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,580
Are you with Ger?

160
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,000
Who is it?

161
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,650
It’s me, Suer.
(Suer in Thai means tiger)

162
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,340
North, your best friend.

163
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,950
Stop messing with me.

164
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,520
My name is Tiger.

165
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,170
Wow. So I can’t call you that?

166
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,790
- But why…?
- North.

167
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,290
What is up with you?

168
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,190
You're talking too much.

169
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,580
I suddenly wanna see Friend Zone movie.

170
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,890
Should I ask Nao to go see it with me?

171
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
F*ck you, North.

172
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,790
Why?

173
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,390
Are you afraid that he’ll find out?

174
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,550
You stuck in a friend zone for years.
He probably knows by now.

175
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,140
If he were to find out,
it should be from me. Not you.

176
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,370
But…

177
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,420
If I got some green tea tomorrow,
I think that might be great.

178
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,260
Sure sir. I will buy one for you.

179
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,090
Then please shut up.

180
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,630
And never mentioned this again.

181
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,900
You know my secret
and now acting so big and cool.

182
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,610
Does that help me? No?

183
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,820
Cause I don’t understand.

184
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,320
What do you see in him?

185
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,540
How can you not see his cuteness?

186
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,370
But that’s good.
Just leave him be. Go away.

187
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,660
He’s not suspecting or anything
that you’re sneaking out to talk like this?

188
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,720
It’s because of you.

189
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,890
Just shush it.

190
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,810
And why are you calling?

191
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,110
I cannot sleep
cause I'm scared of creepy stuff.

192
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,410
I need to talk to someone.

193
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,610
You can talk to me.

194
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,180
No, I want to talk to my friend!

195
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,040
Now, I’m dead.

196
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,780
I’m sorry.

197
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,500
North, did he hang up?
Can I talk to him?

198
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,020
Here.

199
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,430
Hello?

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,540
What’s up?

201
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,840
I’m really scared man.

202
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,050
I cannot sleep.

203
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,020
I’m so anxious wherever I look.

204
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,950
I’m afraid that there might be…

205
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,950
Ghosts?

206
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,700
Damn it. Don’t say that!

207
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,030
What?
Aren’t you with Ter?

208
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,060
I’m actually at P’Johan’s condo.

209
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,410
I know what you’re thinking.

210
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,600
But it’s not like that.

211
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,640
I haven’t said anything.

212
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,110
And how come you ended up there?

213
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,900
It’s a long story.

214
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,820
I will tell you about it later.

215
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,370
Hey.
My battery is running low. Hang on a sec.

216
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,230
Shit!

217
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,330
What?

218
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,540
My uniform is so crinkled.

219
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,130
I thought something bad happened.

220
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,560
Then go iron it.

221
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,590
Whenever I iron it myself,
it always end up crinkled.

222
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,340
You are at his place,
then you can borrow his jacket.

223
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,970
I can’t.
I do not dare to do it.

224
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Then you just wear your crinkled shirt like that.

225
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,510
What are you doing?

226
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,010
Ghost. Ghost. Ghost.

227
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,310
Ugh!!

228
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,020
You scared me.

229
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,800
You’re still awake?

230
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,790
Cause you’re loud.

231
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,240
I’m sorry.

232
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,550
Dude I gotta go.

233
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,130
I cannot sleep.

234
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,660
Yes?

235
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,710
Can you fix me something to eat?

236
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,970
Are you like this often? Cannot sleep?

237
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,740
Sometimes.

238
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,740
And what do you usually do?

239
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,290
I'd work until I'm tired
and fall asleep.

240
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,290
Why would you choose to be in meds school...

241
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,400
even though you have a family business?

242
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,220
My mom applied it for me.

243
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,800
And I got in.

244
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,800
So I have to take it.

245
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,500
You're probably always tired huh?

246
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,350
I can handle it.

247
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,010
Do you want some warm milk?

248
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,340
I will heat it up for you.

249
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,790
Milk and some honey.

250
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,510
I heard that drinking milk with honey before bed
will help you to have a better sleep.

251
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,070
You always make things so sweet, don't you?

252
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,610
Huh?

253
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,200
Me?

254
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,970
How do you know?

255
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,150
If there's nothing else,
I'll go to bed now.

256
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,620
Good night.

257
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,570
Where are you taking me?
Hey wait!

258
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,110
Sleep here.

259
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,720
It's alright.
I can sleep outside.

260
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,520
You were loud when you were outside.

261
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,980
I can't sleep.

262
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,520
Wake up.

263
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,330
Morning already?

264
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,730
Almost 7am now. I'm running late already.

265
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,260
7am?

266
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,100
Why are you up so early?

267
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,580
Go change. Hurry up.

268
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:25,170
I have class in the afternoon.

269
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,870
I will wait outside. Don't be long.

270
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,800
I'm so sleepy.

271
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,830
Wanna borrow mine, right?

272
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,990
Oh thank you.

273
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,950
You're done.
We can go now.

274
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,940
Why is he in such a rush?

275
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,950
- Why are we taking this one today?
- I'm in a hurry.

276
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,360
Here.

277
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,720
Why are you so slow?

278
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,060
Hop on.

279
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,990
Hold on tight.

280
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,190
You're that scared?

281
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,390
Look at the way you drive.

282
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,800
- Right. I'm gonna go to class now.
- Hey and...

283
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,710
What about me?

284
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,580
I have class in the afternoon.

285
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,150
Do you wanna go to my class with me?

286
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,450
What am I gonna do in your class?
No.

287
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,150
I'll call my friends to come get me.

288
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,090
Fine. I'll go now.

289
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,240
P'...you forgot your money in your jacket.

290
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,200
You can keep it.

291
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,870
Keep it?
Why would you do that?

292
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,650
You forgot your wallet, didn't you?

293
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,430
You're really giving it to me?
You're not gonna add to my debt, right?

294
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,000
North?

295
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,030
Last night was not enough?
You have to wake me in the morning too?

296
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,860
I don't know who else to call.

297
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,360
So what's up?

298
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,550
Dude.

299
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,550
Can you help me with something?

300
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,470
What is it?

301
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,990
Pick me up.

302
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,450
P'Johan left me here on campus.

303
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,450
I have class in the afternoon though.

304
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,850
Wait.

305
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,950
Shit!

306
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,320
Shit!

307
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,760
What the hell, Nao?
That hurts.

308
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,040
- I'm back.
- What's going on?

309
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,220
Suer talked in his sleep
and put his arm around me.

310
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,150
That's why
I was uncomfortable all night.

311
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,360
But I kicked him out of the bed already.

312
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,360
Calm down.

313
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,150
Get up here.

314
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,140
What time do you have class?

315
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,880
9am why?

316
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,300
Can you go pick North up
from meds faculty?

317
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,500
Why do I have to do that? Tell me?

318
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,810
Did you hear that?

319
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,360
He said
'Why do I have to do that? Tell me?'

320
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:13,130
Ask him for me
'Are you sure you said that?'

321
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,740
'Or he wants me to tell?'

322
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,120
He said...

323
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,270
'Are you sure you said that?'

324
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,150
'Or you want him to tell?'
Tell what?

325
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,500
What are you guys talking about?

326
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,100
Let me talk to him.

327
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,980
What's up with you guys?

328
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,720
North.

329
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,170
What a terrible liar.

330
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,810
Normally I'm pretty good at it,
if you do not call.

331
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,910
My poor little Tiger.

332
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,840
Don't forget about my green tea.

333
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,280
Sure. I will buy it for you sir.

334
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,290
I will go pick you up.

335
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,930
Here.

336
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,200
Hop on shithead.

337
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,540
Wear this too.

338
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,590
What are you looking at?
Just hop on.

339
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,310
Go.

340
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:18,560
So? How was it this morning
when you got kicked out of bed?

341
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,560
It's like...

342
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,150
a cat just kicked me.

343
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,150
Please.

344
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,360
Captain of the football team.
Prom king of Engineering.

345
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,340
You're nuts.

346
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,900
It hurts. Why would you ask that?

347
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,630
- It's because of you.
- Who in the world would think...

348
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,970
that you'll be this pathetic.
Sleep talking and then huged him like that?

349
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,920
Just wait for my turn.

350
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm looking forward to my turn too, my friend.
Go.

351
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,990
Go buy me green tea.

352
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,700
- I wanna drink some green tea.
- Yes sir.

353
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,390
Prang: North. What did you do to Johan?

354
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,320
Why?

355
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,150
Johan added 3 more debts on your account.

356
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,330
Huh!?

357
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,970
3 times?

358
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,470
Yes. That's why I ask what did you do?
If you'd like to trasnfer the money, just let me know.

359
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,550
What did I do to make him added more?

360
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,790
P' Why did you do that to me?

361
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,500
Here.

362
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,310
Thank you.

363
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:35,130
Just leave it right there.

364
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,100
- I'm gonna go to my class now.
- You can go. I'll have mine in the afternoon.

365
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,790
- Afternoon?
- Um.

366
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,790
And where will you be?
You wanna come with me?

367
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,370
No, you can go. I'll be fine.
Don't worry.

368
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,030
You think I care about you?

369
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,230
Just go away.

370
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,540
Ger.

371
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,220
Thank you.

372
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,080
Are you really gonna read and not reply?

373
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,270
About the additional debts?

374
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,510
You gave me money
and added more debt like this?

375
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,060
Jo.

376
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,110
You're not going to have your coffee
from engineering today?

377
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,110
With that face,
he probably already met his nong in the morning.

378
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,570
Ton.

379
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,390
Your friend is about to quit being a player.

380
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,670
But he's so tight-lipped
...unlike his actions.

381
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,050
That's not surprising that he's tight-lipped.

382
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,970
But I'm just wondering,

383
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,900
he's not like this with the others,

384
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:53,090
But why this one?

385
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,090
To be honest, it's a long story.

386
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,260
Like...

387
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,340
He’s the type that Jo has a soft spot for.

388
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,530
How?

389
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,100
All weak in his knee.

390
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,200
Like more than just a type.

391
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,340
Hill. You're talking too much now.

392
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,530
Don't get me started with your story and Ter's.

393
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,050
Wow what is it?

394
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,600
Hey.

395
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm here to interview you.
Do you have a min?

396
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,930
Sure.

397
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,740
- Should we do it there?
- Okay.

398
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,270
What are you guys doing?

399
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,290
- Working on the report.
- Oh.

400
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,470
It's not just a report.

401
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,550
More like someone is missing someone.

402
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,250
Who is it?

403
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,900
You cannot tell us, right?

404
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,750
Maybe I will tell, when I'm successful.

405
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,240
Do you think that person is watching this right now?

406
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,610
Probably.

407
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,770
Would you like to say something to that person?

408
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,020
I miss you.

409
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,770
Which faculty is that person studying?
Can you tell us?

410
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,910
Do you wanna guess?

411
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,650
Meds students have to be with nurses for sure.

412
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,460
No.

413
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,160
Then management?

414
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,000
No.

415
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,140
Engineering?

416
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,390
No, I'll give you one more try.

417
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,370
I'll just randomly guess.

418
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,180
Vet student?

419
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,830
Correct.

420
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,880
We finally got a clue guys!

421
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,830
Last question
before I let you continue your study.

422
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,670
If you made it with this relationship,
what would you like to tell this person?

423
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,150
I'll do my best to take care of you.

424
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,770
Why am I not that person?

425
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,680
Thank you so much. Thank you.

426
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,430
Thank you.
Let's go.

427
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,370
I'll do my best to take care of you~

428
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,740
- I'll do my best to take care of you.
- Oh it has to be that tone?

429
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,770
Ter.

430
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,750
Hello P'Thunmild.

431
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,980
You're here for some drinks?

432
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,420
Yes.

433
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:52,920
Can I talk to you?

434
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:58,970
Sure.

435
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,310
How are you doing?

436
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,200
I'm good.

437
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,670
What about you? How are you?

438
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,150
Not so good.

439
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,000
It has always been you, hasn't it?

440
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,800
You know that I have a crush on Hill, right?

441
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,140
Always have.

442
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,210
Since high school.

443
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,090
But since then and until today...

444
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,190
Hill has never opened up his heart to anyone.

445
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,580
Except you.

446
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,130
But there's one thing I don't understand.

447
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,720
Why did you dump Hill?

448
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,520
I dumped him?

449
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,810
It was after the last orientation.

450
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,560
Hill was very sad.

451
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,380
P'Hill was the one who left me.

452
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,180
Hill left you?

453
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,590
Yes.

454
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,290
No way.

455
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:36,990
You didn't know about Hill's grandma, did you?

456
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,220
Hill.

457
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,930
That's enough.

458
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,300
I know about your grandma.

459
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,100
It's okay.

460
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,360
Everything will be okay.

461
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,820
Thanks.

462
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,750
Let's go.

463
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,840
Can I stay a little longer?

464
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,840
You have drunk a lot already.

465
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,230
He's gone.

466
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,980
He left me.

467
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,590
What about P'Hill's grandma?
What happened?

468
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,600
It's nothing.

469
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,330
There's something I don't know, right?

470
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,080
Why he has never told me anything?

471
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,030
I don't know what actually happened...

472
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,900
...between you and Hill.

473
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,500
But what could be the reason...

474
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,650
for someone to keep hurtful feelings to himself,

475
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,270
if it's not because...

476
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,380
to protect someone he loves the most.

477
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,740
Would you excuse me?
I have to go.

478
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,940
Good bye.

479
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,310
Yes?

480
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,530
Are you done with your class?

481
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:09,990
I am.

482
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:13,550
I'll pick you up.
You have to work today, right?

483
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,270
Yes.

484
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,110
I'm working at the union right now.
Wait for a min. okay?

485
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,980
Oh I'm nearby.

486
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,760
I will talk to you then.

487
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,260
Sure.

488
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,920
Hey where are you going?

489
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,490
To see Ter.

490
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,230
Hey wait Hill.

491
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,230
You brought us here to work on the report,

492
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,220
but now you're leaving to see Ter?

493
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,220
- Um.
- You're just gonna dtich us like this?

494
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,440
No, I won't be long.

495
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,550
Oh and do you want me
to pick up your guy?

496
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,000
No.

497
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,690
Stop right there, Mr. president.
Can I have a moment?

498
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,270
Professor is looking for you.

499
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,450
Will it take long?
Ter is waiting for me.

500
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,700
Not long. Just a min.

501
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,180
Let's go.

502
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,690
Let's go.

503
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,790
Text me when you're done with your class.

504
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,770
X,Y what are these?

505
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,780
Can you explain what is it?

506
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,890
P'Bua.

507
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,520
- Oh hi, Ter!
- Hello.

508
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,370
What's up?

509
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,200
Have you seen P'Hill?

510
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,310
Hill?

511
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,820
I saw him just now with his med friends.

512
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,820
He's probably at the union.

513
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

514
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,200
Oh Ter.

515
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,700
Hi.

516
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,420
What are you guys doing here?

517
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,830
We're bored of our faculty.

518
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,650
Anyways...have you seen P'Hill?

519
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,890
Oh he just left not long ago.

520
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,710
A professor is looking for him.

521
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,480
He left with Peem just now.

522
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,480
But he'll be back soon.

523
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:36,710
Can I ask you guys something?

524
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,080
Um.

525
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,410
So...

526
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,730
can you tell me more
about P'Hill's grandparents?

527
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,890
I think...

528
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,130
...we should just tell him. It's already this far.

529
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,240
You think it's a good idea, Fah?

530
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,720
I think Hill is not going to like this.

531
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,070
He doesn't like to tell other people about his family.

532
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,650
He's not gonna tell even if I ask?

533
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,330
Hey it's not like that.

534
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,300
How can we explain?

535
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:15,210
Hill is always like this.

536
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,360
He likes to keep it to himself.

537
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,570
But what he wants from you...is to trust him.

538
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,760
When he's done dealing with his problems,
he'll come back to you.

539
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,690
Sure.

540
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,190
He keeps to himself like this...is not fair.

541
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,640
But...

542
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,260
what do you want to know about his grandparents?

543
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,270
Everything.

544
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,420
What should I know?

545
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,420
Have you met his grandpa?

546
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,670
Speaking about him gives me goosebump.

547
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,790
Did you know...

548
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,160
that his grandpa thinks
I'm gonna lie and steal money from Hill?

549
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:05,970
I was so upset.

550
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,170
I also have money, you know?

551
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:14,710
Wait Jo. I don't think his grandpa was afraid
that you're gonna take money from Hill.

552
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,390
Right?

553
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:19,520
But I think he's more afraid
that his grandson will turn out bad like you.

554
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,020
- What the f*ck?
- Um.

555
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,630
What about you, Arthit?
Any interesting story?

556
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,450
For sure. I do have some stories.

557
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,450
What story?

558
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:40,120
He said I'm a bad kid. Drinks and smokes.

559
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,690
Clubbing. Nightlife
...not suitable to be his gradson's friends.

560
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,970
- But he's right, isn't he?
- Hmm?

561
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,660
Just like that.

562
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:54,830
I think out of all of us,
there's only Fah that he likes.

563
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,740
Of course,
I'm such a good person.

564
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,590
His grandpa is not on a good term
with you guys?

565
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,220
Something like that.

566
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,830
He's a stubborn old man.

567
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,000
And he's like this with Hill's friends.

568
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,188
Cannot imagine what would it be like for Hill's lover.

569
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,460
But I think Hill is uncomfortable too.

570
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,790
He apologized to us for so many times.

571
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,210
So I think...

572
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:19,960
just forget his grandpa.

573
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,190
Hill is our friend. Not his grandpa.

574
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,670
And since his grandma got into a car accident,

575
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,310
seems like his conditions are getting worse everyday.

576
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,750
It's like he's putting his stress and rage on his grandson.

577
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,750
I feel bad for Hill too.

578
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,940
So his grandma got into a car accident?

579
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:44,580
It happened...I think last year.

580
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,810
His grandma got hit by a car.
Pretty severely injured.

581
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,410
They have to cure her abroad.

582
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,410
Still in a coma until today.

583
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,580
Not only his grandpa,

584
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,130
but both of his parents and Hill, himself...

585
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,860
kinda also lost their ways.

586
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,870
If his grandma wakes up,
everything might be better than this.

587
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,450
Hey!

588
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,490
We told him all of it.

589
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,690
Hill must be so pissed at me.

590
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,330
P'Jo.

591
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,300
Do you remember when exactly from last year
that all these happened?

592
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,730
Probably from February to March.
Around that.

593
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,340
After the last orientaton.

594
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,260
Ter.

595
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,330
Yes?

596
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,180
Shall we go?

597
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:45,550
Yes.

598
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,180
I'm gonna get going guys.

599
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,660
Bye.

600
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,410
- Gotta go.
- See you.

601
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:55,410
See you dude.

602
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,540
Ter.

603
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,000
Yes?

604
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,940
Is something wrong?

605
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,610
Nothing.

606
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,240
P'Hill.

607
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,560
Yes?

608
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,780
I will wait for you.

609
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,290
Whenever you're ready,
you can tell me everything.

610
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,370
Let's go.

611
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:51,860
Hey.

612
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,400
Where are you going?
Hey.

613
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,190
Jo.

614
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,960
North.

615
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,680
Can I borrow your jacket?

616
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,980
What jacket?

617
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,530
The one you're wearing. I'm cold.
&lt;i>(Nao in Thai means cold)&lt;/i>

618
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:24,900
Oh I'm North.
Nice to meet you.

619
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,360
Very funny.

620
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,470
Come on. I'm freezing here.

621
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,410
And why do I have to let you borrow?

622
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,980
Oh you're so protective huh?

623
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,510
- It's your boyfriend's jacket huh?
- Stop it.

624
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,720
Come on.
Just put it over the both of us.

625
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,110
- Why are you so pushy?
- Give it to me.

626
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:44,610
Why don't you borrow Ger's?

627
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,430
No, I don't wanna bug him.

628
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,190
Don't wanna bug him?

629
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:53,120
You just kicked him out of the bed this morning.

630
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,930
- I'll text him. Let me do it.
- North.

631
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,890
Stay still.

632
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,420
Come on. Give it to me.

633
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,210
I'll just borrow yours.

634
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,970
Just let me.

635
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,400
- We both can have each of the sleeve.
- Just wait.

636
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,010
Dude.

637
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,180
Can you pass this to Duennao?

638
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,760
That guy told me to give this to Duennao.

639
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,230
Oh thank you.

640
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,280
- You're always meddling..
- Hey.

641
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,650
You said you're cold.

642
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,190
We took his jacket.
Are you sure he's not cold?

643
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,770
It's fine. He likes cold.
(Cold = Nao in Thai)

644
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,720
I mean the weather.

645
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,060
What are you talking about?

646
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,260
Almost slip out.

647
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,910
Text me when you're done with your class.

648
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,040
Almost done.

649
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,010
Ger is not going back with you?

650
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:07,020
Computer engineering has another class.
Ger is not going back with you?

651
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,270
Computer engineering has another class.

652
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,560
Are you straight to work after this?

653
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,590
Yeah I have to.

654
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,790
You can do it man.
You fight for your life, but sometimes life fights you back.

655
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,980
- We're gonna go then.
- Yeah. See ya.

656
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,390
- Bye bye.
- Bye see you.

657
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:31,170
- See you.
- Bye.

658
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,910
What are you doing after class?

659
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,110
Probably will have some food
then go to work.

660
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,920
How are you going to work?

661
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,260
The purple bus.

662
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,430
Then come with me.

663
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,550
Look up.

664
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:28,866
Ja came to see me. She said she needs to talk.

665
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:32,637
Can we star over again?

666
00:48:33,863 --> 00:48:38,148
Can you tell me what happened when you disappeared from me?

667
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:42,648
Dude. I'm worried about you.

668
00:48:42,665 --> 00:48:44,524
I don't want you to work at that bar.

669
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:45,573
Oh hey.

670
00:48:46,946 --> 00:48:48,398
What are you gonna do to me?

671
00:48:48,437 --> 00:48:51,460
I'm gonna make you mine.
