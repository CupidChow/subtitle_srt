1
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,280
How about you and Johan?

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,580
It's good, I guess.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,640
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes?

4
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,260
Did you feel something to P'Johan?

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,680
At that moment, when you were disappeared.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,680
Can you tell me about it?

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,160
I have something to talk with Ter.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,160
Ter don't want to see you.

9
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,980
- Hey Ter!
- Oh hey, Duennao.

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,350
- You're here for lunch?
- Actually to buy one.

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,540
Oh Ter.

12
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,630
I saw Jah came to see North today.

13
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,820
JhaJah? North's ex-girlfriend?

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,700
Yes.

15
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,340
I think you should check on him.

16
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,030
I saw him looking so distracted walking out.

17
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,660
Um. Sure.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,550
- I'm gonna go now.
- Um.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,290
If not, Tiger might be starving and eat me alive.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,130
- See you.
- See you. Bye.

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,370
Is North gonna be okay?

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,130
North?

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,230
He'll be fine.

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,960
Right?

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,460
A person like him is not gonna die easily.

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,340
Let's go.

27
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,570
Jah came to see you?
Duennao told me.

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,600
Why did she come?
What did you guys discuss?

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,140
Nothing. Just talked a little.

30
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,310
What did you guys talk about?

31
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,510
Don't hide it from me.

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,700
Tell me.

33
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,890
Are you so free?

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,230
I just wanna know what did you guys talk about.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,600
She came to see you at the facullty?
What did she say?

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,720
Tiger. Are you free? Please answer me.

37
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,080
I don't have time for you.

38
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,650
Tiger. I suddenly feel uncomfortable.

39
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,010
It's like I keep someone's secret with me for so long.

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
But like I can't keep it to myself any longer.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,330
Why? It's not even your business.
What's the matter?

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,440
Can I call?

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,740
Yeah.

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,910
What's up?

45
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,290
I wanna ask you something.

46
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,540
I went to see Jah today, my ex-girlfriend.

47
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,900
She mentioned about Temp.

48
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,730
Did you do anything to him?

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,300
Why did he transfer?

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,000
So now you're pinning it on me?

51
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,260
Cause out of the people around me,
there's only you who's capable of doing this.

52
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,080
When he provoked Duennao,

53
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,140
I was so pissed.

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,380
I wanted get the footage from cctv,

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,820
but your Johan already took it first.

56
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,020
When I asked him,
he said he already handled it.

57
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,880
How? You tell me so vaguely.

58
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,390
I talked to him.

59
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,270
After that day, he did not stop.

60
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,570
He kept provoking Duennao.

61
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,590
So me and P'Jo just kinda made him expelled.

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,970
He already has bad history too.

63
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,270
So it was not difficult.

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,200
Are you done?
Why are you asking me so damn much?

65
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,470
So that happened?

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,860
Yeah cause he provoked my Duennao.

67
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,620
My love is great alright?

68
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,830
You're always so protective of him.

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,970
Does he have any idea?

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,000
What about you?

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,550
If you ex didn't show up,

72
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,540
you'll never know right?

73
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,600
How am I supposed to know?

74
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,840
Have you realized that you like him?

75
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,980
What?

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,090
Hey.

77
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,640
It's about your P'Jo.

78
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,790
What?

79
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,490
- I'm not...
- Fine. Fine. Okay.

80
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,420
Maybe you're not...

81
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,580
But for him...

82
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,870
you're driving him crazy.

83
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,670
You're not stupid, North.
I'm being serious.

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,780
You tell me all those stories...

85
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,680
are you telling me that he doesn't like you?

86
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,470
So?

87
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,470
-I...
- don't like him?

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
Right?

89
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,970
Yeah I never really think that way.

90
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,010
We just got to know each other.

91
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,240
He never said he liked or wanted to go out with me.

92
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,140
How can he like a person like me?

93
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,340
That's another thing to think about.

94
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,300
I...

95
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,580
don't wanna keep thinking too much.

96
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,330
Especially about love.

97
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,110
Fine fine.

98
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,400
You never thought of anything.

99
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,120
But...

100
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,650
But what if he does...

101
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,380
he does not think all day.

102
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,610
How?

103
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,980
I don't know.

104
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,380
I'm just babbling.

105
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,760
Bye. I don't wanna talk to you anymore.

106
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,580
Right. Right.

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Ugh. Ter.
Why do you wanna know so much?

108
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,760
Jah wanted to get back together.
Happy?

109
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,900
You're back?

110
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,160
Umm.

111
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,660
Why didn't you text me back? Hmm?

112
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,080
- I did.
- No, you haven't.

113
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,610
Look. Here. Here.

114
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,570
See. I already replied you recent messages.
See?

115
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,170
- Check this out.
- Umm. Where?

116
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,830
Shit!

117
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,090
- Shit?
- I replied the wrong chat.

118
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,220
Huh!? And who did you text?

119
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,040
P'Johan's.

120
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,340
When you throwing me a bunch of texts,
he kinda texted me too.

121
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,760
And what did you text him?

122
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,720
- Jah wanted to get back together.
- Huh!?

123
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,190
Jah wanted to get back together.

124
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,690
Did you reject her?

125
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,270
I did.

126
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,600
Are you sure?

127
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,350
Yeah. I no longer have feelings for her.

128
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,910
You should help me think
what am I gonna do with P'Johan.

129
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,270
Why? It's fine.

130
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,310
Or it's not?

131
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,410
a little?

132
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,440
I don't want him to know.

133
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,970
I'm afraid that
he might add more debt to my account.

134
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,890
Really?

135
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,650
More like you're afraid that he misunderstands?

136
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,680
Or...

137
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,900
To be honest, you just don't want him to find out cause you started to care huh?

138
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,310
Right?

139
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,420
Answer me, North!

140
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,360
Answer me now.

141
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
I...

142
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,510
I'm scared.

143
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,680
Scared of what?

144
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,680
Not sure that I can tell...

145
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,480
You can. I'm ready to listen.

146
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,900
Yeah something like that.

147
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,740
Shit!

148
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,220
I know that he took care of the damage from the bar.

149
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,050
But I didn't know that he took care of Temp issue too.

150
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,710
Dude! Ughh he's so into you.

151
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,030
He likes you!

152
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,580
Finally! My ship has sailed.

153
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,050
You're focusing on the wrong point.

154
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,280
Dude.

155
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,510
From now on, it's up to you.

156
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,090
I'm not feeling anything.

157
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,120
You're destroying my dream.

158
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,310
North.

159
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,780
Be honest with me.

160
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,940
Don't you feel nice,
when there's someone to protect you.

161
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,860
Who woud not
when there's someone to protect you?

162
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm blushing.

163
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,850
- I'm not gonna talk to you anymore. Gonna go work.
- Hey wait wait.

164
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,380
I'm not done.

165
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,140
What about that guy from the bar
you told me about?

166
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,530
How is it?

167
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,500
P'Day?

168
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,280
Yeah how is it?
Does he mess with you again?

169
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,520
Same.

170
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,390
I'm worried about you.

171
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,540
To be honest,
I really don't want you to work there.

172
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,270
Yeah.

173
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,070
I will be careful.

174
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,740
I'm gonna go get ready.

175
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,780
Yeah.

176
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,920
Oh you're here.

177
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,070
Hello.

178
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,580
Haven't seen you for so long.

179
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,810
I miss you.

180
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,970
Hey.

181
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,120
I'm not a dog.

182
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,060
What?

183
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,020
I cannot even touch you?

184
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,700
Why don't you let me flirt with you?

185
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,280
I already told you. I don't like this.

186
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,070
Oh North. Day.

187
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,660
Hello P'Paan.

188
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,690
Just wait until I have the chance.

189
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,040
I'm gonna go work now.

190
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,790
What's the matter?

191
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,810
Nothing. It's nothing.

192
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,220
I'm gonna go work too.

193
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,870
Where are you?

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,620
Jah wanted to get back together.
Happy?

195
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,410
I asked...where are you?

196
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,150
Forget it.

197
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,180
Explain.

198
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,540
Are you gonna tell me here
or you want me to open your mouth and tell me myself?

199
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,940
I'm telling you now. She's my ex.

200
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:49,720
Hello?

201
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,770
What about your ex?

202
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,740
She wants to get back together.

203
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,730
But I already rejected her.

204
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,370
The girl that got you in trouble?
What did she say?

205
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,510
She just broke up with her boyfriend
and she wanna get back together with me.

206
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,840
But I rejected her already.

207
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,500
I know. You told me. What else?

208
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,730
Nothing else.

209
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,270
That's it.

210
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,140
Anything else?

211
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,600
About Temp.

212
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,360
I got in a fight with him til he had to transfer.

213
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,660
Jah asked me
whether I have anything to do with it?

214
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,210
I said I did not.

215
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,550
So she suspects you and Ger instead.

216
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,350
Then I asked Ger.

217
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,860
Umm.
That shithead already told you huh.

218
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,820
Yes.

219
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,980
He said...

220
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,580
Hey.

221
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,240
What?

222
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,800
I haven't told anything.

223
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,060
You still send me even if it's blurry?

224
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,480
Cute. I won't show you the clear one. I'd be jealous.

225
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,340
I just wanna show you his cuteness.

226
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,280
Right. Whatever.

227
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,000
But good that you're texting me.
I need your advice.

228
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,420
No. I'm gone.

229
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,980
Hear me out. I've been so uncomfortable.

230
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,220
There's a guy from my work, wanted to go out with me.
I already rejected him.

231
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,760
But he keeps trying.
Lately, been so touchy too.

232
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,900
I already told him that I don't like it, but he wouldn't stop.

233
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,140
What should I do?

234
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,060
That's easy.

235
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,160
Just tell P'Jo.

236
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,280
Funny.

237
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,780
What can you do?

238
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,820
Hey North. Come help us.
Customers are here.

239
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,550
Sure.

240
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,440
Where's my phone?

241
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,810
Where is it?

242
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,680
Are you looking for this?

243
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,740
You do not take care of your stuff.

244
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,410
I dropped it?

245
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,030
Thank you.

246
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,420
Should I give it back to you or not?

247
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,940
Can I have my phone back please?
I'm about to go home.

248
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,840
Come get it.

249
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,690
I'm not playing wih you.

250
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,540
I'm also not.

251
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,720
- P'
- I told you already...don't let me have the chance.

252
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,780
Hey what are you doing!?

253
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,130
P' stop.

254
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,850
Stop, P'.

255
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,980
Why are you playing hard to get?

256
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,740
No. Stop.

257
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,100
Stop.

258
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,770
Hey!

259
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,820
- You think you can get away from me?
- Let go of me. What are you doing?

260
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,590
Are you scared?

261
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,380
But you were acting so cool,
arguing with me earlier.

262
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,940
It would be done easily
if you didn't play hard to get.

263
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,980
Now, I have to be physical with you.

264
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,160
What are you doing?
Let me go.

265
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,000
What am I doing?

266
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,140
I'm gonna make you mine.

267
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,430
Let's see whether you can argue with me further?

268
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,070
Hey.

269
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,140
What?

270
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,150
Step back.

271
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,000
Turn around. Hands on the wall.

272
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,180
P'Jo.

273
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,110
Take care of the rest.

274
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,560
P'Jo.

275
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,490
I told you not to work here anymore.

276
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,690
I can get up myself.

277
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,120
North.

278
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't be stubborn with me.

279
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,890
Here it is, Mr.Johan.

280
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,770
Do you want me to take care of him?

281
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,390
So you can rest.

282
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,910
It's okay.

283
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,520
I will do it. You can go rest.

284
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,670
You're awake.

285
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,850
How are you feeling?

286
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,410
Still hurt?

287
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,290
Not anymore.

288
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,520
And...

289
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,910
Mr.Johan just left.

290
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,650
The moment he saw you woke up,
he just left.

291
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,800
Even he was with you all night.

292
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,060
He was here with me all night?

293
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,430
Yes.

294
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,950
I wanted to take care of you myself,
but he wouldn't let me.

295
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,130
He wanted to be with you himself.

296
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,390
Did he say anything else?

297
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,050
Oh.

298
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,770
Not really.

299
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,680
But his facial expression was not so good.

300
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,020
I've never seen him this angry before.

301
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,530
He can be frustrated sometimes,

302
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,450
But angry lilke this,

303
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,320
I've never seen before.

304
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,320
Really?

305
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,160
He left
because he probably don't wanna see you right now.

306
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,290
He's probably too angry to see you.

307
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,420
But also...

308
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,850
too worried...

309
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,930
to leave.

310
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,320
I will go prepare you some food.

311
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,860
Oh and these medicines, he prepared it for you.

312
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,930
Take it before the meal please.

313
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,940
- I will leave it here.
- Sure. Thank you.

314
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,240
I...

315
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,060
...don't know.

316
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,030
I don't even know myself.

317
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,140
But if one day I really fall in love with someone,

318
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,000
you know that I am not a complicated person.

319
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,100
I will do my best to show them.

320
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,120
I think..

321
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,290
I also don't see P'Johan with anyone either.

322
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,840
He might really like you one day.

323
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,850
Why don't you try to open your heart for him?

324
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,760
Please try.

325
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,330
There's nothing wrong with that.

326
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,100
Where are you going sir?

327
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,610
I'm about to bring you your food.

328
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,790
Er...

329
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,780
can you take me to P'Johan please?

330
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,850
I think...

331
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,710
you better not see him right now.

332
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,820
No one's dare to see him when he's angry.

333
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,660
But...

334
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,970
I really need to talk to him.

335
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,280
P'Johan.

336
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,020
P'Johan.

337
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,750
P'Johan.

338
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,990
I have something I need to talk to you.

339
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,420
Are you in there?

340
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,470
Aunty Da.

341
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,360
Yes, Mr.Johan?

342
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,710
Can you take him back to his room?

343
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,410
- Let's go. We should go.
- Wait a minute.

344
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,680
P'Johan.

345
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,880
I really wanna talk to you.

346
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,620
I'm sorry. I know you're angry with me.

347
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,950
But I really wanna talk to you.

348
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,160
Please hear me out.

349
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,450
You know that I'm mad at you right?

350
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,540
I know.

351
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,560
I...

352
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,380
I'm sorry for not listening to you in the first place.

353
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,760
And also...

354
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,470
thank you.

355
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,880
Without you, I'd probably--

356
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,250
Why...

357
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,000
are you so nice to me like this?

358
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,450
Because I like you!

359
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,620
If you tell me to stop,

360
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,660
I will stop.

361
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,550
Can I kiss you?

362
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,370
About me working at the bar behind your back...

363
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,980
I'm sorry and...

364
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,140
thank you for rescuing me.

365
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,220
You know what's gonna happen right?

366
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,810
If I didn't go there?

367
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,470
I know.

368
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,710
- I didn't mean to lie to you.
- But you never told me.

369
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,700
You also never told me
why you don't want me to work there.

370
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,720
Cause I'm worried.

371
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,100
You don't have any common sense?

372
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,720
But from now on,

373
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,060
I will no longer let you work anywhere.

374
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,470
No more.

375
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,890
I was not gonna go work at the bar anymore.

376
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,590
But let me work in some other places.
I need to earn to pay you back.

377
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,790
Not to mention my personal spending.

378
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,990
Dorms and etc. So many expenses.

379
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,970
Then I won't take your money anymore.

380
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,110
What do you mean?

381
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,710
If you let me hug you like this.

382
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,600
I will give you 500.

383
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,820
If you let me kiss you, I will give you a 1,000.

384
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,170
But if you give more than that,

385
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,940
I will give you 5,000 each time.

386
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,760
How?
It'll be like I use my body to pay you back.

387
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,690
No, it's not.

388
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,840
Cause I like you.

389
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,230
No.

390
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,620
Are you even listening to me?

391
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,410
No.

392
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,420
So that was a 1,000, right?

393
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,920
Yes.

394
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,910
What about earlier?

395
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,800
That doesn't count.

396
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,200
Why not!?

397
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,700
- Cause I haven't told you the rules.
- What?

398
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,540
You're mean.

399
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,570
Go to sleep.

400
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,120
I already called Duennao
that you won't attend the class.

401
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:34,000
But seems like you have to attend the afternoon one.

402
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,930
Good. I'm still sleepy.

403
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,360
I will go to sleep then.

404
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,050
Where are you going?

405
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,860
Go to sleep.

406
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,040
Sleep here.

407
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,620
Sleep in your room?

408
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,980
Um.

409
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,460
How can I sleep when you stare at me like that?
Go!

410
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,900
Hey! What are you doing?

411
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,100
Why? Can't I hug you?

412
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,390
We're not boyfriends.

413
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,760
Can we do this?

414
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,860
Why?

415
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,780
- You wanna be my boyfriend?
- It's not like that.

416
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,040
It feels weird doing this
when we're not even boyfriends.

417
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,230
Then we should be.

418
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,280
You're talking nonsense.

419
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,380
You already opened your heart for me, yeah?

420
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,430
If not,
then you wouldn't let me kiss you.

421
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,340
I'm not gonna talk to you anymore.

422
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,870
Mr.Johan. May I come in?

423
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,020
Yes.

424
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,200
I don't know which size do you normally wear, so...

425
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,120
so I brought all for you to choose.

426
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,580
This one is fine.

427
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,650
Thank you.

428
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,850
For the shoes,
I already have it ready downstairs.

429
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:14,010
Would you like me to bring your food up here?

430
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,800
Are you hungry?

431
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
Not yet.

432
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,350
Then you go shower and change.

433
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,860
I have a class in the afternoon too.
I will drive you.

434
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,670
Sure.

435
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,470
Please.

436
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,800
Mr.Johan never brought anyone home at all.

437
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,800
Same goes to the condo.

438
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,960
Really?

439
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,860
Yes.

440
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,300
You're the first boyfriend
that I get to meet.

441
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,670
Oh so...

442
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,820
Am I saying anything wrong?

443
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,640
No.

444
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:19,160
I was worried that he is a player type.

445
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:23,010
Never committed to a serious relationship with anyone.

446
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,950
But that's good that he stops now.

447
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,080
Even though he's really smart and hard-working,

448
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,820
but he still needs someone

449
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,710
to support him.

450
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,850
Right?

451
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,150
Yes.

452
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,030
- Would you excuse me? I'm gonna go shower.
- Sure.

453
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,620
If you need anything else,
please let me know.

454
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,720
- Sure. Thank you.
- Yeah.

455
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,580
I'm gonna shower now.

456
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,370
Hello? What's going on my best friend, Tiger?

457
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,050
Asshole.

458
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,440
What's up?

459
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,700
Can you buy some snacks for Duennao?

460
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,500
He didn't have breakfast.

461
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,920
Neither for lunch.

462
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,260
Transfer me the money.

463
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,510
It's just a few Baht. You still need me to transfer?

464
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,390
Why don't you buy it yourself
if it's just a few Baht.

465
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,410
I can't.

466
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:36,900
Hahaa. You cannot? With just this kinda stuff?
And you call yourself tiger?

467
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,470
I will be worse when it's my turn.

468
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,230
I already transferred you. Bye.

469
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,530
I will take care of it.

470
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,670
Tiger?

471
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,710
Yes.

472
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,450
He wants me to buy some snacks for his crush.

473
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,980
- Is his name Duennao?
- Hey.

474
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,350
How do you know?

475
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,820
He told me when he came to see me.

476
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,310
That's a relief.

477
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,000
I thought I slipped it.

478
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,750
Thank you.

479
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,030
Hey...what are you doing?

480
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,180
Don't forget...
how you're gonna pay me back.

481
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,580
Go to you class and pay attention.

482
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,740
The new ice scream shop, that recently opened.

483
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,110
- I already tried it.
- Why didn't you invite me?

484
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,060
For real!?
Is the world ending? You bought us snacks?

485
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,850
- Or you don't want it?
- That's crazy.

486
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,210
What do we have?

487
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,780
I heard that...

488
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,560
P'Johan drove you here?

489
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,950
So?

490
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,460
Why does he do that?

491
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,010
- Were you with him this morning?
- Nao!

492
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,540
My nosy habit is already kicking in. Come on.

493
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,050
I called him this morning whether he's coming to class or not.

494
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,980
- Do you know what happened?
- What?

495
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,760
P'Jo answered.

496
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,870
He said North couldn't make it.

497
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,530
- Why? What did you do?
- Let's do it this way.

498
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,760
Why were you guys together?

499
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,840
Or...

500
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,140
- Or...
- Are you guys officially boyfriends?

501
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,670
Answer us please. What's the story?

502
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,590
Nosy. Nosy. Nosy.

503
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,590
- You don't get to eat these anymore.
- Hey!

504
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,320
Go to your class.

505
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,240
You know which class you have to be?

506
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,400
See. He's pouty.

507
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Now, he's back.

508
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,130
The class that you told me not ot miss
is Home Economics?

509
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,710
Yeah. We have a group project.

510
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,900
It's a free elective
and why do you have to choose this one?

511
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,400
Blame on Ikkyu.

512
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,120
He signed up for us.

513
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,340
Why? When you're done with Calculus,
you can bake something. Pretty chill.

514
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,530
- Like I know how to make it?
- You know how to cook, right?

515
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,170
But I don't know how to bake.

516
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,650
If I got an F, you guys are responsible for this.

517
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,640
What? Why us?

518
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,900
I'm not involved in this.

519
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,830
Here we go students.
I would like you to find your pairs.

520
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,800
Today, we will make an easy cake.

521
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,470
- An easy one.
- Easy one.

522
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,680
Not difficult one. We're good.

523
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,770
What are you doing?

524
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,700
Who do I have to be your pair?

525
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:14,500
Cause you and Ikkyu have some skills.

526
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:18,090
If I were to be with him, we would fail.

527
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,770
I think this is for the best.

528
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,700
Do we pour this in?

529
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,760
You need to sift first.
You didn't here the instruction just now?

530
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,460
Sift what? How to do it? Like this?

531
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,710
Funny.

532
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,020
Here. Pour it.

533
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,010
- Pour here?
- I will sift it myself.

534
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,400
Wait wait. Hold this.

535
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,260
What?

536
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,980
- You continue. I'll be back.
- Yeah.

537
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,340
Keep sifting.

538
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,180
Hello, P'Paan? What's up?

539
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,620
North. I'm calling to tell you about the bar.

540
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:05,370
The new owner fired you.

541
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,910
Fired me?

542
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,550
Umm. I don't know why.

543
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,920
But are you okay?

544
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,420
I'm okay. I was gonna resign anyway.

545
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,910
Really?

546
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes. Thank you though, P'Paan for telling me.

547
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,730
Okay. Bye then.

548
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,250
Yeah.

549
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,690
How's it going?

550
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,240
North. When I cracked the eggs,

551
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,550
the yolk was broken.

552
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,550
It's fine. We will have to mix it anyway.

553
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,480
But we've got some shell in it too.

554
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,800
I already tried,
but I probably didn't take all of the shell out.

555
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,820
And why didn't you do it before?

556
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,910
Let me see...woah.

557
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,100
Calcium.

558
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,380
You think you're funny?

559
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,650
Take it out.

560
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,940
Why is your face like that?

561
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,260
You're still asking?

562
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,210
The professor face when she talked still cracks me up.

563
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,410
'Students. Are you gonna poison me or something?'

564
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,910
Stop talking. It's because of Nao.

565
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,260
Cracked the eggs but he didn't take all the shell out. Why though?

566
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,200
Why? You get some texture. Crunchy.

567
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,660
Crunchy your ass!

568
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:56,060
People make mistakes too.

569
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,110
Yeah. Whatever.

570
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,790
- Are you going straight home?
- Yes, I'm so sleepy.

571
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,520
Me too.

572
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,390
Except some people, they might go cuddle with their boyfriends.

573
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,900
Teasing me huh!

574
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,810
Right right. Let's go.
Did you bring your ride?

575
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,940
- I didn't.
- I will drop you off.

576
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,590
Let's go.

577
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,380
Why did you bring me here?

578
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,460
I wanted to talk to you.

579
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,750
About what?

580
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,440
Is it important?

581
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,200
Why do you look so serious?

582
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,780
It kinda is.

583
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,830
I've been thinking for awhile.

584
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,520
Think about what?
Shit. I'm getting nervous.

585
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,700
Can you just tell me what is it about?

586
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,150
About Tiger.

587
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,270
Why?

588
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,150
I...

589
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,260
I just...

590
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:21,190
- I think he likes you.
- Huh!?

591
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:25,820
He always acts like he's seeing someone.
When people approaches him, he always rejects.

592
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:30,860
When I ask him to give it a try, he always says he doesn't wanna talk to anyone.

593
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,380
So I think he already has someone that he likes.

594
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,240
Which is you.

595
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,660
And why me?

596
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,780
He always mentions about you too.

597
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,620
He always calls you when he's at the dorm.

598
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,740
Not like that.

599
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,050
He doesn't have a crush on me. Trust me.

600
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,780
Um.

601
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,940
I know that you already opened your heart for P'Johan.

602
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,870
But...

603
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,560
Tiger is a nice guy.

604
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,560
I don't want him to be disappointed.

605
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:07,260
Oh god.
If he finds out, he'll be so heart broken.

606
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,170
Trust me. He doesn't have a crush on me.

607
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
So am I misunderstanding?

608
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,020
Yeah like big time.

609
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,070
What were you thinking?

610
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,030
Really?

611
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,540
What are you looking at?

612
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,610
What happened to your lips?
Why does it look swollen?

613
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,220
- A wasp stung me.
- When?

614
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:41,850
Just now.

615
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,620
Be honest, wasp or bee?

616
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,520
Or P'Jo kissed you?

617
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,100
Shit. I was just kidding.

618
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,630
Am I right?

619
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,770
You guys kissed?

620
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,760
Are you guys boyfriends yet?

621
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:03,280
Not yet.

622
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,930
But you let him kiss you?

623
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,860
Or you wanted to?

624
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,680
Yeah. I didn't feel bad or anything.

625
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,610
Oh so now you have feelings for him?

626
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,720
He's probably not fooling around with you.

627
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,430
He actually...

628
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,000
- said he likes me.
- Shit! For real?

629
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,090
I'm blushing for you man.

630
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,990
And do you like him too?

631
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,020
I already tried to open my heart for him.

632
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,770
Like a lot.

633
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,890
And why you open now?

634
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,910
He's been so nice to me.

635
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,000
Like real nice.

636
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,150
But isn't it normal?

637
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,620
when people are nice to you, you must feel good, right?

638
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,780
Yeah that's good that he's nice to you.

639
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,980
But you probably have feelings for him too.

640
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,100
if not, you wouldn't let him do all these to you.

641
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,200
I like it!
He kissed until your lips are swollen.

642
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,340
Don't you think he's cruel?

643
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,530
He can't do it in a normal way, yeah?

644
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,580
Why not?

645
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,020
Cause a guy like you, when there's someone likes you, and you don't like them back.

646
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:16,920
you'll push them away from your life.

647
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,990
You won't keep them in your empty head.

648
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,080
But when P'Jo does it this way,

649
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,550
it stucks in your head like this.

650
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,770
You call all those flirting?

651
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,820
Yeah they are.

652
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,080
North.

653
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:46,160
- Come here.
- What is it?

654
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,280
No matter how bad I'd like to know
about the guy from the bar,

655
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,870
but I wanna know about P'Jo more.
Spill the tea.

656
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,110
What are you doing?

657
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,020
About last night, P'Hill told me already.

658
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,370
He saved you last time.
This time he also did again.

659
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,850
Let's be honest with me,
you don't have any feelings for him at all?

660
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,870
I already told you I'm not a complicated person.

661
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,810
That means you're now opening your heart to P'Jo?

662
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,180
Um.

663
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,950
And...

664
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,240
do you know how does he feel about you?

665
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:28,950
He sends someone to look after you like this,
it's impossible not to have feelings for you, right?

666
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,270
He actually...

667
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,050
- told me he likes me.
- Really!?

668
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,230
That hurts. You hit me too hard.

669
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,520
I'm so happy!

670
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:44,140
I'm sorry. Sorry.

671
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,600
I was too happy.

672
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,070
A shipper like me has been rooting for you for so long.
Let me have my moment.

673
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:57,110
Oh and what re you gonna do about P'Day?

674
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,940
To be honest,

675
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,540
I didn't think he is such a scum bag.

676
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,610
But forget it.

677
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,280
- P'Hill told me he got fired.
- I'm also fired.

678
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,450
Oh why?

679
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:13,240
Someone took over the bar, new owner just fired me.

680
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:16,040
But whatever. I was gonna resign anyway.

681
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,290
I should've listened to you.

682
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,370
I shouldn't have worked there.

683
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,840
It's okay dude.

684
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,270
It's already in the past.

685
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:29,010
Here. From now on, there'll be only good things coming to your life.

686
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,340
Come on.

687
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,610
You look happier than me.

688
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,930
That's good.
I saw you're happy. I'm also happy.

689
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,580
I just met the owner aunty, she's asking for the rental payment.

690
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:52,400
Pay.

691
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,400
I already spent the money on my computer.

692
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,640
Huh!? Computer?

693
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,400
I don't have the money for my tuition fee and dorm rent.

694
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,400
Just follow my conditions.

695
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,500
These are just the deposit.

696
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,480
Give me one more chance to take care of you.

697
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,860
Will you be my boyfriend?
