1
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,400
There's something happened on set today.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,440
Someone said P'Hill shouldn't be with me. It's a waste fo time.

3
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,230
And P'Hill just burst and punched him.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,090
Good. He deserved that.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,040
But P'Hill got punched back.

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,170
Can you go see him for me?

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,680
Why me?

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,830
You will see something nice there.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,830
Trust me.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,270
How was it?

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,830
Good I guess.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,700
I just want everything to be clear.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,280
I don't know whether the way I make it public is the right thing to do.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,970
From now on, when I say 'it's fine',

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,060
the meaning will be, 'we're both fine'.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,410
Cocoa drink here is good.

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,410
- Really?
- Umm.

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,850
You come here often?

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,090
Once in a while.

20
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,740
With who?

21
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,950
By myself.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,190
I don’t believe you.

23
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,850
I really do come here alone.

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,150
Cause normally you never really liked dessert.

25
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,490
I’m not here for the dessert.

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,920
I come here because it reminds me of you.

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,090
What are you talking about?

28
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,080
It’s true.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,168
We haven’t seen each other for so long.

30
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,940
That’s so irrelevant.

31
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,780
You love cocoa drinks.

32
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,900
I tried all the dessert cafes around here.

33
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,900
This one is the best.

34
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,360
I miss you…

35
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,640
but I couldn’t come see you…

36
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,420
So I had to distract myself by doing something to get my mind off you.

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,280
P’Hill.

38
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,130
I have always thought

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,690
of bringing you here.

40
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,740
I want to take you anywhere you wanna go.

41
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,950
So I did my research on so many good restaurants.

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,190
Or beautiful places.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,030
In case we would meet each other again someday.

44
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,390
I thought we'd never see each other again.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,520
I am here now.

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,190
Thank you…

47
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,510
for letting me see you.

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,200
Continue eating.

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,330
Sorry.

50
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,760
I’m sorry.

51
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,170
Thank you.

52
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,860
What are you looking at?

53
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,210
Stop looking.

54
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,200
I won’t.

55
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,890
I will charge you fee for looking.

56
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,430
- How much is it?
- THB100 each time.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,980
Do you have a lump sum payment option?

58
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,760
Like I lay once and I can look at you the whole month.

59
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,550
It will be expensive though.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,390
Is there any promotion, if I pay you cash?

61
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,620
What kind of promotion?

62
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,380
Like I can borrow you home to hug while I sleep?

63
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,970
For a few days?

64
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,970
I won’t allow that.

65
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,130
Please.

66
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,830
No.

67
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,590
You’re really doing this to me?

68
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,580
I will buy you cocoa drinks too.

69
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,360
Don’t try to convince me with the drink.

70
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,480
Coconut too.

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,800
It’s not working.

72
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,790
Thank you.

73
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,360
Ter.

74
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,500
Yes?

75
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,430
You forgot this.

76
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,300
Oh right.

77
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,830
Thank you.

78
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,960
Night night.

79
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,990
Bye bye.

80
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,210
Oh the thief is coming.

81
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,000
Go go. Go in.

82
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,160
Yes! I’m holding a sniper.

83
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,160
I’m home.

84
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,280
Where have you been?

85
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,280
I was with P’Hill.

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,060
I also brought you this.

87
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,560
Hey! It’s like you can read my mind.

88
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,550
I’m kinda hungry right now.

89
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,070
Thank you. How much do I owe you?

90
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,890
It’s fine. P’Hill paid.

91
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,770
Wow~

92
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,350
He also paid for my food. He’s so smooth.

93
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,570
Trying to win over through his friends.

94
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,100
So strategic.

95
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,680
What are you babbling about?

96
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,140
Oh Ter. Do you still want a part time job?

97
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,810
Sure.

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,810
It’s a Japanese restaurant.

99
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,240
Working from 6-10pm.

100
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,190
Are you interested?

101
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,190
Sure.

102
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,720
If you are, I will tell them.

103
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,300
Okay.

104
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,150
- Oh North.
- Hmm?

105
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,810
Do you know P’Johan?

106
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,810
The guy who dropped me off the other day.

107
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,460
No.

108
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,570
You really don’t know him? He’s so popular.

109
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,620
I know that he’s a friend of P Hill.

110
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,610
But I don’t know him personally.

111
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,010
Really?

112
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,000
Yeah. Why would I lie to you?

113
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,630
And what do you think?

114
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,370
Think of what?

115
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,430
Like what do you think of him and such?

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,590
Well…

117
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,360
I don’t know.

118
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,230
Why so many questions?

119
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,230
I have enemies on my front door.

120
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,230
I have to protect my land.

121
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,170
I’m sorry.

122
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,010
Do you know North from Crime Suppression Division?

123
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,820
- For the pride.
- Always play the game.

124
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,570
You're ruining my hair.

125
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,560
Do you know how long it took me to do this?

126
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,130
Half an hour.

127
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,870
- Hey. Your turn.
- Let me play too please.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,260
Oh I have to start first?

129
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,150
Expert.

130
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,690
It’s a competition.

131
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,140
You’re so noob.

132
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,230
I can’t see.

133
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,230
I let you try again.

134
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,080
Not as good as mine anyway.

135
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,760
Let me decorate the car a min.

136
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,960
Wanna go for some food after?

137
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,400
North and I cannot join.

138
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,400
We have to work. Part time job.

139
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,910
So hard-working.

140
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,230
We need it for the tuition fee.

141
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,930
What time do you guys get off?

142
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,570
Either 10pm or midnight.

143
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,120
Woah. So late.
Be careful when you go home.

144
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,660
People have to be careful of me instead.

145
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,860
It'll be just me and Phoon again.
So lonely.

146
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,860
Having meal just the two of us.

147
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,490
Let’s do this.

148
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,110
We will have dinner at your work, shall we?

149
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,870
We’re free anyways.

150
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,490
Let’s do that.

151
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,530
Japanese right?

152
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,560
- Umm.
- We wanna have Japanese anyways Come with us, Daotok.

153
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,560
Sure.

154
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,130
Huh!? Can I!?

155
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,120
For real?

156
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,190
- Hey are you for real?
- Go. Let’s go.

157
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,760
Daotok is finally joining us.

158
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
We’ve been waiting for this moment.

159
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,250
- Shall we?
- Now?

160
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,250
- Let’s go. I’m hungry.
- Let's go.

161
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,250
Whose bag is this? Where’s my bag?

162

I guarantee you. This is good.

163
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,770
Please welcome.

164
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,760
Irashaimase.

165
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,620
What? Hurry.

166
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,350
Oh Ter. North. You're here.

167
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640

168
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Why are you here so early today?

169
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,640
I brought my friends for dinner.

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,380
- Hello.

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,780

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,710
Everything will be on the house today.

174
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,920
Ooh. Really, P'Yah?
Can I also join?

175
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,260
North.

176
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,360
It's okay. P'Yah. I feel bad.

177
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,400
If not, I won't let them come here anymore.

178
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,720
Ok fine. I won't pay.
I will give you guys lots of free stuff instead.

179
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,140
Thank you, P'Yah.

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,670
Please make yourself at home.

183
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,480
North.
Why are you sitting down? Get up.

184
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,480
Go change.

185
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,120
What would you like for today?

186
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:55,280
What do you wanna eat?
Just order.

187
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,170
This waiter has no manner.

188
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,850
Can't you see that we're still deciding?

189
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,850
How can you rush?

190
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,060
Shall we report the manager?

191
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,060
Stop messing with him.
There're so many people already.

192
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,300
Fine. I will get this one.

193
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,790
And this set too.

194
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,160
Okay?

195
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,030
- I will be back.
- Okay.

196
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,200
Here are your drinks.

197
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,950
You don't have the butterfly pea lemon?

198
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,990
If you're so picky, please go dine somewhere else.

199
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,350
You can have mine. Here.

200
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,640
The food is here my friends.

201
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,250
- Ugh. Finally, I get to sit.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,250
So many people here today.

203
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,870
And you guys can sit out here like this?

204
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:49,410
P’Yah told me to take a break.

205
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,580
I’m hungry. So damn hungry.

206
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,580
What are you having? Let me try.

207
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,380
How is it? Good?

208
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,510
It’s good.

209
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,180
I guess we might come here more often.

210
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,720
Good, so we won’t be so bored working.

211
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,710
You should come hang with us often.

212
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,490
Sure thing.

213
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,130
Ter. Come here.

214
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,060
Yes.

215
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Nong Ter.

216
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,620
Someone is here to see you. So handsome!

217
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,620
Your boyfriend?

218
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,820
P'Hill.

219
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Why don't you tell me you have a part time job?

220
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,630
It's dangerous, going home so late.

221
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,210
I work with North though.

222
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,630
Even so. It's still dangerous.

223
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:00,100
I wanna do something by myself too.

224
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,020
I don't want to be a burden to my family.

225
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,240
And how is it?

226
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,840
Good. It's good.

227
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,840
Everyone is so kind.

228
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,240
You work here with North, right?

229
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,910
Yes.

230
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,940
Then I will come take you home from now on.

231
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,230
It's fine. I can come and go with North.

232
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,960
Please.

233
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,140
Please.

234
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,800
Fine.

235
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,990
That's good.

236
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,010
Then we will start today.
I will wait until you shift is over.

237
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,010
It's fine. I can go back by myself.

238
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,270
All my friends are also here.

239
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,390
Fine.

240
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,440
I will go back work now.

241
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,630
Yes, you go ahead.

242
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,930
I will make a call for a min.

243
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,930
Sure.

244
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,640
Are you free?

245
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,040
No.

246
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,040
I have something to talk to you.

247
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,040
I'm working. Can we talk later?

248
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,430
It's about North.

249
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,570
What is it?

250
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,210
- P'Yah.
- I'm not. I'm not peeking.

251
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,210
Yeah. I believe you.

252
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,460
So what's going on?

253
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,460
Are you guys a couple?

254
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,380
No, we're not.

255
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,630
He's waiting for you there like that.

256
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,240
I'm just gonna go.

257
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,550
Let's go.

258
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,130
You scared me.

259
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,130
Go home already.

260
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,130
Next time.

261
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,720
P'Hill.

262
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,080
I'm done.

263
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,720
Then let's go.

264
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,970
We will go now, P'

265
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,970
Sure. See you around.

266
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,520
- See you dude.
- Bye. See you.

267
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,640
Do you wanna leave your motorbike here?

268
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,230
Riding motorbike at night is too dangerous.
I'll take you home.

269
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,230
Sounds good.

270
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,520
Let's go.

271
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,920
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

272
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,110
See you tomorrow.

273
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,370
Yes.

274
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,370
Thank you for dropping us off.

275
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,470
- Thank you, P'Hill.
- Sure.

276
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,470
Go go.

277
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,060
Oh Ter.

278
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,430
Hmm?

279
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,680
I think he takes care of you so well.

280
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,490
Why don't you guys make it official?

281
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,100
How can I?

282
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,580
Why can't you?

283
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,990
Cause I haven't told him that I like him.

284
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,960
Another thing.

285
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,750
What's another thing?

286
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,080
He has never asked me to be his boyfriend.

287
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,390
I think he's waiting for you.

288
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,070
Waiting for what?

289
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,280
Waiting for you to realized yourself.

290
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,120
Let's put it this way.

291
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,560
Have you told him how do you feel about him?

292
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,150
Not yet.

293
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,160
See?

294
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,260
Cause you're still scared, aren't you?

295
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,130
About when you were hurt before or something.

296
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,690
You're afraid that it will happen again, right?

297
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,150
Yeah.

298
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,150
I think he's waiting for you
to be honest with yourself.

299
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,520
It's up to you now, Ter.

300
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,860
Understood.

301
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,830
Just give me sometimes.

302
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,140
- I'm gonna go play games now.
- Umm.

303
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,350
Aren't you gonna shower first?

304
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,080
I like to be nasty.

305
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,580
If it's overthere...green right?

306
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,350
You can try.

307
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,150
You can end it with brown color too.

308
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:14,520
All I'm asking is to explain to me why you disappeared.
And just tell me you love me once again.

309
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,750
What's up, Mr.president? Everything's good?

310
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,890
Umm.

311
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,710
I thought we're not gonna be able to host this
before the term starts.

312
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,660
We also have very few members too.

313
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,950
Right.

314
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,690
Both booth and concert.

315
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,860
Are we making it too big for welcome back activity?

316
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,610
Last year, the seniors did it so well.

317
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,930
Hill.

318
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:17,390
Johan will be here to help.
Fah and Arthit also.

319
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,890
Those guys are gonna come help?

320
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,390
I don't know.

321
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,230
I will go check everything over there first.

322
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,130
Umm.

323
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,660
- Please handle this after me.
- Sure. Thank you.

324
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,020
Hill.

325
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,360
I heard that the guy that you're seeing...

326
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,070
...is here somewhere?

327
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,490
Lower your voice.
Many people here.

328
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,490
- Hmm?
- Keep it down.

329
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,850
Is it the same guy we met the other day?

330
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,510
Must be the same one.
It's Hill. Not Johan, who constantly changes.

331
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,510
What the f*ck?

332
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,140
Can I go talk to him?

333
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,140
Hey Arthit.

334
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,560
Hello Nong Ter.

335
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,360
Hello.

336
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,150
Hi.

337
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,150
President. Come here.

338
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,570
Come here.

339
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,870
If you need anything,
just let my friends help you.

340
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,660
Are you sure that's a good idea?

341
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,180
Don't have to feel bad.

342
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,190
Damn. He said so nice things.

343
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,320
Our friend has changed guys.

344
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
- Right.
- I can't.

345
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,240
I also can't when you flirt with the girls.

346
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,240
Enough you guys.

347
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,080
We will help him, Hill.

348
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,670
Go do your thing.

349
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,230
Right. Take care of him.

350
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,290
I will be back.

351
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,770
Sure.

352
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,850
Dude.

353
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,340
How can we help you, Ter?

354
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:11,840
There is this
that you can put the flag on.

355
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,840
Do you think you can do it?

356
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,360
- It's just a simple out it on the rope.
- Hill really has changed.

357
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,860
Umm. It's so weird.

358
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,890
Ter. Your phone.

359
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,120
Yes?

360
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,650
Who's calling me?

361
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,160
Typhoon.

362
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,570
Oh Typhoon.

363
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,540
I will just give this to him.

364
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,900
- Nong Ter.
- Yes?

365
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,970
- Here.
- I'm sorry. My hands are a bit dirty.

366
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,030
- Can you answer it for me?
- Okay sure. I will put him on speaker.

367
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,740
Hello, Phoon. Where are you?

368
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,470
Ter. Help me. I'm lost. Foam took me out front of the campus. He said he wanted to take a detour.

369
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,080
We ended up around other people's houses.

370
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,450
Oh and which alley are you at?

371
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,880
What alley?
Dude. I think we need to stop and use the GPS.

372
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,790
No. Trust me, Phoon.

373
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,390
What the hell you guys!?
I'm busy here.

374
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,910
You can tell me the direction.
I can go get you.

375
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,610
Thank you.

376
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,180
P'?

377
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,450
Who's speaking?

378
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,420
My name is Tonfah.

379
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:38,150
Ter is kinda busy.
Just tell me the way and I will come pick you up.

380
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,950
Please help us.

381
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,990
Ok then. I left the campus
and turn left around the corner of that dress rental shop.

382
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,290
Oh ok I know where that is.
Wait there. I will pick you up.

383
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,290
See you dude. Bye.

384
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,830
- I will go now.
- Yes, please get them for me.

385
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,830
- It's not a big deal.
- Thank you.

386
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,390
- Jo, can I borrow your car?
- Where are you going?

387
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,720
Ter's friends are lost somewhere in front of the campus.

388
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,720
I'm going to get them.

389
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,800
Do you want me to go instead? I'm free.

390
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,400
You are not normally this kind.

391
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,070
Please don't go.
You'll come back and complain.

392
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,450
He's right.

393
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,620
I think you should leave it to Dr.Fah,
who's so kind.

394
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,026
- Drive safe.
- Sure. Thank you.

395
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,940
You look like you're free.

396
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,940
I'm so damn bored.

397
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,240
What's going on boys?

398
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,000
You guys are here helping.
This seems weird.

399
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,600
Hey P'.

400
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,070
What kind of guys do you think we are?

401
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,170
You guys are probably here
to check out Hill's sweetheart, right?

402
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,170
How does she know?

403
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,990
- Hello~ P'Mei Li.
- Hi~

404
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,150
How come you're here?

405
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,190
Cause I miss you, kiddo.

406
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,490
You're too sweet.

407
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,560
Just kidding.

408
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,880
I have some work at the union,
so I stopped by to check.

409
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,360
Good.
We have so many things to do too.

410
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,410
Woah. He won't let anyone sit by his side at all.

411
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,190
Jealous type too.

412
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,940
Hello P'Mei Li.

413
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,770
I thought you were not gonna say hi to me.
Hello.

414
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,740
Are you hot?

415
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,670
Yes, a bit.

416
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,630
Wow...you guys are so sweet.

417
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,630
I was also in the sun while walking here.

418
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,630
Our friend has emphathy too?

419
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,510
I think he's probably has it for this guy only.

420
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,340
Hill is so Hill.

421
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,790
Oops.

422
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,130
Opps what

423
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,250
Opps.

424
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,940
You want some water?

425
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,940
Thank you.

426
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,130
Hey guys.
Come help me carry stuff from the union to here.

427
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,130
Let's go.

428
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,420
- I'll be back.
- Sure.

429
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,940
- Come on.
- Oh guys. I also bought you these.

430
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,580
- I will have one.
- Please take it. I bought for you guys.

431
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,660
That's the coldest one we have.

432
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,970
Is this okay?

433
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,990
Easter.

434
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,990
We're here.

435
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,360
I can hear your voice since miles away.
Took forever to get here.

436
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,480
- Why don't you just punch me?
- Can I?

437
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,210
Just one time.

438
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,700
Without P'Fah, we would be in trouble.

439
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,140
Thank you so much for picking them up.

440
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,480
You're welcome.

441
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,960
By the way, where are all my friends?

442
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,770
Oh they went to get some stuff from the union.

443
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,320
Ok. I won't be in your way anymore. Excuse me.

444
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,500
- Oh and here's your phone.
- Thank you.

445
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,500
- Thank you so much.
- Sure thing.

446
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,790
Why are you still standing?
Sit.

447
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:22,060
- I've been waiting for you to ask.
- Sit. Sit here.

448
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,450
These are your friends?

449
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:28,340
Oh yes. This if Foam and this is Typhoon.

450
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:32,860
Oh Typhoon. Hi. I'm Mei Li.

451
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,110
Mei Li.

452
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,110
I have heard of your name before.

453
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,300
I heard that you kinda always look after him.
Thank you.

454
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,520
It's not that much.

455
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,970
Now, I'm blushing.

456
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,650
P'Mei Li. Phoon is a photographer.
He takes great photos.

457
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,260
He does it even better than me.

458
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,160
- Really?
- Not really. I normally don't do portraits.

459
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,030
What?
Not portraits then what do you normally take?

460
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:02,470
Like sky and stuff.

461
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,470
Sky?

462
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,880
How?

463
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,750
Here.

464
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,390
Phoon's IG.

465
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,240
It's pretty.

466
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,760
But why do you only take pictures of the sky?

467
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,600
They're beautiful.

468
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:31,560
And I also like blue color stuff.

469
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,710
You're so weird.
You can post some other pictures too.

470
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,010
None of your business.

471
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,010
Oh.

472
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,280
Stop fighting you guys.
Since you are here,

473
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,000
come help me take all these to the stage.

474
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,010
Guys, can I go with you?

475
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,200
I don't have anything else to do today.

476
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,900
Sure, but it's kidna hot out?
Are you sure you wanna go?

477
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:56,470
I'm a fighter.

478
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,380
This is not right.

479
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,650
I think the president gives you guys too many hard work.

480
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,840
It's fine, P'Mei Li.
We're happy to help. The term almost starts too.

481
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,300
Very protective of him.

482
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,110
But it becomes a burden for us.

483
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,480
Oh I thought you're willing to help?

484
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,010
Come on.

485
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,680
P'Mei Li, are you okay?

486
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,110
I'm fine. Wait.

487
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,830
I think booth A looks okay already.

488
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,040
- Can you go check booth B for me?
- Okay, on it.

489
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,770
Oh hey P'Hill.

490
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,140
Hello.

491
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,040
I heard you guys were lost?

492
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,700
Fah came to get you, right?

493
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,470
Yes, he seems like an expert in directions.

494
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:48,240
Even I told him my guess.
I couldn't really remember thing.

495
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,240
He still managed to find us.

496
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,420
- Hey Phoon.
- Huh?

497
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,390
We still haven't thanked him.

498
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,030
Oh right.

499
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,780
It's okay.

500
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,490
It think he wanted to help.

501
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,370
Then could you excuse us?

502
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,800
Bye.

503
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,480
We worked so hard.

504
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,530
Are you alright, P'Mei Li?

505
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,900
Not really, but I still wanna help.

506
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,120
Hey do it.

507
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,790
- What?
- It's you!

508
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,830
- What?
- There's something goin on,

509
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,910
since the day P'Hill took you home
from P'Yah's restaurant.

510
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,430
There's something make me believe that
you and P'Hill are not just two normal people.

511
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,880
You're having secrets with friends?

512
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,960
Tell me now, Ter!

513
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,940
You can just asked me nicely.

514
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,900
I will let you talk.
I will pay good attention.

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,090
Even if you are secretly having a boyfriend
and won't tell us.

516
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,990
or when my feelings are hurt when you hide things from me.

517
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,360
Sure. I still can take it.

518
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,350
Listen to me first.
You're so overreacting.

519
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,590
Fine. I will tell you now.

520
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,910
P'Mei Li. Help me.

521
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,620
Ok have you seen P'Hill's posts?

522
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,680
#SugarDaddyDoctor and #WhostheOwneroftheWatch.

523
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,400
Oh I remember.
I saw many people reposted on Facebook.

524
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,510
That's it.
The one and only reason behind all those.

525
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,950
The owner of the watch

526
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,910
and also the owner of P'Hill's heart.

527
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,060
Or...

528
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,520
Why you never told me!?

529
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,780
There's no good time to tell you.
I couldn't tell you directly.

530
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,190
It's you!

531
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,610
"I'll go drinks with friends tonight."

532
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,180
"Are you okay?"

533
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,902
"A bit heart broken. If I got too drunk, come get me"

534
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,171
"Don't drink too much. I'm worried"

535
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,540
Oh.

536
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,400
Is he asking for something back?

537
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,310
- Yes?
- Come check the overall with me, will you?

538
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,090
Yes. Sure.

539
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,270
You see that?
How come you guys don't have any idea?

540
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,100
He just never told us.

541
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,770
- "I'll go drinks with friends tonight."
- "Are you okay?"
- "A bit heart broken. If I got too drunk, come get me"
- "Don't drink too much. I'm worried about you"

542
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,300
You need to talk to me?

543
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,950
I think...

544
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,950
we should break up.

545
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,020
I need you to understand, North.

546
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,710
We're grown ups.

547
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,510
We need to choose someone with the future.

548
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,330
We cannot just date for fun
like little kids anymore, right?

549
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,440
I really want to thank you.

550
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,130
For everything...

551
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,140
...that you have done for me.

552
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,140
But--

553
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,820
You already chose Temp, right?

554
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,900
Um.

555
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,360
I'm sorry.

556
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,740
It's okay.

557
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,740
I understand.

558
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,090
But please tell Temp for me.

559
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,900
Promise me that he will take care of you for me.

560
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,560
Good luck.

561
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,220
North.

562
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,070
North.

563
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,290
Are you okay?

564
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,420
I am.
Let's go. Cheers.

565
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,960
Easy there.
I think you're somewhat drunk.

566
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,140
The drinks cannot do anything to him.

567
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,140
He's heart broken. Let him be.

568
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,770
Don't say that I'm heart broken.

569
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,630
We broke up long time ago.

570
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,220
But today she just updated relationship status
with her new guy.

571
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:54,490
If you're really okay,
we wouldn't have to be here, would we?

572
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,640
Why?

573
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,480
What's wrong with engineering?

574
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,050
She wants to be with someone with the future?
She doesn't want to date for fun?

575
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,810
I also didn't date for fun.

576
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,360
I did take care of her.

577
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,920
But he's a doctor. That's why.

578
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:17,190
So?
Engineer has no future?

579
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,150
This is offensive to all of us.

580
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,460
That's true.

581
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,090
Does Jah go to our university by the way?

582
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,600
But Temp, her new boyfriend, sure does.

583
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,590
I'm praying for you two,
to not run into each other.

584
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,590
You're such a hot-headed guy.

585
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,250
Ughh. I'm not like that.

586
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,230
To be honest,

587
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,630
I don't have a problem with him.

588
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,120
But just don't break her heart.

589
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:55,240
- Hey Q, you haven't drunk anything.
- This way!

590
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,080
You guys are not drinking

591
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,460
even though I pay.

592
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,960
The chance that I win lotteries
does not occur often too.

593
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,820
If you're all drunk,
who's gonna take care of y'all?

594
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,100
Look at each one of them.

595
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,200
You guys are drunk already?

596
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,130
Who's drunk? No one.

597
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,100
Are you coming back with me, North?

598
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,360
No, my dorm is in a different way from yours.

599
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,320
But I already informed Ter.
If I'm drunk, I wil lhave him pick me up.

600
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,270
Right. If I don't look well,

601
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,060
please call Ter for me.

602
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,300
Okay?

603
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,870
Yeah.

604
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,430
North.

605
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,360
Temp that you were talking about...

606
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,730
is that him?

607
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,910
Yes.

608
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,350
Yes what? Look!

609
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,960
- Shit.
- Shit.

610
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,300
I just said don't want them to run into each other.

611
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,090
Hey but the girl that he's with is not Jah, right?

612
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:09,890
- Follow him.
- Where are you going, North?

613
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,610
Hey! What are you doing?

614
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,960
North.

615
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,140
North?

616
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,330
I asked what the f*ck are you doing?

617
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,550
You've got a problem?

618
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,600
Why? You're a sore loser?

619
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,340
What a loser.

620
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,780
Temp!

621
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,130
North!

622
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,140
- What are you doing?
- Just go.

623
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,140
F*ck you.

624
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:45,330
Hey North!

625
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,240
North, are you alright?

626
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,400
My lips.

627
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,260
This sh*thead.

628
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,740
Why did you punch him, Nhow?

629
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,940
Cause he punched my friend.

630
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,020
You!

631
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:10,220
- Hey someone's calling. Pick up.
- Ter Ter. I'm Ikkyu. North is in trouble.

632
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,520
Hurry up.

633
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,490
Are you sure you want this?

634
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,770
What?

635
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,390
Let go of me!

636
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,730
Let go of me!

637
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,870
I really don't wanna fight.

638
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,950
Fall again.

639
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,130
Don't hurt my friend.

640
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,680
Stop stop.

641
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,850
Hey that's enough.

642
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:36,060
Why don't you mind your own business?

643
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,460
Hey! Come at me!

644
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,410
- Hey.
- I said enough!

645
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,600
Let me go!

646
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,710
Let me go!
Why are you holding me?

647
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,450
Hey! Let me go!

648
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,170
Just let me know how much do we owe you.
I will handle it.

649
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,230
I'm sorry about tonight.
Let me know your hospital bills.

650
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,270
Sure.

651
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,220
- I helped, but you kept punching me.
- Next time, just leave it to me.

652
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,980
Oh sure. Next time, I'll leave it to you.

653
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,050
Can you take your friends home?

654
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,480
Yes.

655
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,570
But...

656
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,420
I will handle that.

657
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,550
Yes.

658
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,170
Oh P'

659
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,000
This is North's.

660
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,030
North.

661
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,920
- North.
- North.

662
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,000
North. North.

663
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,230
North.

664
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,680
Get up.

665
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,570
Come help me.

666
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:24,640
Ugh. My body is still hurt.

667
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,520
Take the bike home.

668
00:44:58,574 --> 00:44:59,760
How is it?

669
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,310
I already handled it.

670
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,830
What about Nong?

671
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,380
He's sleeping here. Just drank too much.

672
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,580
I'm taking him home.

673
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,290
Can you bring Ter over tomorrow?
So he won't have a heart attack when he wakes up.

674
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,200
Good that he's okay.

675
00:45:15,576 --> 00:45:17,160
I will bring Ter over tomorrow.

676
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:20,030
Um. I gotta go.

677
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,300
I told you to not break her heart.

678
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,560
Why are you doing this?

679
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,730
My heart hurts so much.

680
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:35,070
Who told you to drink so much?

681
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,000
- I can't.
- Huh?

682
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,400
- Shit.
- Mr.Johan.

683
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,350
Aunty Da.
Can you prepare some clothes for me?

684
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,870
Yes.

685
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:08,620
- Take care of him.
- Yes sir.

686
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,950
Oh my my.

687
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,130
How can you be this drunk?

688
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,980
Ugh I need to pee.

689
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,910
I need to pee.
Where's the restroom?

690
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:08,670
I have to pee.

691
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,860
Where's the restroom?

692
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,190
Why is this so high up?

693
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,430
I need to pee.

694
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,970
Or the restroom is over there?

695
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,990
Hey or it's...

696
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,560
over there?

697
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,930
Or it's...

698
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,960
over here?

699
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,440
Or...

700
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,860
Where is it?

701
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,500
Hey what!?

702
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:37,490
Oh my god. Why are you so drunk?

703
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:41,860
Oh my. Mr.Johan is gonna like this.

704
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,490
Aunty. I'm sorry.

705
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,240
What am I gonna do?

706
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,490
Be careful!

707
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,990
Oh my!

708
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,110
Aunty.

709
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:01,720
- Go to the room.
- Where are we going?

710
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,380
- I told you to go back to the room.
- I need to pee.

711
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,620
Go to the room.

712
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,190
- I told you go back.
- Aunty~

713
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,200
- I need to pee.
- I told you to go back.

714
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,960
Aunty, I'm sorry.

715
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,740
Please come clean this up for me, Aunty.

716
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,510
Aunty. It's over there too.

717
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,560
Go to the room.

718
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,680
Oh my god.

719
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,680
Restroom.

720
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,630
Where's the restroom?

721
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:35,820
It's here.

722
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,490
It's so far.

723
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,310
Restroom.

724
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,490
I have arrived at the restroom.

725
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,880
I can pee now.

726
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,000
Shake it shake it.

727
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,890
North.

728
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,830
Ter.

729
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:24,960
- Easy dude.
- Why is it so hurtful?

730
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:29,240
- It's morning already?
- Not morning.

731
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,330
It's already evening.

732
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,490
I thought you were not gonna wake up.

733
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,140
Why is my whole body ache?

734
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,050
You deserved that.
Seeing you like this, I even wanna aggravate you even more.

735
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:44,130
But I don't know where to start.

736
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:47,610
Don't do that to me.

737
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,630
Thanks for picking me up last night.

738
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,210
It's not me.

739
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:56,410
Oh.

740
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,800
And where am I?

741
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,840
P'Hill's room?

742
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,330
North. I'm really mad at you.

743
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,130
Why did you do it?

744
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,020
Why were you in a fight with them?

745
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:14,350
Do you have any idea how worried I was?
When I called Ikkyu...

746
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,190
...and he said you were in trouble?

747
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:19,670
When will you stop being so hot-headed?

748
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,010
Right I'm sorry.

749
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,330
I will try to calm down next time.

750
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:28,720
You won't be in a fight next time.

751
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,850
I will...

752
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,530
try to calm down then.

753
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,210
Anyways, I think you probably wouldn't want to drink
for a very long time.

754
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:45,430
Why?

755
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,530
Where am I?
Can you tell me already?

756
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:53,250
This is a house of P'Hill's friend.

757
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,810
P'Johan's house.

758
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:56,620
Oh. P'Johan.

759
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,730
Huh!?
And how come I'm here?

760
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:06,050
When Ikkyu told me you were in trouble,
I didn't know what to do.

761
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,980
So I called P'Hill
and he said he will handle it.

762
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,280
I need to answer this.

763
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,390
Yes.

764
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,620
Dude...so what happened?

765
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,690
How did I get here
and where is he now?

766
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,040
He went out for work.
He probably will be back soon.

767
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:36,750
Hey let go of me!

768
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:38,750
I told you to not break her heart.

769
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,890
Shit...or I...

770
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:45,430
puked all over him last night?

771
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:47,200
You remember now?

772
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,680
He seems very upset with you too.

773
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,590
I only remember some parts.

774
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:56,590
Dude but...

775
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,760
I don't understand why it was him to pick me up?

776
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:06,770
Right? When he said he'll handle it,
I also didn't think it would be P'Johan to go get you.

777
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,740
You said you called Ikkyu, right?

778
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,920
Yes.

779
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,920
I will call him.

780
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,540
This is my phone?
Why is it in this condition?

781
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:31,680
I have no idea.

782
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,640
Dude. I can't turn it on.

783
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,120
When P'Johan gave it to me,
it's already like this.

784
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,450
He must be the one who did this.

785
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,050
Why would he do that?

786
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,120
You said he seems upset with me, didn't you?

787
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,390
Look. I cannot turn it on.

788
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,830
This is too much.

789
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,870
What did I do to him?

790
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:56,850
to make me deserve this?

791
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,620
You kinda did a lot though.

792
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,410
- What did I do?
- Um. Here.

793
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:06,610
This is why you probably
wouldn't want to drink for a very long time.

794
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,280
What is this?

795
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,880
Ter.

796
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,510
Yes, dad?

797
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,510
I will go back this weekend.

798
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,030
Yes. See you.

799
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,910
- You're done?
- Umm.

800
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,250
Is he awake?

801
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,610
Yes, he's talking to Ter inside.

802
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,290
Wait.

803
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,450
You're not thinking of
doing anything funny, right?

804
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,450
I'm sorry about last night.

805
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,150
And thank you so much.

806
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:20,170
Also..I'm sorry that...

807
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,570
you puked all over me.

808
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:24,720
Yes.

809
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,980
It's okay. You just pay me back.

810
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,890
Pay?

811
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,890
For the damage you caused.

812
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,490
You need to pay all of that.

813
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:08,170
Damage fee.

814
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,910
You have to pay all of that.

815
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,750
I cannot afford just the damage fee alone.

816
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,570
He's charging me interest also.

817
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:15,630
That's why I'm looking for more jobs.

818
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:16,750
Oh.

819
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,150
I won't charge you.

820
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:20,430
But will you do anything as I said?

821
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,400
You said you ave had a crush on you for so long, right?

822
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:24,610
Yes.

823
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,610
You know me before that?

824
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,610
Ter.

825
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,750
Can I start everything over with you?
