1
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:19,185
Have you seen P'Hill's posts?

2
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:21,348
Who's the owner of the watch?

3
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,340
Or...it's you?

4
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,176
- I said enough.
- Let me go.

5
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,170
Hey let go.

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,810
Go to the room.

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,422
I told you to go to your room.

8
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,280
What is this?

9
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,336
Damage fee.

10
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:54,991
You have to pay all of that.

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,997
But this is a few hundred thousands.

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,296
I was just in a fight there.
Why do I have to pay this much?

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,017
What is this? Wine?
I don't even drink wine.

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,471
You did not drink.

15
00:01:08,164 --> 00:01:09,470
But you broke it.

16
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:13,482
- How?
- It was probably close to your hands.

17
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,294
And what's this?

18
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:16,894
What's the medical fee is for?

19
00:01:17,032 --> 00:01:18,478
Those guys wanted to claim with you.

20
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:20,370
And this? Clothing?

21
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,106
That have your vomit.

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,414
Almost a 100k.

23
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:25,954
Ughh I'm going crazy. Clothes for almost a 100k.

24
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,336
And why do I have to pay alone?

25
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:29,093
For the damage fee at the bar?

26
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:31,505
Litigant also has to pay. Not just me.

27
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,878
Those people already paid.

28
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,626
And the rest are for the damage you made at my home.

29
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,645
Me?

30
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,137
Here...my phone.

31
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:58,290
All broken. Cannot touch the screen.

32
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:59,481
It's broken.

33
00:01:59,511 --> 00:02:02,552
You broke it. You're responsible.
I'm not gonna let this go.

34
00:02:05,448 --> 00:02:06,114
Here.

35
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:08,620
This is not included with what you owe me.

36
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:20,342
Actually...

37
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,660
you can just give me some money to fix it.

38
00:02:24,508 --> 00:02:25,518
Too much work.

39
00:02:27,149 --> 00:02:29,080
And for all the damage fee,

40
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:31,220
can I do installment payment?

41
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:36,155
Yes.

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,063
But there'll be interest.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,330
- How much?
- 20%.

44
00:02:40,374 --> 00:02:43,155
I cannot afford just the damage fee alone.

45
00:02:43,188 --> 00:02:45,352
If you charge me interest too, how can I pay you back?

46
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:48,340
I don't even have the money to pay for the dorm either.

47
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:50,755
What am I gonna do, tell me?

48
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:52,198
I know!

49
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:53,742
Dude.

50
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,395
You can think about it later.

51
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,235
Customer is calling,

52
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,300
I have to go.

53
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:04,583
Again?

54
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,980
Yeah. Take care of this for me.

55
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:12,350
Yes?

56
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,302
He has work thing.

57
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,300
- Shall we go?
- Yes, I will.

58
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:24,441
You're so hurry.

59
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:26,835
If you were me,
you'd be in a hurry too.

60
00:03:27,084 --> 00:03:31,060
You wake up then you have hundreds of thousands.
If I crashed something again,

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,314
- what are you gonna do? Can you afford it?
- What are you talking about?

62
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:34,670
Let's go home!

63
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,168
Fine. Let's go.

64
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:38,160
There's something on your face,
let me see.

65
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,813
You're not hurt there anymore?

66
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:42,314
Why the hell did you poke me?

67
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:44,310
You're such a troublemaker.

68
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:53,314
Aunty Da. I'm gonna get going now.

69
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:54,699
Goodbye.

70
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,965
I have to go.

72
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,257
Check your belongings too.

73
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,451
- All good.
- You sure?

74
00:05:24,894 --> 00:05:26,010
Don't be sad.

75
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,518
Thank you so much, P'Hill.

76
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,946
And I'm sorry for troubling you.

77
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,717
It's okay.

78
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,539
Then could you excuse us?

79
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,118
Go.

80
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,472
Don't be sad, my friend.

81
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:46,168
You can make more money.

82
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:50,296
Just make some more.

83
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:51,640
Right?

84
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,958
What do you think of P'Johan?

85
00:05:57,977 --> 00:05:58,945
Why?

86
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:00,940
You're interested in him, aren't you?

87
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,974
He's my creditor.

88
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:07,054
I should know a few things about him.

89
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,325
But from what I've seen...

90
00:06:10,582 --> 00:06:12,320
he's a quiet person.

91
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,985
But he can also talk to people.

92
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,948
Eventhought he has...

93
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:18,845
some intimidating vibes sometimes.

94
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,680
Oh and P'Hill told me he gets mad easily.

95
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,680
You just don't do anything to make him mad.

96
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:26,180
- He's easily get mad?
- Yes.

97
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,577
And...

98
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:28,894
...when and how's he gonna be mad?

99
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:31,671
Hey how am I supposed to know everything?

100
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,945
I think only his friends...P'Hill, P'Fah, and P'Arthit....

101
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:37,511
that knows when to and whne not to talk to him.

102
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:41,186
- Very unpredictable, right?
- Yes.

103
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,180
You hang in there then.

104
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:44,663
Come on.

105
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,268
- Why don't you push the button?
- Why didn't you?

106
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:51,745
It's here.

107
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,405
Hey North.

108
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,340
What are you gonna do now?

109
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:07,340
It's a a big amount of money.

110
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:09,968
I think I will just do installment.

111
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,960
Maybe THB1,000 a week?

112
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:12,971
Huh!?

113
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,025
A THB1,000 a week?
You'll probably be paying until you graduate.

114
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:17,822
What do you want me to do?

115
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,534
I cannot afford just the damage fee alone.
He's charging me interest also.

116
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,530
What?

117
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:29,625
What?

118
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,337
Or should I just sell the phone?

119
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,330
Hey.

120
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:40,413
Or should I sell me shirt?
It's probably cost a lot.

121
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:45,607
What the hell?
Are you for real?

122
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:50,450
- I'm kidding.
- Huh!?

123
00:07:50,743 --> 00:07:52,450
You think I'm that pathetic?

124
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,450
Who knows?

125
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:56,549
To be honest,

126
00:07:57,485 --> 00:08:01,656
I'm still wondering
why was it P'Johan that come get me?

127
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,533
I also don't know.

128
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:07,530
But If you let me guess,

129
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:10,127
I think he just probably wants to take care of you.

130
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:15,934
Think about it.

131
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:20,091
Even the medical bill, he also paid for you.

132
00:08:20,256 --> 00:08:22,951
I think P'Hill knows, so he asked P'Johan to help.

133
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:25,848
Then add his LINE and thank him.

134
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:28,706
- Why would I do that?
- Hey.

135
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:31,788
You owe him.
You don't have much of a choice.

136
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:33,309
Do it.

137
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:35,284
Add him. Give me your phone.

138
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:38,140
- Come on. Add him.
- Fine.

139
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:41,711
Added.

140
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:43,710
Text him too.

141
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:45,551
- Text him?
- Yes.

142
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,954
Do it.

143
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:51,411
I did.

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,897
Good.

145
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,601
But is he...

146
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:56,171
gonna reply you?

147
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:59,730
Cause you use cute yellow ducky as a profile picture.

148
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,143
Why?

149
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:03,002
What's wrong with my duck?

150
00:09:03,517 --> 00:09:06,165
- He's cute. Do not bully my duck.
- Right. Right.

151
00:09:13,545 --> 00:09:14,933
You're the cutest.

152
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:22,471
Can't stop hugging huh.

153
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,106
Who's this? What a shitty profile pic.

154
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,758
It's North. Thank you again.

155
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,271
Umm. I had to spend a few 100k.

156
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,139
I will pay you back slowly.
I don't have much.

157
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,668
I will charge you interest.

158
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,791
Can you only charge me 2%?

159
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:54,896
...?

160
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,140
Can we do 3%?
If not I'll have to pay almost THB10,000.

161
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,850
How is it? Are you guys talking?

162
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:10,185
Yes.

163
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:12,585
I'm asking him to reduce the interest.

164
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:14,032
He read, but doesn't reply me.

165
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:16,625
Damn it.

166
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,620
He's overcharging so much.

167
00:10:19,882 --> 00:10:21,354
So greedy.

168
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,350
Come on.

169
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,370
You make a lot in a month.
You will pay up pretty soon.

170
00:10:26,631 --> 00:10:28,370
I don't even earn THB10,000.

171
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,988
I cannot pay just for the interest alone.

172
00:10:31,014 --> 00:10:34,634
Not to mention food, rent, and stuff.

173
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:37,574
Ter. I'm gonna die.

174
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:41,185
Don't die on me yet.

175
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,468
I think you just need to talk to him again.

176
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:44,714
Get up.

177
00:10:45,808 --> 00:10:51,099
I think I'll come up with some sort of begging phrases
for him to reduce me the interest.

178
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:53,814
Ter.

179
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:56,847
Do you wanna go get some food?
We will have to work later.

180
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:57,988
Huh?

181
00:10:58,139 --> 00:10:59,862
Huh? For real?

182
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,659
You look like this and wanna go to work?

183
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:05,197
Don't go. Just stay here.

184
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:06,822
I can't.

185
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:08,425
P'Yah will scold me.

186
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,337
Um. Let's go get some food then.

187
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,918
I will just go and hang with you. I already ate.

188
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:17,158
It's fine then. I'll ask Ket and Q instead.

189
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,352
I need to talk to them anyway.

190
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:22,000
I will just see you at P'Yah's then.

191
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:24,148
Are you sure?

192
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:26,623
Yes, I will just go change.

193
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:27,552
Okay. Okay.

194
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,294
Oh where's Sket?

195
00:11:40,087 --> 00:11:44,330
I already asked him,
but he said he wated to rest.

196
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,632
Why?

197
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:47,139
That bad?

198
00:11:48,485 --> 00:11:49,761
A bit.

199
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:52,149
What about you? How are you?

200
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:54,042
Look at my face.

201
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:55,980
With those little punches won't hurt me.

202
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:57,158
Sorry.

203
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:58,140
Really?

204
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,995
Here. Wanna get hurt some more?

205
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,188
You can't do that.
If my face has more bruises,

206
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,856
all the girls won't fall for me.

207
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,134
By the way...

208
00:12:09,358 --> 00:12:10,918
I'm sorry about last night.

209
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:12,910
Whatever.

210
00:12:13,044 --> 00:12:14,910
I intentionally fought with them too.

211
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,910
You didn't force me.

212
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,440
Just look snf Nhao.

213
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:21,440
Damn. He just went straight in.

214
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:22,850
More hot-headed than you.

215
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:23,718
- Really?
- Yes.

216
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:24,942
Is he alright?

217
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:27,404
He is the most alright one.

218
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,416
He's probably out playing footbal already.

219
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,370
Huh? Playing football?

220
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,389
Yes.

221
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:33,909
Oh.

222
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:40,287
And what else happened last night?
I couldn't remember anything.

223
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:44,154
Here's what happened.

224
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,792
North!

225
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:51,063
Ter called, so I told him that you were in trouble.

226
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,365
Did you know who came?

227
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:58,240
P'Johan.

228
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,794
I was so damn confused.

229
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:10,253
He just walked in. Cleared everything for you.
Pulled you away from Temp and just carried you out.

230
00:13:10,801 --> 00:13:12,429
Let me go.

231
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:13,702
Let go of me!

232
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:15,826
- Carry me?
- Yeah.

233
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,820
When he walked in,
people stepped back for him.

234
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,334
It was like he was giving some intimidating vibes.

235
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:23,480
- Are you crazy?
- I'm telling you the truth.

236
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:28,862
You don't believe me?
I'm telling you the truth.

237
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:32,948
It's possible.

238
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,105
If he's that mad until he could break my phone like that.

239
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,420
He probably looked intimidating.

240
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,536
Wait.

241
00:13:44,011 --> 00:13:44,961
Just now...

242
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,960
you said who broke your phone?

243
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:49,918
P'Johan.

244
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:52,438
He broke my phone.

245
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:53,792
Look.

246
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:55,790
Looks like someone freaking stomped on my phone.

247
00:13:56,429 --> 00:13:57,790
I cannot even turn it on.
Look.

248
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,790
Who told you that?

249
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:14,949
Shit.

250
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,940
And why didn't you tell me?

251
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:19,094
I was yelling at him like a lot.

252
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:22,930
Who's gonna have any idea
that you cannot remember anything?

253
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,285
Damn it.

254
00:14:31,826 --> 00:14:33,955
Oh you're here.

255
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,380
What's the matter?

256
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,854
Hey North.

257
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,222
What happened to your face?

258
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,017
I was in a bit of a trouble.

259
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,217
Oh my gosh.

260
00:14:49,311 --> 00:14:51,588
Your pretty face now has many bruises.

261
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,405
This is not you, North.

262
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,700
Does it hurt? Let me see.

263
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,637
It was not hurt,
but when you pressed like that...

264
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,630
- it is.
- Sorry.

265
00:15:01,173 --> 00:15:04,877
So what did you do to make these happened?
Can you work today?

266
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:06,930
I can. I'm all fine.

267
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,930
Don't let this happen again, okay?

268
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:10,930
Go go. Go change.

269
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,127
Yes.

270
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:14,850
Go go.

271
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,736
North. How are you?
Temp told me everything.

272
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:26,730
So what really happened? Can you tell me?

273
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,604
About the guy who helped you last night, he was a senior from his faculty. So he didn't want to cause more scene.

274
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,400
I will be waiting for your reply.
I'm worried about you. We're still friends.

275
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,047
What was happened last night?

276
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:37,040
Temp told me you suddenly just went straight in, but I know you better than that.

277
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,223
Or Temp has someone else?

278
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,268
You knew?

279
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:43,721
It's maybe not.

280
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,988
I just started 'dating Temp not so long ago
If this is true, I don't think I can be with him as well.

281
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,592
It could be just a misunderstading

282
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,122
I wish it was.

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,336
North. Can I text you again? As a friend?

284
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:04,330
I can be myself when I talk to you.

285
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:09,220
Sure, if I'm free I'll reply.

286
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,967
- North.
- Hey!

287
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,318
What are you doing?

288
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,960
You said you're not gonna talk to her again?

289
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:22,280
She texted me about the fight with her boyfriend.

290
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:23,540
Are you sure?

291
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:26,170
Don't let me find out that you have feelings for her again.

292
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:28,860
If you have to drink because of her again,
I'll kill you.

293
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,939
No more. I'm done.

294
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:38,017
But I still don't understand.
Why does she act like nothing happened? She's the one who dumped me.

295
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:40,414
Cause she sees you as a friend.

296
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:42,808
She can be herself when she talks to you.

297
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,294
Why are you repeating that to me?

298
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,216
You promise me that you won't go back to her?

299
00:16:47,478 --> 00:16:49,635
I don't wanna see you like last night again.

300
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:54,035
Yeah, I won't go back for sure.

301
00:16:54,312 --> 00:16:55,717
Umm.

302
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:03,432
I will wait outside.

303
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:08,666
Sure babe.

304
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,988
Don't say that. I miss you.

305
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,594
The beef is here.

306
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,586
- North. North.
- Yes?

307
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,768
Can you give this order outside?

308
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:25,219
- Yes, P'Yah.
- Thank you.

309
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:27,797
Ok, I will see you.
Okay?

310
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,186
Oh.

311
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:34,180
What are you doing here, P'Johan?

312
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:37,320
Oh.

313
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:40,888
Er...

314
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:44,002
About the phone...

315
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:45,632
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:45,802 --> 00:17:48,496
- I didn't know that...
- About the interest.

317
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:51,150
Can you please reduce the interest rate for me?

318
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,520
I will slowly pay you back.

319
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:00,072
I won't charge you interest rate.

320
00:18:00,976 --> 00:18:03,682
But will you do everything I ask instead?

321
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:06,871
Are you really not gonna charge me any interest?

322
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,042
Are you willing to do anything I say or not?

323
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:11,306
What do you want me to do?

324
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:18,503
Yes?

325
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,666
Let's talk later.

326
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,171
Oh wait P'Johan. About my interest--

327
00:18:26,247 --> 00:18:27,437
Thank you.

328
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:32,197
Why were you out for so long?

329
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,746
It's P'Johan.

330
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,134
P'Johan? What did he do?

331
00:18:37,331 --> 00:18:39,192
He said he won't charge me interest anymore.

332
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,576
Hey really?

333
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:42,740
It's good. I know. It helps me a lot.

334
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,297
But he said...

335
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,952
I have to do everything that he says.

336
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,118
- Everything?
- Yeah.

337
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,605
Everything as in what?

338
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:54,053
Right.

339
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,949
I also have no clue.

340
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,349
He just answered his phone and left.

341
00:18:59,124 --> 00:19:01,131
If he wants me to be his assistant,

342
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:02,579
is not so bad.

343
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,800
He said you need to do everthing thought.

344
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:09,874
What if he asked you to do illegal stuff?
You might be in more trouble though.

345
00:19:09,912 --> 00:19:11,870
It won't be that bad.

346
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,401
Or will it?

347
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:18,850
Or will it be that bad?

348
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:19,610
No it won't.

349
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,120
Maybe.

350
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,120
I think so.

351
00:19:27,745 --> 00:19:29,687
Are you guys not working?

352
00:19:29,807 --> 00:19:31,154
No, we are.

353
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:36,385
- Customers are here. Seat them. Hello~
- Please come in.

354
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,866
Inside please.

355
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:41,198
Come on in.

356
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,151
P'Yah, you're not working?

357
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,020
Why are you standing here?

358
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,020
This boy...go.

359
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,868
We're gonna go home now, P'Yah.

360
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:05,565
- Bye.
- Yes. Thank you for today.

361
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:07,647
And how are you going back?

362
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:11,558
Of Hill will come pick you guys up like usual?

363
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:13,256
Yes.

364
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:17,051
I'm really jealous of you, Ter.

365
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:19,690
I wanna have someone come pick me up like this too.

366
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,788
To be honest, I'm actually annoyed.

367
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,358
When it's the three of us together,
I feel like I'm the air.

368
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:27,557
But it's fine,
I also get the benefits from their relationship.

369
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,980
- I can bear it.
- Enough North!

370
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,991
- I'm gonna go. See you, P'Yah.
- Always tease each other.

371
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,860
- Go go.
- Always like this when you're blushing.

372
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:36,860
- North.
- Sigh. Someone is in love.

373
00:20:37,121 --> 00:20:38,237
I get it.

374
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:39,856
You're teasing us...

375
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,945
but I saw you were talking to a guy earlier.

376
00:20:43,608 --> 00:20:44,644
What guy?

377
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,192
I talked to a girl kub.
<i>(Kub is a polite particle used by men to end sentences in formal or respectful way)</i>

378
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,189
Kub you said?

379
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:50,801
- Bye.
- Bye.

380
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,294
Are you exhausted?

381
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:03,851
Not at all.

382
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:06,340
- Hello North.
- Hello P'Hill.

383
00:21:06,856 --> 00:21:08,315
Do you wana go have dinner?

384
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,933
Yes.

385
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,183
Do you want anything else, North?

386
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:28,890
No more.

387
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:31,019
Here.

388
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,960
Oh P'Hill.

389
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,380
Today P'Johan went to see North at work too.

390
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,545
Johan?

391
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,278
And he said he won't charge North any interest anymore.

392
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:52,880
But under one condition.
North has to do everything that he says.

393
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:54,940
He said that?

394
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:56,637
Yes.

395
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,552
What does he want me to do?

396
00:21:59,536 --> 00:22:00,968
I also don't know.

397
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:04,389
And did you ask him? What does he want?

398
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,832
I did.

399
00:22:07,102 --> 00:22:08,965
But someone called him.

400
00:22:09,586 --> 00:22:12,404
He just answered the phone and left.

401
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:14,805
He's a bit busy lately.

402
00:22:15,127 --> 00:22:17,773
Try texting him.
I already gave you his LINE.

403
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,640
I will.

404
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:28,240
Thank you.

405
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,191
Shall we go?

406
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:31,548
- Sure.
- Yes.

407
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,928
- Are you full?
- I am.

408
00:22:37,395 --> 00:22:39,280
Dude you're full and don't have to pay.

409
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,386
Dude. What does he do for wokr?

410
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:55,724
Huh.

411
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:58,522
What? I'm just asking.

412
00:22:58,823 --> 00:23:00,022
Oh.

413
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:02,853
Probably his family business.

414
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,654
Working for his family business?

415
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:07,502
You don't think it's true?

416
00:23:09,174 --> 00:23:10,751
Just lookt at him.

417
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:14,694
If you told me, he's just fooling around everyday.
I would believe that.

418
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:18,739
What should I do?

419
00:23:19,256 --> 00:23:20,687
Do what?

420
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:23,617
Just text him.
Ask him what does he want you to do.

421
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:24,832
That's it.

422
00:23:24,885 --> 00:23:27,914
You owe him.
You don't want to b charged with interest.

423
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,565
Just do it.

424
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:31,380
It's true.

425
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:34,037
But what if he wanted me to do bad things like you said?

426
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:36,906
But if you don't text him,
you'll never find out.

427
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:38,994
What should I do, Ter?

428
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,379
When you said 'do anything that you say',
what do you mean by this?

429
00:23:57,391 --> 00:24:00,198
If it's not too much for me, I think I can do it.
Or you can reduce interest rate just a little.

430
00:24:03,217 --> 00:24:04,642
He read!

431
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:10,400
Dude.

432
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:13,262
He read but doesn't reply.

433
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:14,740
Should I text him another one?

434
00:24:14,835 --> 00:24:16,957
Sure. You can.

435
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,845
If you're not worried that
he'll be annoyed.

436
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:21,185
Don't sasy that.

437
00:24:21,604 --> 00:24:23,294
I just wanna know.

438
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:26,180
What if he changed his mind?

439
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:27,945
It's THB10,000,
we're talking about.

440
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,016
Up to you.

441
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,900
Are you working now?

442
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,608
I don't want to bother you,
but can you give me a bit of your time?

443
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,342
I just wanna know when you said you won't charge me interest,

444
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:05,770
did you really mean it?

445
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,278
He read but doesn't reply again.

446
00:25:15,537 --> 00:25:19,115
He's probably annoyed now. I think.

447
00:25:20,675 --> 00:25:21,462
Hey.

448
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:23,848
He's replying.

449
00:25:24,228 --> 00:25:25,840
Answer in 5 seconds.

450
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:33,565
Hello?

451
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,554
Are you working?

452
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:43,211
Yes, I'm too lazy to text.
What's up?

453
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:47,995
I wanted to ask you about the interest.

454
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:51,100
Do we have a deal or not?

455
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:52,579
Well...

456
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:56,398
when you said 'Everything that you say'...

457
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:58,390
what kind of things do I have to do?

458
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,591
If it's not too much,
I think I can do it.

459
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:06,122
And what is too much for you?

460
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,204
Like...make me do illegal stuff.

461
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,574
Deal some drugs.

462
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:13,998
Stealing people's purses.

463
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:15,905
Rob the gold shop.

464
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:18,647
Or hurt other people.

465
00:26:18,755 --> 00:26:20,936
I can't do those thing bro.

466
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:25,536
You're not gonna make me do those weird things, right?

467
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:29,198
And do you think
you're capable of doinf those things?

468
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:31,190
No.

469
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:34,300
It's not gonna be things
that out of your capabilty.

470
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,348
Cool.

471
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,672
I'm not capable of doing that many things too.

472
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:38,682
Good.

473
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,127
Then cancel the offer.
You're useless.

474
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,690
Er...let's just say...

475
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:48,517
I will do everything that you ask then.

476
00:26:49,037 --> 00:26:51,232
You need to cancel the interest rate for me.

477
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:53,288
Umm.

478
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,834
But...

479
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,638
if you upset me,

480
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,357
I'll charge you daily interest rate.

481
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:00,377
Hey how so?

482
00:27:01,002 --> 00:27:03,062
You're not happy?

483
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:05,496
Yes, I am.

484
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:09,601
And...

485
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:11,315
what makes you upset?

486
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:12,798
Think.

487
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,429
Hey. How am I supposed to know?

488
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:18,720
Just be quiet.

489
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:20,100
Don't fall asleep.

490
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:21,838
And don't mke any noise.

491
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:26,174
You mean you just want to be here?

492
00:27:38,737 --> 00:27:40,048
Do you want me to talk to you?

493
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:48,142
Hey you want me to be here,
so I need to talk.

494
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:52,367
When my ex, Jah, wanted to hang,
she wanted me to talk to her.

495
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,182
I'm not your ex.

496
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:02,416
Fine.

497
00:28:03,321 --> 00:28:04,893
I'll be quiet.

498
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,727
P'Johan.

499
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:16,317
I'm sleepy.

500
00:28:16,358 --> 00:28:17,958
How long left?

501
00:28:18,604 --> 00:28:19,917
For awhile more.

502
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:27,211
You work late like this everyday?

503
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,949
No, just somedays.

504
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,111
Can you talk to me?

505
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:38,133
I want you to just hang around.

506
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,777
Do I need to talk to you too?

507
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,373
Ugh.. I'm just sleepy.

508
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,090
Then you tell me your stories.

509
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,502
Hey...about me?

510
00:28:48,463 --> 00:28:51,623
I have many stories though.
Which one would you like to hear?

511
00:28:55,945 --> 00:28:57,134
Hello. I'm North.

512
00:28:57,546 --> 00:29:01,242
North. Natchanan.
First year engineering student.

513
00:29:01,417 --> 00:29:02,582
Woah~

514
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:05,290
Just the opening already makes me so cool, huh?

515
00:29:05,355 --> 00:29:07,087
My roommate is Easter.

516
00:29:07,217 --> 00:29:09,737
I'm an easy goin person. Pretty chill.

517
00:29:09,752 --> 00:29:11,730
Not too serious about lfe.

518
00:29:12,564 --> 00:29:13,828
I'm pretty joyful, delighted,

519
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:16,699
cute and also easy to feed.

520
00:29:16,817 --> 00:29:22,237
I'm always humble with elders and a good friend to all.
I also respect everyone.

521
00:29:22,783 --> 00:29:24,737
You can say that for yourself?

522
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:28,771
Not me who says that.
It's on my report card to my parents.

523
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,401
But...

524
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:34,240
The cute and easy to feed part,
I added on just now.

525
00:29:43,189 --> 00:29:45,671
Can you tell me about yourself too?

526
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:49,274
- Why medical school?
- Just stay quiet.

527
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:54,840
But I'm sleepy.

528
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,594
I'm not a coffee persn like you.

529
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,500
How do you know?

530
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,032
I just guess.

531
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:04,745
You always work so late,
you must be addicted to coffee.

532
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,740
Hey.

533
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:08,743
I'm about to take a course how to make coffee.

534
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,512
I will let you try mine when I make one.

535
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,481
Learn how to make coffee?

536
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:16,638
Yes.

537
00:30:16,717 --> 00:30:20,368
I actually work at a coffee shop you know?

538
00:30:20,691 --> 00:30:21,722
Which shop?

539
00:30:22,226 --> 00:30:23,890
Nearby the campus.

540
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:25,291
Work with Easter there.

541
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:26,795
You wanns make more money?

542
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:27,816
For sure.

543
00:30:27,844 --> 00:30:29,918
I have so much debt like this.

544
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:34,527
To be honest,
I actually want to find a few more jobs.

545
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,460
But I'm not charging you interest anymore.

546
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:39,875
Hey who knows?

547
00:30:40,478 --> 00:30:42,309
What if you want to charge all of a sudden?

548
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,300
You're unpredictable too.

549
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,974
Can I ask you something?

550
00:30:58,641 --> 00:31:01,442
Does the person who hangs with you here
complain anything?

551
00:31:03,192 --> 00:31:04,164
No.

552
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:07,442
No?

553
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,657
I never let anyone hung with me.

554
00:31:12,607 --> 00:31:14,152
Don't ask too many question, can you?

555
00:31:16,223 --> 00:31:17,617
Fine.

556
00:31:35,155 --> 00:31:36,117
North.

557
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:40,266
North.

558
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:42,268
North.

559
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:44,419
North.

560
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:15,551
If you're tire, just go lay down properly.

561
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:23,663
Stop working part time jobs, understood?

562
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:57,337
North.

563
00:32:58,708 --> 00:32:59,946
I'm rooting for you dude.

564
00:33:05,314 --> 00:33:09,321
About P'Jo. I saw you guys talking to each other. So cute.
I'm your shipper.

565
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,137
More like ship-hai.
(Means f*cked in Thai)

566
00:33:13,394 --> 00:33:15,069
Wait.

567
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:17,902
How do you know?

568
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,900
Oops.

569
00:33:20,912 --> 00:33:23,543
- You were eavesdropping?
- I did not.

570
00:33:23,554 --> 00:33:24,764
I just overheard.

571
00:33:24,797 --> 00:33:26,580
But I didn't hear you say clearly.

572
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:29,309
Just some cute sound parts.

573
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:31,300
- It was cute.
- Cute your ass!

574
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:33,300
Stop it.

575
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:36,481
Too bad..I'm already a JohanNorth shipper.

576
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,632
Stop babbling and go to your class.

577
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,804
I'm gonna go now~

578
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:43,680
Yeah.

579
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:47,823
My friend won't be lonely,
cause he always have someone to talk to all day.

580
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,395
- Bye bye~
- Yeah.

581
00:33:55,696 --> 00:33:56,943
What?

582
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:08,460
- Everything's all good today?
- Yes, Mr.President.

583
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:10,460
Then please take care of the rest.

584
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,177
P'Hill.

585
00:34:25,225 --> 00:34:28,270
Today seniors are gathering with all the first years,
can I join them?

586
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:29,442
Sure thing.

587
00:34:29,546 --> 00:34:31,600
You already took many pictures today.

588
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:32,602
Thank you.

589
00:34:32,714 --> 00:34:34,060
Do you have any class today?

590
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:35,921
Yes in the afternoon.

591
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:39,154
- I will take you there.
- It's fine, P'Hill.

592
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:41,518
You should be here. I will go there myself.

593
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:02,591
That's lovely.

594
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:07,179
Do you like it?

595
00:35:08,394 --> 00:35:09,813
I do.

596
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,309
I do too.

597
00:36:00,954 --> 00:36:02,200
We probably have everyone, right?

598
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:08,780
I'm announcing that you have exactly 1 week to find your code senior.
(Seniors who have corresponding student code)

599
00:36:08,968 --> 00:36:12,647
You will be given with clues abut your code senior.

600
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:25,637
I will see you at the same activity area tomorrow.

601
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,400
So from what you told...

602
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:42,284
you basically have to pay him back?

603
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:45,305
Yeah that's why I'm looking for more jobs here.

604
00:36:45,478 --> 00:36:46,491
Dude.

605
00:36:46,817 --> 00:36:49,777
Let me know if you need any help.
I feel guilty.

606
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:52,367
You didn't think like this when you got in a fight.

607
00:36:52,414 --> 00:36:53,977
You were the most hot-headed one.

608
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:53,980
They punched my friend.
I cannot just stand there.
You were the most hot-headed one.

609
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,518
They punched my friend.
I cannot just stand there.

610
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:56,520
- So you had to punched them back?
- Yeah.
They punched my friend.
I cannot just stand there.

611
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,110
- So you had to punched them back?
- Yeah.

612
00:36:58,114 --> 00:37:00,634
Ughh enough. No need to argue.

613
00:37:01,515 --> 00:37:03,828
My debt is not actually caused by the bar.

614
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,499
It's actually from myself.

615
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:07,582
I caused all that myself.

616
00:37:07,638 --> 00:37:08,819
Anyway...

617
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:11,085
just let us know if you need our help.

618
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:19,773
Hello North. I'm Prang, Johan's assistant.

619
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:21,770
I will be handling his accounting.

620
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:23,770
If you'd like to Johan back,
please inform me.

621
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,770
But if Johan would like to deduct the amount,
I will also let you know.

622
00:37:28,077 --> 00:37:29,420
Wait.

623
00:37:29,442 --> 00:37:32,069
You said you need to make money to pay him back.

624
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,060
But how come you have the new phone?

625
00:37:36,197 --> 00:37:38,508
- P'Johan bought it for me.
- Damn.

626
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:41,844
You blamed him for breaking your phone,
but he still bought you a new one?

627
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:43,225
So?

628
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:45,792
I think there's something's going on.

629
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,312
That night P'Johan came to get you.

630
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,922
He also bought you a new phone.

631
00:37:50,994 --> 00:37:53,943
I was also wondering why did he come get you.

632
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:56,654
There's no something.

633
00:37:56,878 --> 00:37:58,668
There's nothing going on.

634
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,637
Don't think for yourself.

635
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:05,585
I heard that Ter in your shipper.

636
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:07,908
Can I also join the ship?
I will help paddle.

637
00:38:08,112 --> 00:38:11,805
Go paddle at your own place.
I will just sink all of your ships.

638
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:14,457
Now you're suddenly all on the same page.

639
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,228
We haven't started paddling
but the ship is already sunk.

640
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:20,293
Why? Are you shy?

641
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,982
- Are you blushing?
- I'm gonna go to class. It's time.

642
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:30,238
- You're suddenly wanna go to the class?
- I always want to go to the class.

643
00:38:31,229 --> 00:38:34,254
Do you even have any idea
what's the topic?

644
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:35,748
You're babbling.

645
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,031
Look.

646
00:38:50,548 --> 00:38:51,968
The girls wll be swooning.

647
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:53,882
What a guy.

648
00:38:54,103 --> 00:38:57,586
Clothes are undone.
The hair is not set, but still manage to look so good.

649
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:00,680
Are you gonna be swooning too?

650
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:05,240
You should meet him in the version that I met.
You might not be swooning after all.

651
00:39:05,758 --> 00:39:07,240
Are you trying flaunt or what?

652
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:15,125
You're not interested?

653
00:39:15,207 --> 00:39:19,034
He's both handsome and rich.

654
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,740
He also gave me debt.

655
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,820
I think if you become his boyfriend,

656
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:29,620
you will be given 100% remission.

657
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,510
Nonsense. Just pay attention to the class.

658
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,600
Hey.

659
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,440
I passed.

660
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,780
Wanna go back to sleep already.

661
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,870
The term has just started.
Don’t complain yet.

662
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,580
I’m sleepy.

663
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,350
What? You guys!

664
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,000
So what, Foam? Are you gonna skip the class?

665
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,320
Can I?

666
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,980
Can you check attendance for me tomorrow?

667
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,130
Easy there.

668
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,720
Foam…you cannot just fool around
like you did in high school anymore.

669
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,450
It’s a big thing, if you failed in university.

670
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,800
You two are so whiny.
My parents do not even complain to me this much.

671
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,180
Cause you do not pay attention in the class.

672
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,790
It’s not like you pay much attention.

673
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,650
Cause you always talk to me.

674
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,830
Stop it. Why are you guys arguing?
The professor might scold at you.

675
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,990
Just be focused.

676
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,400
I already wanna leave.

677
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,650
That’s it for today guys. Class dismissed.

678
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,640
Thank you.

679
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,640
- Are you done with the class?
- Umm.

680
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:01,840
As you wished.

681
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,750
Are you guys going home right away?

682
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,020
We have club thing today. You forgot?

683
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,530
Right.

684
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,370
- Are you guys going?
- Yes.

685
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,530
North and I already promised Daotok
to be there.

686
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,030
I think I’m gonna stop by the club
before going home.

687
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,740
What about you Phoon?

688
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:21,390
If Ter goes, I’ll go.

689
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,050
I will go too.

690
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,260
Let’s go.

691
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,620
You’re suddenly determined

692
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,620
when it’s not related to the class.

693
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,270
Dude.

694
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,380
Why there’s no one
signing up for our club?

695
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,460
When is Ter gonna be here?

696
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,750
He said he has arrived.

697
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,240
But he took Foam to check out some other clubs.

698
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,660
Are you gonna apply for other clubs too, North?

699
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,970
I don’t know.

700
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,260
But maybe more.

701
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,260
I will just check out later.

702
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,190
Do you know anyone
who’s looking for a club to join?

703
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,930
Maybe you can ask them to join ours?

704
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,140
Why? The less people, the better.

705
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,620
So we won’t have too many fuss.

706
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:08,900
I’m afraid that we might got cut down the budget.

707
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,510
So…

708
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,400
I'll ask my engineering friends to join first then.
We might gain several.

709
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,790
Here. I did.

710
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,890
Hey.

711
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,270
I will have Ter ask his medical senior.

712
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,460
He has so many friends.

713
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,960
Medical senior?

714
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,760
Umm. It’s P’Hill.

715
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:33,710
If P’Hill joins, many people will be interested in our club more.

716
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,700
For sure.

717
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,700
I will tell Ter first.

718
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,310
Daotok said if we have a few people in our club,
we might have to shut down.

719
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:52,310
You better start finding more people to join.
You can ask anyone. Could be P’Hill and his friends.

720
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,310
Just hurry. Daotok is crying.

721
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,620
Hey Ter!

722
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,890
- Hey P’Arthit.
- Hello.

723
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,700
Are you in any club?

724
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,640
Yes, I am.

725
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,390
Hmm? Which club?

726
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:11,790
Drawing.

727
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:16,100
Oh I thought you’re joining Basketball club with Hill.

728
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,030
Probably not for me.

729
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,720
You’re in Football club?

730
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,580
I am the club president.

731
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,440
So cool.

732
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:32,440
So? Are we in this club or what?

733
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:36,070
Sure. I wanna join some sport clubs anyway.

734
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,230
Deal.

735
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,030
Okay.

736
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,680
So I will have Hill coming around to my club more often then?

737
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,580
A jealous type like him,

738
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,760
he won’t let you out of his sight easily.

739
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,630
And…

740
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,650
which club are P’Johan and Tonfah joining?

741
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,070
Fah is in tennis’s.

742
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,930
For Johan and Hill, they are in Basketball’s.

743
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,180
There…

744
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,490
speaking of the devil.

745
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,000
What’s up Fah? How’s your club doing?

746
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,150
Mine is already full.

747
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,520
- What about yours?
- Also full.

748
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:23,010
You?

749
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,090
Is there anyone joining a club
with a president like you?

750
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:30,480
At least Ter is joining mine.

751
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,450
You want to join Football club?

752
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,530
- Yes.
- I feel like I wanna join Football club.

753
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,090
So? Are you in Fah? Jo?

754
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,750
Are you in any club yet, Ter?

755
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,490
I’m actually in Drawing club at the moment.

756
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,960
- Drawing club?
- Yes.

757
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,400
Do you wanna go check out my club?

758
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,290
We need more people.

759
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,780
Let’s go.

760
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,800
Go. Let’s go.

761
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:10,670
Fah, come join Football with me.

762
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,720
- Yeah.
- Come on.

763
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,190
- Not convenient for me.
- Go.

764
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,630
This club gathers every Friday
at the old Fine Arts building.

765
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,100
You go in at 4pm and you’ll be out no later by 6pm.

766
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,120
Interesting.

767
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:27,960
If P’Hill joins, many people will be interested in our club more for sure.

768
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:30,660
It’s true.

769
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,610
You said Daotok is earlier huh?

770
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,650
Really? I said that?

771
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,650
You lied to me.

772
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:45,490
Help.

773
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,250
Can I sign up for my friends now then?

774
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:49,800
Yes.

775
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,930
That’s great P’Hill.
Write a lot of names down please. The more. The merrier.

776
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,850
What’s your plan after this? Where are you going next?

777
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,480
No plan.

778
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,050
Do you wanna go eat something?

779
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,850
Umm.

780
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,000
What would you like to eat?

781
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,230
Anything. Up to you.

782
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:10,000
Do you wanna go to the market?

783
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,510
Let’s go.

784
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,960
- See you.
- Bye, P’Hill.

785
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:16,950
- Are we leaving now?
- Let’s go.

786
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:25,810
Do you call that Mauhom shirt?

787
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,830
Yes.

788
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,250
You want one?

789
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,650
It’s okay.

790
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,070
It’s beautiful.

791
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,630
That elephant pants are also cute

792
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,380
Looks so comfortable to wear.

793
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,620
You want one?

794
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,610
Sure.

795
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,960
Do we need to hold hands?

796
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,650
You might get lost.

797
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,460
Why?

798
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,530
You don’t want other people to see?

799
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,560
No.

800
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,240
Just feel a bit weird.

801
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,780
How?

802
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,580
I’m just not used to it. I guess.

803
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,100
Then I will have to hold your hands more, so you can get used to.

804
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:19,540
Hi. This is my favorite longan drink.

805
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:20,790
I will have one please.

806
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:22,070
Not so sweet.

807
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,420
Drinkable?

808
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,520
Would you like to try?

809
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,510
Good?

810
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:45,790
Sorry.

811
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,370
Here.

812
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:03,970
Thank you.

813
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,270
Can I help you pay? I don’t want you to always be the one who pays.

814
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:11,350
Then I will be something else in exchange then.

815
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,690
What is it?

816
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,300
I’m not telling you yet.

817
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,730
Do you want anything else?

818
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,890
I don’t know. I will just walk around some more.

819
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,620
Sure. Let’s walk.

820
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,500
Does this look good?

821
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,800
You’re not eating?

822
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,950
I am.

823
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,670
Feed me.

824
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,810
No.

825
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,700
Please.

826
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:01,530
Here.

827
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:10,740
How was it? Is it good?

828
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,840
It’s so good.

829
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,760
Whatever you feed me are always good.

830
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,860
- Really.
- I don’t believe you.

831
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,340
Does this look good?

832
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,230
It does.

833
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,560
- Ter.
- Yes?

834
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,660
Tell me.

835
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,890
Tell you what?

836
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,330
Since when did you like me?

837
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:15,320
You’re asking me directly like this, I’m too shy to answer.

838
00:50:16,830 --> 00:50:18,810
Please tell me.

839
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:19,970
Please.

840
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,560
Really wanna know.

841
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,940
Why would you want to know?

842
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,490
Cause if my crush likes me back, I would like to know how.

843
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,440
Anyone would like to know.

844
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,460
Then think of it as a way to thank me
for buying you snacks today.

845
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,450
Sounds good?

846
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,820
You already planned this.

847
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:09,190
But…

848
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,960
I still don’t understand.

849
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,010
You told me you have had a crush on me
for so long already, right?

850
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:17,720
Yes.

851
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:20,620
Then…

852
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:24,480
you have had a crush on me since high school?

853
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,430
Yes.

854
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,930
That means you know be even before then?

855
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,950
Yes.

856
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,230
You have had a crush on me
since when I returned your notebook?

857
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,110
Yes.

858
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,100
I had no idea.

859
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,340
That’s not surprising.

860
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:00,420
We didn’t get to know each other properly back then.

861
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,870
You never told me anything.

862
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:09,330
I can be shy too you know.

863
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,490
What about you?

864
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,580
I…

865
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,230
have had a crush on you since the beginning.

866
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,850
Beginning?

867
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,980
Yeah right in the start.

868
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,810
When we got to know each other.

869
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,260
I remember that so well.

870
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,340
You transferred to our school
in the middle of the term.

871
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,210
You liked to play basketball with your friends
and teachers always scolded at you guys when you played.

872
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,380
That’s when I met you.

873
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,850
But I think around that time, you didn’t know me yet.

874
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,920
I did.

875
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:52,950
Really?

876
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:54,950
Really.

877
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,950
Ter

878
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,950
That’s not the first time though.

879
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,900
Hey.

880
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,740
How?

881
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,060
So you are interested in me since then?

882
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:09,550
Yes.

883
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:13,090
I was very impressed by you.

884
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:15,200
You were really good in school.

885
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:17,500
Great in sport as well.

886
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,900
And when we got to know each other more.

887
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,240
I know that you’re a very kind person.

888
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,010
- So I just...
- You just started to like me?

889
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,130
That’s nice.

890
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:41,560
If I knew that you have liked me since then would be great.

891
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,720
Stop talking already.

892
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:58,570
Can I start everything over with you again?

893
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,050
I love you, Ter.

894
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,840
I love you too.

895
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,230
Oh North.

896
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:27,120
When you said you need to find more part time jobs,
are you sure you can handle it?

897
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,330
Yes, I can. My creditor is so unpredictable.

898
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,370
What are you doing after?

899
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,220
I have to go work for my new job.

900
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,150
At a bar?

901
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,920
If you go,
P’Johan will be very angry at you.

902
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,220
