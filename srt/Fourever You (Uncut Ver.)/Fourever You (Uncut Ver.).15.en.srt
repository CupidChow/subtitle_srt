1
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,944
When I go to Boston,

2
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:21,249
are you gonna miss me?

3
00:00:21,636 --> 00:00:23,390
Of course. I will.

4
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,305
What's the matter?

5
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:27,375
You look a little pale.

6
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:29,169
You said you're not gonna get sick, huh?

7
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,532
How should I punish a stubborn kid?

8
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:35,241
P'Johan...

9
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:38,903
I like you.

10
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:43,078
You want money?

11
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:46,268
Send me your video clip. I will pay you THB100 a second.

12
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:50,899
I miss you.

13
00:00:51,904 --> 00:00:53,801
I'm waiting for you to come back.

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,198
Why don't you talk more?

15
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:11,980
It's only 20 secs.

16
00:01:12,217 --> 00:01:13,720
That's equivalent to THB2,000.

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,592
I don't know what else to say.

18
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,697
Hey.

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,554
Damn!

20
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,840
- 700,000.
- 700,000.

21
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:25,360
Why 700,000?

22
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,230
Oh.

23
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,567
I think...

24
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:31,386
it's not a THB100 per second.

25
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,710
But it's actually $100 per second.

26
00:01:33,714 --> 00:01:34,845
That's a lot of money.

27
00:01:36,356 --> 00:01:37,430
Wow..

28
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,400
Are you buying our lunch?

29
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:01,945
What's wrong?
Why are you looking so stressed?

30
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,601
Physic's exam result is out.

31
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:06,304
I did so bad.

32
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,264
Huh!?
Since when do you care about school?

33
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:11,876
P'Jo kinda tutored me for this subject.

34
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:14,480
Even he was very busy.

35
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:18,092
It's fine.

36
00:02:18,696 --> 00:02:20,642
You did your best, right?

37
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,461
Come on.

38
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,820
And how long has it been that he's gone to Boston?

39
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,379
4 days.

40
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,130
Do you miss him?

41
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,980
- Enough with the teasing.
- Hey.

42
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:35,708
I'm seriously asking you.

43
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,778
What would you say?

44
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:40,540
If it was P'Hill who went to Boston?

45
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,238
Awww...it's alright. It won't be that long.

46
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:47,060
Only 2 weeks and he'll be back.

47
00:02:50,247 --> 00:02:52,683
I really wanna fast forward the time.

48
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,140
Why are you looking distracted?

49
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,056
Here.

50
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,307
- You're home?
- Yeah.

51
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:48,616
Hey.

52
00:03:48,787 --> 00:03:50,296
I'm going to sleep.

53
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm gonna turn off the light, okay?

54
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,450
Um.

55
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:57,615
Don't think too much.

56
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:58,740
Smile.

57
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:01,070
Yeah.

58
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,406
Good night.

59
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:11,238
You should go to bed too.

60
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,940
- The truck only delivered the ice out front. We have to carry it so far.
- So damn heavy.

61
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,400
You're looking like a sad dog there.

62
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,570
You're missing him that much?

63
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,890
Yeah.

64
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,280
I texted him but he hasn't replied me.

65
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,960
If you're worried, why don't you just call him?

66
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,130
I don't wanna disturb him.

67
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,670
Hey.

68
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,530
If you can't do anything,

69
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,230
then why don't you come help us?

70
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,180
Can't you see what we are doing?

71
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,630
He probably doesn't want to do it.

72
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,760
The gear event.

73
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,640
I's for you to come with your lovers.

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,300
But his boyfriend won't be here.

75
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,520
Oh.

76
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,580
My poor friend.

77
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,000
It's okay.

78
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,820
Ughh. I don't have a boyfriend.

79
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,550
Hey wait.

80
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,340
You guys are not boyfriends yet?

81
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,420
Why?

82
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,590
Or...

83
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,540
he hasn't asked you yet?

84
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,290
He's in a real bad shape.

85
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,880
With his conditions,

86
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,260
he needs to see the doctor.

87
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,650
What kind of doctor?

88
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,270
Doctor Johan.

89
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,710
You guys are so funny huh?

90
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,250
I'm gonna go.

91
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,570
- Where are you going?
- Go see Ter.

92
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,260
Hey don't be mad.

93
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,020
Aren't you gonna come back and help us?

94
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
No.

95
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,460
What's the matter with him?

96
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,700
What are you drawing?

97
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,260
Here.

98
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,580
There.

99
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,420
P'Hill. P'Fah. Hello!

100
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,580
- Oh hi.
- Hi.

101
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,260
What about me?

102
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,230
Why do I have to say hi to you?

103
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,660
- You guys are working?
- Um.

104
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,170
We also have to do for Jo's.

105
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,180
P'Hill.

106
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,330
Have you been talking to P'Jo?

107
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,240
Why?

108
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,980
You miss him?

109
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,090
Well...

110
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,400
...yes.

111
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,440
Then call him.

112
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,720
I do not dare to call him.

113
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
I'm afraid I might some how disturb him

114
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,630
You can call him.

115
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,540
If he's busy, then he just won't answer.

116
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,570
Don't be afraid.

117
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,560
I'll call for you.

118
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,430
Why are you such a chicken?

119
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,874
What's up?

120
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,820
Are you drowning with work to death?

121
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,578
Are you cursing me or something?

122
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,920
I'm just worried about you.

123
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,091
I'm still alive.

124
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,076
What about him? How is he?

125
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,410
He's good.

126
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,980
If you're worried, why don't you give him a call?

127
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,580
Don't you wanna talk to him?

128
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:09,416
It's not like that.

129
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,299
If I talk to him, I even wanna go home more.

130
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:14,518
Just hearing his voice,

131
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,900
I can just leave all my work here behind.

132
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,100
But he misses you.

133
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:29,958
Really? As much as I miss him?

134
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,029
Oh tell him this for me, about the exam result.

135
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,078
he doesn't have to think too much.

136
00:09:45,109 --> 00:09:46,356
He's done well.

137
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,100
I will tell him for you.

138
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,160
You can go back to work now.

139
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,120
I will call you when necessary.

140
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,050
I told you. See!? It's nothing.
You don't have to be overthinking.

141
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,230
It's alright. He will be back in a few days.

142
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,460
Oh.

143
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,700
Can you give this to him when he's back?

144
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,010
What is it?

145
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,810
His midterm score.

146
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,660
You can open it.

147
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,200
- P'Fah.
- Hmm?

148
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,630
What's the red mark here?

149
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,330
It means 'Failed'.

150
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,940
- English?
- Um.

151
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,220
P'Jo failed English test?

152
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,090
Here's the thing, he doesn't attend any of the classes.

153
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,290
He said the professor teaches stuff that's too easy.

154
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,740
Like we're in college, but still teaches grammar.

155
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,510
I know that it's easy, but he has to attend some classes.

156
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,510
And where is he gonna get the grade?
It's not like he got TOEIC score 900,

157
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,670
- and he doesn't have to attend any class.
- He got 900?

158
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,660
If I were you, I call him 3 times and he doesn't pick up,
I probably won't call anymore.

159
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,500
What are you doing? He doesn't get it!
(TOEIC  in Thai sounds like 'Call some one 900 times')

160
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,820
I will give it to P'Jo myself.

161
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,030
- Once is enough. I'm begging you.
- Call again? (TOEIC)

162
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,100
- No more.
- I'm still hurt.

163
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,890
Good, so you will remember. You embarrassed me.

164
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,770
I used TOEIC pun,
you need to play along with me sometimes.

165
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,930
Then you go use that pun alone.

166
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,960
Hey North. Are you done?

167
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,340
The even will start soon.

168
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,460
Don't rush me.

169
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,540
I squeeze until my hands are burning.

170
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,910
Don't complain, North.
Look at me here.

171
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,170
Whose idea was this to make healthy drinks?

172
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,590
Hey cause people are now interested to take care of their health more.

173
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,860
Just like me.

174
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,620
You're the root cause, Get.
If it's not because of your name on paper,

175
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,690
all of us wouldn't have to be here.

176
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,070
I probably be wandering around the fair already.
Damn it.

177
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,250
What are you complaining?

178
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,660
Nao. I bought you lunch.

179
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,340
Wow.
We could've been starving, if you didn't buy.

180
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,920
It's raining heavily.

181
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,980
- Thank you dude.
- Yeah.

182
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,150
Hey guys. Here.

183
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,210
Thank you.

184
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,900
Let's eat.

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,570
So wet.

186
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,140
Absent minded again.

187
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,620
You're missing him again?

188
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,000
No.

189
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,730
But I have always been missing him.

190
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,610
Woww.

191
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,090
You got me curious.

192
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,510
How? Like how are you missing him?

193
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,000
Well...

194
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,250
I just miss him.

195
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,330
Wanna talk.

196
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,290
Wanna see his face.

197
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,070
I don't know what he's doing right now.

198
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,820
Is he gonna eat 3 times a day? Or will he just drink only coffee?

199
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,970
Don't know how much is his workload.

200
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,910
i'm just worried about him

201
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,110
I want him to be here with me.

202
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,250
You miss him so much huh?

203
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,500
Yeah. Why do you ask?

204
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,320
- Can you hear me!?
- Huh?

205
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,100
P'.

206
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,510
You heard all of it?

207
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:17,922
Yeah.

208
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,230
You're free now?

209
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,618
I'll have to hang up soon.

210
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,320
Hey now he's down again.

211
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,570
I have to go.

212
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,970
He hung up.

213
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,880
Why didn't you tell me you were calling him?

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,220
If I told you, were you gonna say all those things?

215
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,570
That you miss him?

216
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,550
You let it all out my friend.

217
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,420
You're so---

218
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,340
Let's eat.

219
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,061

220
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,320

I will ask P'Hill to come with us, is that okay?

237
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,990
So you just wanna hang out with your boyfriend?

238
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,170
No, it's not like that. I wanna go with you guys.

239
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,840
But the fair does not occur everyday right?

240
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,740
And it's not easy to have all of our friends here.

241
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
What would you like to drink?

242
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,060

243
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,370

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,120

No.

253
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,910
Suer! She's cute. Are you sure?

254
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,930
I said no.

255
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,420
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,050
Yelling to let customers walk in.

257
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,730
Want some healthy drinks?

258
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,580

259
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,260

Nao.

261
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,230
- Huh?
- Come here.

262
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,610
What?

263
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,100
How's the broadcasting?

264
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,720
It's been okay. Why?

265
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,370
Are those 2 people who donates you still around?

266
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,530
Yeah they are.

267
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,670
They are always watch me almost all of lives.

268
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,250
Why?

269
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,120
I think they like you.

270
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,590
Especially the one named Gun.

271
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,500
He donates A LOT to you.

272
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,710
Sending you so many stars.

273
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,840
Really?

274
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,060
I think he just likes...

275
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,850
my broadcast. That's all.

276
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,810
No, I think he's like really into you.

277
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,590
Don't you feel it?

278
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,250
I only see him on screen yeah?

279
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,430
I don't even know him in real life.

280
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,900
I'm not special or anything in real life too.

281
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,590
Why do you think that way?

282
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,440
It's true.

283
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,580
He only sees me online.

284
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,500
He doesn't know the real me.

285
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,980
What if...

286
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,780
there's someone who likes you for who you are?

287
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,640
- Why are you asking me that?
- Hey.

288
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,890
I'm your friend, right?

289
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,800
I just wanna know if there's someone who likes you for who you really are,

290
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,420
what are you gonna do?

291
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,870
- If there's someone who likes me for who I really am?
- Um.

292
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,430
I think that would be nice.

293
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,130
But I don't think there's one.

294
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,520
You do your work. I'm gonna continue mine now.

295
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,240
You can scan to pay.

296
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,420
Have you been waiting for long?

297
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
Not really. Just arrived too.

298
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,220
Where's Foam?

299
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,140
That one is picking up a girl.

300
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:03,270
He probably wants to walk around the fair with his lover for sure.

301
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,790
I will walk around with my lover too.

302
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,460
P'Hill.

303
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:11,700
Where are you guys going?

304
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,530
He's inviting me to go to gear event.
You should join us.

305
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,130
Come join us P'Fah. Come together with many people.

306
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,620
It should be fun.

307
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,300
I actually...

308
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,200
have some errands to do.

309
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,260
I don't think I can join.

310
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,490
Would you excuse me?

311
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,340
Hey.

312
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,220
Bye then.

313
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,230
North.

314
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,430
Hmm?

315
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,630
Dude.

316
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,540
I wanna be at the concert with Nao.
Only just the 2 of us.

317
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,130
What!? Why are you doing this to me again?

318
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,660
Please. Help me.

319
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,440
When we go inside,

320
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,390
can you just leave us?

321
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,200
Fine. This is for the sake
of the effort that you've been trying though.

322
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,560
If not, I wouldn't help.

323
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,220
What are you guys talking about?

324
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,490
Nothing.

325
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,430
- Let's go. Concert is about to start.
- Yeah.

326
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,070
And now it is time, that you guys have been waiting.

327
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,120
This is our highlight for today.

328
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,120
Dude. Let's go in the front.

329
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,820
- Sure.
- Let's go.

330
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,600
Hey I will leave you guys from here then.

331
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,420
- Thank you, dude.
- See you.

332
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,870
And to not waste anymore time, please meet our first band!

333
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,610
Let's go, P'Hill.

334
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,000
- This one?
- I like this one.

335
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,890
- I like the blue one.
- Try it.

336
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,070
See. It suits you.

337
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,220
Yeah right.

338
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:05,180
(If you pay attention,)

339
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,920
(you'll see love that is not too far from you...)

340
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,520
If there's someone who likes me for who I really am?

341
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,060
I think that would be nice.

342
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,690
- (Two people. Just to meet...)
- Nao.

343
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,520
- When North asked you about if there's someone who likes you for who you are.
- (what kind of attraction is that?)

344
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,420
What?

345
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,980
I just wanna tell you...

346
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,040
that I...

347
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,920
Hey where is North?

348
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,960
Where did he go?

349
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,290
He went to buy some food.

350
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,520
Oh.

351
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,130
And what were you saying?

352
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,120
(My heart beats fast only when I'm with you)

353
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,160
- I said the song is nice.
- Yeah.

354
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,710
I really like this song.

355
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,490
Can you make some noise?

356
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,310
Why are you looking so sad?

357
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:39,205
You miss me that much?

358
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,290
Why are you...

359
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,070
What's wrong?

360
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,770
You miss me, didn't you?

361
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,910
I do.

362
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,200
I miss you so much.

363
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,600
I'm here now.

364
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,020
Don't have to cry anymore.

365
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,560
Make some noise!

366
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,250
P'Jo. I wanna eat that.

367
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,160
2 sausages please.

368
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,570
Hey P'Jo.

369
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,370
Are you leaving?

370
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,760
No.

371
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,390
Then where are you going?
We haven't checked out all of the booths.

372
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,010
Um. Do you wanna go for some ride?

373
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,050
Ride?

374
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,110
Sure.

375
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,120
Sounds fun.

376
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,780
Let's go.

377
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,030
You like it?

378
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,230
I do.

379
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,290
It's so beautiful.

380
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,670
Oh I wanted to ask you this.

381
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,150
Why are you back early?

382
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,020
Aren't there just a few more days until your flight back?

383
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,270
Cause someone said he misses me.

384
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,890
He wants to see me.

385
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,420
Wanna talk to me.

386
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,180
Being together is better, isn't it?

387
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,990
Yes.

388
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,460
And...

389
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,280
did you drink coffee instead of actual food over there?

390
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,560
I told you to eat some food too.

391
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,610
Was there a lot of work in Boston?

392
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,370
I was worried about you.

393
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,160
You know what...

394
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,770
the work at Boston was not difficult or heavy at all,

395
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,700
but whenever I turned to my side and I didn't see you,

396
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,930
it's more difficult for me.

397
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,460
What I'm trying to say is...

398
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,340
having you by my side,

399
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,420
it's way better that way.

400
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,560
So...

401
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,210
can you stay by my side forever?

402
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,910
Will you be my boyfriend?

403
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,420
Yes.

404
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,920
You're so mean!

405
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,220
I miss you so much.

406
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,310
When I wanted to talk to you, you hung up on me.

407
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,620
Do you have any idea how much I miss you?

408
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm responsible for that.

409
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,020
I will be there for you to hug every night, okay?

410
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,700
You're so clingy.

411
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,950
Stop it.

412
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,550
Thank you.

413
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,370
It's me.

414
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,370
That needs to thank you.

415
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,970
That kiss.

416
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,850
I have to charge you.

417
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,450
I can pay.

418
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,150
Hey. I will go talk to the professor first.

419
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,290
You can wait for me at the cafe.

420
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,040
I think Ter is there.

421
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,310
Sure.

422
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,640
What do you wanna eat today?

423
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,750
Think about it.

424
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,740
Where have you been?

425
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,380
I've got a question.

426
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,810
Why?

427
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,380
Are you guys boyfriends already?

428
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,820
Hey. How do you know?

429
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,310
Here.

430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,310
Are you?

431
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,540
So cute!

432
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,080
A shipper like me can die peacefully now.

433
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,840
Oh dude.

434
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,510
The movie that you wanna see is now in the theater.

435
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,020
It's in?

436
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:49,790
Um.

437
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,100
I might go see it with P'Hill. You should ask P'Jo.

438
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,260
- Let's go.
- Really?

439
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,340
Deal!

440
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,260
Help me eat this cake.

441
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,840
- Oh hi.
- Hello.

442
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,960
Those 2 went to talk to the professor, right?

443
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,900
Yes.

444
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,290
North.

445
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,930
so...

446
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,620
you're officially with Jo, right?

447
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,740
Yes.

448
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,130
I'm so happy for you and...

449
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,770
hope you guys stay together for a very long time.

450
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,930
If you need any help, please let me know.

451
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,970
You're my friend's boyfriend now.

452
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,870
- Thank you, P'Fah.
- Um.

453
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,690
Good luck.

454
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,350
- What's up with you?
- I'm just so happy. That's all.

455
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,680
- Dancing like a crazy person.
- P'Fah.

456
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,210
Has P'Arthit been back?

457
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,420
Nope.

458
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,990
- Oh you guys are back.
- Um.

459
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,310
You didn't wait for me?

460
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,930
North kinda stole some bite.

461
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,570
- Is it good?
- It is good.

462
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,210
How was the talk with professor?

463
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,150
- Went well.
- Oh Hill.

464
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:03,160
Ter was asking why Arthit has not been back yet?

465
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,490
i think same reason.

466
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,110
- Um.
- He's into the native local lifestyle again?

467
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,150
Um.

468
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,050
He's been like that before?

469
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,890
Yes.

470
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,860
He gets bored easily.

471
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,680
He likes to try new things.

472
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,780
So when he goes away, it's difficult to come back.

473
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,650
But I think if he doesn't come back,

474
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,425
- He might get a suspension.
- Have you tried calling him?

475
00:35:26,474 --> 00:35:28,363
I did. He didn't answer my call.

476
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:30,193
I will call him myself.

477
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:40,609
What' s up dude?

478
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:41,494
Where are you?

479
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:42,438
Manaus.

480
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:44,828
What's that sound so loud?

481
00:35:45,411 --> 00:35:47,687
Manaus? In Brazil?

482
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,329
Thought you said you're in Miami.

483
00:35:49,378 --> 00:35:51,354
I wanna fish some piranhas.

484
00:35:51,865 --> 00:35:52,725
Fishing? Piranha?

485
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,552
Yeah. I'm kinda busy. Can we talk later?

486
00:35:54,614 --> 00:35:55,886
Come back already.

487
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,251
You might get a suspension.

488
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,300
- Who's that? Fah?
- Yeah.

489
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,754
I know, but I have to go. The nurse is calling me.

490
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,997
Huh? Nurse? What are you doing?

491
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,750
I got bitten by piranhas.

492
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:15,615
Oh Jo. Can you transfer me some money?.
I don't have enough to go back.

493
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:16,877
Why do I have to do that?

494
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:20,949
Don't forget to do that.
I'll have my wound cleaned first.

495
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:26,766
See.

496
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,505
He's your friend.

497
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,495
He's also your friend.

498
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,480
So the movie.

499
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,890
Yeah what should we do?

500
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,150
Ask P'Jo.

501
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,030
We have to go together anyway, right?

502
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,130
Ask him.

503
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,740
Don't mess ti up.

504
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,230
Shall we?

505
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,020
I gotta go.

506
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,420
P'Johan.

507
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,590
What's up?

508
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,170
So...

509
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,570
Ter and P'Hill are going for a movie.

510
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,450
do you wanna go with me?

511
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,570
You wanna see it?

512
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,190
Yes, I do.

513
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,450
Sure then.

514
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,530
Really?

515
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,700
But...

516
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,770
you know what you have to do right?

517
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,740
When you're asking me for something,

518
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,990
what do you have to do?

519
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,560
P'!

520
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,010
Then I won't go then.

521
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,960
Up to you.

522
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:48,600
I should have charged you interest in the first place.

523
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,010
Let's go for a movie.

524
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,240
I haven't had dinner with you for so long.s

525
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,430
And who ask you to work that hard?

526
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,340
You haven't stopped eating.

527
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,810
Cause it's yummy.

528
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,640
Thank you.

529
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,400
Thank you, P'Hill.

530
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,370
You always buy me food.

531
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,760
You thank the wrong person.

532
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,220
All the money I used to buy you food came from Jo.

533
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,810
Why do you have to!?

534
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,050
I was not comfortable too,

535
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,790
but the owner of the credit card

536
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,700
asked me to use all of the money.

537
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,730
Thank you.

538
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,560
Keep eating.

539
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,160
I'm full.

540
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,600
So full.

541
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,910
Why are you smiling?

542
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,790
What do you wanna see?

543
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,680
The horror movie.

544
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,890
Aren't you scared of ghosts?

545
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,530
What about you, Ter? What would you like to see?

546
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,290
Shall we see the horror movie with North?

547
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,050
Are you sure that you won't get scared?

548
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,020
I will,

549
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,490
but I wanna see it.

550
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,950
Let's go buy the tickets.

551
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,290
Do you normally watch movies?

552
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,050
I haven't been to the theater for so long.

553
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,690
Because of work?

554
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,910
Um.

555
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,170
He's ruining the mood.

556
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,900
I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.

557
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,740
You screamed so loud, North.

558
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:48,210
I was terrifying.

559
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,900
You didn't see anything.

560
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,530
You close your eyes the whole time.

561
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,210
Do you wanna stop by somewhere first?

562
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,900
I think I will just leave.

563
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,720
Err...where are we going?

564
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,330
Back to the dorm.

565
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,370
Hey.

566
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,700
Are you guys going up too?

567
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,600
Let's go.

568
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,180
Hey hey.

569
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,770
What's going on?

570
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,220
P'.

571
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,160
I want you to move in with me.

572
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,670
Huh!?

573
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:28,540
How?

574
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,610
- Go go.
- What the hell?

575
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,970
I also don't know.

576
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:37,900
Their room is so small.

577
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,990
You've been here before, haven't you?

578
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,020
I didn't pay attention back then.

579
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,050
- You have anything to do with this, right?
- I don't. I just found out with you.

580
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,030
Excuse me. Would you like to pack your personal belongings yourself,
or you'd like me to do it?

581
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,910
I will do it by myself.

582
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,840
- You should have told me.
- I told you I just found out about it now.

583
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,810
Anything else?

584
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,850
P'Hill. Pull it more.

585
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,730
More.

586
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,710
Are you being sarcastic?

587
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,690
Hey. How can I forget this?

588
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,180
This stupid duck?

589
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,880
- Throw it away. You cannot bring it with you.
- No.

590
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,080
This duck is very important to me.

591
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,490
He's so cute.

592
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:44,870
He's so cute. Here.

593
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,430
You need to give him a chance.

594
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,480
Important?

595
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:00,210
It is.

596
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,860
It is a last orientation gift.

597
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,170
He saved my life.

598
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,360
I think we should break up.

599
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,010
Someone wants to give you this.

600
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,710
Smile please :).

601
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,530
Can I....

602
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,180
keep it?

603
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,340
you like it that much?

604
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,050
Yes.

605
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,950
Fine.

606
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,040
I bought you so many things,
but you like this duck so much.

607
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,110
Cute. Cute.

608
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,160
You get to live~

609
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,910
How long have you had a crush on me?

610
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,050
Quite long. 3 years already.

611
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:49,300
3 years!?

612
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,860
Do you think it's weird
if I like someone that has never done anything for me?

613
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,050
I knew it.

614
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,850
You always check him out.

615
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,830
Jo. Have you heard of his news?

616
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,230
He got a scholarship to study in the USA.

617
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:06,390
After today,
you might not get to see him anymore.
