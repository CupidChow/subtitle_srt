1
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,130
Hey…

2
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,130
Actually…

3
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,810
I...

4
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,450
have had a crush on you for so long.

5
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,460
You are mine now.

6
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,550
Ter. Ter. Ter.

7
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,670
What’s going on?
Is there a robbery or a ghost?

8
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,080
Nothing.

9
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,280
If it's nothing,
then why did you just scream?

10
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,170
I just had a bad dream.

11
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,200
What kind of dream?

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,500
- Well…
- Well?

13
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,330
It was really terrifying.

14
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,430
Thinking about it,
gives me goosebumps.

15
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,380
Look!

16
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,040
Ter...or...

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,070
we actually have a ghost in our room?

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,240
What the hell!

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,540
You’re being nonsense.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,980
What’s wrong with you?
Just go to bed.

21
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,720
There's no ghost.

22
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,780
- Are you sure there's nothing?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,170
Nothing.
Just go to sleep.

24
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,700
I’m begging you.
If you don't go, you'll be late tomorrow.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,230
Go go.

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
Please do not haunt us.

27
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,000
Ter.
You should pray before sleeping too.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,210
If not, they'll haunt you.

29
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,210
Yeah I know.

30
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,400
Hey!
Did you hear that?

31
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,050
What?
It’s my voice.

32
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,170
Oh.

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,810
Shit!

34
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,940
What are you doing?
I'm already late!

35
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,300
Come on.
It takes you forever in there.

36
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,600
Don’t be so dramatic!

37
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
I’ve been waiting for so long already.

38
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,380
Almost done.
Stop rushing me.

39
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,770
I AM LATE ALREADY.
Come on!

40
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,730
Yeah give me a min.

41
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,130
Get out here now, Ter!
Damn it. Get out!

42
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,250
F*ck you!

43
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,060
Just go in.

44
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
F*ck you~

45
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,850
Hurry up.

46
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,290
You’ve been in there for too long.
Come on, North!

47
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,600
You've been in there forever.

48
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,200
I’m shitting.

49
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,370
We’re late~

50
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,060
First year,
come register here please.

51
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,180
Are you a freshman?

52
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,180
Um…yes.

53
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,180
Do we have to register?

54
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,820
Yes,
she said first years register here.

55
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,120
I’m Phoon.

56
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,530
And you are...?

57
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,780
Oh…I’m Ter.

58
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,740
Is this your first day?
I’ve never seen you before.

59
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,290
Yes yes.

60
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,720
Oh I actually have another friend.

61
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,610
Met him during the orientation.

62
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,610
He should be here by now.

63
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,810
If you don’t have any friends,
you can hang with us.

64
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,100
Thank you, Phoon.

65
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,990
I don’t know anyone here.

66
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,420
When I first joined,
I also didn’t know anyone but Foam.

67
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,680
You’re here early today.

68
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,080
Oh you’re here.

69
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,400
Speaking of the devil.

70
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,010
You’ve got a problem with me?

71
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,880
What?

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Better watch your back.

73
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,870
Also a freshman?

74
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,890
Um…yes.

75
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,070
Yeah
I met him at the registration just now.

76
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,150
Oh and this is Foam.

77
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,290
This is Ter.

78
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,340
Hi Foam.

79
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,870
Hi Ter.

80
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,760
Ter?

81
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,330
Why?
Is it short for something?

82
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,560
It’s from Easter.

83
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,040
I was born around Easter.

84
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,800
Oh that’s why.

85
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,190
Easter...

86
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,530
I also have a sibling,
named Christmas.

87
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,030
Born on Christmas day.

88
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,030
Hey that’s cool.

89
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,640
But…it's a sister, right?

90
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,220
Does she have a boyfriend?

91
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,380
Stop it.

92
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,270
If I were him,
I wouldn’t let my sister date a guy like you.

93
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,580
Why?
What’s wrong with me?

94
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,780
Can I say it?

95
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,080
Hey.
You are no better than me.

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,880
You two calm down.

97
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,960
Where are you goin'?

98
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,560
Those who just arrived,
please queue at the back.

99
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,390
This should be all, yeah?

100
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,020
First of all, I'll introduce myself.
My name is Bua. I’m a representative from Student Union.

101
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,110
I'd like to invite you guys,
Vet students to join our union.

102
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,900
Quiet. All quiet.

103
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,000
Let’s put it this way.
Apart from work experience, you’ll also get extra credits.

104
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,800
Is anyone here a student
from Lady Rattana’s scholarship?

105
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,710
Anyone?

106
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,400
Ok wait…there’s one…

107
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,130
Ok since you’re scholarship students,
you have to help out the union anyways.

108
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:24,340
Anyone who wants to voluntarily join?

109
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,360
If you do,
please go fill out you name over here.

110
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,540
Those scholarship students too.
Come sign up here.

111
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,420
I heard the president is a med student, right?

112
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,720
How do they manage the time?

113
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
I know right. So talented.

114
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,200
Good with both extra curricular and studies.
Top of the faculty too.

115
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,200
Ter.
You’re a scholarship student?

116
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,640
That means you have to join the union?

117
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
That must be tiring.

118
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,820
Classes haven't started,
already complaining?

119
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,160
Don't let me hear you complain.

120
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,840
Why?
I’m not going to complain anyway.

121
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,190
Oh I also heard that
we have to join some clubs too.

122
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,190
Which club are you interested in, Ter?

123
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,680
No idea.

124
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,880
What about you, Phoon?

125
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
I don’t know.
Haven’t thought about it.

126
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,300
Way to go...all my friends.

127
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,550
Like you already have something on your mind?

128
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,150
Me?

129
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,860
I wanna join Basketball club.

130
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,620
I heard the seniors there are very tough.

131
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Especially the club’s president.

132
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,370
He’s also the president of Student Union.

133
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,910
That’s cool. Multitasking.
Doing many things.

134
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,630
You have to also work at the Student union, right?

135
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,630
You might meet him there.

136
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,410
Right.

137
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,020
Probably.

138
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,630
You can do it.

139
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,530
Girls!

140
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,530
Look at those med students

141
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,850
They're so handsome.

142
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Who’s that?

143
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
What?
Don’t tell me you don’t know who they are?

144
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,240
That one…

145
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,220
that’s reading.

146
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,220
His name is Tonfha.

147
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,150
Sir.

148
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,750
Can I have more paper?

149
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,990
Thank you.

150
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,300
He’s smart.

151
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,810
Guys, if you don’t understand anything,
please ask me.

152
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,260
Nice, kind, warm and gentle too.

153
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
Oh myy~

154
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,560
what about that one?

155
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,020
His name is Arthit.

156
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,020
Even he looks a bit like a bad boy,

157
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,500
but he’s good with music instruments.

158
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,260
And so does sports.

159
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,450
What about the one that’s napping?

160
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,530
That one is Johan.

161
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,100
He’s hot and also rich.

162
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,800
The whole place...on me.

163
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,480
It’s like he just comes out of a fairly tale.

164
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,600
You asked me to come study,
didn’t you?

165
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,600
Fine. I’m up.

166
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,600
What about the other one?

167
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,480
That one?

168
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,880
That’s Hill.

169
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,880
He’s super smart.
Always the 1st class honor.

170
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,220
He’s the president of the union too.

171
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,860
Like you're aware,
work at the Student union is pretty detailed.

172
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,060
If you have any questions,
please ask me.

173
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:44,860
Yes, president.

174
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:49,477
He's also the president of Basketball club.

175
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,111
He's so hot.

176
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,270
Look.
They're so perfect.

177
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:08,059
Don't know
whether they're dating someone?

178
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,161
How's the union this morning?

179
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,595
Busy.
About to start new semester.

180
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,590
I'll have to be at the union after this.

181
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:31,395
(Panupong Jittangkul)

182
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,056
(Veterinary Medicine)

183
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,400
Finally home.

184
00:15:08,405 --> 00:15:11,527
The orientation alone is already exhausting

185
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:16,896
Ter.

186
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:18,082
What?

187
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:20,300
If you sleep now,
the ghost will come haunt you.

188
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:24,211
Whatever. Just let me be.
Go play your games.

189
00:15:24,211 --> 00:15:26,210
And go easy with the keyboard sound.

190
00:15:30,355 --> 00:15:31,940
Getting my nerves?

191
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,124
Come on!

192
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,565
Oh yeah.
Come at me.

193
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,560
- Hey!
- What....hey!!

194
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,742
Ter!

195
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,740
What's the matter?

196
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,500
I told you not to nap during the dusk,
when the ghost is around.

197
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,192
That's why you have bad dreams.

198
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:02,358
How was it?

199
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:04,400
Did the ghost gave you lotto numbers?

200
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,811
I'm just gonna go shower.

201
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:11,370
You should go to bed too.
Playing games all damn night.

202
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,370
Just one round.

203
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,948
It's been so many damn rounds.

204
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:18,167
What the...

205
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:37,234
Why are you up so early?

206
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,377
I haven't slept actually.

207
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,540
Huh? Really?

208
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:48,185
Because of those bad dreams?

209
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:50,562
Yeah.

210
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,355
I don't think so.

211
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,410
Ter. What are those dream?
You can tell me.

212
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:02,751
It's nothing. Forget it.

213
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,546
We have a ghost...in our room, right?

214
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,189
You cannot sleep cause all those bad dreams.
There's no other way.

215
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:17,400
Please leave me alone,
I will make merit for you.

216
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:20,310
Just kidding.

217
00:17:21,149 --> 00:17:23,011
It's not funny.

218
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,010
Ohh it's fine.

219
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:29,362
And..are you really okay?

220
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:34,791
Um...I think so.

221
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:38,060
You can always tell me everything, yeah?

222
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,125
Dude.
Let me ask you something.

223
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,444
What?

224
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,630
Let's say...hypothetically...

225
00:17:46,635 --> 00:17:48,914
If there's someone that you really hate,

226
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,300
and you don't wanna see his face.
What would you do?

227
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:52,897
Then don't go see.

228
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:54,822
It's not that simple.

229
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,032
Sometimes you just walk into each other.

230
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,600
Just pretend that you didn't see.

231
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:03,191
Don't talk. Don't pay attention.

232
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:05,660
But I think if he hates you,

233
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,045
I don't think
he'd want to show his face to you either.

234
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,040
Unless he wants a fight.

235
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:15,620
There're many types of hatred though.

236
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:18,300
Hate because you just don't like his face.

237
00:18:18,783 --> 00:18:20,565
Or you've done something bad to him.

238
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:21,934
Or...

239
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,028
You hate him because you used to love him.

240
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,380
If that's the case,
not seeing at all is for the best.

241
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,500
Hey.

242
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,562
Or you...

243
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,413
have a love problem?

244
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,752
Nonsense.
It's all hatred.

245
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:45,863
Stop it.

246
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:47,900
You're not going anywhere today?

247
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,022
I will hang out with a senior.

248
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,416
What about you?

249
00:18:52,748 --> 00:18:55,715
I will go out in the evening.
Might take a nap a bit more.

250
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,710
Then go ahead.

251
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,110
So tired.

252
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:00,053
I'm gonna go shower.

253
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,420
You just woke up.
I haven't slept. How can you be tired?

254
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:04,170
I didn't get enough sleep.

255
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:15,278
Hello?

256
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,642
"Hey you picked up so fast!
You already got up?"

257
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,630
Umm...I just took a nap
...not so long ago.

258
00:19:21,635 --> 00:19:24,114
"What?
Why didn't you sleep last night?"

259
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:26,110
"Is something wrong?"

260
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:29,148
Umm...nothing.
Never mind.

261
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:33,000
"Phoon and I will go to a coffee shop."

262
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,365
"Just wanna ask you to join us."

263
00:19:34,365 --> 00:19:36,360
"You can nap there."

264
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:39,939
I can actually nap there?

265
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,550
"Sure"

266
00:19:41,557 --> 00:19:43,484
"It's a coffee shop for students"

267
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:45,480
"I've seen so many take a nap there"

268
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:54,165
Okay okay.
I'll go.

269
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:55,771
"Good."

270
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,032
"Leave now, okay?"

271
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,982
"I'm at the front of your dorm already."

272
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,220
Huh?

273
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,010
Okay.
Let me shower first.

274
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,554
Okay okay.
I will wait here~

275
00:20:17,148 --> 00:20:18,740
How long have you been waiting?

276
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,674
Since before I called you.

277
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,376
I was thinking,
if you refused to go,

278
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:25,960
I'd drag you out of your room myself.

279
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:28,133
That's forcing.

280
00:20:28,339 --> 00:20:30,370
Stop babbling.
Hop on.

281
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:31,441
Here.

282
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:32,768
Fine.

283
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:35,570
Where's Phoon?

284
00:20:35,577 --> 00:20:38,657
He's at the coffee shop
to get a table already.

285
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:40,819
Let's go.

286
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,810
Just drive safely.

287
00:20:44,069 --> 00:20:45,394
Hang on tight sir~

288
00:20:49,712 --> 00:20:50,930
Hey! Hey! Hey!

289
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,453
Hi Phoon.

290
00:20:57,638 --> 00:20:59,450
Oh.
You wanna order something?

291
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,235
You already did.

292
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,161
I'm gonna continue my nap.

293
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:15,946
What' wrong with him?
Why is he like that?

294
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,940
He couldn't sleep last night.

295
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,560
Why?

296
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:27,017
Whatever...let him be.

297
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:35,288
I'm gonna go pee.

298
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:37,280
Hey.
I'll go with you.

299
00:21:56,146 --> 00:21:58,380
Hey.
When did he get up and order?

300
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:01,140
Wake him up.

301
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:03,979
- Ter.
- Hmm?

302
00:22:04,677 --> 00:22:06,394
Why don't you eat what you ordered?

303
00:22:08,533 --> 00:22:10,063
You guys ordered this?

304
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:12,060
We just got back from the restroom.

305
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,309
You didn't order this?

306
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:16,832
No, I didn't.

307
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,084
Hey!

308
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:23,150
This is yummy.

309
00:22:23,158 --> 00:22:24,942
You try it.
It's good.

310
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,560
It's probably someone else's order.

311
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,748
Whatever.
We can pay them later.

312
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:39,583
The food is here.

313
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:41,580
Er...excuse me.

314
00:22:41,842 --> 00:22:44,798
Are you serving the wrong table?
We didn't order these.

315
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,790
Neither the chocolate nor this cake.

316
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:50,419
Table 15.
2 orders. It's correct.

317
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,410
Already paid too.

318
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,985
Enjoy.

319
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:55,980
Sure.

320
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,051
- I think she remembered the wrong table.
- Yeah.

321
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:02,960
It's okay. Let's just eat.

322
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,773
You guys are so...
but let me have a bite.

323
00:23:08,102 --> 00:23:10,010
Umm...

324
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:14,066
About the club,
which club are you guys joining?

325
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:16,272
Anything in mind?

326
00:23:17,285 --> 00:23:18,933
Not really.

327
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,108
I'll join whatever you'll join.

328
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:24,281
Thing is...
we still don't know what to join.

329
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,480
What are the clubs do we have here?

330
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,797
Err...well...

331
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,860
You guys are looking for a club to join?

332
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,742
Yes yes. Why?

333
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,110
I'm from a Drawing club.
We're looking for more members too.

334
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:40,900
We only get a few members each year.

335
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:44,155
If you're interested, you can join us.

336
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:51,020
But I cannot draw.
Am I allowed to join?

337
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,657
Why not?
It's not that serious.

338
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,500
Or you can just sign up your names.

339
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,650
Then decide again later
when the semester begins.

340
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,133
In case you have no idea what to join, then you'll have mine as a backup.

341
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:08,136
Sure.
That sounds good.

342
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:10,760
Oh hey..

343
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,820
can I sign up for my friend too?

344
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:14,240
My friend also needs one to join.

345
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:15,822
Umm sure.

346
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,102
Which friend?

347
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,152
It's North.

348
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,724
He's not gonna join his engineering friends?

349
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,285
He said all his friends already signed up.
Mostly sports.

350
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:27,280
He doesn't want to use so much energy.

351
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:29,628
Good.

352
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:31,620
By the way...what's your name?

353
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:36,768
I'm....Daotok.

354
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:39,294
I'm Foam.

355
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,714
I'm Easter.
You can just call me Ter.

356
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:43,710
I'm Typhoon.

357
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:09,548
Hill.

358
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:11,654
Hill!

359
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:15,288
Hill.

360
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:26,080
Hill!

361
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:28,614
What's wrong with you?
You're smiling to the book.

362
00:26:30,211 --> 00:26:31,540
Just thinkin' about something.

363
00:26:31,783 --> 00:26:33,430
What thing?

364
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:37,995
You know what's it about.

365
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,317
About that person?

366
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:47,459
Um.

367
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,820
I'm so wanna meet that person.

368
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:53,263
Who is it that makes my friend like this?

369
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:09,860
(Student Union)

370
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:14,388
Come on.
Follow me.

371
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:19,160
Come come.
Follow me.

372
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,142
Put it here.

373
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,048
- Hello.
- Hello.

374
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:25,040
That's it for now.
We'll talk later.

375
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,590
You're a Vet student, aren't you?

376
00:27:27,597 --> 00:27:28,291
Yes.

377
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,290
What's your name again?

378
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,290
Easter.
You can just call me Ter.

379
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,020
Oh ok...Ter.

380
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:36,534
Wait a min.
Peem!

381
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,558
Peem.

382
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:39,550
Come here.

383
00:27:41,385 --> 00:27:44,470
This is Ter.
This is Peem. He's a coordinator of the union.

384
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:47,110
Peem,
you will delegate some work for him to do.

385
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:49,400
Sure. Follow me.

386
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,948
- Right.
- We'll have a Welcome Back to the campus thingy.

387
00:27:52,948 --> 00:27:54,940
It's usually busy around this time.

388
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,800
We'll have to organize a concert too.

389
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,371
Well...will you help me paint all these wood?

390
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:05,370
Make it all white.

391
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:06,764
Sure.

392
00:28:06,764 --> 00:28:08,760
Thank you.

393
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,413
Peem. Peem.

394
00:28:16,143 --> 00:28:21,173
Do we have to carry all these to the stage?
Or there'll be someone do it for us?

395
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,722
Right...I haven't asked the president.

396
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:27,767
And where is he now?

397
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:32,977
I think he's taking a nap in there.
He just finished his exam.

398
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:34,970
- I'll have a freshman go get him.
- Sure.

399
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:37,697
- Ter. Ter.
- Yes?

400
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:40,454
Can you go wake up the president?

401
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,684
He's in the break room.
Tell him Peem needs your help.

402
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:46,680
Sure.

403
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,680
- You want me to go now?
- Yes.

404
00:28:51,343 --> 00:28:53,320
- He knows right?
- Yes.

405
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:22,933
P'...
Peem wants me to wake you up.

406
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:26,560
P'...

407
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:37,361
P'...

408
00:29:37,957 --> 00:29:39,017
P'...

409
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:43,690
Excuse me.
Peem wants me to wake you up.

410
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:14,576
Ter.

411
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,238
Hey.

412
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:23,770
Hey...Ter.

413
00:30:24,845 --> 00:30:26,177
What's the matter with him?

414
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:30,982
Here we go.

415
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,010
Don't tell me the president scolded at him
so he ran away?

416
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:38,044
Right...
he doesn't like when people wake him up too.

417
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,740
Why didn't you go do it by yourself.

418
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:42,241
I didn't know
that he's gonna be this upset.

419
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,028
Hill!

420
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,459
What did you do?

421
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:52,450
I told him to wake you up.

422
00:30:52,828 --> 00:30:54,865
I didn't think you would be this upset.

423
00:30:57,302 --> 00:30:58,813
He's probably crying now.

424
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,183
This is bad.
What should we do?

425
00:31:02,579 --> 00:31:03,567
Yeah.

426
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:06,152
This is bad.

427
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:08,167
What should I do?

428
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:37,142
Why are you here?

429
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,450
Don't you have to be at the union?

430
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:39,669
Phoon.

431
00:31:41,641 --> 00:31:42,973
What's wrong?

432
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,720
I don't wanna work at the union anymore.

433
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,780
You're being funny.

434
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,094
I'm serious.

435
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,420
You can't.
You're a scholarship student. You need those hours.

436
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,102
That's true...

437
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:59,420
If I don't go,
would I get my credits deducted?

438
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:01,120
What's the matter with you?

439
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,478
What's going on really?

440
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:04,470
Dude.

441
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:05,751
Help me.

442
00:32:06,862 --> 00:32:08,350
What's going on?

443
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,819
Fine fine. Calm down.

444
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:16,810
Shall we go?

445
00:32:19,508 --> 00:32:20,722
Take the drink with you.

446
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:27,248
Oh.

447
00:32:27,838 --> 00:32:29,514
Don't you have to be at the union?

448
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:35,543
What's the matter?

449
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,400
Foam...let me hang with you guys here please.

450
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,548
(Memorable moment...
before we won't see each other again)

451
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,539
(I no longer want to see this post.)

452
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,157
What's up dude?

453
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,705
Did you have fun working at the union?

454
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:19,312
Not at all.
I wanna quit.

455
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,310
Why?
Too many tasks?

456
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:22,912
Hey.

457
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,011
Do you remember that person I told you?

458
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,722
He's in the union as well.

459
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:28,720
And he's also...

460
00:34:30,057 --> 00:34:30,940
also what?

461
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:32,680
He's also the president of the union.

462
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:34,534
Shit.
For real?

463
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,533
Yes.

464
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,240
What a coincidence.

465
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,240
You probably met him face to face, yeah?

466
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,240
Yes.

467
00:34:44,259 --> 00:34:45,710
What are you gonna do now?

468
00:34:45,718 --> 00:34:48,800
If you don't participate,
you might lose your schorlarship.

469
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:51,705
Losing the scholarship?

470
00:34:54,508 --> 00:34:56,533
What should I do?

471
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:00,257
Weird.

472
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,960
What weird?

473
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,946
Why?
Why don't you wanna see his face?

474
00:35:04,946 --> 00:35:06,940
I hate him.

475
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,269
Hate like hate hate?

476
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:13,272
Not exactly.

477
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,352
Weird...see!?

478
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,260
You're really weird.

479
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:19,854
Nonsense.

480
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,503
You keep bugging me.

481
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:28,120
Are you sure that you hate him?

482
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:29,594
Or....

483
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,170
Enough, North!
What are you talking about?

484
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,051
See.
You're always like this.

485
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,700
Whenever you're blushing or upset
...it's all the same.

486
00:35:37,709 --> 00:35:39,321
No!

487
00:35:50,597 --> 00:35:51,450
(Student Union)

488
00:35:51,857 --> 00:35:53,706
That's right.

489
00:35:53,706 --> 00:35:55,700
Great. Great.

490
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,183
Hello.
Please come on down.

491
00:36:06,078 --> 00:36:06,983
Hello.

492
00:36:30,582 --> 00:36:33,564
The freshmen are here, Mr.president.

493
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,291
You should go work now perhaps?

494
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:38,570
The kid you scolded yesterday
is also here.

495
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,400
Or at least apologize to him.
I don't want any uncomfortable situation here.

496
00:36:44,164 --> 00:36:45,127
I didn't scold.

497
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,120
Didn't scold?

498
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,420
Didn't do it?
Then why did he ran away like that?

499
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:58,992
And where are you going?

500
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:00,990
To apologize.

501
00:37:32,296 --> 00:37:35,949
He said he's gonna go apologize,
then why is he standing there?

502
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,940
That's odd.

503
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:41,322
What happened yesterday?

504
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:49,872
I think we need to help our president.

505
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,834
What's up kids?

506
00:38:04,745 --> 00:38:05,830
Hi.

507
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:10,134
Ter.
I'm so sorry about yesterday.

508
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,962
I shouldn't have asked you to wake him.

509
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,343
He probably gave you a mean face.

510
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,734
That's why you ran out like that, right?

511
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:17,699
No not at all.

512
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:19,690
Oh...then what happened to you?

513
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:22,367
I thought he was being mean to you
that's why you cried.

514
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:24,360
I DIDN'T CRY.

515
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:26,973
I didn't cry.

516
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,152
But still..I fell guilty.

517
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:35,362
I will buy you dinner after this...how's that?

518
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,925
It's fine. Really.

519
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:39,920
It's actually not big a deal.

520
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:43,994
I"m the one who needs to apologize for running away like that.

521
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,088
But we're still guilty.
Let's have dinner with us.

522
00:38:56,088 --> 00:38:58,080
Please Ter.

523
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:00,450
I feel bad.

524
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,364
I understand...

525
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,800
that you're not comfortable to have dinner with us, right?

526
00:39:08,842 --> 00:39:10,139
It's not like that.

527
00:39:13,674 --> 00:39:15,605
Fine. I will go.

528
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:17,600
- I'll go.
- Yes!

529
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:20,540
Then I will go help the president first.

530
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:22,940
- Sure.
- See you, Ter.

531
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,459
Keep up y'all.

532
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,450
I'm going with you.

533
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,230
Is this enough cloth?

534
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:43,395
Yes.

535
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,671
- Dude.
- Hmm?

536
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,066
Is that the union's president?

537
00:39:57,477 --> 00:39:59,060
Yes. That's P'Hill.

538
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:01,760
Why is he looking this way?

539
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:04,840
I don't know. Ask him.

540
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,620
Are you crazy?
Look at him.

541
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,020
Looks so scary with his resting bitch face.
I wouldn't ask.

542
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:16,462
What are you guys whispering about?

543
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:21,917
It's the president, P'Bua.
He always looks this way.

544
00:40:22,176 --> 00:40:24,180
Did we do something wrong?

545
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:30,191
Nothing. Keep working.

546
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,290
Oh P' by the way...

547
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,506
is he seeing someone?

548
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,182
I don't know.

549
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,072
How come you don't know?

550
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,749
You've never asked him?

551
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:43,740
I have.

552
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:46,980
Do you know what did he answer me?

553
00:40:47,717 --> 00:40:49,051
What is it?

554
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:52,109
He said...

555
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:56,813
'Now, I already have someone
I wanna commit myself to.'

556
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:03,860
So charming the way he said it.

557
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:06,357
Come here.

558
00:41:09,183 --> 00:41:10,216
Come here.

559
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:16,974
You told me that you have someone you want to be committed to, right?

560
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,493
Um.

561
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:39,592
I'm going to the restroom.

562
00:42:15,254 --> 00:42:16,284
Ter.

563
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:20,420
I have something that I need to talk to you.

564
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,308
Let me go.

565
00:42:24,946 --> 00:42:25,878
Ter.

566
00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:32,428
I said let me go.

567
00:42:44,888 --> 00:42:46,185
Let me help.

568
00:43:11,426 --> 00:43:13,650
Holding a needle like that is really dangerous.

569
00:43:18,728 --> 00:43:20,702
You need to hold it like this

570
00:43:20,702 --> 00:43:22,700
And hold the cloth like this.

571
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:32,103
Be careful.
Don't poke yourself.

572
00:44:04,536 --> 00:44:06,788
Let's have dinner~

573
00:44:06,788 --> 00:44:08,780
So exhausted today.

574
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,340
Not at all.

575
00:44:10,346 --> 00:44:12,854
- Isn't that right, Ter?
- Let's go eat, Ter.

576
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:13,620
Let' go.

577
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,600
Sure.

578
00:44:14,607 --> 00:44:16,840
And today Thunmild is not joining?

579
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,160
No.

580
00:44:19,848 --> 00:44:21,980
Let's go eat.
Come on, Ter.

581
00:44:21,988 --> 00:44:25,011
Let's go eat something.

582
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:35,510
I will get this one please.

583
00:44:35,515 --> 00:44:37,345
Sure.

584
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:39,340
And err...

585
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,460
Do you wanna try this?

586
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:49,140
Ter.
Order whatever you'd like. On us.

587
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:50,742
Please order.

588
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:51,767
Sure.

589
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:53,825
Make that 2 for Ter.

590
00:44:55,385 --> 00:44:57,530
I will get a big set of salmon sashimi please.

591
00:44:57,537 --> 00:44:58,854
Okay.

592
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:04,315
Anything else?

593
00:45:04,881 --> 00:45:06,310
No.

594
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:09,992
- That'll be all for now.
- Okay.

595
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,625
Okay so--

596
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:48,019
Hill.
You have someone you want to be serious with?

597
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,402
Um.

598
00:45:51,386 --> 00:45:52,949
Who's that?

599
00:46:00,685 --> 00:46:02,930
Ughh can you just tell me?
I'm dying to know.

600
00:46:02,936 --> 00:46:03,980
Right.

601
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,160
I can't.

602
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:06,800
Please give me a clue.

603
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,438
I can't.

604
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:10,430
You guys will find out soon.

605
00:46:23,794 --> 00:46:25,080
Eat up please.

606
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:39,730
Are you full, Ter?

607
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,394
I am.

608
00:46:40,394 --> 00:46:42,390
Good.
Next time I will have Hill buy for you.

609
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,641
Hill,
you can drop me and Bua at the faculty.

610
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:47,640
Then you go drop him at his dorm.

611
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,786
That's fine. I can go back by myself.

612
00:46:52,174 --> 00:46:55,979
Hey you're not a burden.
Let Hill take you home.

613
00:46:58,296 --> 00:47:00,545
- But--
- You don't want me to take you home?

614
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,545
Let him take you home.
Don't have to feel bad.

615
00:47:06,777 --> 00:47:07,779
Fine.

616
00:47:12,677 --> 00:47:14,537
Thank you.

617
00:47:32,623 --> 00:47:36,013
Thanks for dropping us off.
Please drop him off for us, will you?

618
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,311
Take good care of him, okay?

619
00:47:39,137 --> 00:47:41,220
- Bye. See you.
- Good bye.

620
00:47:47,442 --> 00:47:49,300
You can come sit in the front.

621
00:47:50,908 --> 00:47:52,546
I'm fine back here.

622
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:57,093
Then it's gonna look like I'm your driver.

623
00:48:02,321 --> 00:48:03,274
Fine.

624
00:48:37,622 --> 00:48:39,154
I will fasten by myself.

625
00:48:44,482 --> 00:48:45,921
Did you like the food?

626
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:51,179
I did.

627
00:48:52,648 --> 00:48:55,251
Then I will take you there again.

628
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,597
It's fine. I rather not.

629
00:49:24,312 --> 00:49:25,465
See you soon.

630
00:49:26,515 --> 00:49:27,545
Thank you.

631
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:32,339
Ughh.
Too many things happened in one day.

632
00:50:33,186 --> 00:50:35,571
I'm so tired.

633
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:38,453
Ter!

634
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:39,977
What?

635
00:50:39,977 --> 00:50:41,970
Come check this out.
Hurry!

636
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:44,213
What is it?

637
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:49,448
Isn't that your hand?
