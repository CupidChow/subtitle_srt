1
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:20,786
When I said 'can I be with you?',
I didn't ask.

2
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,053
I just wanna inform.

3
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:23,500
That's not funny.

4
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,625
So you guys were holding hands?

5
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:29,762
I want someone
to take behind the scene pictures.

6
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,590
Do you know anyone?

7
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:33,749
I know a guy.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,041
Or he's just pretending
to make me believe him?

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,900
If he doesn't take it serious with you,
he will stop eventually.

10
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,494
But maybe...

11
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:42,380
he might suddenly want to commit with you.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,720
I made my mind.

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,380
- Made your mind about what?
- About what I told you.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,000
I have moved on from him.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,130
So I will no longer care about him.

16
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,190
Even if I meet him at the union or in campus,
I will just ignore him.

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,090
Like I cannot see him at all.

18
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,520
So he will finally stop talking to me.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,690
How does that sound?

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,880
What?

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Why are you poking me?

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,100
Dude!

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,820
How can you ignore him,
when he's picking you up like this.

24
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,630
Help me.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,710
What are you doing here, P'Hill?

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,520
Picking you up.

27
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,220
I will go with my friend.

28
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,220
Hello P'Hill.

29
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,220
North!
Mother--

30
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,740
Seems like your friend is busy,

31
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,070
I guess.

32
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,530
Shall we?

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,130
I can walk myself.

34
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,760
- Be careful.
- Yes.

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,070
I can actually go there myself.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,380
Ughhh. North.

37
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,810
Have you ever taken any photographer job?

38
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,540
For fun yes.

39
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,750
But I've never done a professional one.

40
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,940
Why?

41
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,360
The team that works on campus filming
needs a photographer.

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Do you think you can do it for us?

43
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,220
Me?

44
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,350
Umm you take nice pictures.

45
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,500
But...

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,200
I'm not good at taking pictures of people.

47
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,943
You are.

48
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,790
There're some others
who do it better than me.

49
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,440
I don't want an outsider to do it.

50
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:49,591
But...

51
00:03:49,974 --> 00:03:51,339
I'm also an outsider.

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,494
No, you're not.

53
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,885
I will be there with you.

54
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:04,430
Where do you want me to drop you off anyway?

55
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:05,791
At the library.

56
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,480
You still like going to the library huh?

57
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,930
- Hello teacher.
- Oh hey.

58
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,070
Can I help you with anything?

59
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,070
You can put these books away for me.

60
00:04:28,343 --> 00:04:30,150
Anything else?

61
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:14,090
'Ratchakit Tanthikul'

62
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,480
Err...excuse me.

63
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,910
That guy he forgot this.
Can you give it back to him?

64
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,250
Oh sure.

65
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,010
That nong wants to give you this.

66
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,480
Nong.

67
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,820
Nong.

68
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,100
Yes?

69
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,400
Thank you.

70
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,970
Oh yes.

71
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,420
No problem.

72
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
I found it at the library.

73
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,050
I always see you on that table.

74
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,050
I remember.

75
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,760
You remember me?

76
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,390
Yes, I do.

77
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,530
I'm a librarian.
I must remember things.

78
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,980
Then...

79
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,120
...can I buy you some drink to thank you?

80
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,660
Are you sure?

81
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
It's nothing.

82
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,950
I will have one with boba then.

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,630
Sure.

84
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,290
You're not getting any?

85
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,520
I don't like sweet stuff.

86
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,900
That's too bad.

87
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,290
My family owns a dessert cafe.
I thought of inviting you over.

88
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,530
Really?

89
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,740
I will stop by then.

90
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,040
Really?
But I thought you don't like dessert.

91
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,120
I wanna give it a try.

92
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,300
Sure, then you have to stop by!

93
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,330
Are you paying for me?

94
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,330
Yes, it will be on the house.
My mom pays.

95
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,920
Good.
You can taste the chocolate drink made by me.

96
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
It will be yummy. I guarantee.

97
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,010
You'll love it. Trust me.

98
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,330
Promise?

99
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,750
Do we have a deal?

100
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,590
Yayy~

101
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,990
Here. You have to do it like this.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,340
Go get the car ready.

103
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm leaving.

104
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,930
Aren't you gonna wait
and take him home too, sir?

105
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,260
Hello~

106
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,150
Please come on it.

107
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,510
Hello.

108
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,540
Any recommendation for me?

109
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,340
What shall you have?

110
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,740
Would you like to try the coconut cake?

111
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,450
My son said it's the best.

112
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,140
- I will take one please.
- Sure.

113
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,400
For here or to go?

114
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,990
- I will have it here.
- Sure. Please wait a moment.

115
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,980
Excuse me.

116
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,700
Is Ter here?

117
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,700
You know Ter?

118
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,270
I go to the same school with him.

119
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,400
Oh really?

120
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,810
He said that his family owns a dessert cafe.

121
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,170
So that's why I'm stopping by.

122
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,390
You're his senior?

123
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,600
He's upstairs.

124
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,640
I will go get him.
Make yourself comfortable.

125
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,110
Thank you.

126
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,470
I didn't think you would really come.

127
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,220
You invited me.
How can I not?

128
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,890
And...

129
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,890
have you ordered anything?

130
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,140
All done.

131
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,320
- What did you order?
- Here they are.

132
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,030
Wow~

133
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,440
These are like bestseller menus.

134
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,270
Please enjoy.

135
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,340
- It's on the house.
- Really?

136
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,060
Umm.

137
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,650
- Thank you.
- Sure.

138
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,650
You have a friend over,
I have to.

139
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,770
You should try.
These are made by my mom.

140
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,540
It's the most delicious things.

141
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
- Really?
- Why?

142
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
You don't believe me?

143
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,910
If you don't, then try it.

144
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,970
Here.

145
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,350
Eat. Open your mouth.

146
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,710
How is it?
Good?

147
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,350
Is it good?

148
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,260
Don't keep me waiting.

149
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,930
It's delicious.

150
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,800
I'm relieved.
Thought you're not gonna like it.

151
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,340
Good, right?

152
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,860
Then you need to finish all of it.

153
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,770
I love this cake from my cafe the most.

154
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,570
I've had it since I was a kid until today.
Never get bored.

155
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,890
So good~

156
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,110
Thank you so much for dropping me off.

157
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,800
About being the photographer,
please think about it.

158
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,890
I'm actually interested.

159
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,680
But it's just...

160
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
...I'm not that confident with myself.

161
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,830
Why not?

162
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,870
I'm afraid it might turn out bad.

163
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,250
Don't think too much.

164
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,720
You can do it.

165
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,600
Yes.

166
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I will try then.

167
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,590
Attaboy.

168
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,760
I'm gonna go.

169
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,730
I'm so sick of you guys.

170
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,520
You're so disapointing.

171
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,290
Enough. Enough.

172
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,430
Are you going back with me?

173
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,760
Um. I will.

174
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Really?

175
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
I thought P'Hill is gonna pick you up.

176
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:09,280
Hey.

177
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,710
My friend is grumpy again.

178
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,520
You left me with him.

179
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,800
I did not leave you.

180
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,770
I just didn't want to be a third wheel.

181
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,770
You left me.

182
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,130
Whatever.

183
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,170
Oh dude.

184
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,890
I need your advice.

185
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,540
- What?
- So…

186
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,970
P’Hill asked me to be university's photographer.

187
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,160
But..

188
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,160
I’m not so confident.

189
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,160
Why not?

190
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,250
I think your pictures are great.

191
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,490
They are?

192
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,830
Yes.

193
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,240
You should be confident with yourself
just like when others trust you.

194
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,410
Even with P’Hill,

195
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,210
he believes that you can do it.

196
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,210
That’s why he asked.

197
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,230
Damn…

198
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,320
What a line.

199
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,580
I must be very cool when I said that huh?

200
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,230
You're wasting my time.

201
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,230
Look again.

202
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,650
I’m so sick of you.

203
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,910
That side, bring up the limbo.

204
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,710
Up up.

205
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,230
Set the camera.

206
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,080
Bring the stuff over here.

207
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,970
Put it here.

208
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,870
Put it down.

209
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,550
Set up and make it ready.

210
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,960
Hey.

211
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,320
Who are you here to see, kiddo?

212
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,030
P’Hill asked me to come take pictures.

213
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,030
Oh the photographer.

214
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,470
I’m Mei Li.

215
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,130
I’m the production manager.

216
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,790
- Hello P’Mei Li.
- Hi~

217
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:58,180
I’m Easter or you can just call me Ter.

218
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Ok nong Ter.

219
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,220
Anyways,
you brought your own camera?

220
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,900
You don’t have to next time.

221
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
We have one on set.
You can use it.

222
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,930
Come come.

223
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,930
I will introduce you to the others.

224
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,740
I will introduce all for you.

225
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,300
- Look.
- The watch is obvious.

226
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,300
Right.

227
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,820
What are you guys talking about?

228
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,240
Oh Mei Li is here.

229
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,820
- What’s up?
- It’s about Dr.Hill.

230
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,530
Ooh what is it about him?

231
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,530
Did you see his watch post?

232
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,040
The whole campus saw it.

233
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,290
Have you found out
who’s the owner of the watch?

234
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,960
He hasn’t told anyone at all.
He said he’s still trying.

235
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,830
Who would believe that?

236
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,320
Holding hands like that,
how can someone resist?

237
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,450
I would die since the taking care post.

238
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,610
- Right?
- I first thought it was Thunmild.

239
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,400
But if you look carefully it’s not her hand.

240
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,780
Dr.Hill is so difficult to read.

241
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,850
I have known him for years,
never seen him had an eye on anyone.

242
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,440
Yeah.
Not sure whether that person is still wearing the watch.

243
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,210
- If he does, people'd see it.
- Then start looking who's wearing the red watch.

244
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,210
- P’Mei Li.
- You tell me first thing.

245
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,420
Oh my gosh.
I lost track of time talking.

246
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,740
Guys this is Ter.
He'll be our behind the scene photographer.

247
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
- Hello.
- Hi.

248
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,050
I will catch up with you guys later.

249
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,710
Take care of it. Find it.

250
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,710
I will show him around the set.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,930
Here come. I will introduce you.

252
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,140
There’s nothing much…wait.

253
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,720
Are you wearing any watch today?

254
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,270
- No.
- Ok never mind.

255
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,940
Hi kiddos.

256
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,060
P’Mei Li is here.

257
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,980
You’re here.

258
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,640
How long have you arrived?

259
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,310
Awhile ago.

260
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,100
How did you get here?

261
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,900
I took the purple bus.

262
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,690
Why didn’t you tell me?

263
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,690
I could have picked you up.

264
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,270
I can get here by myself.

265
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,530
Shall we start?

266
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,030
Oh yes. We can.

267
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,680
We will start with Hill first.

268
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,450
Come on doc.

269
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,700
Turn this way please.

270
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,500
Turn around. Okay.

271
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,320
There.

272
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Shoot away.

273
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,790
Adjust the lighting for me too.
Make it soft.

274
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,320
Okay.

275
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,770
Hill, you can now post.
Go for it.

276
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,770
Smile.

277
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,880
Ready 1 2 3.

278
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,700
You’re finally my photographer.

279
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,800
Hill, please come over here
to do make up.

280
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,270
Go do your make up first,
then coma back and take some more.

281
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,950
Look after him for me please.

282
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,650
Sure thing.
I will take good care of him. No worries.

283
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,340
I will show you where they do the filming.

284
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
Great.

285
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,930
Ok so…

286
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:47,700
You will have to snap some of the shots
whatever you see like it will do.

287
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,860
It doesn’t matter.
It's behind the scene. For the rest, I will--

288
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,140
Ter.

289
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,600
Nong Ter.

290
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,270
Yes?

291
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,360
Why are you looking distracted?

292
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,930
I called you so many times.
You didn’t answer.

293
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,890
I’m sorry.

294
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,860
Or…

295
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,900
you were blushing with what Hill said?

296
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,030
Even I was feeling it as well.

297
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,140
It was nothing, P’Mei Li.

298
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,140
He was just kidding.

299
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,140
He did?

300
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,520
But I have never seen him
care anyone this much before.

301
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,330
Or you’re….

302
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,630
the guy from his posts?

303
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,510
No, I’m not. How can it be me?

304
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,550
Really?

305
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,870
But I’ve never seen him
talk like that to anyone either.

306
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,350
Are you guys close?

307
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,690
We went to the same high school.

308
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,690
Oh…nong from the same school.

309
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,120
Okay.

310
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,930
Let’s go.

311
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,640
I will have you waiting over there.

312
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,880
I will call you again.
Let me clear things over there first.

313
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:02,709
Do we have the camera ready?

314
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,691
Ok. We will start in a bit.

315
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,420
Hey Hill. You can sit down.

316
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,390
Thunmild please sit.

317
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,720
Listen up kids.

318
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,870
We'll film the combined one
and also each one for each faculty too.

319
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,330
Okay?

320
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,900
Prepared yourself.

321
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,700
I'll call out each faculty to come film.

322
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,700
Okay.

323
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,950
Ok Hill and Thunmild, you're next.

324
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,100
Others please stand by with people from your faculty.

325
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,400
Hill and Thunmild,
please give me some cute scenes.

326
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,260
You are the hope of Meds students.

327
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,580
They are so perfect together!

328
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,860
Hill is so handsome. Thunmild is also pretty.

329
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,940
What a perfect couple.

330
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,730
Awesome!

331
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,380
Hill, you have something in your hair.

332
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,890
It’s fine now.

333
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,580
Can you take a picture for me?

334
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,500
Can you?

335
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,090
Yeah. Sure.

336
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,490
Please relax.

337
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,180
1 2 3 go.

338
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,440
- Does it look okay?
- Hill!

339
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,440
- Let me adjust the lens.
- Dr.Hill.

340
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,880
Why are you looking so absent-minded?
Look at the camera.

341
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,370
Come on. We’re almost done.

342
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,620
You must be tired.

343
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,620
Thank you.

344
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,440
It's not that tiring.

345
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,220
I’m Junior.

346
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Mei Li said…

347
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
your name is Ter, right?

348
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,260
Yes.

349
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,140
Hey what are you doing here?

350
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,790
I saw him sitting here alone.

351
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,790
So I hang with him.

352
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,780
Oh okay.

353
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,520
You looked for the photographer yourself?

354
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,410
It’s actually Hill who suggested him.

355
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,410
Hill did?

356
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,120
Why?

357
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,100
No no. nothing.

358
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,160
But...

359
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,680
he’s kinda cute, right?

360
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,650
Easy there, Junior. He’s all scared now.

361
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,140
Don’t be scared Ter.

362
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,160
I’m fine.

363
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,040
Can I please have your LINE ID?

364
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,940
I might ask you to go take some pictures with me.

365
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,670
Thought you were not gonna give me.

366
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,510
I want some model anyway.

367
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,220
What are you doing?

368
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,220
P’Hill.

369
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,310
- What are you looking at?
- The cat.

370
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,430
Like cat meow meow?

371
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,830
Cat burglar.

372
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,920
Dog in a manger.

373
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,260
Enough enough. What’s going on?

374
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,020
Hill.

375
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,170
They said they'd like to continue with meds faculty.

376
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,190
Um.

377
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,420
I will go wait over there.

378
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,830
Hello~ I’m Thunmild.

379
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,000
I’m Hill.

380
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,980
We are medical student ambassadors.

381
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,330
Ok thats great.

382
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,990
Hill and Thunmild can go rest now.

383
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,990
Next faculty, please come on in.

384
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,180
Ter.

385
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,380
Yes?

386
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,380
Can I have your phone?

387
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,530
Why do you want it?

388
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,990
Can I have it please?

389
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,690
Don’t be stubborn.

390
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,380
Mild.

391
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,520
- Hmm?
- You’re not going home yet?

392
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,660
I’m about to.

393
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,390
Why don’t you ask Hill to go with you?

394
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,340
Better not.

395
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,030
Why?

396
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:48,510
Or…

397
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,510
you haven’t told him that you like him?

398
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,540
Well...

399
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,060
what if he doesn’t like me back?

400
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,060
Why wouldn’t he?

401
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,740
The whole school…

402
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,140
thinks you and Hill are together anyway.

403
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,260
But…

404
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,870
it’s already great being friends like this.

405
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,480
Then you might have to keep it to yourself
for the rest of your life?

406
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,970
What if Hill found someone he likes?

407
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,150
Can you bear that feeling?

408
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,840
When that time really comes,

409
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,730
I probably won’t be able to bear it.

410
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,850
Wake up! Class has ended.

411
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,700
Get up.

412
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,520
You go first. I’m tired.

413
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,550
Ter.

414
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,020
Wake up.

415
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,020
Give me 5 mins.

416
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,260
Class is over.

417
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,970
My class needs to use this room.

418
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:51,800
If you’re not gonna wake up,
I will carry you out.

419
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,420
P’!

420
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,600
Now, you're up.

421
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,380
Since when you’re here?

422
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,120
Just arrived.

423
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
All your friends are gone.

424
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,310
Would you excuse me then?

425
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,690
When is this gonna be over dude?

426
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,960
Not yet, Ter.

427
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,700
You go ahead. I will catch you later.

428
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,550
You got punished again?

429
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,380
Yes.

430
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,210
We forgot to clean the classroom.

431
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,170
We have to run almost 10 laps.
The whole class.

432
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,840
Are you okay?

433
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,600
I’m fine.

434
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,130
But you’re looking so pale.

435
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,130
I’m okay.

436
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,650
I will continue.

437
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,650
- Keep it up!
- Sure.

438
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,990
Hill.

439
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,110
The teacher told me
we'll be our class representatives to hold flower pedestal tray.

440
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,710
Um.

441
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,710
You’re not going home yet?

442
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,360
I’m waiting to play basketball.

443
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,400
I will go home then.

444
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,250
Let’s go get some drinks.

445
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,250
You go ahead.

446
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,120
Are you exhausted?

447
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,230
I am. Thank you.

448
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,230
I almost faint.

449
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,850
Thank you.

450
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,750
Hey Hill!

451
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,750
You’re not playing?

452
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,750
I have to take care of someone.

453
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,750
Who?

454
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,750
I’m not telling.

455
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,540
Come play later then.

456
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,750
I’m dizzy.

457
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,660
- Feeling better?
- I'm between life and death here.

458
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,660
Can I get a pic?

459
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
Sure.

460
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,410
Thanks dude.

461
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,380
You want me to pick you up?

462
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,180
It’s okay. I will go to the union.

463
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,590
I can find my own way.

464
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,590
Let P’Hill take you.

465
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,170
He’s probably not that available.

466
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,310
I think he would always be available for you.

467
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,800
Stop it, North.

468
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,130
You’re blushing!

469
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,400
I’m not.

470
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,540
I gotta go. Get home safely.

471
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,950
He’s always free. Just call him.

472
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,950
Wait a moment please.

473
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,920
Ughh my camera man is not here.
What am I gonna do?

474
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,740
P’Mei Li.

475
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,890
- Hey Ter.
- Hello.

476
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,890
Hi.

477
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,890
You need to help me again.

478
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,540
It’s alright. No problem at all.

479
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,530
What will you be filming today?

480
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,130
There’re actually interviews with each faculty.

481
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,870
It will be a long day.

482
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,980
Can you handle it?

483
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,750
I can. It’s all good.

484
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,880
But right now I have a favor ask you.

485
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,430
The usual photographer is not here yet.

486
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,620
Can you help us take some?
Could you please help me?

487
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,490
Sure. You’re more than welcome.

488
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,878
Okay you're awesome. This way.

489
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,260
Ok guys. Line up.

490
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,740
Come on. First one.

491
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,860
Smile with more confident.

492
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,810
Ok that's good.

493
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,810
Next please.
Oh...

494
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,810
Dr.Hill.

495
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,590
Shoot away.

496
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,590
Ready? 1 2 3.

497
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,990
That's great.

498
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:43,020
What a sweet smile!

499
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,580
The way you look at the camera
it's like you're looking at your lover.

500
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,010
Very strong emotion.

501
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,800
Ter.

502
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,740
- Ter.
- Yes?

503
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,760
Are you okay?

504
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
I'm okay.

505
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,760
Are you alright?

506
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,760
I'm fine.

507
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,620
Let's continue.

508
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,350
Let's do what you did just now.

509
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,140
Give us a sweet smile.

510
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,280
Sure.

511
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,530
If it's this photographer,
I will do anything for you.

512
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,050
Continue taking kiddo.

513
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,030
Okay.

514
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,880
Ok that's it.
All good since the first picture.

515
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,220
We're done.

516
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,220
You can go rest.

517
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
Next one, be prepared.

518
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,060
Why are you guys here?

519
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,720
Why?
We cannot be here or something?

520
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,240
We just wanna check you out.

521
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,800
And found something interesting.

522
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
"If it's this photographer,"

523
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
"I will do anything for you."

524
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:03,770
Is this the guy you were talking about?

525
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,160
Um.

526
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,710
Must be difficult.

527
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,900
Why?

528
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,150
Look.

529
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,510
Because the owner of 'my watch'
does not wear it anymore.

530
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,510
Ooh!

531
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,390
You're being mean.

532
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,070
Maybe he just forgot to wear it.

533
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,150
I'm really rooting for you my friend.

534
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,520
Umm.

535
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,020
Let's take a break.
Let the photographer get some drinks and rest.

536
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,560
Go rest near by.

537
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,890
Anyways...

538
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,060
I will just go get to know him a little.

539
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,130
No, you can't.

540
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,130
Hey Arthit!

541
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,130
Jo.

542
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,950
You should follow and check him out.

543
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,950
They might stir up some troubles.

544
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,360
Hello nong Ter.

545
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,060
Hello P'Johan.

546
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,100
I'm Arthit. A friend of Hill.

547
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,180
Right. P'Arthit.

548
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,150
What are you guys talking about?

549
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,590
Hi Easter.

550
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,350
My name is Tonfah. Nice to meet you.

551
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,650
Hello.

552
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,170
I'm Easter.

553
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,730
You can just call me Ter.

554
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,490
I'm a first year vet student.

555
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,960
First year vet student?

556
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,360
Your faculty must me close by to ours.

557
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,730
I remember the first years have to use our labs in meds building too.

558
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,690
We probably will see each toher often then.

559
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,690
You can go now. You already introduced yourself.

560
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,700
Hey don't be jealous.

561
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,920
We just got to introduce ourselves. Haven't really talked.

562
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,710
Nong Ter.

563
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,990
Please look after my friend.

564
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,880
Even if you don't like him, please have some mercy for him.

565
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,710
Because it seems like he is not the kind who loves anyone easily.

566
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,580
Go aways you guys.

567
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,000
Do not mind them.

568
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,840
Ter.

569
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,090
Yes?

570
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,800
I have something I wanna talk to you.

571
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,060
Yes.

572
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,040
Thank you.

573
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:51,400
Let's go.

574
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,770
I'm gotta go.

575
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,990
"Ter."

576
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,990
"I have something to talk to you."

577
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:14,870
You want to talk to me, P'Hill?

578
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,430
I don't know where to start.

579
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,610
I just want to start things over.

580
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,930
I think...

581
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,040
we've tried enough to run away from the past.

582
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,050
I think we should talk about it.

583
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,050
We shouldn't let it be like this.
Not good.

584
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,780
Do you have anything to ask me?

585
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,300
I can ask about anything?

586
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,660
I will answer every question you have.

587
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,390
How much can I trust you?

588
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,390
100%.

589
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,090
And...

590
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,970
how am I supposed to know that you're not lying?

591
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,590
I will prove it.

592
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:33,870
Then first question...

593
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:37,220
is....

594
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,110
You and P'Thunmild...

595
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,330
Why?

596
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,570
What are you guys to each other?

597
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,450
We're friends.

598
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,140
Oh.

599
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,790
You guys are not together?

600
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,620
I thought you guys have been dating.

601
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,120
I only see Thunmild as a friend.

602
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,110
Really?

603
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,810
And...

604
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,700
And...

605
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,240
what about Christ?

606
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,140
She's a sister.

607
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,030
But...

608
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,030
But you and--

609
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,300
I thought you like Christ.

610
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,640
I've never thought in that way with Christ.

611
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,700
And...

612
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,700
what about me?

613
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,820
Hmm?

614
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,820
Why?

615
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,010
What about me?

616
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,920
It's obvious.

617
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,530
Obvious what?

618
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,140
If I want to be with someone,

619
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,770
there's only one reason, isn't it?

620
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:48,410
That only reason is...

621
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:51,120
"that feeling"...right?

622
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,670
If...

623
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:00,220
what you mean by that is 'I like you' then...

624
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,850
yes.

625
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,870
Huh?

626
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,150
Since when?

627
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,200
What do you mean?

628
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,430
since when that you like me?

629
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,890
Probably before you even know me.

630
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,070
Huh!?

631
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,800
You don't believe me?

632
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,960
How is that possible?

633
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,570
Cause I have had...

634
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,550
What did you say?

635
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,930
Cause I have had a crush on you for so long.

636
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,060
Not as long as I do.

637
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,870
Can you go see him for me?

638
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,870
You will see something nice.

639
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,770
Is this the guy you're trying to date?

640
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:59,770
Yeah.

641
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:02,170
I can totally beat him, why not?

642
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,620
When you're drunk, the whole vibes will lead you there.

643
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,470
So Hill doesn't need to waste his time to go out with you.

644
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,500
Waste his time?

645
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,450
I thought you were not gonna answer my call.
