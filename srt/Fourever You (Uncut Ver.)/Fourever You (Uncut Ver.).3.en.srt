1
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,592
And how come you know him?

2
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:20,619
Fine. That's the guy.

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,444
That guy you said you hate him so much?

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,242
That's right.

5
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:26,240
So our friend,
Hill, is about to be married.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,874
So it's just us left
...Jo...Ton.

7
00:00:27,874 --> 00:00:29,870
It's probably not just me.

8
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:32,103
I thought you want to go take some pics.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,445
I know a place.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,211
Really beautiful.

11
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,210
Can I ask for one more thing?

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,830
Can I ask for one more thing?

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,390
What?

14
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,860
Can I be with you?

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,080
- What are we gonna do?
- Ter.

16
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,080
Ter. Calm down.

17
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,110
It's okay.

18
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,150
It's fine, Ter.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Don't worry.

20
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,890
Are we gonna be able
to see each other again?

21
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,680
We will.

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,520
Don't worry.

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,570
Wait for me, okay?

24
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,730
Yes.

25
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,730
I will wait.

26
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,340
Welcome.

27
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,780
Thank you.

28
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,180
P'Hill.

29
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,970
(Block Contact)

30
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,560
Can I be with you?

31
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,440
No.

32
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,920
Why are you smiling?

33
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,780
I didn't actually ask.

34
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,240
When I said 'can I be with you?',
I didn't ask.

35
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,020
I just wanna inform.

36
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,160
That's not funny.

37
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,630
Yes.

38
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,990
Not funny.

39
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm serious.

40
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,540
I'm not taking that.

41
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,510
But I already took it.

42
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,690
P'!

43
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,220
What are you talking about?
Stop it.

44
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,220
Ok. Sure.

45
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,030
But I already called dibs on you.

46
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,010
Are you hungry?

47
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,460
Let's go grab a bite.

48
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,920
You're not hungry?

49
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,680
Hmm?

50
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,780
Well...I am.

51
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,010
Good. This meal is on me.

52
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,430
- Sure.
- Let's go.

53
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,530
Are we going now?
It's still raining.

54
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,290
I will build an elevator here myself.

55
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,310
Where are you?

56
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,060
Oh Thunmild!

57
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,060
Have you seen, Hill?

58
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,060
He's probably at the union.

59
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,910
What a waste of time.

60
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,180
Is there something you need, P'Mei Li?

61
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,750
I need a little bit of help from Hill.

62
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,540
It's about the shoot to promote our university.

63
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,260
Is it the same one
that I will have to shoot as well?

64
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,030
Yes yes. That one.

65
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,880
Don't know what's wrong with him.
He hasn't answered my call.

66
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,220
I'm about to go see him at the union anyway.
I will tell him for you.

67
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,500
Please tell him for me, my dear

68
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,290
Tell him it's urgent.

69
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,990
Please. Thank you so much.

70
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,770
You're awesome!

71
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,300
You are the most awesome, girl!

72
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,870
See you.

73
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,990
(Student Union)

74
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,420
Here, P'Peem.

75
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Thank you.

76
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
More work.

77
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,250
This gives me a headache.

78
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,650
Hi Peem.

79
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,650
Oh hey, Mild.

80
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,290
Hill is not here?

81
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,350
He just left awhile ago.

82
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,350
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

83
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,980
But seems like he's probably having so much fun now.

84
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,780
Fun?

85
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,170
He went out by himself?

86
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,170
No, with a nong.

87
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
He's one of the guys from the union.

88
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:33,980
Who is he?

89
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,880
Not sure you will know him,
if I tell you.

90
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,760
Is it the guy Hill posted a picture with?

91
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,960
Hey you know him!?

92
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,120
Is he gonna come back?

93
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
Probably not.

94
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
If he does,
I'll tell him you stopped by.

95
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,800
It's fine, I will call him myself.

96
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,120
I'm just stopping by to see him.
That's all.

97
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,970
I will just go then.

98
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,580
Oh mild.

99
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,790
You and Hill went to the same high school right?

100
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:16,530
Umm.

101
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,260
Do you know someone named 'Easter' then?

102
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,270
Yes, we also went to the same school.

103
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,800
I knew it!

104
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,990
That's why those two always act so weird.

105
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,770
What do you mean?

106
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,830
It's nothing...it's just...

107
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,040
Seems like those two know each other before.

108
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,180
Oh.

109
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,590
I gotta go.

110
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,820
Bye bye.

111
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,800
I knew it that they had something goin' on.

112
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,980
My instinct was right.

113
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,170
The rain has stopped.

114
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,520
You can let me go now.

115
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,790
What's up, Mild?

116
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,800
Where are you, Hill?

117
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,280
What's up?

118
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,390
I came to see you at the union,
but you were't there.

119
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,080
What do you need?

120
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,270
P'Mei Li was asking for you.

121
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,610
She said she needs to talk to you.

122
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,020
But you didn't answer her calls.

123
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,250
Oh...I probably didn't have any signals earlier.

124
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,900
Seems like something urgent too.

125
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,560
It's something about
the shoot to promote our university.

126
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,780
Are you...

127
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,990
...going, Hill?
So I can tell her.

128
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,560
I can't be there today.

129
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
She didn't told me in advance.

130
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,820
You're busy?

131
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,590
Umm.

132
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,590
I am.

133
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,840
You guys met?

134
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,240
Hmm?

135
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,200
Nothing.

136
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,920
Today, you won't be at the faculty, right?

137
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,630
No.

138
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,120
I will see you tomorrow then.

139
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,660
Umm.

140
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,800
That's not nice.

141
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,240
Eavesdropping like that.

142
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,030
I did not.

143
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,980
Let's go eat.

144
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,230
Wait.

145
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,450
If you have some work to do,
we can leave.

146
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,520
But I rather spend time with you
and take you out for dinner.

147
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,290
There are some yummy cocoa and cakes too.

148
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,360
Ok fine. Let's go.

149
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,600
You're so cute
when you're not stubborn.

150
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,950
Let's go in.

151
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,960
Hello.
Did you book the table?

152
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,560
I did. A table for 2.

153
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,900
Under which name sir?

154
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,980
Ratchakit.

155
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,980
This way please.

156
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,510
Do you like the atmosphere here?

157
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,160
It's good.

158
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,860
Do you like me?

159
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,610
I do.

160
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,610
You said it.

161
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,440
I mean I like the restaurant.

162
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,990
Yeah I also meant the restaurant.

163
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,600
Do you want me to help you order?

164
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,030
What would like to eat?

165
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,530
The cake.

166
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,440
Hey.

167
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,720
You should eat something
before the dessert.

168
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,040
What!?

169
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,040
There's no need to scold.

170
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,150
Are you okay?

171
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,000
It's the picture.

172
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,150
Yes.

173
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,470
The picture you posted.

174
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,830
It's...

175
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,800
Forget it.

176
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,300
I'm serious.

177
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,010
About the picture I posted,

178
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,130
and also when I said I will be with you.

179
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,930
So...trust me.

180
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,060
Let's continue ordering.

181
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,220
I will eat now~

182
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,680
Careful! It's hot.

183
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,510
I will blow to cool it first.

184
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,020
Why are you looking like that
when you see your friend?

185
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,750
Why are you here?

186
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,500
Why?
Can't I be hungry too?

187
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,970
Are you the only one
that can be in this restaurant?

188
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,580
Who is this?

189
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,970
He's my nong.

190
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,580
Oh...nong.

191
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,580
Nong that I'm dating.

192
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,470
Cute too.

193
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,470
Jo!

194
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,220
Don't mind him.

195
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,340
Why?
Can I just get to know him like a brother?

196
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,340
No, you cannot.

197
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,850
Fine. Cannot it is.

198
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,850
I'm gonna go then.

199
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,880
I have to go.

200
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,120
I guess I have to eat somewhere else today.

201
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,560
Bye bye then.

202
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,680
Is he your friend?

203
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,110
Umm. His name is Johan.

204
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,040
Oh.

205
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
This is the guy.

206
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,800
You know him?

207
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,230
Yes for sure.

208
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,400
He's so popular.
A lot of people talk about him.

209
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,100
Talk about what?

210
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,180
Well...he's handsome.

211
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,260
What is he like in person?

212
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,260
Still handsome.

213
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,520
What about me?

214
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,540
Just eat.

215
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,540
It's getting cold.

216
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,140
Looks so good.
Wait a bit, I will eat you~

217
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,710
How was the cocoa and the cake?
Yummy?

218
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,590
It was.

219
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,040
I like it.

220
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,190
You seem to be in a better mood
after eating your favorites.

221
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,190
Yes, I am.

222
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,450
You remember?

223
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,450
What is my favorite food?

224
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,810
I remember everything about you, Ter.

225
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,230
Let's go.

226
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,910
Thank you.

227
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,950
Ter.

228
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,670
See you at the union.

229
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,380
And don't avoid me again.

230
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,020
Sure.

231
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,130
Can I be with you?

232
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,360
Shit.

233
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,240
Go! I gotta get away.

234
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,240
Hey, you're back.

235
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Where have you been?

236
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,690
Dinner.

237
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,110
You had dinner with P'doctor, huh?

238
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,040
Wowww~

239
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Wow your ass!

240
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,720
Hey for real?

241
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,530
You really went with P'Hill?

242
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,060
Was it a date?

243
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,030
How was it?

244
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,080
It was not a damn date.

245
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
So how was it?

246
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,430
What are you talking about?

247
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,430
About P'Hill.

248
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,730
I don't know.

249
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,110
He's dating you now?

250
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,430
I guess so.

251
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,510
If other people found out
that he's dating you,

252
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,510
they would cry their eyes out.

253
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,100
Right.

254
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,680
There're many people out there,
why me?

255
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,630
Dude.

256
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,010
Or he's just messing with me?

257
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,010
Why would he do that?

258
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,500
Like make you fall in love and leave you?

259
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,580
Who knows?

260
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,220
That would be too much.

261
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,220
It's possible.

262
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,390
If you don't like him,
then just tell him directly.

263
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,480
I already did that.

264
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,480
and he didn't stop?

265
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,440
I'm just gonna go shower.

266
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,930
- Hey don't leave!
- You’re not making any sense.

267
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,300
I still haven't got the answer.

268
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,800
Just play your games.

269
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,930
Play all day all night.
Play until you're blind.

270
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,930
I can play, but you--

271
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,070
...didn't tell the whole story.

272
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,180
Hi son. Arrived home already?

273
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,960
Yes, dad.

274
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,380
Where are you, dad?

275
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,380
I'm with grandma.

276
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,870
How is she?

277
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:26,400
Same same.

278
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,435
She will wake up eventually.

279
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,990
Are you guys doing okay?

280
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,530
We're fine.

281
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,530
We takes turn to be with her.

282
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,530
Don't worry.

283
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,960
How are you? Are you tired?

284
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:01,110
What about grandpa?

285
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,228
Like usual

286
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,890
If you have time,
go visit him sometimes.

287
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:15,640
You're not mad at him at all?

288
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:17,160
Hill.

289
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,970
I have to go.

290
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,020
You guys take care of yourself too,

291
00:24:28,312 --> 00:24:29,920
You too, son.

292
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,030
What's up?

293
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,030
You were gone all day yesterday.

294
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,810
What are you doing?

295
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,340
Nosy.

296
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,790
Hey.

297
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,560
I will get back to you later.

298
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,210
Hill.

299
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,720
Have you talked to P'Mei Li?

300
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,290
I will go see her today.

301
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,290
Don't forget please.
It seems urgent.

302
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,450
Where were you yesterday?

303
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:48,660
I took nong to take some pictures.

304
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,500
I will go now.

305
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,940
So you took someone out to take pictures?

306
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,120
It's none of your business.

307
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,360
Mild, do you know whose was it
that P'Hill posted a picture with?

308
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,820
- What picture?
- Here

309
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,170
- (The owner of my watch)
- Who is that?

310
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,550
I don't know.

311
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,510
I don't know who to find anymore.
What are we gonna do?

312
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,750
Oh hey.
Hill, what are you doing here?

313
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,760
Heyyy golden boy.

314
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,460
Come here. Sit here.

315
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,650
Please sit.

316
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,020
Where were you all day yesterday?

317
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,000
I had an appointment.

318
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,090
Appointment?
You're sure it's not a date?

319
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,820
You have something to talk to me?

320
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,330
Oh.

321
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,980
It's about the promoting video we discussed.

322
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,940
Is there a problem?

323
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,500
I basically want representatives
from each faculty to shoot.

324
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
For med students,

325
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,950
can you help me out?

326
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,540
Thunmild will also be there.

327
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,010
Err....it's pretty busy at the union lately.

328
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,950
It's just a day or two.

329
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,380
Please. Help me out.

330
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,250
If you don't help me,
I don't know what to do anymore.

331
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,040
Have you tried Jo, Ton, or Arthit?

332
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,860
Those guys you're asking?

333
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,530
Please just help me, Jo.

334
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,530
You'll be your faculty's representative.

335
00:28:19,842 --> 00:28:21,620
Sure.

336
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,730
Are you serious?

337
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,640
If you can shoot this in the hoop,
I will do it.

338
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,460
Too bad.

339
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,430
I just wasted my time, didn't I?

340
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,780
- Lately..
- I'm busy lately.

341
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,070
Ughh. Hear me out first.

342
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,660
What's up?

343
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,900
- So next week--
- I'm also not free next week.

344
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,800
Why are you so busy?

345
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,630
I'm sorry.

346
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,790
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.

347
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,790
I will just ask some other people.

348
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,740
Thank you.

349
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,990
Sure.

350
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,020
I don't know what to do,
if you're not helping me.

351
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,750
I would be in so much trouble.

352
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,490
Just a bit of shooting.
I know you can do it, Arthit.

353
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,200
Just following the script.
A short interview.

354
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,620
I know you can do it Arthit.
Not long. I'm not---

355
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,710
I spoke for so long.

356
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,710
Are you seriously asleep?

357
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,770
Just like that.

358
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,250
There's only you, Hill.
Please help me.

359
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,650
You are my last hope.

360
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,390
Fine.

361
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,660
You're the best!

362
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,330
Thank you.

363
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,760
Oh...do you also know anyone that can take pictures?

364
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,520
I want someone
to take behind the scene pictures.

365
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,340
Someone to take pictures?

366
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,340
Do you know anyone?

367
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,330
I know a guy.

368
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,330
- I will handle it.
- Right?

369
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,890
I will let you handle that.

370
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,180
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

371
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,750
Thank you. Really.

372
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,070
You're the best!
Girls.

373
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,070
Isn't he so cute?
Ayy~

374
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,590
Shit.

375
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,720
What's going on?
Calm down.

376
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Are you okay?

377
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Dude. I can't.

378
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,580
Look.

379
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,280
It's just a picture.

380
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,050
Um.

381
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,820
Holding hands.

382
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,050
Then what?

383
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,050
We can see a watch.

384
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,340
But that's your watch, isn't it?

385
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Yes.

386
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,250
Whatever.
People can't see your face,

387
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,340
P'Hill. P'Hill.

388
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,710
Enough.
Stop looking at it.

389
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,160
Hey Ter.

390
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,940
You don't seem to be mad though.

391
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,990
It's like you're blushing.

392
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,520
Really?
You're not denying too.

393
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,060
- What?
- So?

394
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,410
It's nothing.

395
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:57,950
So you guys were holding hands?

396
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,630
He asked for my hand.

397
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,680
And you let him?

398
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Um.

399
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,810
And...

400
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,810
why are you not okay?

401
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,850
It just seems weird.

402
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,850
How?

403
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,950
I don't know.

404
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,130
This is why...

405
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,420
...he hasn't posted a picture with your face.

406
00:32:34,426 --> 00:32:35,720
Why?

407
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,390
Cause you, yourself,
still don't know how you feel.

408
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,440
He's probably waiting for you
to recognize your own feeling first.

409
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,500
And when things are settled,

410
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,420
he will make it public.

411
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,710
Making it public?
No way.

412
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,750
No way? We'll see.

413
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,000
Dude. You have to be on my side.

414
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I'm always on your side.

415
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,480
But you're always overthinking.

416
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,410
Dude.

417
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,660
Or he's just pretending
to make me believe him?

418
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,360
You're so pessimistic.

419
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,280
Try to be open-minded.

420
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,410
There's nothing wrong with that.

421
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,670
You...

422
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,310
Being open-minded is not easy to do.

423
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,710
Cause I've been hurt so much before.

424
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,710
You've been hurt before?

425
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,230
Well...

426
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,400
when I was in high school,

427
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,910
I had a crush on him.

428
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,800
Huh?

429
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:56,030
I told you before.

430
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,940
I went to the same school with him.

431
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,360
I met him quite often.

432
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,790
And I just fell for him.

433
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,790
But...

434
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,110
But what?

435
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,000
He liked my sister.

436
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,750
You helped out at my shop so often,
my mom should pay for your wages already.

437
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,780
Can I get free coconut cakes
for a lifetime then?

438
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
That's not a problem at all.

439
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,540
P'Hill.
Just coconut cake is not enough.

440
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,910
I'll also give you cocoa.

441
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,810
Please. Try it.

442
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,640
I've been practicing.
But cannot make it as good as my mom does.

443
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,650
How is it?

444
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,090
Good?

445
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,630
You've improved actually.

446
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,630
Really?

447
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,730
Er...but have I
ever made one for you to try?

448
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,470
P'Ter.

449
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:37,990
Come help me with my homework.

450
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,610
P'Hill.

451
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,370
Hello.

452
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,130
Hello.

453
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,750
Oh.

454
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,320
Here. Let P'Hill help you.
He's so much smarter.

455
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,410
Can you help Christ with her homework?

456
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:16,900
Do you mind?

457
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,600
Not at all.

458
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,410
- You're not troubling me.
- Really?

459
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:30,400
You're the kindest person.

460
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,500
And my sister also likes him a lot.

461
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,350
What can I do?
Except keeping it to myself for the past 2 years.

462
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,160
And you...

463
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
helped your sister out?

464
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,320
Don't tell me
you were the matchmaker for your sister and P'Hill?

465
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,980
And did they end up dating?

466
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:00,840
Dude.

467
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,280
If they were actually together,
it'd be easier for me to move on.

468
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,240
So if they liked each other,
why didn't they end up dating?

469
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,980
Okay.

470
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,980
Just tell me when you're ready.

471
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,590
Now, I kinda understand
why you're not opening up your mind.

472
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:28,160
And has he ever brought up your sister
when you guys talk?

473
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,800
No. Nothing. Like nothing happened.

474
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,550
What about your sister?

475
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,870
Oh.

476
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,620
I haven't talked to her for so long as well.

477
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,830
And when you were in high school,

478
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,910
did he give you any signs or hints?

479
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,910
To let you know that he likes you?

480
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,170
Not really.
He's always nice...

481
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,170
and kind to everyone.

482
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,840
Everyone?

483
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,000
And can you move on?

484
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,720
I think I can...

485
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,000
Then...

486
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,200
just forget it.
You don't have to care.

487
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,280
If he doesn't take it serious with you,
he will stop eventually.

488
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,400
But maybe...

489
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,000
he might suddenly want to commit with you.

490
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,160
There's no commiting or anything.

491
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
No way.

492
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,630
I think you need the time to tell you.

493
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,440
If you can move on from him,
then you don't have to care.

494
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,190
Right.

495
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,720
Christmas.

496
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,990
Ter.

497
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:32,990
Let's go.

498
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,240
- Hey.
- I'm coming.

499
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Let's just go down.
Come on.

500
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,080
You're talking too much.

501
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,570
I made my mind.

502
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,230
- Made your mind about what?
- About what I told you.

503
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,860
I have moved on from him.

504
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,980
So I will no longer care about him.

505
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,040
Even if I meet him at the union or in campus,
I will just ignore him.

506
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,970
Like I cannot see him at all.

507
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,180
And now he will stop talking to me.

508
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,730
So how does that sound?

509
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,750
What?

510
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,750
Why are you poking me?

511
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,580
Dude!

512
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,955
P’Hil lasked me to be the photographer for our university,

513
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,958
but I’m not confident at all

514
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,669
But he thinks you can do it.

515
00:40:39,669 --> 00:40:41,660
That’s why he asked.

516
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:43,887
Please look after him.

517
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,423
I’ve never seen you care anyone this much before.

518
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,952
The owner of my watch is no longer wearing i

519
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:52,302
Oh can I have your LINE?

520
00:40:52,302 --> 00:40:54,300
Are you P’Thunmild together or something?
