00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,756
CHEONHA LATE NIGHT SNACKS

2
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,339
BATH HOUSE

3
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,017
Who ordered the kong-guksu?

4
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,487
Hey! What the heck!

5
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,889
Hey! How dare you come in here?

6
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,725
This is the women's bath, you pervert!

7
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,826
Get out!

8
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,230
What the heck
do you think you're doing in here?

9
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,931
Hey! Are you deaf? Get out!

10
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,134
What the heck? Get out!

11
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,870
Who the heck does he think he is?

12
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,572
That pervert!
What is this world coming to?

13
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,207
He's here again! He came in again!

14
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,176
Somebody ordered kong-guksu.
Give me my money.

15
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,980
-Hey! Get out!
-Get the heck out!

16
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,681
I'm a girl!

17
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:32,118
-What? You're a guy!
-Get out!

18
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,258
Why are you causing such a ruckus?

19
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,526
Jeez!

20
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,364
-Two.
-Two.

21
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,567
Two?

22
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,671
Look at your cards. Here's a two.

23
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,106
What? I don't have any cards to play.

24
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,245
-Here. Uno! You have to take three cards.
-Hey!

25
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,750
-That's right.
-I saw you!

26
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,585
I did it on purpose to let you win.

27
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,421
What?

28
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,325
Jack, jack, four.

29
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,494
-Three.
-Here.

30
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,800
Stop it! Take three cards.

31
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,403
Okay. One, two, three.

32
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,441
-Six. Have anymore?
-Nine.

33
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,476
How about this? Uno!

34
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,579
Uno.

35
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,448
-What are you going to change it to?
-Whatever you want.

36
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,250
-Hearts.
-Okay, hearts.

37
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,018
Uno.

38
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,620
Joker.

39
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,057
You're really good. You meanie.

40
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,894
Let's play again when we're in Seoul.

41
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,062
In Seoul?

42
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,065
I doubt that we'll meet again.

43
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,209
Hi. It's me.

44
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,912
I just got back.

45
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,518
I'm at home.

46
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,389
Of course I missed you.

47
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,026
But I'm way too dirty right now.

48
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:24,897
I just can't let you see me
in this filthy state.

49
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,367
Jeez! Don't you use
that playboy voice with me.

50
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,871
I thought I was going to die
because I missed you so much.

51
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,240
I'm not exaggerating.

52
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,576
You never answer my calls.

53
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,178
Hey! I told you to just leave!

54
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,181
But I devoted my youth to that place!

55
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,685
Youth? I didn't make you waste your youth!

56
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,022
If you want to talk about youth,
go and talk to that slut!

57
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,992
How dare you say such a thing
after abandoning the person

58
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,761
who supported you for 20 years for a girl?

59
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:56,529
Ma'am!

60
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,798
You better rush over here
as soon as possible.

61
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,066
Your grandma's angry.

62
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,801
But I've already ordered the food.

63
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,147
By the way, have you seen Han-sung?

64
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,617
He cleaned his place
when he heard you were coming back.

65
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,253
No.

66
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,756
I'll probably run into him
since we live in the same neighborhood.

67
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,861
Food delivery!

68
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,571
What the heck?

69
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,911
My food's here. Bye, Mom.

70
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,447
-Hey! Han-gyeol!
-Come on in. The door's open.

71
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,316
-Your food's here.
-Please put it on the table.

72
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,384
Sure.

73
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,156
What are you doing? Just come in.

74
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:58,725
Okay.

75
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,573
By the way.
Do you guys also have naengmyeon?

76
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,108
We do.

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,589
Why is everyone naked today?

78
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,826
Is my package that impressive?

79
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,095
All day, since this morning,
both women and men.

80
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,935
My legs are shaking.

81
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,340
He was staring for so long.

82
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,642
I didn't pay.

83
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,303
Did you see my fantastic kicks?

84
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,239
Hey! Come on! Applause!

85
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,809
Eun-chan! Koh Eun-chan!

86
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,478
Hey! Chan! I need help.

87
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,214
Master Koh.

88
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:33,252
Something really urgent came up
and I need you to come with me.

89
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,955
The toilet must be clogged up again.

90
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,690
Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack

91
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,892
-Can't you hurry up?
-We'll do this later.

92
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,497
You needed help for this?

93
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,466
Calling me away from the kids
to unclog the toilet.

94
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,234
Why can't you unclog it yourself?

95
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:52,338
You know I don't have the stomach
to do that.

96
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,940
You're such a nagger.

97
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,512
That's why you should poop
in small chunks.

98
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:03,149
Hey. See if you can control your sphincter

99
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,252
and cut your poop like that
when you're my age.

100
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,320
By the way,

101
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,791
I heard that your taekwondo master
put the gym up for sale.

102
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:15,228
Why did that kung fu gym
have to open across the street?

103
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,231
Because of that, yours is closing.

104
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,766
-It's my mom.
-What? It's your mom.

105
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,568
Those are new shoes.

106
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,836
Excuse me.

107
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,805
Mom!

108
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,908
Mom! You bought new shoes again!

109
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,778
Wait a minute! Wait a minute, Mom!

110
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,713
Hello?

111
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,115
She is gone already.

112
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,184
-Eun-chan!
-I need to go.

113
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,886
Imelda bought new shoes again.

114
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,055
Eun-chan! This punk keeps bothering me.

115
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,357
A punk?

116
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,392
You like punks. What's the problem?

117
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,694
Where did she go?

118
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,596
But this guy's a real punk!

119
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,132
Hey! I'm not a punk.

120
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,867
I'm a gangster!

121
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:55,968
Hey!

122
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,237
Who is that bastard?

123
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:03,376
I like girls with skinny arms and legs,
and a big face

124
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,877
like you.

125
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,612
Shut the hell up.

126
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,181
I'm going to go and sit next to you.

127
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,750
Do that and you're dead.

128
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,219
I'm being sincere. Why don't you get that?

129
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,154
Eun-sae.

130
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,392
Jeez!

131
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,861
What the heck? Who is he?

132
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,165
Hello.

133
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,234
Hey, Eun-chan.

134
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,243
Hey, Koh Eun-sae.

135
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,345
Is this guy your boyfriend?

136
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,348
I'm getting offended here.

137
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:45,985
It's understandable that you like me.

138
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,288
But we're just not meant for each other.

139
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,490
You're a high school dropout.

140
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,328
You don't have a good education,
you're poor, and you're not good-looking.

141
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,163
Where do you get the guts to hit on me?

142
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,998
Can't you see how much I love you?

143
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,700
You're my angel,

144
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,001
Eun-sae.

145
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,202
I know.

146
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,037
But money is more important

147
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,173
than love to me.

148
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,310
Are you saying that this wimp
has a lot of money?

149
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,413
We didn't order yet.

150
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,984
That's why I guessed what you would want
and brought them.

151
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,121
This place is weird.

152
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,856
This aroma kills.

153
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,559
Hey! Let's have it out, you and me!

154
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:29,729
Mr. Hong! This coffee tastes great!

155
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,799
Eun-chan,
let's get this over with and go home.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,534
What? Home?

157
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,205
What did you do to my Eun-sae?

158
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,273
-Are you two living together?
-Let go of me!

159
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,142
No, you bastard! Let's end this right now!

160
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,377
Let go!

161
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,314
Hey, don't be such a wuss.

162
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,116
Just know this.

163
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,918
The guy I beat up three years ago
is still in the ICU.

164
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,254
So just consider yourself lucky
and get out of here.

165
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:56,856
Why you little...

166
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,258
Didn't you just hear what I said?

167
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,360
I'm a taekwondo master!

168
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:02,828
I wrestled in high school.

169
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,296
On a team that sucked?

170
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,499
I'm the breadwinner for my family.

171
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,869
I can't lose my license
after beating the crap out of you

172
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:11,303
and lose my source of income.

173
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,406
I'm too hungry to talk,

174
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,409
so quit bothering me
and just get out of here.

175
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,077
I think you should just beat him up.

176
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,112
This is Prince Coffee.
I'd like jjajangmyeon--

177
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
Me too!

178
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,181
Why you...

179
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,518
You want some too?

180
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:31,323
Okay. Thank you.

181
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,193
One jjajangmyeon for Prince Coffee Shop.

182
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,828
Pack a lot of pickled radishes!

183
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,998
This is on the house.

184
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,766
-On the house? Great!
-Enjoy.

185
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,669
I'll be overeating if I finish all this.

186
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,371
You better keep your word, Eun-sae.

187
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,040
If I beat him, you're mine, okay?

188
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,709
Do you have money for the food?

189
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,544
I'm not going to lose. You are.

190
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,414
Would you be the referee, Mr. Hong?

191
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,952
The person who finishes
all five bowls first will win.

192
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,488
If you lose, you will pay for the food
and the coffee.

193
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,857
Why were you looking at me
when you said that?

194
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,593
Let's just get this over with. Ready?

195
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,196
Get set! Go!

196
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,851
See? That's your problem.
You have to eat all of that.

197
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,041
Dog food.

198
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,211
Pizza. Pork porridge.

199
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,981
Cooking oil. Pork rinds.

200
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,285
Boils on your butt

201
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,787
oozing puss and blood!

202
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,892
Rotten margarine with a big fat fly in it.

203
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,863
Creepy crawly worm spaghetti.

204
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:57,803
The grease from my shiny nose!

205
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,390
Shoot.

206
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,261
Shoot.

207
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,940
These aren't very good.

208
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,111
Just one more bowl to go.

209
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,380
Mr. Hong,

210
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,249
do you have any pickled radish left over?

211
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,583
Sure.

212
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,047
Give me a lot.

213
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,387
Is this all you have? I need more.

214
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,363
You lose if you puke!

215
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,778
Be careful! Don't get it on the floor!

216
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,446
Go to your grandma.

217
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,185
I didn't want to come here either,
but Grandma and Mom insisted.

218
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,387
I'll stay for five minutes.

219
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,530
Do you hate me that much?

220
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,765
You even skipped dinner.

221
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,542
TAMING HAN-GYEOL

222
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,844
1. GET CONTROL
2. SUBMIT EVIDENCE

223
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,878
3. GET A GIRL

224
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,330
Do you think Han-gyeol

225
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,198
and his dad are talking?

226
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,901
Have you memorized

227
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,536
what you're going to say to Han-gyeol?

228
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,372
What? Almost.

229
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,808
I think that it would be best

230
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,311
to tell him about your condition--

231
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,813
For what?

232
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,782
He's too weak.

233
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,518
If he finds out that I have cancer,
he'll faint.

234
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:33,685
Leave him alone.

235
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,789
I've lived long enough.

236
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,825
Even if I die tomorrow,
I would have no regrets.

237
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,895
I've lived a full life.

238
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,067
Anyway, I just don't understand.

239
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:51,570
Sure, his dad was always aloof.

240
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,807
But Han-gyeol adored his dad
when he was young.

241
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,375
Why is he so cold to him now?

242
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,179
I thought it would improve over time,

243
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,314
but it gets worse by the day.

244
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,751
I asked them both, but they say
they don't know the reason.

245
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:09,154
I asked his friends,
and they say all men are like that.

246
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,423
Men are so stupid.

247
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,260
Okay. I'm done!
Tell Han-gyeol to come here.

248
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,111
What's wrong with you two?

249
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,545
You look relaxed.

250
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,785
Get control!

251
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,289
You've partied hard with my money
for the past five years.

252
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,092
You can't tell me
you're not done partying after five years!

253
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,760
This is nice.

254
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,563
Now that I hear you screaming,
I feel like I'm home.

255
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,234
Don't you dare use
your playboy tactics on me!

256
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,570
I sent you to get your MBA,
not study movie production!

257
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,174
That's not all.

258
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,343
He entered no less than six schools
during that time.

259
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,311
You irresponsible, incorrigible boy!

260
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,014
Movie-making wasn't enough,
now you play with toys?

261
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,617
Did you or did you not promise me
you would come back

262
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,118
before you turn 30?

263
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,486
But I'm only 29.

264
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,788
Grandma,

265
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,558
why don't we go to Madu
for some old-school shaved ice?

266
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:20,526
What?

267
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:22,361
Shaved ice?

268
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,788
Submit evidence.

269
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,691
Hey. That's Dick!

270
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,893
He's really photogenic.

271
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,495
What is this doing here?

272
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,331
We heard you liked each other,

273
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,767
and that you guys were
always together and kissing.

274
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,570
Your friend in SoHo sent this to us!

275
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,704
Kissing?

276
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,873
You know what that is.

277
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,209
You little punk.

278
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,112
How could you let your mom and grandma
see such shameless behavior?

279
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,749
You should have a family by now
at your age,

280
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,785
not kissing another man!

281
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,124
GET HIM A GIRL!

282
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,730
Get married right away!

283
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,466
Do you want to set me up then?

284
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,835
But she has to be pretty.

285
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,605
Not for my sake,
but for your great-grandchildren.

286
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,942
What did I tell you?
This isn't going to work on him.

287
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,578
I still want to see this
all the way through.

288
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,249
They're adorable.

289
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,119
I'm back.

290
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,721
Hello, dear.

291
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,089
I'm so tired.

292
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,925
Did you finish your daily quota?

293
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,060
I don't think I can today.

294
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,929
I just got back from my school reunion.

295
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,197
Right. The shoes.

296
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:09,234
Oh, those aren't very expensive, Eun-chan.

297
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,236
Just leave her alone.

298
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,306
100,000 won is cheap for relieving stress.

299
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,275
That's what she lives for, you know.

300
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,810
Can't you just shut up
while you're pooping?

301
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,880
-Is 100,000 won cheap?
-No, it isn't.

302
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,316
I know. That's why I'm peeling
these chestnuts

303
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,920
until my fingertips bleed
and I get boils on my butt.

304
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,255
Mom.

305
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,892
"If you spent less money, you wouldn't
have to work until your hands bleed."

306
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,394
That's what you were going to say, right?

307
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,963
It's useless anyway.

308
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,731
Give it a break. What's done is done.

309
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,899
Aren't you going to study?

310
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,501
You said you'd go to college.

311
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,269
This increases my concentration.

312
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:50,108
Putting these on makes me feel smarter.

313
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:53,111
I concentrate so hard
that they're becoming cross-eyed.

314
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,147
I feel like I'm getting cross-eyed too.

315
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,751
Hello?

316
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,887
Hey! Dong-suk!

317
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,324
Yes. I got home fine.

318
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,694
The ring? I'm wearing the ring right...

319
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,062
Where did it go?

320
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,598
Of course I have it.

321
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,134
It's in the room.

322
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,804
I'll go get it and call you back.

323
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,406
What?

324
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,609
Where could it be?

325
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,347
That's right. My purse.
I must have left it in my purse.

326
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:31,750
Did she just say "ring"?

327
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:35,020
Yeah. But why is Mom
looking for Aunt Dong-suk's ring?

328
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,824
I can't find her diamond ring!

329
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,394
Hold that steady, will you?

330
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,996
Why would the ring be under that?

331
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,133
Are you sure you were wearing it?

332
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,103
I'm absolutely sure I was wearing it.

333
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:54,072
Where could it be?

334
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,641
Eun-chan!

335
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,310
Do you see it anywhere?

336
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,389
Hey! Are you crazy?

337
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,134
-Go!
-Go!

338
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,521
Round and round.

339
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,992
Don't do it!

340
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,128
Don't! That's so gross! Don't do it!

341
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,831
-You lost! You just blinked!
-No, I didn't!

342
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,100
Yes, you did!

343
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,402
-Liar!
-Hey!

344
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:08,206
-Hey!
-Liar!

345
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,544
You lost, right?

346
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,646
-No comment. Let me go!
-You lost.

347
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,380
Hello?

348
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,450
Why are you panting?

349
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,986
It's because I'm hot for you, Han Yoo-joo!

350
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,423
It always puts me in a good mood
when you call me by my full name.

351
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:00,825
Where are you?

352
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,094
Isn't it early in the morning there?

353
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,563
I'm in Seoul. Let's meet up.

354
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,299
What? Really?

355
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,235
Then come to Hongdae later.

356
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,403
Okay.

357
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,982
Yeah!

358
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,252
Isn't this better than SoHo?

359
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:28,887
Sure.

360
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,791
Here, I have tteok-bokki,
sundae sausages, and you...

361
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,193
And there's Han-sung, too.

362
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,762
I wonder how he's doing.

363
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:40,098
Is it over between you
and that successful boyfriend of yours?

364
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:41,166
Mr. DK.

365
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,767
DK.

366
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,269
Take a look.

367
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:48,373
What do you think?

368
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:52,243
-How much is this?
-It's 10,000 won.

369
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,213
It looks great on you.

370
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:56,581
Thanks.

371
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,985
I feel so sorry for Mr. DK.

372
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:03,822
Isn't it a little harsh to dump him
as soon as you became successful?

373
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:06,591
Are you disrespecting my art?

374
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,262
Maybe you should get back...

375
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,732
With Han-sung?

376
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:22,707
You should've been nicer to him
considering you're his first love.

377
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,786
Come on. Let's go.

378
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,873
Aren't you excited that you might run
into Han-sung

379
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,207
when you come to this neighborhood?

380
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,476
Does it make you happy to say that?

381
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,514
Want to come up?

382
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:04,215
I'll pass.

383
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:17,796
Wait here.

384
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,831
I'll get the present I bought for you
and take you home.

385
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,407
Why the heck would I give

386
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,077
a three months' advance to a part-timer?

387
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,878
Think before you speak, punk!

388
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,148
True. No one would give a part-timer
an advance.

389
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,829
He's so fast.

390
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,309
Fine!

391
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:11,483
Hold on.

392
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,166
Are you all right?

393
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,634
-What is it?
-My purse!

394
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,681
Let me take a look.
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

395
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:44,649
I'm okay.

396
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,818
Don't just say you're okay. Try to get up.

397
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,154
Being formal with me now
that you're desperate?

398
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,792
Get up, you bastard!

399
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,529
-You.
-Let me go!

400
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,298
Why are you snatching purses?

401
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,168
I'm going to pay for Eun-sae's tuition
at the singing academy. Why?

402
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,769
Eun-sae's tuition?

403
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,339
Someone seems to have caught
the purse snatcher.

404
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,309
I'll go take a look. You stay here.

405
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,644
I'll go with you.

406
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,014
Why are you worrying about Eun-sae?

407
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,983
She's my... She's my sister.

408
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,619
-No, she isn't! She's my angel!
-You brainless idiot.

409
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:28,126
You need to spend some time
in the big house.

410
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,794
Follow me!

411
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,598
What am I going to do?

412
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:38,269
Hey! I want you to push me and run away.

413
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,804
What?

414
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:43,308
Jeez! Run away, dimwit!

415
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:46,044
Are you ready? You punk.

416
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:49,647
Why is a kid like you
snatching people's purses?

417
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,449
On the count of three!

418
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:56,020
One, two, three!

419
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,691
What are you doing? Run.

420
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:06,998
Hey! Stop right there! Hey!

421
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,304
I lost him.

422
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,511
Thank you.

423
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,015
You're hurt. Are you all right?

424
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,149
Yes, I'm all right.

425
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,784
Damn it.

426
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,365
Shit! I'm dead meat!

427
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,669
What are you doing?

428
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,006
Come on. Start!

429
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,778
Sorry. This was my fault.

430
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,547
No. This is just a piece of junk,
that's all.

431
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,251
Go and get your scooter fixed
and if you call me at this number--

432
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,588
This is all a ploy, isn't it?

433
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,491
You should take a bigger cut.

434
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,460
It's risky remaining at the scene
of the crime, don't you think?

435
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,869
You should use a bike
that looks more expensive.

436
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,304
What are you trying to say?

437
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,204
Han-gyeol!

438
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,839
Call if you have the guts to confess.

439
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,575
You clearly have a sad life,
so I'll pay for the repairs.

440
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,946
-What's wrong with you?
-You got hurt!

441
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,648
Leave.

442
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,318
What's wrong with you?

443
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,619
They're low-lives.

444
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:35,987
You shouldn't associate with them.

445
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,191
Look!

446
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:42,393
I'm not that kind of person!

447
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,396
Goodness!

448
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,467
Why won't this stupid thing start?

449
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,438
What the heck? Where's the mirror?

450
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,977
What the heck? What am I going to do now?

451
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,245
Gosh!

452
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:14,559
I hired a chick because you were cheap,
but you cause trouble every day!

453
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,628
What does being a girl
have to do with anything?

454
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,364
Well, you are a girl. You're not a boy!

455
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,166
No.

456
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,837
Take the scooter and leave.
You messed it up, so you fix it.

457
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,640
Keep it and we'll call it even.

458
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:33,311
What?

459
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,628
Sweeper!

460
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:24,529
Hey!

461
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,364
How are you?

462
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,833
How about a howl?

463
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,316
Nice.

464
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,186
You totally cheered me up.

465
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,955
I've been feeling down lately.

466
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,694
What's your master up to these days?

467
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,164
Drag him out once in a while.
He lights up the town.

468
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,066
Bye, Sweeper.

469
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,134
Bye.

470
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:05,470
Bye.

471
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:14,312
CHOI HAN-SUNG

472
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,218
Who is she? She's funny.

473
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,487
Is she your girlfriend?

474
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,026
Our mom's not home right now.

475
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,662
The ring?

476
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,431
I heard.

477
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:37,034
My mom, sister, and I have been looking...

478
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,036
Mom!

479
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,706
Okay, Auntie Dong-suk.

480
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,709
I'll have Mom call you
as soon as she gets back.

481
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,277
Okay.

482
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:50,915
That was Auntie Dong-suk.
She wants the ring back by next week.

483
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,517
It's her mean sister-in-law's

484
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,985
who will be back from a trip next week.

485
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,323
Did you find money for the ring?

486
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,458
Where? How?

487
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:03,027
I got fired from my job
because of that dimwit.

488
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:04,629
How can I get the money?

489
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,231
What are you snapping at me for?

490
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,667
If you're that angry,

491
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,068
tell that jerk to fix your scooter.

492
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,405
You're the one who butted
into other people's business!

493
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,508
If you studied like how you talked,
you would get into Harvard.

494
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,978
I'm better than you. You've got bad grades
and you can't even talk well.

495
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:23,915
Yes? Hello, sir.

496
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:27,418
Yes. What?

497
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,888
You can't raise the deposit so suddenly.

498
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,089
Is it the landlord?

499
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,094
I understand that you've been
very patient with us but...

500
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,664
-Yes.
-Is it the landlord?

501
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,434
Yes.

502
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,536
Yes. Okay, sir.

503
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,704
Bye.

504
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,105
What?

505
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:52,643
-Is he raising the deposit?
-Yeah. By ten million won.

506
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:56,480
-Oh, no!
-Let's eat.

507
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,549
How can you eat at a time like this?

508
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,918
Move over.

509
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:05,656
Mom, let's eat.

510
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:11,329
I'm going to peel more chestnuts
from now on as penance.

511
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,372
You should eat!

512
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,750
Mr. Gu!

513
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,485
Mr. Gu, what are you doing?

514
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,553
I had a dream.

515
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,656
I had a dream that I was smothered
to death by a cow.

516
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:46,897
I can still feel its massive tits
smothering me!

517
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,604
I was turned down
by the literary magazine again.

518
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,742
The title of my work was
Raw Meat and Endless Cubes.

519
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,145
The thing is, Mr. Gu...

520
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:05,516
It depicts the life, joys, and sorrows,
loneliness, frustrations, rage, strife,

521
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:10,488
love and pathos of a butcher who must
spend his life cutting meat into cubes.

522
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,724
I need to borrow some money--

523
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,361
Why don't they understand my work?
What's the use of this all?

524
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:22,400
Are all true poets
fated to live in poverty?

525
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,471
-Goodbye.
-Sure.

526
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,604
This should be a little slower.

527
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,888
I think the tempo should be quicker,
what do you think?

528
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,558
Try it again.
It does feel like it drags a little.

529
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:21,492
Let's try that again.

530
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,434
Someone's here to see you, Han-sung.

531
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,583
How have you been?

532
00:39:50,988 --> 00:39:52,390
Isn't it so hot out?

533
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,326
It's overcast, like it's going to pour.

534
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,895
Maybe a storm's coming.

535
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,740
It has been a month since I came back.

536
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:16,147
I'm sorry.

537
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:23,754
I've missed you.

538
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,697
Say something.

539
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,203
Go.

540
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,974
You left without warning,

541
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,178
and you show up again without warning.

542
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,784
Plus, I don't eat bagels anymore.

543
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,307
PRINCE COFFEE SHOP

544
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,143
You were looking for a job all morning,
but I guess you didn't find one.

545
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,146
Have you eaten? Want some toast?

546
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,214
Do you have any jam?

547
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,348
Sure!

548
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:32,923
Mr. Hong, maybe I should get a loan
without collateral?

549
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,492
Those are loan shark ads.

550
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,894
They'll force you to give up a kidney
if you don't pay.

551
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:42,666
Should charge it on my credit card?

552
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,570
No. You can't do anything
in society with bad credit.

553
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,741
Is it that difficult for you to get money?

554
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,744
I thought you caught a purse snatcher?

555
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,412
Aren't they going to give you a reward?

556
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,120
Choi Han-gyeol.

557
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:07,925
No.

558
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,394
The purse snatcher is Eun-sae's boyfriend.
I can't do that.

559
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,796
That other guy doesn't know that.

560
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,164
You should just take the money.

561
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,735
This is no time
for you to consider your pride.

562
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,607
It's not much.

563
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,612
This is all I have
after taking out rent and money for food.

564
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,019
It's embarrassing. Don't check.

565
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,257
Mr. Hong.

566
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,593
You know I like you, right?

567
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,528
Jeez.

568
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:57,675
Hey, Ah-yeong.

569
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:00,578
A wine bar?

570
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,646
Sounds good.

571
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:04,915
I'll take any kind of work I can get.

572
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,288
As always, Grandma is on my side.

573
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,492
But Mom won't stand
my slacking off anymore.

574
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,496
Why don't you take over the company?

575
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:21,532
I like making music.

576
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,702
But you don't even like movies.

577
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,770
Why can't you take over the company?

578
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:29,607
That's because unlike you,
I can't do anything well.

579
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,442
Do I sense a hint of resentment?

580
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,511
I saw Han Yoo-joo.

581
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,324
What's this?

582
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:49,827
Where are the buttons?

583
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,097
Jeez! What the heck is this?

584
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:54,865
This is so frustrating!

585
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,340
This is crazy.

586
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,110
She left her life in New York
because of you.

587
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,878
Let's not talk about that.

588
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,715
Then what should we talk about?

589
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,184
Do you still like her?

590
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,186
You don't have to worry.

591
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:18,789
Yoo-joo says she doesn't like me.

592
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,457
What else is there to say?

593
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,234
So where should I start?

594
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,437
Are you sure you can work like that?

595
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,939
I know! Can't I just work in the kitchen?

596
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:37,408
You're filling in as a waitress.

597
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,376
Shut up and follow me.

598
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,418
That guy is completely drunk.

599
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,753
Go grab a cab.

600
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:51,622
Okay.

601
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:56,994
Sir.

602
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,530
Can you get up?

603
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,964
One, two, three, up you go!

604
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,967
-She's so strong!
-She's no joke.

605
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:07,638
What's the address?

606
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,774
Jugong Apartments in Itaewon.
Building 107, apartment 503.

607
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:11,975
Come again?

608
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,213
-Building 107, apartment 503.
-503 or 504?

609
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:19,316
Sir, what number?

610
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,185
Tell me quick, or I'll drop you.

611
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,420
Just go! I already told you...

612
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,388
What?

613
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:30,728
She's strong!

614
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,200
Are you going to stay?
I have to go meet some people.

615
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,837
Don't drink and drive.

616
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,705
I won't. I'll call a designated driver.

617
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,208
-Bye.
-See you later.

618
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:46,910
Bye.

619
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:50,180
I can't see anything

620
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:56,854
But I've raised my head and I'm all right
Time will tell the truth

621
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,557
I'm in Samcheong-dong. Yes. Buam.

622
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,693
Burn it up

623
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,062
Yes. How long will it take
you to get here?

624
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,397
-Five minutes? Okay.
-Bubble wrap!

625
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:13,971
It's Sweeper's dad.

626
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,405
You're Sweeper's dad, right?

627
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,107
Sweeper?

628
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,910
Sweeper, your dog who sweeps
the entire neighborhood!

629
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,448
You must mean Terry.

630
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,484
So the dog's real name is Terry.

631
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,686
You must live in my neighborhood.

632
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,523
I deliver milk to you every morning.

633
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,724
I bet you didn't know.

634
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:36,760
So, you're the milk lady.
You're Terry's girlfriend, right?

635
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,762
Right?

636
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,199
Your dog is a male?

637
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:43,200
Yes.

638
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:47,604
I thought the things hanging
from his stomach were breasts.

639
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,609
Come to think of it, there was only one.

640
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:56,780
What's that?

641
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,083
It's bubble wrap.
I found it on the ground.

642
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,887
Want to pop it?
It's great for relieving stress.

643
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,971
Do you think money is more important
or pride?

644
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:22,940
Sorry?

645
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:25,209
Just wondering.

646
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,312
Eun-chan! Get your butt back in here!

647
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,180
I need to go.

648
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,684
-Okay. Here.
-You can keep it. I'm off! See you later!

649
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,333
-Jang-mi! Jang-hui!
-Ha-rim!

650
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,201
It's so nice to see you!

651
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,371
-Have fun.
-Goodbye.

652
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,908
Hey, what's the secret to your popularity?

653
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:02,012
-Should I tell you or not?
-Don't tell him.

654
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,748
He'll do anything it takes
to increase his popularity.

655
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:07,451
Han-gyeol!

656
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,654
Han-gyeol!

657
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,688
Hey!

658
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,156
She's throwing herself at him.

659
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,925
You're back for good, right?

660
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,294
I was going to go look for you.

661
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,530
Hey, we called your brother out.
Why did you come?

662
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:23,133
She has a knack for butting in
where she doesn't belong.

663
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,269
By the way, I heard your mom
was setting you up.

664
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,170
Don't do it!

665
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,072
How did you know?

666
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,909
A friend of mine called
saying she was being set up with you.

667
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:33,944
She's not pretty at all.

668
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,346
She had her breasts, chin,
everything done.

669
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,049
Come on!

670
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,652
Let's have a drink
since it has been so long.

671
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,186
Let's take a love shot.

672
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,155
No. And I don't drink.

673
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,590
Just do it.

674
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,091
She isn't asking for your body.

675
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,593
Yeah.

676
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,461
Just one drink!

677
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:54,498
It has been a dream since high school
to take a love shot with you.

678
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:56,867
Just do it if it will shut her up.

679
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,369
Her whining is giving me goosebumps.

680
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,871
Whine.

681
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:03,440
You guys are driving me crazy.

682
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,447
-He drank it.
-He's screwed.

683
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,985
Money, pride.

684
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,421
Pride, money.

685
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,758
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe

686
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,562
Catch a tiger by the toe

687
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:31,601
I'm not going to catch anything.
My head hurts.

688
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,240
Hello?

689
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,343
Hi, Auntie Dong-suk.

690
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,877
How are you?

691
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,412
I'm so sorry.

692
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,748
Oh, no!

693
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,456
Get in. Watch your head!

694
00:49:53,557 --> 00:49:55,592
Bye, Ye-rang!

695
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,395
Have a hot time with Han-gyeol!

696
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,765
-Have fun!
-Bye.

697
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,303
Bye! Goodnight!

698
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,639
He's so cute!

699
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,364
I have 420,000 won in the bank.

700
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:36,867
I get 800,000 a month
from the taekwondo gym.

701
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:39,102
He owes me three months.

702
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,340
And 200,000 won
from sewing on eyes on the dolls.

703
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,308
And 300,000 from delivering milk.

704
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,377
That's 15 days away!

705
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:52,649
That makes it a million of my money.
Plus the five million in the account.

706
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,785
That's six million won in all.

707
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,055
We're still eight million short.

708
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:01,491
Shit.

709
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,201
Choi Han-gyeol, from now on, you're mine.

710
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,618
Should I call him or not?

711
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,688
Should I call him

712
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,723
or not?

713
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,160
Hey, Eun-chan!

714
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,896
What's more important? Pride or money?

715
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,334
Money, pride,

716
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:47,838
money, pride.

717
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,575
Money, pride.

718
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,845
Jeez! I don't know! I really don't know!

719
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,915
You can't live on pride,

720
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:00,484
but you can live on money.

721
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:03,120
Money it is!

722
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,855
My phone.

723
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,034
Who is it?

724
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:19,936
Well, I'm...

725
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,805
I'm sleeping.

726
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,675
The delivery...

727
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,677
What?

728
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,680
I retrieved that lady's purse
a couple of days ago.

729
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:31,781
Oh, the purse snatcher.

730
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,284
I'm not the purse snatcher.

731
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,053
I'm the person
who caught the purse snatcher.

732
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,788
Yes. The scooter!

733
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,824
You said you would give me
some reward money.

734
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,127
What? You want me to come now?

735
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,163
Where are you?

736
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,500
Yes. Okay.

737
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,908
Why don't you believe me, Han-gyeol?

738
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,543
Put this on!

739
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,479
You were too drunk to remember anything.

740
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,916
I remember everything. You helped me walk.

741
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,985
You brought me here, laid me down,
and removed my clothes except my pants.

742
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,887
I was just pretending to be asleep

743
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:13,089
just to see what you would do.

744
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,058
Go away. Leave me alone.

745
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,697
But you're mine, Han-gyeol!

746
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,701
What's so bad
about taking the guy's money?

747
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:26,303
This place is so swank.

748
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:28,505
This is my last chance!

749
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,074
You can do it, Koh Eun-chan!

750
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:39,216
You even ordered breakfast.

751
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,585
You shouldn't skip breakfast.

752
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,256
-Say, "Ah."
-I don't want any. Leave.

753
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:48,758
I'll leave after I wash up.

754
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:50,827
Who is it?

755
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:57,934
You really came.

756
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,575
Do you like money that much
or are you that bold?

757
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,081
You're a minor, right?

758
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,183
No.

759
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,584
Is that any way for an adult to dress?

760
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:16,987
Are you a girl or a guy?

761
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,123
You look just like a girl.
Did you go to the army yet?

762
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,424
I'm...

763
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:24,961
No.

764
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,062
Take a seat.

765
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,331
I'll pass.

766
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,769
I didn't want to take any money

767
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,573
but as you saw,
my scooter was wrecked in the incident.

768
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:40,510
And plus, I got fired
because of the incident

769
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:42,279
and I haven't even received my pay.

770
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:44,447
That's why you want me
to give you reward money?

771
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,985
-Yes.
-How old is the guy that ran away?

772
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,521
How should I know?
He's a high school dropout.

773
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:58,461
I don't plan on calling the cops,
so don't get scared and just tell me.

774
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,298
I think I have an inkling,
but what exactly is your system?

775
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,999
I'm interested in the criminal world.

776
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,268
Criminal world?
What are you trying to say?

777
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,670
You better shape up, you idiot.

778
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,538
Did you think you could get away with it?

779
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,508
You look so innocent.

780
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:12,876
I guess that's why it works.

781
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,578
This was your first job, wasn't it?
You still need to work on your acting.

782
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,050
Hey, mister, you seem
to be mistaken about something.

783
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,552
I don't know the guy who ran away at all.

784
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,020
-He just--
-I saw everything.

785
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,355
Don't you understand me?

786
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:28,692
I know your ploy, you pathetic loser!

787
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,028
You're more pathetic,
doing this with a girl in broad daylight.

788
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,763
Whatever. You're just jealous.

789
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:36,499
Jeez!

790
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,203
You shouldn't look down on me
just because I came for reward money.

791
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,639
You shouldn't look down on people
just because you're rich!

792
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,074
How dare you raise your voice at me?

793
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,408
Assume the position!

794
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,378
The position? Are you freaking nuts?
This is so frustrating!

795
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,848
-Assume the position. Now.
-What are you doing? Let go.

796
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,284
What's wrong with you?

797
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:01,324
Han-gyeol?

798
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,426
Are you gay?

799
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,096
You must be out off your mind!
What do you think you're doing?

800
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,200
You're out of your mind!

801
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,769
Shoot.

802
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,804
Hey, get up!

803
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,650
That's why you shouldn't have touched me.

804
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:29,919
Just leave.

805
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,857
Can't you at least give me the money
to fix my scooter?

806
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,326
I didn't even get paid.

807
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,829
This all happened because of that incident

808
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,799
so if you would at least lend me--

809
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:45,402
Do your parents know
you go around begging for money?

810
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,005
Of course they do!
They're probably even worse than you.

811
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:53,843
Apologize.

812
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,714
Apologize for ragging on my parents!

813
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,916
Apologize!

814
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,486
-Both of you, out.
-Apologize!

815
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,954
-Both of you, out.
-Apologize!

816
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:06,823
-Both of you, out.
-Apologize!

817
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:07,857
Apologize!

818
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,393
-Get out!
-Apologize!

819
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,897
-Out!
-Apologize!

820
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:16,466
-Out!
-I won't go!

821
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,970
-Apologize!
-Han-gyeol!

822
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:24,040
-Apologize!
-Han-gyeol!

823
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,041
Apologize!!

824
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,812
How many women
do you want me to meet today?

825
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,047
Just six.

826
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,683
We cut down the list as much as possible.

827
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,084
Six?

828
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:38,121
-It's like a blind date marathon!
-Open up right now!

829
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,025
-Are you out of your mind, Mom?
-Open this door!

830
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,060
Apologize.

831
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,665
Apologize.

832
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:50,733
Idiot.

833
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:57,440
I heard that your dad's company
made 30 billion won in profits this year.

834
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:58,641
Yes.

835
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:03,313
But I want to try being poor
like other people for once.

836
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:07,984
Just live in an apartment in Gangnam
and own a beauty salon. That's all.

837
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,253
I see.

838
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:15,725
I feel so hot.

839
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,360
Do you mind if I take my jacket off?

840
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:19,462
Apologize!

841
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,699
Apologize!

842
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,634
Apologize.

843
00:58:25,368 --> 00:58:28,004
Excuse me,
could I get a glass of cold water?

844
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:37,714
Sir, you can't lie on the sofa like that.

845
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:40,750
I'm so sorry!

846
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,286
If I did something wrong,
I should apologize!

847
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,088
I'm really sorry!

848
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,991
I'm sorry!

849
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:50,960
Excuse me.

850
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,200
Seon-bong? Hi. What's up?

851
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,969
Oh, right. It's dog-meat day.

852
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,375
Did you kill it already? Got it.

853
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,478
Wait till I come back. Bye!

854
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:20,189
I majored in Korean History at MIT.

855
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:41,511
Can you touch your chin with your tongue?

856
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:44,113
I can.

857
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:57,427
APOLOGIZE, YOU BASTARD!

858
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,936
Four cups of coffee
and seven cups of juice!

859
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,772
It's like a flood.

860
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,244
Seriously. How are all the chicks so bad?

861
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,580
Apologize.

862
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:21,184
Hey! What the heck?

863
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,219
Apologize.

864
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,558
Apologize for ragging on my parents,

865
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:29,759
reimburse me for my scooter,

866
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:30,793
and the pay what I lost.

867
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,462
You're so unbelievable too.

868
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,633
All the girls I was set up with
are unbelievable too.

869
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,201
Look in the mirror.

870
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,869
The girls were all pretty--

871
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,071
Are you really gay?

872
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,774
No wonder that girl in the hotel room
said that you were gay.

873
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:48,144
How do I seem gay to you?

874
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,891
Hey, turn around slowly for me.

875
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,694
Why?

876
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,808
Hey, do you want to be my lover?

877
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:27,617
I want money. Open your wallet,
not your laptop.

878
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,651
-Your name?
-Koh Eun-chan.

879
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:30,753
-Your resident ID number?
-840805-2371...

880
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,922
Hey! Can't you do anything right?

881
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,323
It's one three.

882
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,358
Guys' IDs start with a one.

883
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,293
Why are you asking this stuff?
Just give me the money.

884
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,362
You said you needed money
so I'm trying to give you a job,

885
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:40,530
but I can't trust you

886
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,532
-so I'm getting your information.
-What job?

887
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,333
-Playing my lover.
-You bastard!
