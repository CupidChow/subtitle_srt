1
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,232
You're looking even worse today.

2
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,433
Did you get any sleep?

3
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,135
Yeah. A little.

4
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,337
You should try taking sleeping pills.

5
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,039
You look awful.

6
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,914
I thought I fired you,
so what are you doing here?

7
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,252
You really are shameless.
Do you still have something to say to me?

8
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,985
You have three minutes.

9
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,655
Say what you have to say and leave.

10
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,192
At first,

11
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,162
I didn't think that
you could return my feelings.

12
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,866
Because you were in love with Yoo-joo.

13
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,205
She's a lot more attractive than I am,

14
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,475
and so I thought that it would be better
to be a man.

15
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,344
When I asked you what you would think
if I were a woman,

16
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,314
you said that you weren't going
to see women anymore,

17
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,318
and that you were going to marry a woman
from a privileged family

18
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,486
who grew up in a gilded cage.

19
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,488
That you were going to marry someone

20
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,189
that your grandma and mom approved of.

21
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,791
I...

22
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,895
I'm not like that at all,
and I'm not pretty.

23
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,234
So I thought, I'd get to stay by your side
if I became your blood brother.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,173
I got to joke around with you
and you treated me so nice.

25
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,277
Because I loved that so much,
I couldn't tell you the truth.

26
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,346
I hate this world.

27
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,283
Why does everyone I love
have to stab me in the back?

28
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,687
Why did my father keep the secret
of my birth from me for so long?

29
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,489
Why couldn't you tell me your secret?

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,160
I've been racking my brains trying
to figure it out for the past two days.

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,130
It's because you and my dad
just didn't trust me.

32
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,433
And to think how much I loved you,

33
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,971
you couldn't trust me so--

34
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,673
It's not that I couldn't trust you.

35
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,976
It's just that I couldn't trust myself.

36
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,112
When I admitted
that I like you even as a man,

37
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,916
I didn't care what the world
would think of me,

38
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,186
disregarding my family and friends,

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,622
to the point where I decided
those things didn't matter.

40
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,259
I agonized so much.

41
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,562
You know, Eun-chan...

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,031
I...

43
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,501
I need someone who trusts me.

44
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,338
Even though the entire world laughs at me
and calls me an imbecile.

45
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,739
I need someone who can tell me

46
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,210
that I just haven't had the opportunity
to prove myself.

47
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,979
That I can do anything
if I put my mind to it.

48
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,181
That I just...

49
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:38,151
I just haven't found my way yet.

50
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,221
But when I do, I'll be able
to make something out of myself.

51
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,655
I need someone who trusts me like that.

52
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,723
Not someone like you,

53
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:45,992
who deceives me
while being in love with me,

54
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,162
always fearful of being abandoned.

55
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,965
I didn't have the courage.

56
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,168
I didn't want to get dumped.

57
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,605
I wanted to tell you the truth,

58
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,275
but I was scared
that you would leave me if I did.

59
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,712
But the reason I'm telling you
the truth now

60
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,682
is because I want to be your girl.

61
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,519
I guess there's nothing I can do
if you don't want me.

62
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,588
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,191
I know what I did was unacceptable.

64
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,461
But just know that I love you

65
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,031
more than anything in the world.

66
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,202
I'll leave the shop if you want.

67
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,703
If you don't want to see me...

68
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,041
Can't I still continue to see you anyway?

69
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,283
I don't think I can ever see you again.

70
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,386
I just don't know who you are anymore.

71
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,588
The Koh Eun-chan that I loved...

72
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:51,758
My little friend...

73
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,694
He was always frank with his emotions,

74
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,529
and he didn't hesitate
to give his trust to anyone.

75
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,364
He saw how beautiful the world really was.

76
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,934
And that's why I wanted so much
to be like him.

77
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,904
But now...

78
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,742
you're not the Koh Eun-chan that I know.

79
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,913
So let's stop seeing each other.

80
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,076
Eun-chan's leaving.
Please sort her wages out.

81
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,914
Why do you have to go to such extremes?

82
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,883
Just what is it
that you're so angry about?

83
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,120
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Well, I do!

84
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:55,722
Do you feel slighted?

85
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,357
Fine! Let's say that you suffered

86
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,158
through a little more agony
than Eun-chan did.

87
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,760
So what?

88
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,695
Is it so unacceptable to you
that you went through

89
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,697
a little more agony
and that you loved a little more?

90
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,900
What are you acting so angry about?
Haven't you done enough?

91
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:10,336
Eun-chan's a girl
and you're in love with each other.

92
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:11,904
So what's the problem?

93
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,374
You should be jumping for joy,

94
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,843
not causing scenes in the shop
every other day with your fits!

95
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,711
This is a place of business,
not for fighting!

96
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,650
-Let's get out of here, Han-gyeol!
-I mean, why do you have to be so extreme!

97
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,953
If you wanted to break up,
you should have done it quietly,

98
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,554
and not caused such a racket!

99
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,190
Tell Eun-chan to come downstairs
with all her stuff.

100
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:33,926
Seon-gi!

101
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,163
For crying out loud! Seon-gi!

102
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,198
Where do you think you're going?

103
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,937
Let's get out of here, Han-gyeol.
Let's go somewhere and talk.

104
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,073
Don't you even think of going anywhere.
Stay at the shop.

105
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,708
I'm leaving.

106
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,511
I can't bear it here anymore.

107
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,414
I've been as patient as I can
with you guys but this is too much.

108
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,682
Don't go, Mr. Hong.

109
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,518
Who will make the coffee if you leave?

110
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,287
All the customers come here
because of your coffee.

111
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,656
You don't have to quit, Mr. Hong.

112
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,291
I'm going to be leaving in a month anyway.

113
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,894
Is that so?
Then I'll come back in a month.

114
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,328
I'm out of here.

115
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,565
Mr. Hong! Please don't act so rashly.

116
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,136
Eun-chan.

117
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,473
The boss is just really angry right now.

118
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,376
He'll probably call you in a little while
and ask you to come back.

119
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,779
So don't worry about it, don't be hurt,

120
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,648
and just think of it as a break.

121
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,918
Why are there tears in your eyes,
you big lug.

122
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,288
-Just get back to your work.
-Okay.

123
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,058
I guess there's nothing I can say
to make you feel better.

124
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,327
I'll call you once in a while.

125
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,266
DK might as well take the whole gallery.

126
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,967
He is already taking
our most prominent artist

127
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,369
and purchased all of her works.

128
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,771
He must be quite happy.

129
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,842
I'm sorry for not being able
to finish out my contract.

130
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,810
I don't want to hear it.

131
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,313
Anyway, what's done is done.

132
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,955
CHOI HAN-SUNG

133
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,973
For the love of God!

134
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,162
-I don't have anything to say to you.
-Then don't talk and just listen.

135
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,865
I met Eun-chan for the first time

136
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,134
about four months ago.

137
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,570
She was delivering milk to my place.

138
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,473
Even though it must have been tiring
to deliver milk so early in the morning,

139
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,742
she was so cheerful about it
that I took a liking to her.

140
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,381
And you're right about the woman
I took to Yoo-joo's exhibit.

141
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:17,783
It was Eun-chan.

142
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,920
I was trying to get back at Yoo-joo

143
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,856
for having DK sponsor
her first exhibit in Korea.

144
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,826
But that day,

145
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,196
Eun-chan looked very beautiful.

146
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,801
But by the time
I thought she was beautiful,

147
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,603
she had already fallen in love with you.

148
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,841
She confessed to me, crying,
that she was in love with you.

149
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,945
Can you keep it short?

150
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,681
Just how much longer
do I have to listen to this for?

151
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:52,551
She said that she wanted to tell you,
but she was afraid.

152
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,187
She said that she wasn't a guy
or even a girl for that matter.

153
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,323
She sobbed like a child that day.

154
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,728
I'll be frank with you.

155
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,299
I had feelings for Eun-chan at one time.

156
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,137
But,

157
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,372
because she was in love with you,

158
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,542
I decided to give up on her.

159
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,647
I don't even know why I developed
feelings for her in the first place.

160
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,717
That's really it.

161
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,789
The reason that Eun-chan
finally got around to tell you

162
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,259
is because she trusted you.

163
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,732
I guess that's all I have to say to you.

164
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,437
It's up to you whether you believe
what I just said or not.

165
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,239
Take care. Bye.

166
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,021
That will be 10,000 won, please.
Thank you.

167
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:03,856
Have a nice day.

168
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,694
An espresso, an Americano,
an iced mocha, and a latte for table five.

169
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,995
-Hello.
-Hello.

170
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,898
Two iced Americanos, three iced mochas,
and five waffles for table six.

171
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,600
What? What did you say?

172
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,671
An espresso, an Americano, an iced mocha,
and a latte for table five.

173
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,239
And two iced Americanos,
three iced mochas,

174
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:21,407
and five waffles for table six.

175
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,978
An espresso, an iced mocha, an Americano,
a latte, and five waffles for table five?

176
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,781
How many times do I have to tell you?
Are you stupid or something?

177
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,216
You have no right to get angry.

178
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:32,351
-We're this busy because of you.
-What?

179
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,954
This is all thanks
to the unsanitary Mr. Hong

180
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,290
and the liar Eun-chan leaving
just as you wanted, isn't it?

181
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,592
What? What did you just say?

182
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,060
We don't have the time to fight.

183
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,461
Customers are waiting for their order.

184
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,929
Things wouldn't have gotten so bad

185
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:47,666
if you hadn't told the boss first
and only waited for Eun-chan to tell him.

186
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,835
I thought that Eun-chan
had already told Han-gyeol.

187
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,304
How can you be such a blabbermouth?

188
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,907
I told you countless times to stay out
of other people's relationships.

189
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,642
I see why you never had
a serious relationship.

190
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:57,576
-Are you done?
-Yeah.

191
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,145
And I don't want to talk to you anymore.

192
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,014
All you and the boss can think about
are yourselves.

193
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,849
What about you?
You don't give a damn about others!

194
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,186
It's better not to care than screw
everything up like you!

195
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,554
Why I ought to just...

196
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,398
Stop arguing and take these
to table seven.

197
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,902
Why are those two acting like that?

198
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,570
Boss.

199
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:26,705
Boss.

200
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:31,243
-Could you make me an espresso?
-Okay.

201
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,417
Hello?

202
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,022
Why is your house like this?

203
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,092
I'm sorry about not telling you
about Eun-chan.

204
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,363
What's this talk about you going
to America all of a sudden?

205
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,402
When will you be back?

206
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,639
I don't think I'll be back for a while.

207
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,508
Is it because of Eun-chan?

208
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,380
Were Han-sung and Eun-chan
involved seriously enough

209
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,481
for you to act this way?

210
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:10,816
What are you curious about?

211
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,419
Are you curious
about how far those two went?

212
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,624
It would have been nice
if you had told me earlier.

213
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,126
I couldn't tell you how far
Han-sung and Eun-chan went,

214
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,296
because the relationship wasn't mutual.

215
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,333
It was only Han-sung
who had feelings for Eun-chan,

216
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,135
and even that didn't last for too long.

217
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,571
So please,

218
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,074
forgive Eun-chan.

219
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,642
Then why are you leaving?

220
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,080
It's between me and Han-sung.
You know how it is between us.

221
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:46,819
I'm the selfish, headstrong one
who will do whatever she wants.

222
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,823
Han-sung is the selfless
and understanding one

223
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,192
who always forgives me
and lets me do whatever I want.

224
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:59,098
I thought Han-sung reserved
that warm smile of his exclusively for me.

225
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,836
But I found out I was wrong.

226
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,640
I know that I'm being childish

227
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,642
and acting rashly.

228
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,646
I know how unreasonable I'm being.

229
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:15,881
But I just...

230
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,585
I just can't bring myself
to act otherwise.

231
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,657
I wonder what Han-sung was thinking
when he always let me stay by your side.

232
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,926
Why did he let me?

233
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,129
Because I was no match for him?

234
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:35,267
Did he think that you would never fall
for me no matter what I did?

235
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:37,536
I asked him about you once,

236
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,038
if you were getting on his nerves.

237
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,473
He told me no,

238
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,943
saying that you were his cousin.

239
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:45,911
That's not the whole reason.

240
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,580
Han-sung just trusts you.

241
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,350
Even though you might develop feelings
for someone else,

242
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,652
he trusts that you will come back
to him in the end.

243
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,856
That's why he waited for you
even when you ran off with another man.

244
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,359
If that's true,

245
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,928
doesn't that mean
that you don't trust Eun-chan?

246
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,401
I have a new respect for Han-sung.

247
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:15,441
It's an infuriating thing to have someone
be in love with the woman you love.

248
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,544
But he has been patient
with me for so long.

249
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:20,713
It's hard for me to be like that.

250
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,620
Your bond with Han-sung
seemed so strong to me.

251
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,689
I was so jealous of that relationship.

252
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,025
That's may be why I kept on trying to get
between the two of you,

253
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,259
like a jealous kid.

254
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,429
Don't go, Yoo-joo.

255
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,568
If you hurt Han-sung again,
I don't think I could forgive you.

256
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,416
Do you think the bathroom
is your exclusive property?

257
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,318
Why are you always crying in there?

258
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,453
You're crying again, aren't you?

259
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,224
No.

260
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,526
Yeah, right.

261
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,662
Mom, Eun-chan is crying again.

262
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,800
Can you tell her to come out
and stop crying?

263
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,202
-I need to wash up!
-Will you stop with your whining?

264
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,505
Why do you always hate me?

265
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,475
Run down to the store
and buy some soap and toothpaste.

266
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,211
-No.
-"No"? Why are you so lazy?

267
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,114
All you've been doing
throughout your summer vacation

268
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,383
is lie around watching television
all day long.

269
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,451
Give me the money.

270
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,491
Is it all right
if I buy myself a popsicle?

271
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,662
How can you glare
at your own daughter like that?

272
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,161
I wanted to tell you the truth,

273
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,897
but I was scared
that you would leave me if I did.

274
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,033
But the reason I'm telling you
the truth now

275
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,902
is because I want to be your girl.

276
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,912
I'll leave the shop if you want.

277
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,514
If you don't want to see me...

278
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,916
Can't I still continue to see you anyway?

279
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,198
KOH EUN-CHAN

280
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,171
Why don't you try asking yourself

281
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,074
if you can really live without Eun-chan?

282
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,269
I could have just taken a cab.

283
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,242
You take care, okay?

284
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,044
Don't go.

285
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,316
I don't think I'll be able to bear
you leaving me again

286
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,484
like you did two years ago.

287
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,254
So please listen to me.
Don't do this to me again.

288
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,256
DK is waiting for me.

289
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,058
Then call him and say you're not coming.

290
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,461
Stop the car
if you're going to be like this.

291
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,163
I'll take another car.

292
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,388
You've had feelings for someone else, too.

293
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,291
So why can't I have them!

294
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,227
While we were together,

295
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,731
you were seeing DK
behind my back for over a year.

296
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,768
You would tell me that you were working,
even though you were with DK.

297
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,939
I let it pass
although I didn't believe you.

298
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:18,810
I told myself, "You stupid bastard!

299
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,613
What will you do
if you don't forgive her?"

300
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,616
I told myself that!

301
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,985
And I let everything slide!

302
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,687
How could you have feelings
for another woman

303
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,355
after all you went through to be with me?

304
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,158
What is it about her
that you liked so much?

305
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:34,626
Was it her innocence?

306
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,629
She's just a cute kid?

307
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,433
Looking at you while you're lying to me,

308
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,236
while you're checking to see
if she had texted you

309
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,837
even after we had made love,

310
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,773
do you know how pathetic I felt?

311
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,947
I'm sorry. I was a bastard.

312
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,917
But I just had feelings for her,
not love her!

313
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,620
I went temporarily insane, that's all.

314
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,156
What's the difference between
having feelings and falling in love?

315
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:07,292
How is that different?

316
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,128
I love you. Don't go.

317
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:11,830
Don't go.

318
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,832
Don't go!

319
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,500
Yoo-joo.

320
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,603
Don't go!

321
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,858
The blood sausages are here, Eun-chan,
along with delicious innards!

322
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,927
That looks great.

323
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,997
The expression on your face
says otherwise.

324
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,632
I'm just not hungry, that's all.

325
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,600
-Try some.
-I don't--

326
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,273
Did you shell all of these?

327
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,009
That must be over a sack of chestnuts.

328
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,411
If you keep this up,
we're going to get rich quick.

329
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,613
We'll make loads of money

330
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,482
if you shell chestnuts
like this night and day.

331
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,983
It is good to be rich.

332
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:55,554
You're acting exactly how women act
when they're dumped on TV.

333
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,391
Sitting around, moping all day long,
not sleeping, not eating,

334
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,393
and pretending not to be sad
even though you are.

335
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:02,294
I don't want to eat.

336
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:09,200
Go and sleep.

337
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,102
Don't sit around with that expression
on your face!

338
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,905
I need to get some fresh air.

339
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,540
Where are you going?

340
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,475
I'm going to go buy some cookies.

341
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,778
Why do you need cookies?
We have blood sausages.

342
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,012
I'll buy some ramen too.

343
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,603
I guess asking
how you're doing is pointless.

344
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:46,972
You just look awful.

345
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:50,575
Really? I feel fine.

346
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:54,679
Is Han-gyeol still very angry?

347
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,415
He fired me from the shop.

348
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,186
I'm so sorry.

349
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,188
It pains me to think
that you're going through

350
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,689
so much difficulty because of me.

351
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,126
Why should you be sorry?
It's all my fault.

352
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,831
Han-gyeol's acting this way
because he loves you so much.

353
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,067
That's why he's acting so angry
and so cruel.

354
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,702
Even though he doesn't seem like it,

355
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,271
once he falls in love with someone,

356
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,210
he falls in love harder than anyone else.

357
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:28,246
That's why he's so hurt,
so give him some time.

358
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:30,849
You know how Han-gyeol feels, don't you?

359
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,885
Frankly, I didn't know before,

360
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,488
but I think I understand him
a little better now.

361
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,693
I'm sorry for having told him I loved him,

362
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,832
and it pains me to think of
how much he's suffered because of me.

363
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,904
I regret not telling him earlier.

364
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,909
I wish I hadn't fallen in love with him
in the first place.

365
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,146
I wish I hadn't fallen in love with him
in the first place.

366
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,750
When I think back on the good times
we've had together,

367
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,186
I feel so happy.

368
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:10,822
And I miss it so much.

369
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,191
That's how it is.

370
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,900
That's why you should give him
some more time.

371
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,536
When Han-gyeol finds out how you feel,

372
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,337
he'll be more understanding of you.

373
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,407
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

374
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,409
You're such a good person.

375
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,716
By the way, don't tell Han-gyeol

376
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,186
what happened between us.

377
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,088
What do you mean?

378
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,992
Oh, that?

379
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,929
Don't tell him even though
he says that it's all right,

380
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,364
even though he says he won't get angry,

381
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,900
and that you can share
everything with him.

382
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,969
You should never tell him.

383
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,438
If you try to make yourself feel better

384
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,474
and tell him about it,

385
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,609
sometimes,

386
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,613
it might only hurt him.

387
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:15,053
So don't worry about it too much
and feel better.

388
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:19,791
Thanks, mister.

389
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,661
You're my Santa, mister.

390
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,431
I should be the one thanking you.

391
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,467
I'm happy that I can be your Santa.

392
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:33,204
Right. I know things are rough,
but cheer up.

393
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,341
Han-gyeol is hopelessly in love with you.

394
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:38,610
I can guarantee that.

395
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,119
You look so tired, mister.

396
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,223
I've just been very busy as of late.

397
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,497
Are you all right
making the deliveries by yourself?

398
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:00,799
Should I come with you?

399
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,868
No. With Mr. Hong gone,
you'll have to make the coffee.

400
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,273
Why does Mr. Hong have to act
so childishly?

401
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:11,709
Han-gyeol.

402
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,045
About Eun-chan...

403
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,215
Forget it.

404
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:21,519
You need to hire another barista
or another employee.

405
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:22,887
This has been going on for too long.

406
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,323
With Mr. Hong and Eun-chan gone,

407
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,158
it's difficult to handle the workload
by ourselves.

408
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,360
Boss!

409
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,364
Can't you just forgive Eun-chan?

410
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,500
I know that Eun-chan
shouldn't have deceived you,

411
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:39,003
but she doesn't have anywhere else
to work,

412
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,639
and Eun-sae tells me that
she won't eat, she won't sleep,

413
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,374
and she's a complete mess.

414
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,178
I feel like my head is going to burst.

415
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,880
-I'm off.
-Boss.

416
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,549
They say that you should hate the crime
and not the criminal.

417
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,785
Can't you just let Eun-chan come back?

418
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:56,454
Why are you so eloquent all of a sudden?

419
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,156
Just go and work.

420
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,258
Can't you please forgive Eun-chan, boss?

421
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,662
Will you stop it and go do your work?

422
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,365
I think Eun-chan must have agonized
quite a bit herself.

423
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:09,467
She's young and she was afraid

424
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,036
that this would happen
if she came out with the truth.

425
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,567
Are you home? Can I come in?

426
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,807
I just met Eun-chan.

427
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:55,079
I ran into her at the convenience store.

428
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:56,714
"Ran into her"?

429
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,950
She just happened to deliver milk
to your place,

430
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,585
and now, you just happened
to run into her?

431
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,689
You guys must be destined for each other.

432
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,693
Do you think I would tell you we met
if something was going on between us?

433
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,832
-How is she?
-Who?

434
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,201
Eun-chan?

435
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,270
How do you think she is?

436
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:27,078
When I first found out
that you were in love with Yoo-joo,

437
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,481
I thought you would get over her soon.

438
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,417
It might be a little prideful for me,

439
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,286
but I also felt a little sorry for you.

440
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,290
Can't you just be more understanding
of how I felt about Eun-chan,

441
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,860
just as I was understanding
of your love for Yoo-joo?

442
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,930
I won't see Eun-chan anymore
if you don't want me to.

443
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,435
I'll even avoid running into her.

444
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,771
Just leave
if you don't have anything to say.

445
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,273
I'm really tired.

446
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,041
I'm sorry.

447
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,079
I came here to apologize.

448
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,881
I was wrong...

449
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,385
to have punched you.

450
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,456
Just punch me and forget about it.

451
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,028
I had a crush on Yoo-joo for nine years
in the name of friendship.

452
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,065
I had no right to be angry at you.
I'm sorry.

453
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,668
I'm sorry about the past nine years,

454
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,743
and I'm sorry about punching you
over Eun-chan.

455
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,219
Punch me if you want.

456
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,154
You can punch me more than once.

457
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,829
Anyways, you look really awful.

458
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,768
Did Yoo-joo...

459
00:33:58,669 --> 00:33:59,604
She left me.

460
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,444
I begged and cried for her not to leave,

461
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,980
but she wouldn't listen to me.

462
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,916
How could she be so heartless?

463
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,353
It was my fault.

464
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:21,025
But when she said that she was leaving me,
it was like a wakeup call.

465
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,960
I realized what we had together
was special.

466
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:27,765
Don't worry about us too much.

467
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,234
We've been together for ten years.

468
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:36,207
There's an unbreakable bond between us.

469
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,410
It won't end like this.

470
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,612
Yoo-joo loves you a lot.

471
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,182
I'm sure she'll come back.

472
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,117
Worry about your love life, not mine.

473
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:48,419
I'm glad that...

474
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,191
it's you that Yoo-joo loved.

475
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,495
If it were anyone else,
I would have stolen her away.

476
00:34:58,129 --> 00:35:02,433
But I didn't steal her
because it was you she was in love with.

477
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,506
I like you a lot more than you think.
I just want you to know that.

478
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,009
You're going to make up
with Eun-chan, aren't you?

479
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,145
I don't know.

480
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,613
What?

481
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:17,815
I don't know.

482
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,127
Hello?

483
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,062
This is Choi Han-sung.

484
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,230
Yes?

485
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:37,702
I couldn't get through
to Yoo-joo's number in New York.

486
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,772
Is she with you now by any chance?

487
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,374
I would rather not tell you.

488
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,089
I thought that her art
was the most important thing to her,

489
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,491
but I guess you were more important.

490
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:02,760
I don't know why I'm telling you this,

491
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,662
but Yoo-joo didn't come with me.

492
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,066
Mr. Hong.

493
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,541
What did you do at home all day long?

494
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,110
You could have cleaned the place up
considering you were here all day.

495
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,479
It's not like you've ever cleaned
this house either.

496
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,481
There were so many people asking

497
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,583
for your coffee at work today.

498
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,718
Your coffee must be the best
in the nation.

499
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,254
Actually, the best in the world!

500
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:38,062
Mr. Hong, couldn't you come back
to work tomorrow?

501
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,965
You've taken a lot of time off of work,

502
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,335
and God knows you've had your fill
of alcohol during that time.

503
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:47,471
Plus, Han-gyeol seems
to be regretting the way he acted.

504
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:54,679
Cook me some ramen. I'm hungry.

505
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,917
I've forgotten how fun comic books are.

506
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:02,220
You were reading comic books?
I thought you were sulking!

507
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:07,325
I've been rolling around on the floor
reading comic books all day long.

508
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,894
I've never been so relaxed in my life.

509
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,063
Add two eggs and lots of spring onions.

510
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,334
Why that little! That hurts.

511
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:33,377
Mom! Eun-chan!

512
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,819
Why is he so late?

513
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,920
What am I going to do?

514
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,390
Get a grip on yourself, Eun-chan.
How long do you plan to mope like this?

515
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,995
You have to live your life,

516
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:11,101
and let Choi Han-gyeol live his.

517
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,204
That's how it should be.

518
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:20,478
She's such a ditz!

519
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,758
Are these all yours?

520
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,330
What are you doing, spilling chestnuts
all over the neighborhood?

521
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:17,201
How are you going to make money like this?

522
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:18,802
You're such a ditz!

523
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,971
Aren't you going to bring it over?

524
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:22,840
Okay.

525
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,278
You spilled them all! For crying out loud!

526
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:53,904
Have you been sick?

527
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,507
No.

528
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,644
Weren't you worried about the shop?

529
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,480
Is anything wrong?

530
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:09,353
We're just very busy
without you or Mr. Hong around.

531
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,594
Come back to work tomorrow.

532
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:21,899
I'm still angry.

533
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:26,036
I still hate you.

534
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,806
And I still can't understand you.

535
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,645
But I asked myself
whether I could live without you.

536
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:39,850
Whether I could just break up with you.

537
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,454
I asked myself that question.

538
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,091
And the answer is no.

539
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,666
Jeez, you're crying again.

540
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,535
Why do you cry so easily?

541
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:02,106
From now on,

542
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,042
you better cry only in front of me.

543
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,947
You better not cry like this
in front of any other man.

544
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,559
I'm sorry.

545
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,263
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

546
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,432
It's all right, so stop crying.

547
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:35,305
You must have been in such pain
even as I joked around with you.

548
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,009
I never realized
how much it must have hurt you.

549
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,446
I was only looking
for a way not to get hurt,

550
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,052
and a way out.

551
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:54,558
What agony you must have felt
as you made those toy robots for me.

552
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,961
How much it must have hurt you.

553
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,064
I didn't realize any of that.

554
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,199
Yet I pretended to know it all.

555
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,037
When you told me we should take this
all the way, I was so happy

556
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,974
that I completely forgot
how much I had made you suffer.

557
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,109
I'm sorry.

558
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,546
Are you reciting a speech or what?

559
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,049
I'm sorry for making you suffer like that.

560
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:21,919
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

561
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,021
I'm sorry.

562
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:31,862
I'm sorry, too.

563
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,434
When I kissed you at the coffee shop

564
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,304
and said that it was better
when you were a guy,

565
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,474
I was trying to hurt you on purpose.

566
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,947
I said those things out of anger,

567
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,684
but they're not the truth.

568
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,057
I was childish,

569
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,994
not thinking about how much pain
you must have gone through.

570
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,266
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

571
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:18,041
It was my fault,

572
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,744
so it's all right.

573
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,191
Eun-chan.

574
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,496
I'm so glad that you're a girl.

575
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:23,540
Tick-tock, tick-tock, dingdong!

576
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,175
It's midnight.

577
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,443
What are you doing?

578
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,713
They're probably making up as we speak.

579
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,482
Go for it, Eun-chan.
Stay out a little longer.

580
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,989
Mom, do you think
if Eun-chan marries her boss,

581
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,891
they will give us a house?

582
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,059
What?

583
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,295
My friend's big sister married the owner
of a small startup company,

584
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,598
and he bought a house
and a car for her family,

585
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,967
and bought her an expensive purse,
even shoes.

586
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,403
Since Dongin Foods is a major corporation,

587
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:55,372
Eun-chan's boss will probably buy us
even more, huh?

588
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:56,840
Right, Mom?

589
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,909
Why does that matter to you anyway?

590
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:00,410
You greedy girl.

591
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,413
I know you're thinking
the same thing, Mom.

592
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,382
No, I'm not.

593
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,284
And there's no guarantee
that they will get married.

594
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:12,055
Your sister is only 24 years old,
for heaven's sake.

595
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,525
If you ask me, 24 is more than old enough
to get married.

596
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:21,398
Shanghai

597
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:23,300
Dancing the Shanghai Twist

598
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:26,937
Hey, you.

599
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,440
How have you been?

600
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,875
What are you doing here?

601
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,279
Can't you see? She's cleaning.

602
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:38,348
What are you doing here, Mr. Hong?
I thought you were at home sleeping.

603
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,584
Can you bring me some more rags?

604
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,551
Sure.

605
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:44,655
What the heck?
They're acting like nothing happened.

606
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:46,456
I must be dreaming.

607
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,959
COFFEE PRINCE

608
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,401
You're here, boss.

609
00:48:58,635 --> 00:48:59,970
Eun-chan!

610
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,204
Boss is here.

611
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,208
Eun-chan!

612
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:13,283
Boss is here. It's the boss. Boss is here.

613
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,518
Eun-chan.

614
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:15,819
Boss is here.

615
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,059
So, you've decided to come back, Mr. Hong?

616
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,262
I just couldn't stand it at home
because it was so hot.

617
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,330
Did you miss me?

618
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:44,448
Don't worry about Han-gyeol.
He's just a little slow to forgive people.

619
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,917
Jeez. Couldn't he just forgive Eun-chan?

620
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,820
It must have taken her lots of guts
to come back here.

621
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:52,222
Ha-rim, did you change your mind?

622
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,092
Something fishy is going on.

623
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,194
Why is Han-gyeol leaving Eun-chan alone?

624
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:00,163
You don't think he told her
to come back, do you?

625
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,766
Who cares if she's back?
They're not talking to each other.

626
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,202
It's going to be the Cold War here
all over again.

627
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,005
Get ready to deliver beans
in the afternoon.

628
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:08,905
Me?

629
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,374
Aren't you going to answer me, Eun-chan?

630
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,745
Okay, boss.

631
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:15,712
Hey.

632
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:17,614
You didn't just come here
without permission.

633
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,349
Something happened
between you two, didn't it?

634
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,226
Hey!

635
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:30,861
-It's true!
-Oh, my god!

636
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:33,163
-Is it true?
-What happened, huh?

637
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,099
Did you beg for Han-gyeol's forgiveness
with tears in your eyes?

638
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,235
I doubt it.
I bet she told him she loved him.

639
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,136
Right?

640
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,203
Stop it, you guys.

641
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,773
Jeez, after all the worry
you've put us through,

642
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,207
you tell us to stop it?

643
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,742
Give me your cell phone.

644
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,044
Why?

645
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,547
I want to see it with my own eyes
because I find it hard to believe.

646
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:55,585
Send a text message to Han-gyeol saying,
"I love you, Han-gyeol. Your Chan."

647
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,454
"I love you"? Isn't that too forward?

648
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,856
Just text him, "Han-gyeol,
let's go and get some Chinese food,"

649
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:00,891
and let's see what happens.

650
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,359
-Stop. Stop it, will you?
-Hold on.

651
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,661
I can send a text message
with my cell phone using her number.

652
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,595
-Don't!
-Hey!

653
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,597
Calm down, Eun-chan. Just let him send it.

654
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,332
Send him a heart. A red one.

655
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,134
Let's send him two hearts.

656
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,004
Hey, that'll cost more money.
Just send him one.

657
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:15,272
Wait a minute.

658
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:19,476
Use my cell.

659
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:23,346
-Hey!
-Jeez, Eun-chan!

660
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,415
-Look at her run off!
-Hey!

661
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:48,805
What the heck?
Why isn't he sending a reply?

662
00:51:56,646 --> 00:51:58,048
He looks so serious.

663
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,083
Maybe we sent it to the wrong number.

664
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,251
Did you send two hearts?

665
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:02,919
-You should've sent one!
-Be quiet.

666
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:05,689
THANK YOU
DILIGENT KID

667
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,832
He's smiling.

668
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,634
-He's smiling!
-Look at him smile!

669
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,079
He smiled!

670
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,914
The boss smiled.

671
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,182
He must be in love with you.

672
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,451
Hey, Eun-chan.

673
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:36,686
Congratulations for being the only girl
at the Coffee Prince.

674
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,455
Thanks, Ha-rim.

675
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,057
Does that make her a princess?

676
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,693
Then we should hire another girl
that's really hot to work here.

677
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,428
Good idea!

678
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:48,265
Hey, Eun-chan! Eun-chan!

679
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:51,835
Jeez!

680
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:01,511
If I knew that Chan was a girl,
I would have tried coming onto her.

681
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:05,148
No wonder I felt so attracted to her
from the very beginning.

682
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,018
I guess we can relax now.

683
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,154
The atmosphere at the shop
has been so tense for the past few days.

684
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,856
I didn't think you could be tense.

685
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,492
Did you see how those two
awkwardly walked out of here?

686
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,827
I knew that those two would end up
getting back together again.

687
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:19,162
I have a new respect for our boss.

688
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,364
He's a lot more passionate than he looks.

689
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:23,934
He even confessed his love for Eun-chan
when he thought she was a guy.

690
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,135
He's like that.

691
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,604
Once he falls in love,
he just goes for broke.

692
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,540
Anyway, I still can't believe
that Eun-chan's a girl.

693
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,210
She was so deceptive.

694
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,379
Now, look at the size of that stream.

695
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,648
It's Niagara Falls!

696
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,651
It was so tense lately
that I never even took a good whiz since.

697
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,587
I wonder if she saw my package?

698
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,857
Anyways, I wonder which package
she thought was the nicest?

699
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,392
Which package she thought was the nicest?

700
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,436
Jeez!

701
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,904
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

702
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:01,972
Your package.

703
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,144
You're taking all our business
away from us.

704
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,080
Just start a franchise
and we can be your second shop.

705
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,282
It's hard enough for me
to run one shop as it is.

706
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,751
I'm sorry. I'll see you next week.

707
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:15,652
Bye.

708
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,466
Have you delivered all the beans?

709
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:30,734
Yeah.

710
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,236
This is for you.

711
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:36,806
Why did you only buy one?
You drink it first.

712
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:39,609
I'm all right.
I've already had some juice.

713
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:43,246
Jeez, just drink it, will you?
Do you have to make me tell you twice?

714
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,748
Okay.

715
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:52,722
What the heck? It got into my nose!

716
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,557
That's it.
Now you're acting more like yourself.

717
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,126
-Jeez.
-Here.

718
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,568
Why are you staring at me like that?
Do you like me that much?

719
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,570
This all feels like a dream,

720
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,307
hearing you talk and seeing you smile.

721
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:12,609
I'm so happy.

722
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,987
Your face is all sticky.

723
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,589
Where can we wash this?

724
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:27,857
There's a restroom over there.

725
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,496
She's a girl.

726
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,134
She's a girl!

727
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:39,903
A definite girl!

728
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:42,906
Race you up the stairs.

729
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:45,875
Hey, wait up!

730
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:53,783
You should've told me earlier.

731
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,185
We could've held hands.

732
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,987
I didn't know
that you were in love with me.

733
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,123
How could you not have known?

734
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,359
I even went to the hospital
because of you.

735
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,128
-Are you stupid?
-A hospital?

736
00:56:06,296 --> 00:56:07,664
I was just confused.

737
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,400
I thought that you liked me
as a really good friend.

738
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:15,238
I never even imagined that you could be
in love with a girl like me.

739
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,474
But you're so pretty.

740
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:23,580
I was really bewildered
when I first saw you,

741
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:27,917
but I also thought
that you were really handsome.

742
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:28,985
The first time you saw me?

743
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,088
-The purse snatching incident?
-No.

744
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,691
I went on a delivery to your apartment

745
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,726
and you were drying your feet
with a towel.

746
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:37,761
Don't you remember?

747
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,929
It was about two or three months ago.

748
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,164
Food's here!

749
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:53,743
The helmet!

750
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,812
You left an impression on me.

751
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:57,514
What?

752
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,617
What are you talking about?

753
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:03,586
What left an impression on you?

754
00:57:08,658 --> 00:57:09,893
Your wet hair.

755
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:12,295
You should have told me earlier.

756
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,230
Are you still angry?

757
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,132
Wait!

758
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:24,307
You're a girl.

759
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,446
I'm still not used to it.

760
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,550
Hey, Han-sung.

761
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,093
-Have some water.
-Thanks.

762
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,037
Yoo-joo is so irresponsible.

763
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:56,840
If she's not in New York,
where the heck could she be?

764
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,908
I guess I didn't know as much
about Yoo-joo as I thought.

765
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:02,145
I thought I knew everything about her.

766
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,714
But I don't know her mom's address,

767
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,917
and I don't have the number
to any of her close friends.

768
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,854
-Have you tried the cottage in Yangpyeong?
-I did.

769
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,825
I hope she's all right.

770
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,661
I'm really being punished this time.

771
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,264
I'm sure she's all right.

772
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:24,601
She's a lot more timid than she looks
and I'm sure she didn't do anything rash.

773
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,536
She would've contacted you already
if she were hurt.

774
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,172
Let's just wait for her.

775
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,609
You should lie down.

776
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,144
You look awful!

777
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:39,983
You should go.

778
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:41,751
Okay.

779
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:45,488
-Should I turn off the lights?
-Yeah. Thanks.

780
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,129
You don't have to worry about that.

781
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,031
I even kissed Eun-chan.

782
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,233
Will you keep it down?

783
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:01,237
Are you proud of having shown your package
to boss' future wife?

784
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,840
He thinks that Eun-chan won't remember
since it's been so long.

785
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:09,345
I even showed Eun-chan the tattoo
on my butt that I got to commemorate

786
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:10,713
my discharge from the army.

787
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,215
I must have been crazy!

788
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,018
No one asked to see my tattoo

789
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,453
but I unzipped my pants anyways,
slipped down my boxers

790
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,388
unveiled everything,

791
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,723
and told everyone
to take a look at my tattoo.

792
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,660
To see how cool it is!

793
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,428
What are you talking about, Ha-rim?

794
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,632
Why are you so interested
on what's going on with Han-sung?

795
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:32,268
It's just that you ran off
to his place all of a sudden,

796
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:35,672
and I was wondering what was going on.

797
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:37,907
Is anything wrong?

798
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,809
Yoo-joo left saying
that she was going to America.

799
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:41,711
Really? Why?

800
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,247
Why are you so interested?

801
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,615
Are you trying to make me jealous?

802
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,185
Anyway, she said she was going but didn't.

803
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,821
It's a lovers' quarrel,
so don't worry about it.

804
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,690
They've been together for ten years.

805
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:56,092
They're bound to fight once in a while.

806
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,127
If everything is always great,
that's even weirder.

807
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,066
By the way, I heard that Han-sung
used to be in love with you.

808
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:05,902
That can't be.

809
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:12,141
I'm nothing more than a friend to him.

810
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,109
How about you?

811
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,380
You're not seeing him
behind my back, are you?

812
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:19,649
No, of course not!

813
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:25,088
-At first, I had a crush on him.
-You had a crush on Han-sung?

814
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,792
Yes, I did.

815
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,128
-Oh, my lord!
-Well...

816
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:35,832
Anyways, as I began to have feelings
for Han-sung,

817
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,535
I also began to have feelings for you.

818
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:42,071
I don't know if you can call
that cheating though.

819
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,840
-What?
-But I don't have feelings for him now.

820
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:44,941
I swear.

821
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,679
But why did you choose me over Han-sung?

822
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,816
Usually, women choose Han-sung over me.

823
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,153
He's warm, he has a great personality
and he puts you at ease.

824
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,555
So why did you choose me?

825
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,892
You know what? I don't know.

826
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,562
Tell me the truth.

827
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,898
You have feelings for both Han-sung
and me, don't you?

828
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:09,899
Goodness!

829
01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:12,168
I wish I could take my heart out
and show it to you!

830
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:18,041
Han-sung is just a very good friend
but you are...

831
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,177
I don't know why,

832
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,212
but...

833
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,183
I really care for you.

834
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:31,621
I still can't get over it.

835
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:35,091
I was wrong.

836
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,060
I know I should have told you.

837
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,796
I feel angry whenever I think about it.

838
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,701
I love you.

839
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:48,171
I love you!

840
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:49,939
I love you!

841
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,375
I love you so much!

842
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:54,077
I love you!

843
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:02,518
Tell me the truth, you're a player, right?

844
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:04,754
You're just telling me you love me

845
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,423
when I say I'm still mad.
Where did you learn to change the subject?

846
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,860
I didn't know this side of you.

847
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,763
How could you!

848
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,766
You could have told me
you loved me before.

849
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,568
We could have had great times together,

850
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:20,570
so why you didn't tell me
and make me suffer!

851
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,572
I hate you, Eun-chan!

852
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,208
You just keep this in mind.

853
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:29,212
I love you more than you love me.

854
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,185
That's all. Bye!

855
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:08,684
He says he loves me!

856
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,458
He loves me!

857
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:29,872
I'm so happy!

858
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:31,774
I'm so happy!

859
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,683
