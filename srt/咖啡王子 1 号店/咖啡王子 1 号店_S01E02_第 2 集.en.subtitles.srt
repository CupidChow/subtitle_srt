1
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,432
Hey, do you want to be my lover?

2
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,836
Lover?

3
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,873
Whose lover? Yours?

4
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:44,177
Let's see. You have a nice jawline
and you have a nice nose.

5
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,613
What are you doing? Seriously.

6
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,782
Don't worry, it won't wear out your face.

7
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,251
You really must be gay.

8
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:54,020
Not that it matters to me.

9
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,457
Just apologize for ragging on my parents
and give me the money for my scooter, now.

10
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,591
-We need to talk.
-Let me go.

11
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,260
Where are you taking me? Let me go.

12
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,630
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

13
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,065
What are you doing?

14
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:06,533
I'm trying to give you money.

15
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,334
Then open your wallet,

16
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,602
not your laptop.

17
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,973
And before we go further,
apologize for ragging on my parents.

18
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,676
What are you looking at? Apologize.

19
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:20,680
Fine. I apologize. Satisfied?

20
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,451
Look into my eyes
and say it with some sincerity.

21
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,855
I was wrong to bring up your parents.
Sorry. Satisfied?

22
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,457
"Sorry" without the "satisfied."

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,229
I was wrong to bring up your parents.
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,200
Now give me the money for my scooter.

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,235
-Name?
-How much will you give me?

26
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,770
-Your name.
-Koh Eun-chan.

27
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,908
-Your resident ID number?
-840805-2371292.

28
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,845
Hey. Can't you do anything right?

29
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,146
It's one-three.

30
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,348
Mens' IDs start with a one.

31
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,651
Keep going.

32
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,520
What's the rest?

33
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,955
1371292.

34
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,127
I don't get it.

35
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,229
Why are you asking this stuff?
Just give me the money.

36
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,698
You said you needed money
so I'm trying to give you a job,

37
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,333
but I can't trust you

38
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,034
so I'm getting your information.

39
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,736
-What job?
-Playing my lover.

40
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,705
-Whose lover?
-Mine.

41
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,409
Of all the... You look normal enough.

42
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,149
You already have a girlfriend.
The one whose bag I got back.

43
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,353
"You got hurt!" Her. Am I wrong?

44
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,223
She isn't someone you can talk about.

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,159
Why can't I talk with my own mouth?

46
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,228
Just come to my blind dates
and pretend to be my lover.

47
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,697
Just infuriate my blind dates
and get paid.

48
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,166
Are you in or not?

49
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,469
It doesn't seem too hard to do
as long as you pay me.

50
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,703
Your ID.

51
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,645
Where the heck did I put it?

52
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,780
Oh, right. I left it at home.

53
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,981
Why do you want my ID?

54
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,250
How can I trust a punk like you?

55
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,919
You were in cahoots with a purse snatcher.

56
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:11,124
"Punk." I'm not a punk. I really had
nothing to do with that purse snatcher.

57
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,927
I mean it...

58
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,096
Try anything funny,
and this goes on a wanted poster.

59
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:21,234
Fine. But I need an advance.

60
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:25,572
I need exactly, two, four, six...
Make that eight million won.

61
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,806
I need eight million won.

62
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,875
-Forget it.
-Wait!

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,412
This is when we negotiate.

64
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,747
How about a million per job?

65
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,850
-Half.
-Forget I mentioned it.

66
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,052
How about 300,000 won?

67
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,721
Maybe 100,000 won?

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,857
Make it 200,000 won.
That's as low as I go.

69
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,093
-As you will.
-Mister.

70
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,267
Fine, 100,000 won per job,

71
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:58,805
plus money for transportation,
food, snacks.

72
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,773
-That's highway robbery. All that...
-Clothes.

73
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,775
...is included.

74
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,611
It will cost extra whenever you touch me.

75
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,646
It will vary by where you touch.

76
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,515
Head, 20,000 won.
Face and shoulders, 30,000.

77
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,284
-He thinks I'm a pervert.
-Waist, back, 50,000.

78
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,487
Arm around my shoulders, 70,000.
A hug, 100,000, and a kiss...

79
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:18,524
That's as far as I go.

80
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,493
How much if I jump you?

81
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,896
You were on top of me this morning.
How much will you give me?

82
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,199
Jeez, you petty old man.

83
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,067
You're the one who tripped me.

84
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,002
Nevermind.

85
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,040
I'll give you 500,000 won for your scooter
and pay the rest after you do the job.

86
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,308
Advance.

87
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,383
I need the money urgently. It's the truth.

88
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,688
I won't do it
unless you pay me in advance.

89
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:54,894
Is that your car?

90
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,800
Why is this hotel in such a remote place?
It's so difficult to get here.

91
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,669
My joints are killing me.

92
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,138
Give me a lift
to the subway station, please.

93
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,993
This is awesome.

94
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,362
-Be quiet.
-Okay.

95
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,932
Times like these call for some music--

96
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,901
Don't touch anything.

97
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,002
Okay.

98
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,543
What the heck?

99
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,579
How can you laugh?

100
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,614
I almost got into an accident
because of you!

101
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,483
You scared me half to death.

102
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,785
Don't worry. I'll bring you back
if you die.

103
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,695
Mister, I promise
I'll stay still from now on.

104
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,697
Oh, no. What the heck is going on?

105
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,266
I swear I didn't press anything.

106
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,670
Oh, no. I need to grab on, but...

107
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:11,971
It opened.

108
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:14,507
Drop the act.

109
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,579
Wow, this is so cool.

110
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,615
So this is why people ride around
in convertibles.

111
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,752
How fast can this car go?

112
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,587
It's none of your business.

113
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,858
What are you doing?

114
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,460
It's dangerous. You punk, sit down!

115
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,630
This is awesome. This is so amazing!

116
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:38,898
Favor, please?

117
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll pay you 20,000 won. Let's take a lap.

118
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,535
Hello, everyone!

119
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,140
I needed money and I'm going to get it

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,945
But I need even more money
People come before money

121
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,449
Hello, people!

122
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,736
You're fired if you're even a minute late
tomorrow, okay?

123
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,105
Okay. Thank you for today.

124
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,842
Get home safely!

125
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,248
What a freak.

126
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,459
Mom.

127
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,394
-Mom.
-You're back.

128
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,762
Mom.

129
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,564
Wait. Let me finish writing this.

130
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,866
I'll make you dinner later.

131
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,100
What are you writing?

132
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,637
"Shoes are my enemy.

133
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,973
Imported products
are the quickest way to bankruptcy.

134
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,941
Pink is the angel of death"?

135
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,845
You know how I go gaga
whenever I see pink.

136
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:38,150
I've been thinking about it,
and I must have been crazy.

137
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:42,321
My daughter's working 24 hours a day

138
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,490
in order to make money,

139
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,193
but whenever I see something pretty,

140
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,896
I lose control and buy them all--

141
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,998
Right you are.

142
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,168
You spend way too much for a mom.

143
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,671
Hey. Don't use my mudpack!

144
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,341
You're always using everything I buy.

145
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,444
What did you get on your recent test?

146
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,413
See? Why do you start up with her?

147
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,148
You can never outtalk her.

148
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,249
That brat.

149
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,887
Mom.

150
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,056
What's this?

151
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,162
Oh, my. What's this?

152
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,799
I got a million won advance from my job
and 500,000 to fix the scooter.

153
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,002
Why did they give
you such a large advance?

154
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,205
You're not...

155
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,174
Not anyone can be an escort.

156
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,576
They would hire me, but--

157
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,177
-Watch your mouth.
-Why you...

158
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,282
Tell me the truth,
did you borrow from a loan shark?

159
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,884
I would never.

160
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,419
Don't you trust your own daughter?

161
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,054
Of course I trust you.

162
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,023
Who else do I have to trust? Your sister?

163
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:56,963
But this money isn't nearly
enough to pay for Dong-suk's ring.

164
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,736
First, we'll take the money
out of Eun-sae's college fund.

165
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,672
We'll just earn more money later.

166
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,209
Jeez. Don't look so sad.

167
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,046
Okay. I'm going to peel
as many chestnuts as possible.

168
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,883
Let's have a party! Party!

169
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,119
But for under 10,000 won?

170
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,821
Were you going to spend more?

171
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,590
Let's have a party! Party!

172
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:26,859
Sorry.

173
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,662
I'll peel many, many chestnuts.

174
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:38,304
Yoo-joo, is this a lion?

175
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,872
That's right.

176
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,108
Yoo-joo, draw me a flower, please.

177
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,877
-After I'm done with this.
-Okay.

178
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,280
-It's time to eat, Ye-jin.
-Okay!

179
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,883
-Bye, Yoo-joo!
-Bye!

180
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,787
Yoo-joo, it's time to eat!

181
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,290
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

182
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,592
Let's have meatballs.

183
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,262
I don't eat meatballs.
I've told you it many times.

184
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,898
Is that right?

185
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,735
When you asked me to meet you here,
I kind of figured.

186
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,570
What do you mean?

187
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,439
Let's go.

188
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:14,774
Where are we going?

189
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,208
To the owner of those meatballs.

190
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:17,977
I'm here to see you.

191
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,916
There you go, lying again.

192
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,395
Sweeper's dad!

193
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,898
Sweeper's dad!

194
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,567
Hey, Milk Girl.

195
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,235
-Hello.
-Hi.

196
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,076
Want a beer?

197
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,846
Want some ice cream?

198
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,189
You must not like being called
"Sweeper's dad."

199
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,191
I'm Choi Han-sung.

200
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,627
I'm Koh Eun-chan and I'm 24 years old.

201
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,197
How about you?

202
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,331
I'm 31.

203
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,768
Oh, 31. You're a lot older than I am.

204
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,472
That's right.

205
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,713
What happened
with the pride or money matter?

206
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,249
You asked me about that at the wine bar.

207
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:33,886
Oh, that.

208
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,225
I go back and forth. I can't seem
to make my mind up these days.

209
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,829
Aren't you ever like that?

210
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,664
Me?

211
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,437
I don't know about myself,

212
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:55,474
but I have a friend who has been
like that recently.

213
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,079
My friend, he...

214
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,017
Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.

215
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,886
Why?

216
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,922
Do you think I'm too young to understand?

217
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,058
I know all there is to know.

218
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,428
But forget it,
if you don't want to tell me.

219
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,808
You got some on your face.

220
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,213
Not there. Here.

221
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,594
Can't you tell me about your friend?

222
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,362
I'm very curious.

223
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,464
It's really nothing.

224
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,266
Tell me.

225
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,806
Well, so... this friend...

226
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,976
was in love with this woman,

227
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,680
but she left two years ago.

228
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,616
Did they break up or was he dumped?

229
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,218
Both.

230
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,421
No. I guess it would be correct
to say he was dumped

231
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,890
since she started seeing someone else.

232
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,192
And then?

233
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,161
But...

234
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:27,299
that woman reappeared again
like magic after two years,

235
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,638
and he has been torn about whether or not
to get back together with her.

236
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,641
That's a tough decision to make.

237
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,311
So, if your friend decided

238
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,615
to see that woman again,

239
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,484
then that woman would return
to your friend

240
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,087
and the friend would be back
with his girlfriend...

241
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,489
This is so confusing.

242
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,660
I'll just call them "Guy A" and "Girl B."

243
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:02,434
So does Guy A still love Girl B?

244
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,538
He can't quite tell yet.

245
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,908
Why can't he tell?

246
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,577
If you miss her
and you want to hear her voice,

247
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,045
then you love her.

248
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:17,516
You should try to be franker
with yourself.

249
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,487
Oh, no.

250
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,823
Sorry, but I need to go.
I'll see you later.

251
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,492
Yes, I'm on my way home.

252
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,394
-Sorry.
-Okay.

253
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,629
Of course I didn't eat it--

254
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,200
-How could you eat the whole thing?
-I...

255
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:36,735
I'm off.

256
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:40,306
Hey, I'm right in front of the house.

257
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,309
Open the door. I'm climbing up the stairs.

258
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,964
I feel sorry for you, Han Yoo-joo.

259
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,799
Do you like Han-sung that much?

260
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,272
Fine. You don't have to answer that.

261
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,144
Here comes the owner of the meatballs.

262
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,017
Good luck.

263
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,055
You're back.

264
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,890
-Hey.
-Later.

265
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,236
I broke up with DK.

266
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,544
I know. You're famous.

267
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,146
It's all over the news.

268
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,415
I want to...

269
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,787
get back together with you again.

270
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,449
I just really wanted to tell you
that I was sorry--

271
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,784
What are you thinking about?

272
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,155
I was just wondering

273
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,325
how big a chump you took me for.

274
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,933
You think you can
walk out of my life like that

275
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,569
and just walk right back in?

276
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,443
Do I look that easy to you?

277
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,047
It's not like that.

278
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,251
Just go.

279
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,256
Let's never see each other again.

280
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,003
You're really different from me.

281
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,407
Three years ago,

282
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,076
when you said, "Leave,

283
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,079
let's never see each other again,"

284
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,884
I wept like a fool.

285
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,955
Is it because you have a lot
of experience?

286
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,057
Nothing fazes you at all.

287
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,634
I've changed a lot, right?

288
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,639
I've become a petty bastard
who sleeps with a woman out of revenge.

289
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,112
There was a time when just the sight
of you got me excited...

290
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,584
and I was all right with anything you did.

291
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:06,525
Go.

292
00:22:58,643 --> 00:23:00,746
She really left
just because I told her to.

293
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,642
There's nothing to be scared of,
Koh Eun-chan.

294
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,278
Yeah.

295
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,291
Excuse me! Wait!

296
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,059
Stop the bus! I'm sorry.

297
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,135
Where am I? Darn it. Wait!

298
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,471
I knew it.

299
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,106
He isn't here
and he won't answer his phone.

300
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,707
I was too naive.

301
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:06,578
I was a moron for believing
a punk like that. Darn it.

302
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:10,982
Hey. You beg for an advance
with your puppy-dog eyes,

303
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,818
and you don't show up?

304
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,619
I'll circulate your photo
all across the country!

305
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,189
You punk. You bastard!

306
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,591
-You ass--
-Mister!

307
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,460
Why are you so late?

308
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,363
I'm sorry. I was late
and went back home again

309
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:30,068
and got off the bus at the wrong stop
and ran the rest of the way...

310
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,937
I'm so tired.

311
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,572
What are you saying?

312
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,373
Look how you're dressed.

313
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,575
What about it?

314
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,144
What the heck is this? Come with me.

315
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,512
I even did my hair.

316
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,239
Check this out.

317
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,733
-Red light, green light, one, two, three!
-Red light, green light, one, two, three!

318
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,336
-Red light, green light, one, two, three!
-Red light, green light, one, two, three!

319
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:22,007
-Red light, green light, one, two, three!
-Red light, green light, one, two, three!

320
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,017
Ready?

321
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,264
Dongin Foods is famous for coffee, right?

322
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,900
She looks boring and sounds boring.

323
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,502
Have you seen that movie?

324
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,138
Is it possible to be this bored
after only five minutes?

325
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,341
People often say I resemble Meg Ryan.

326
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,876
Do I really?

327
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,711
I do, don't I?

328
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:02,414
Please excuse me for a while.

329
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,301
This is turning out to be more fun
than I thought.

330
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,202
Hush.

331
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,037
Don't make any mistakes.

332
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,339
Okay.

333
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,448
What are you doing?

334
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,818
Tilt your head.

335
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,254
Are you playing with me?

336
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,856
You said to tilt my head.

337
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,091
The other way.

338
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,330
You bastard!

339
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,403
Wait a minute.
This is no way for a cultured lady to act.

340
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,972
I'll show you culture!

341
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,577
Hey!

342
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,948
He was caught kissing some guy.

343
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,116
Hey, Eun-chan!

344
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,218
And he was beaten up by a girl.

345
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,222
He's doing everything
he can to get out of the dates.

346
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,345
-All right.
-All right. Yeah.

347
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,621
What?

348
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:05,463
Hey. Stop overreacting. Calm down already.

349
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,699
That was my first kiss.

350
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:08,967
That wasn't a kiss.

351
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,468
I was just so overwhelmed that I...

352
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,504
That's my first kiss too. With a guy.

353
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,709
I feel sick to my stomach.

354
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:19,944
Let's go eat.

355
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,793
That's right. Go ahead.

356
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,330
I'm going to bankrupt you
before this day is over. That's it.

357
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,033
-What should we do now?
-That's it.

358
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,637
Rumors that the heir of Dongin Foods
is gay are spreading like wildfire.

359
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,205
What if his dad hears about this?

360
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,841
You have to do something, Mom.

361
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,044
Don't worry about it. I have a good idea.

362
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,113
You just leave everything up to me.

363
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:59,284
That's it. Make my day.
Okay, I'll raise you again.

364
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,086
-Mom!
-Stop talking to me!

365
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,556
Jeez. For crying out loud.

366
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,892
I lost because you broke my concentration.

367
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,795
Can't you leave me alone while I have
some fun before going to work?

368
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,865
Call the car so I can leave for work
and call Gye-sik and tell him

369
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,700
to come to the company right away.

370
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,936
-Gye-sik?
-Yes, Gye-sik!

371
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,138
That's it.

372
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,273
That's it.

373
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:27,111
PRINCE COFFEE SHOP BUSINESS PLANS

374
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,920
If you make two million won a month,
how many cups of coffee do you sell a day?

375
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:41,192
About 300 cups a month?

376
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,729
If you deduct rent, cost of ingredients,
and maintenance, you're left with nothing.

377
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,398
Can you even afford to eat every day?

378
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,867
You know I like noodles and instant food.

379
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,770
I have a place to live, albeit tiny.

380
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,340
I get by since I'm not
trying to strike it rich.

381
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,409
Then you should keep on scraping by
without money.

382
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,211
Why are you trying to revive it?

383
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:04,148
It has memories of a beautiful time.
I don't want to give it up--

384
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,986
I thought that harlot ended up marrying
another man,

385
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,554
so why are you still talking about her?

386
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,924
-I can't seem to forget--
-Shut up!

387
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,760
Don't you dare
talk about that harlot to me.

388
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,098
She brainwashed you
to close the successful butcher's shop

389
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,067
and made you start a coffee company
you knew nothing about.

390
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,670
I supported you
and even sent you abroad to study.

391
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,171
But you worked only five years and quit

392
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,108
to open that cafe,
saying you wanted to live only for her.

393
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,078
Then you stopped visiting me,
and now show up after ten years to ask--

394
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,849
I visited you during every holiday
but you refused to see me each time.

395
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,051
Why would I want to see someone
who abandoned me?

396
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,555
I was worried about your health,

397
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,359
but you're just as loud as ever. I'm glad.

398
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,695
What are you laughing about?

399
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:52,230
Three months.

400
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,801
I'll give you money, so increase sales
by three times in three months.

401
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,704
Three times? You must be kidding.

402
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:03,408
-I'm too old to be kidding at my age.
-Then?

403
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:07,879
I'm going to send you
an idiot as big an imbecile as you.

404
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,981
You two work together
and try the best you can.

405
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,317
It's your last chance, do you understand?

406
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,288
If he's as big of an imbecile as I am,
that's going to be tough.

407
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:30,168
Now, let's see. Minus the advance
that you already gave me,

408
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,703
plus the extras for touching my cheek
and kissing me.

409
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,871
How much does that come out to?

410
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,841
For someone so money-hungry,
you're really slow.

411
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,210
Head 20,000. Face 3 times, so 90,000.

412
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,345
Back twice, so 100,000.
Arm on shoulder 70,000 times 3.

413
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,949
And the kiss... Special price of 150,000.

414
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:47,351
Wrist 20,000. Neck-grab 50,000.
How much is all that?

415
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,120
-How much is it?
-How should I know?

416
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,023
Hold on for a minute.
I just have a lot on my mind.

417
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,393
Our landlord raised our deposit
and I have my sister's tuition.

418
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,028
By how much did your deposit go up?

419
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,063
Why? Are you going to give me
that much money?

420
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,865
It's about five million won.

421
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:07,772
Here's how much you owe me.
We should be precise about this.

422
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,344
By the way, take off your watch.

423
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,548
Jeez. Can't you just give me
this knock-off?

424
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,883
Why?

425
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,122
You're so petty. Go ahead
and take it you petty, miserly man.

426
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,227
Gosh.

427
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,364
Why are these cups so dang small?

428
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,208
You're unbelievable, you know that?

429
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,380
Can you really only handle
one glass of wine?

430
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:51,449
It might loosen you up
if you drank a little more.

431
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,684
You drink as much as you want
and enjoy your life.

432
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,019
Okay.

433
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:02,126
What's wrong?

434
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:05,997
I know I smell it somewhere.

435
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,802
Don't you smell coffee?

436
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,506
Coffee in a Chinese restaurant?

437
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,477
Hey, Jeong-seong!

438
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,614
I'm sorry!

439
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,583
Watch where you're going!

440
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,951
How annoying.

441
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,788
-I spilled coffee on my clothes.
-Welcome.

442
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,723
Can I have some napkins?

443
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,926
-Here.
-Thank you.

444
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,128
Are you a bloodhound?

445
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,996
How can you smell coffee from outside?

446
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,666
As a matter of fact,
my nickname is Bloodhound.

447
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,968
I wasn't going to say this,

448
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,270
but I could smell everything you ate
when you kissed me.

449
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:48,873
You had rice this morning, right?

450
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,182
What is it now?

451
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,357
Something smells foul. What a stench.

452
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,128
This stench is overpowering.

453
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,231
Hey, can't you smell that?

454
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,266
I thought you had to pee.

455
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,103
I was peeing behind a truck

456
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:21,706
when it suddenly took off.

457
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,308
I know I smell something foul. Gross.

458
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,844
Where is it coming from?

459
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,313
Okay. You've made your point.

460
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,649
You have a good sense of smell. Now, eat.

461
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,718
Okay.

462
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,554
Anyway, where do you put all that food

463
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,955
in that tiny body of yours?

464
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,323
I have to eat more so I can work.

465
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,426
I have to store up as much as I can.
This is a rare opportunity.

466
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,963
What will you do with what you store up?

467
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,632
Throw it up and eat it again?

468
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,966
Do you want to see it?

469
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:59,844
Hey. Everything you've done thus far
made it hard for me to eat already,

470
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,345
so cut it out.

471
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,420
Hey, did you just...

472
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:11,455
This is the water.

473
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,868
You're completely offbeat!

474
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,437
How many times is that already?

475
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:00,738
Again, from the top.

476
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,341
-Let's try that again.
-Han-sung.

477
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:04,975
It's 10 p.m.

478
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,877
and we worked through lunch and dinner.

479
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,818
Sorry, everyone! Go and eat.

480
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,554
Are you all right?

481
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,656
Yeah. Get something to eat.

482
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:30,935
What did I do to deserve this?

483
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,171
Why are there so many stairs?

484
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,608
What kind of a guy passes out from that?

485
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,310
He's so heavy.

486
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,015
This is insane.

487
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,889
Hey, mister.

488
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,426
Wake up. You're home.

489
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,662
Hey, mister.

490
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:01,665
Hey.

491
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,001
Hey, mister.

492
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,640
Gosh!

493
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,545
Hey, mister.

494
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,014
Wake up. You're home.

495
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,383
Hey, mister!

496
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,052
My goodness!

497
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,460
Jeez.

498
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,522
Shit!

499
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,362
Wait.

500
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,703
I'm leaving if you don't get up
on the count of three!

501
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,306
One, two, three.

502
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,233
Hey, Eun-chan.

503
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:44,268
What are you carrying? This is a pig.

504
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,237
My employer.

505
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,972
Employer? Hey!

506
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,207
My freezer has room.
Want me to keep that for you?

507
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,509
No.

508
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,440
Eun-chan. I made stew.

509
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,180
Hello?

510
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,217
Hello. Yes. How have you been...

511
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,820
Excuse me? What about Eun-sae?

512
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,758
I'm sorry. I'll be right over.

513
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,460
-Hello!
-Hello!

514
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,496
-Hello!
-Go-yong.

515
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:47,798
Take this.

516
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,668
I have to go somewhere
but I'll be right back,

517
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:52,937
so give this to the handsome man
sleeping over there.

518
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:54,271
-Okay.
-Louder!

519
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,372
Okay!

520
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,411
Take off your shoes.

521
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:10,621
Why did you have to write that garbage
in your notebook for my class?

522
00:43:10,688 --> 00:43:12,690
Who told you to write this garbage?

523
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,393
-Hey. Eun-chan!
-Hello.

524
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,396
You better get your sister to shape up.

525
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:20,864
Just look at this.

526
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,466
She's using her notebook as a ledger.

527
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,801
I'm sorry.

528
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,204
How dare you take that attitude with me?
Stand up straight.

529
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:30,541
I'm sorry, sir.

530
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,778
Where did you get the money?

531
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,281
How did you lend out over a million won?

532
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:38,949
It's money that I saved here and there.

533
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,884
How could you save that much
from here and there?

534
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,753
I stole from the money
from peeling chestnuts

535
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,054
and sewing eyes on the dolls. So?

536
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,523
Don't you dare glare at me.

537
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,529
I wanted to register
at a singing academy. So what?

538
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,765
Why did you hit me?

539
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:56,133
You have no right to hit me!

540
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,570
You're not Mom or Dad! Don't give me crap
just because you make money!

541
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,140
Don't you take that tone of voice with me.
I've been too easy on you.

542
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,509
And can't I even say that
as your big sister?

543
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,711
How dare you glare at me?

544
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,780
You should've told me you wanted to go--

545
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,448
Are you rich?

546
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,384
You don't have that kind of money.

547
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,219
You're all talk when you've got jack.

548
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,555
I'm going to keep lending money
to kids no matter what you say.

549
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:19,790
Not just to kids in my class,

550
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,859
but to the entire school.

551
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,128
And when I become a famous pop star,

552
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:28,098
don't expect anything from me. Got it?

553
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,901
You'll keep lending out money?

554
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:33,137
Of course.

555
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:34,705
But I'm not going to keep a book.

556
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,473
I'm going to memorize everything
in my head.

557
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,009
Later on when I become famous,

558
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,878
I'll set you up
with your own taekwondo gym.

559
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,570
Excuse me. Are you a hobo?

560
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:12,576
-It's a snake.
-It's a snake.

561
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,000
Ready?

562
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,504
Basic stance.

563
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,208
Begin the basic movements.

564
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,510
-Low block.
-Low block.

565
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,746
-Torso block.
-Torso block.

566
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:50,748
-Face block.
-Face block.

567
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:52,382
-Taekwon!
-Taekwon!

568
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:55,719
-Attention. At ease.
-Hey.

569
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,821
Why did you dump me here?

570
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,458
I lugged you here
so you wouldn't get mugged.

571
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,427
Just eat up and go.

572
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,262
-Let's do that again.
-Okay.

573
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,430
Ready?

574
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:09,066
Master.

575
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,367
Master, my butt.

576
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,336
He pooped in his pants.

577
00:46:12,402 --> 00:46:13,737
-I pooped too.
-Me too.

578
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,608
-Me too.
-Me too.

579
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,443
I'm losing my appetite.

580
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,279
-Me too.
-Me too.

581
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:24,281
Hey. So all of you guys pooped.

582
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,483
-Me too.
-Me too.

583
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:31,822
Let's go show that man your poop.
Look at this poop.

584
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,825
Hey. Don't. Jeez.

585
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,599
I can't believe you dry heaved
just from the kids' poop.

586
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,568
It's not like you don't poop.

587
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,103
Stop talking about poop.

588
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,474
This belonged to my dad.

589
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,843
I don't usually lend it to others.

590
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:54,745
How about what I bought you?

591
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,580
I washed them. Do you want wet clothes?

592
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,815
I have to get back to the kids.

593
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,283
Change quickly and come.

594
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,702
The decor is all over the place.

595
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:22,005
Maybe hodge-podge is their theme.

596
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,592
"Eun-chan's daily schedule."

597
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,563
Deliver milk, peel chestnuts,

598
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,465
help around the house...

599
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:59,343
No wonder Grandma calls me a slacker.

600
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:13,123
Wow, he was adorable when he was young.

601
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,900
What are you laughing at, you slacker?

602
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,707
Now stand in one line. That's it.

603
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:34,511
We'll take turns kicking the bag.

604
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,552
Now kick. That was good.

605
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,722
-Have a nice day, Master!
-Have a nice day, Master!

606
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,726
-Good work.
-Bye.

607
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,162
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

608
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,248
"You said you wanted this.
It's a present for a job well done."

609
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,849
Five... Five million won?

610
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,619
Is this guy crazy?

611
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:21,058
I'm lending you 3.5 more than your pay
so make sure to pay me back.

612
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,361
Did Mom drug his stew?

613
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,097
One, two...

614
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,601
One, two...

615
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,506
One, two, three.

616
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,885
I have an exhibition in a month.

617
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,158
You can actually get work done.

618
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:13,296
I can't at all.

619
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,900
My life's a mess.

620
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,139
But you're working.

621
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,008
You can work.

622
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:35,752
Are you ignoring me?

623
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,890
No matter what I say now,

624
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,492
you won't like it.

625
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,960
Do you know me that well?

626
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,797
Then you must know how hurt I was...

627
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:51,835
when you left me.

628
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,840
How I missed you like crazy,

629
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,010
then told myself it was hopeless
and to forget you,

630
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,148
and just how hard it was for me.

631
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,019
You must know very well.

632
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:30,774
I just can't compete with you.

633
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,545
You don't seem to be fazed at all,

634
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,049
no matter how much I try to hurt you.

635
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:50,927
Thank you.

636
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,435
I didn't think you would come.

637
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:04,908
I want you...

638
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,713
to feel my pain.

639
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:26,029
Cry.

640
00:54:26,129 --> 00:54:29,199
Why won't anyone hire
a talented, hardworking person like me?

641
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,533
Why?

642
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,780
How will I repay the 3.5 million won?

643
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,982
Doesn't he have any more blind dates?

644
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,990
He didn't say when he wanted his money by.

645
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:55,659
Should I ask him?

646
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:05,602
I'm so nervous.

647
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:09,606
But why am I nervous?

648
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,575
I don't know. Whatever.

649
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,405
DILIGENT KID

650
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,076
Hello?

651
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,612
Why are you calling at the crack of dawn?

652
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:23,780
You gave me a weird dream.

653
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:26,249
Crack of dawn? It's past noon already.

654
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,385
Why are you yelling at me?

655
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,087
I just called to ask by when
I need to pay you back.

656
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:33,289
I want it back as soon as possible.

657
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,126
Don't you have any more blind dates?

658
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,694
I really enjoyed that job.

659
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,562
You want me to go on more blind dates
just for you?

660
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:41,264
Like I said, I'll do anything.

661
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:44,734
But 100,000 won per job, okay?

662
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:46,302
No, thank you.

663
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:47,570
Cheapskate.

664
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:50,273
When I get make money,
I'll pay you back first.

665
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,142
-Bye!
-Wait.

666
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,814
Thank you.

667
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,322
Hello?

668
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,393
He hung up without saying goodbye.

669
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:23,506
I need more sleep.

670
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:37,454
Why you...

671
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,824
It's already late in the afternoon,
you lazy fool. My goodness...

672
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,660
Just take a look at yourself.

673
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,161
Come with me.

674
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:56,239
Of all the... That crazy fool.

675
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,511
Grandma, be careful.

676
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:06,883
Look at this.

677
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,588
-Grandma!
-Oh, my.

678
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,190
-Are you all right?
-Oh, my.

679
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:18,027
They should just demolish
this place for crying out loud.

680
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,262
Why that...

681
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,239
You idiot.

682
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:32,809
Is this a coffee shop or a pigsty?

683
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,412
Let's go.

684
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,748
I know you know him,
but let's get coffee elsewhere.

685
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,250
We're not going anywhere.

686
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,851
This is your new workplace.

687
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:43,520
What?

688
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:45,121
Go and say hi.

689
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,623
He's your mentor.

690
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,666
Did you really not get paid?

691
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,968
I knew he was no good,

692
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:03,072
always going around smiling
like he was a good guy.

693
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:06,709
Didn't I tell you
not to trust people too much?

694
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,712
If I knew he was going to run,
I would have caught him.

695
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:13,616
But he took off in the middle
of the night. What now?

696
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:15,451
This is your workplace from now on.

697
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,354
Why don't you talk seriously
about the business

698
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,089
with your mentor, Mr. Hong?

699
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:32,535
PRINCE COFFEE SHOP

700
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,395
A sharp nose, slim jaw line,

701
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:02,065
full, lush lips. Are you a guy or a girl?

702
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:03,600
-Who is this?
-My lover.

703
01:00:03,666 --> 01:00:05,868
Are you really going to pretend
to be a guy?

704
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,637
What if you get caught?

705
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,073
Don't worry. I won't get caught
as long as we don't bathe together.

706
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,474
She's flat-chested already.

707
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:15,078
They say every family has a delinquent.
You're such a prick.

708
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:17,146
Why do you keep touching my hand?

709
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:19,882
This is of the highest quality.

710
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,218
I don't know.
I don't want to run a business.

711
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,519
Aren't you too lazy to breathe?

712
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:24,721
Slacking off suits me.

713
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,389
You're not desperate enough.

714
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,824
Whatever. Screw it.

715
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:29,559
How can he not recognize
such a pretty girl?

716
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,693
May I have your phone number?

717
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,861
What? Don't come home?

718
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:33,896
-Are you mad?
-I got it, finally.

719
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,566
Why don't you have facial hair?
You're old enough. Why are you so behind?

720
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,967
I'm a girl!

721
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,756
