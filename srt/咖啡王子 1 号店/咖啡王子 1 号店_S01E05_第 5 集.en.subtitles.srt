1
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,936
What were you doing?

2
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,073
You were blowing into his face
as if you're his lover.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,077
-I didn't do anything.
-Just keep going, why don't you?

4
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,480
Hey, Ha-rim. I didn't do anything.

5
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,548
That punk's always kidding around.

6
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:06,826
It's your birthday present. Three hours
until it expires, so drink it quickly.

7
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,062
If I get a stomachache after I drink this,

8
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,864
it's coming out of your pay.

9
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,565
Then don't drink it.

10
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,437
Are you guys going out or something?

11
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,407
What do you mean?
I was just delivering milk and...

12
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:23,710
Why are you coming down from there?

13
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,012
He's right. What are you doing here?

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,582
-I don't know.
-Hey.

15
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,553
I'm so nervous, Han-sung.

16
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,188
Should we postpone it
if you're comfortable?

17
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,358
What will I say if they ask
why I'm back with you

18
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,493
after leaving you like that?

19
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,365
Never mind. I'll just say, "I'm sorry,

20
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,500
that's just how things turned out."

21
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,971
You don't have to be so tense.
It won't be the Inquisition.

22
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,273
Help me choose an outfit.

23
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:55,675
The phone's ringing.

24
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,846
Yoo-joo, it's Mom.

25
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,881
Are you busy with your exhibit?

26
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,284
-Why don't you call?
-Should I answer?

27
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:09,222
I don't mind if you don't come
to my wedding but please call me.

28
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,493
Is your mother getting married?

29
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,795
Don't ask.

30
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,497
What do you think?

31
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,667
Shy or bold?

32
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,970
-I like them both.
-Forget it. I'll decide.

33
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,146
HAN YOO-JOO, THE ARTIST OF LIGHT

34
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,380
NO MARRIAGE PLANS ON THE HORIZON

35
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:45,225
Galbitang? Your tastes
have become so simple these days.

36
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,860
That's because I have
so many employees to pay.

37
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,497
So why did your parents kick you out?

38
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,400
They want me to follow in
my dad's footsteps and wield the knife.

39
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,902
No, thank you.

40
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,870
I hate blood.

41
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,138
Knife? Blood?

42
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,707
Does your family run a butcher shop?

43
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,975
Butcher shop?

44
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,043
Still, you can't stay at the cafe.

45
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,745
You can stay with me for a while.

46
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,747
No thanks.

47
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,148
You'll nag me to death.

48
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,585
"Have breakfast. Sleep early.
Fold your laundry. Keep the room clean."

49
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,387
And you'll get jealous for meeting girls.

50
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,557
I don't think I could handle your nagging.

51
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,459
I couldn't either.

52
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,561
You must be such a pain to live with.

53
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,463
Just shut up and eat.

54
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,866
Couldn't you let me stay at the cafe

55
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,435
just until I find myself a place?

56
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,037
Mr. Hong has an extra room.

57
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,105
Could you ask him?

58
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,539
You shouldn't live like that.

59
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,508
Always ordering other people around

60
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,278
when you don't have
everything together yourself.

61
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,948
Why are you always ragging on me?

62
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:45,752
That's the way Eun-chan always talks.

63
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,186
Didn't you know that?

64
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,966
You can't bear to watch others eat,
can you? Here.

65
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,269
Give me one with more meat.

66
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,408
Here. Happy?

67
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,343
Look at all this meat.

68
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,281
You two are acting like you're going out.

69
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,319
My Chan, do you know that
you're blushing right now?

70
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,755
My Chan has such strange taste in men.

71
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,091
Stop jumping to conclusions. Jeez.

72
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,794
-What the heck was that?
-Also,

73
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,197
enough with the "My Chan."
It's super gross.

74
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,366
It's so annoying.

75
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,935
"My Chan!" What the heck is that?

76
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,270
Eat slowly.

77
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,710
I don't know what I should say right now.

78
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,613
Foreigners get past it gracefully,
but I...

79
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,384
Why? Lots of married couples get back
together after they get divorced.

80
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,153
What's wrong with getting back together
after a breakup?

81
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,358
I agree. Couples that break up at least
once are happier in the long run.

82
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,460
Thanks.

83
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,895
How do you feel, now that
you've set a wedding date?

84
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,531
It's all right.

85
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,969
When are you two going to get hitched?

86
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,337
Han-sung's such a nice guy

87
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,972
and I bet he would
make the perfect husband.

88
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,811
-Well, I...
-Yoo-joo doesn't believe in marriage.

89
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,583
-How nice.
-Your girlfriend will kill you.

90
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,719
Cheers.

91
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,526
Where in the world are you going?

92
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,764
We were here just a moment before.

93
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,932
What are you doing?

94
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,168
I guess I forgot to tell you.

95
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,637
-I'm exercising right now.
-What?

96
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,740
If you don't like the way I do things,
you don't have to stay at my place.

97
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,776
No. not at all.

98
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,311
I love the way you do things, Mr. Hong.

99
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,680
Wow, you're even doing push-ups
at this hour.

100
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,116
How could I not respect you?

101
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,586
Where now?

102
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,303
You know I'm only taking you in
because Eun-chan asked me to, don't you?

103
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,538
Of course.

104
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,607
And you know
you'll have to pay rent, don't you?

105
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,676
Of course.

106
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,779
I was thinking about 300,000 won a month.

107
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,650
Give me just 200,000 won including meals.

108
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,888
You're such a good man, Mr. Hong.

109
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,323
You're such a good man.

110
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,225
I know.

111
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:45,498
What are you doing here?

112
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,769
I was looking for a place to stay too,
and Eun-chan told me to come here.

113
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,571
I'll give you 300,000 won.

114
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,807
One, two, same difference.
The door's open. Come in.

115
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,044
Why didn't you wait in the house?

116
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,379
You try going in there.
There's nowhere to sit.

117
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,759
Home sweet home. Let me clear this.

118
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,396
Should I keep my shoes on?

119
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,435
You can't walk around in someone's home
with your shoes on.

120
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,503
So take them off?

121
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,344
What's wrong with this place?

122
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,381
I'll use this room.

123
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,816
It's up to you.

124
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,751
You can share the room with me
if you want.

125
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,652
Are you kidding me?

126
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,420
It's like Prince Coffee Shop.

127
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,622
Have some juice.

128
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,593
Is that from three years ago?

129
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,829
I wonder if my socks are dry.

130
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,431
I forgot to turn them inside out.

131
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,601
I guess I'll have to wash them again.

132
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,705
He dries them without washing them.

133
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,546
-Don't you want this?
-You have it.

134
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,514
If you insist.

135
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,052
We sold 27 cups of coffee and 10 waffles
per day the first week.

136
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,422
On the second week, we sold 19 cups
of coffee and 9 waffles.

137
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:17,657
On the third week,

138
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,660
we sold 52 cups of coffee and 24 waffles
during the first three days.

139
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,830
Why do you think business is so bad?

140
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,832
Like you know? It's all because of you.

141
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,368
This is because we're trying
to sell coffee to kids.

142
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,138
I told you kids know nothing about coffee.

143
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:33,239
What do you think, Seon-gi?

144
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,442
I sold 200 a day when I had my stand
in front of the women's college.

145
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,111
What's certain is that
my waffles taste good.

146
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,447
Why hasn't Min-yeop come in
for the past three days?

147
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,450
Starting next week, we'll offer takeout.

148
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,752
This chart shows the people
who pass near our cafe

149
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,555
broken down by time.
The first is from 7 am to 9 am.

150
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,959
-When did you do all that?
-Nobody gets up that early.

151
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,393
Those two hours are the peak hours.

152
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,529
Even if you know nothing about taste,

153
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,030
you can't serve coffee in paper cups.

154
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,966
Coffee is about affection.

155
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,435
It needs to be in a ceramic cup.

156
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,837
A world famous coffee chain
promoted its coffee by having

157
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,974
every employee including the CEO carry
around paper cups with their logo on it.

158
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,610
They succeeded without spending money
on advertising.

159
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,211
We'll do the same thing.

160
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,315
We'll divide the employees
into morning and afternoon shifts.

161
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,383
That will be all.

162
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,485
-I'm impressed.
-About what?

163
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,887
Is Min-yeop not coming in again today?

164
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,489
I fired him, so don't ask.

165
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,861
What do you mean, you fired Min-yeop?

166
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,263
He said something came up
and needed to quit, so I said okay.

167
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,431
What came up?

168
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,166
How in the world should I know that?

169
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:38,804
You shouldn't just tell him to quit
when he said something came up.

170
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:42,742
He called out of the blue
and said he's quitting.

171
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,777
Why should I ask what's going on?

172
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,447
He was so happy
because this was his very first job.

173
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,751
A good boss would have asked him
why he needed to quit.

174
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,086
Fine. I'm a bad boss.

175
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,389
Are you sad
your fellow troublemaker is gone?

176
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,924
He's an adult! He makes his own decisions.

177
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,027
You just worry about yourself.

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,330
That prick. That rude little prick.

179
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,048
Hey, mister. Cartilage and soju, please.

180
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,084
Okay. Hey, you...

181
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,386
You crazy punk.

182
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:30,289
You should've called me
if you couldn't come to work.

183
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,558
Why didn't you call?
Are your fingers broken?

184
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,860
What are you doing here?

185
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,463
And you should clear these right away
so other customers can sit.

186
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,432
Are you trying to ruin the business?

187
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,402
Leave me alone.
You're disrupting business.

188
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,671
Are you in your right mind,

189
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,239
not showing up to work for days?

190
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,076
He's not even your brother,
but someone from school.

191
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,344
Why are you running his stand?

192
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,948
How did you know that?
Did you have someone investigate me?

193
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,252
I went all the way to your house
on top of the hill.

194
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,591
-Why didn't you answer your phone?
-I dropped it in the soup. So what?

195
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,327
Were you worried about me?

196
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,862
Like hell.

197
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:15,000
What kind of friend is he
that you would quit your job to do this?

198
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,969
An upperclassman from the wrestling team.

199
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,205
He took care of me
when things were hard for me.

200
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,174
-He's my favorite upperclassman--
-Chicken feet please.

201
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,209
-Okay.
-Okay!

202
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,244
Coming right up. Go make it.

203
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,245
I'll make it right now.

204
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:33,652
What's that smell?

205
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,591
Wow, that looks really delicious.

206
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,393
Eun-sae loves chicken feet.

207
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:45,798
No way. Eun-sae eat chicken feet?

208
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,300
Welcome.

209
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,102
-Really?
-Go cook.

210
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:51,971
What should I do?

211
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,007
-What would you like, sir?
-Soju please.

212
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,108
Soju.

213
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,558
Your girlfriend is late today.

214
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,266
Hello? What's up, mister?

215
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,401
Where are you right now?

216
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,470
I'm in the neighborhood. Why?

217
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,341
Well, it's just that...
Sweeper can't wait to see you.

218
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:34,380
Actually, I want to see you
more than he does.

219
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,818
I'll be there as soon as I'm done
with my milk route.

220
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,853
Okay. I'll be waiting.

221
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,388
Okay.

222
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:48,561
Okay, I'll be waiting

223
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:53,299
He's waiting for me

224
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,705
Mister. This bean sprout soup
was really delicious.

225
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,310
You're a great cook
and you make good soup.

226
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,613
I'm so jealous of Girl B.

227
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,049
You shouldn't be.

228
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,351
Guy A is so narrow-minded.

229
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,053
Here's dessert.

230
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,890
-Let's go outside.
-Okay.

231
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:24,163
It's not easy to take back
a girlfriend who left you.

232
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:29,168
I think Guy A is
a nearly perfect boyfriend.

233
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,306
Be careful.

234
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,145
This is so nice.

235
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:47,486
-Having fun?
-Yes. Giddyap.

236
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,690
You're the first visitor I've had
that climbed on that.

237
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,859
Why? It's really fun.

238
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,728
I don't know. They just look at it.

239
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,297
You should get on too.

240
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,135
How's work?

241
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,737
It's fun.

242
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,840
But my boss can be so mean.

243
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,211
Is it all right if I complain
about your cousin?

244
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,481
Why? Is Guy 1 mean to Girl 2?

245
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,317
No.

246
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,821
There's this big, lug of an employee
who's really timid.

247
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,324
He's so timid,
he couldn't ask for time off, and said,

248
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:27,059
"I need to quit work
because something came up,"

249
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:27,993
and he just let him go.

250
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,662
What a big jerk.

251
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:34,099
Han-gyeol can be like that sometimes.

252
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,370
But as time passes,
you'll see that he's actually a great guy.

253
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,206
I don't know if I'll ever see that.

254
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,877
Okay.

255
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,846
Isn't it difficult to pretend to be a guy?

256
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,783
No. I'm quite good at it.

257
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,253
Don't you think I look like a guy?

258
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,423
No. You look like a girl
no matter how I look at you.

259
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:03,295
I get tons of chocolates from girls
on Valentines Day,

260
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,198
but never from guys.

261
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,202
I wouldn't like me
if I were a guy, either.

262
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,639
How could they not recognize
what a pretty girl you are?

263
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:15,674
You look pretty to me.

264
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,081
You're so frank. Thanks.

265
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,086
Oh, right. Would you like to
go to a party with me

266
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,687
next week?

267
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,656
It's an opening gala for an art exhibit.

268
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,624
I would appreciate it if you'd go with me.

269
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,427
I don't know much about art.

270
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,597
You don't have to go if you don't want to.

271
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,865
That's not it.

272
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,433
Why would I not want to go?

273
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,035
I love parties.

274
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,505
But the way I look...

275
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,676
You might not know it,

276
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,245
but women love that kind of thing.

277
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,848
An opening gala for an art exhibit.

278
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,018
My heart's pounding

279
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,753
just thinking about it.

280
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,958
But I'm so ugly that I'll embarrass you
if I go with you.

281
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,094
Hey. If that's why you don't want to go,
go with me.

282
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,598
Are you sure you won't be embarrassed?

283
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,700
Of course. Don't you know
how pretty you are?

284
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,542
Okay, then I'll try my best to be pretty
so that you won't be embarrassed.

285
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,977
I promise.

286
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,313
So don't worry.

287
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,250
-Okay.
-All right.

288
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,018
You know what?

289
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,257
You have a talent
for making people feel good.

290
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,561
Thank you.

291
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,969
How is business?

292
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,638
Business isn't so good.

293
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,973
I know what you mean.

294
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,912
Hi, Angel. I made chicken feet,
your favorite.

295
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,146
Where are you?

296
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,184
Try guessing where your angel might be.

297
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,855
I'm somewhere that you can never come.

298
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,823
Where are you?

299
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,125
I would go to the ends of the earth
in order to see you.

300
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,260
I'm at the women's bathhouse.

301
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,729
Try coming here, why don't you?

302
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,668
I'm going in.

303
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,381
My angel.

304
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,984
I brought you chicken feet and gizzards.

305
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,524
Hey. What are you doing here with Eun-sae?

306
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,660
Huh? This is the women's bathhouse.

307
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,597
And what's that on your shoulder?

308
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,700
That's a bra strap.

309
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,602
Oh, dang. This isn't good.

310
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:57,669
You take care of this.

311
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,605
Why me? Not my problem.

312
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:01,673
-Whatever.
-Hey, Angel.

313
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,844
-What the...
-Shit.

314
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,347
What the heck are you, asshole?
What's with the bra strap?

315
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,828
But I saw you take a whiz standing up.

316
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,963
Take your time.

317
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,802
I even kissed you.

318
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,573
Is there anything you didn't do?

319
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,609
But then again, you even made deliveries
to the men's bathhouse.

320
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,745
I really had no choice.

321
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,680
Still. How could you pretend to be a guy?

322
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,815
I would die
before pretending to be a girl.

323
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,984
Like anyone would believe it if you tried.

324
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,924
You like Eun-sae, don't you?

325
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,961
Is it a bad thing for you
that I'm not her boyfriend?

326
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,796
That's one less rival for you.

327
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,400
Plus, I'm Eun-sae's older sister.

328
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,274
I've grown fond of you.

329
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,043
Especially after that tent bar.

330
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:14,213
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

331
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,818
You want to keep seeing Eun-sae,
don't you?

332
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:20,919
Yeah.

333
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,554
Not, "Yeah." Say, "Yes, ma'am."

334
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,557
Yes, ma'am.

335
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,359
Now, listen to me carefully.

336
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,162
Say, "Yes, ma'am."

337
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,965
-Yes, ma'am.
-Good boy.

338
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,307
You're eyes are all bloodshot.
What are you doing at night?

339
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,876
Min-yeop's running a tent bar

340
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,579
for his friend who's very sick.

341
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:52,417
Good. It's better to run a tent bar
than be an employee at a cafe.

342
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,319
Do you really not care
how Min-yeop's doing?

343
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,454
No.

344
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,489
How can you be so heartless?

345
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,591
Didn't you know that I was heartless?

346
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,828
Gross.

347
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,229
Mr. Hong says not to flush

348
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,832
after taking a dump
because we have no water.

349
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,700
They say it will be back
two days from now.

350
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,135
Why don't we close the shop?

351
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,938
We can't close already. We just opened.

352
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,539
We'll use bottled water.

353
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,008
Do the dishes, flush the toilet,

354
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,544
and mop the floor with bottled water.
You're so wise.

355
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:20,712
He has a point.

356
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,782
We have no water, it's hot,
and there are no customers.

357
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,018
Think of this as an opportunity.

358
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,153
Let's take this opportunity

359
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,191
and go on a trip together.
A team building trip.

360
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,626
Sounds good.

361
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,428
Min-yeop would have loved to go.

362
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,865
Ms. Han,

363
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:44,503
you use mother-of-pearl
in many of your works.

364
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,905
Where did you get the idea for that?

365
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,041
Well, mother-of-pearl is a material

366
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,543
that I was very familiar with
since childhood.

367
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,278
She's not as pretty as they say.

368
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,881
Still, I heard her sponsor was DK.

369
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,949
No wonder she has so much backing.

370
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,318
But I heard that they broke up.

371
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,385
Really?

372
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,689
Many of the decorative items

373
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,225
around the house had mother-of-pearl.

374
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,400
You should have told me that you were sick
instead of suffering alone.

375
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,673
This is mustard soup.
It's perfect when you have the chills.

376
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,176
How did you know I was sick?

377
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,579
I could tell by the way you said,
"I'm all right," on the phone yesterday.

378
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:29,715
I said I was fine. This wasn't necessary.

379
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,650
Will it kill you to say thanks?

380
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,092
This is so warm.

381
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:45,530
Are you going to come?

382
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,702
I can't go to the opening gala
but I'll go the next day.

383
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,909
You have a fever.

384
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,247
Have you always been so charming?

385
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,016
You smell nice

386
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,852
and you even shaved.

387
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,255
Don't. You're making my heart pound.

388
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,026
Where did you learn to cook this?

389
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,461
You're a man of many talents.

390
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,130
Why isn't Han-sung here?

391
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,665
Shouldn't he be taking care of you?

392
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:21,867
Did you guys fight?

393
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:23,735
I wonder.

394
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:29,341
I think so since he hasn't
called for three days.

395
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,776
Why?

396
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,445
What was the fight about?

397
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,080
It's nothing.

398
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,382
You should get going.

399
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,050
A little later.

400
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,420
I want to lie down, that's why.

401
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:45,757
Go. Please?

402
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:49,327
Take your medicine.

403
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,931
Of course, I even went to the hospital
and got a shot.

404
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:54,933
Okay.

405
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,036
You're good at doing things alone.

406
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,907
I can't do anything to help
even though I want to.

407
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,542
It's deflating.

408
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,077
I'm off.

409
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,880
See you later.

410
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,402
...after the tone.

411
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,573
Do you know that Yoo-joo is sick?

412
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,777
She seemed to be waiting for you.

413
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,851
I know that it's none of my business,
but you should take care of her.

414
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,388
They don't have any skewers here.

415
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,590
You can eat them later.

416
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,825
-Why don't you order an omelet roll?
-Yes.

417
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,427
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

418
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,930
-Soju and an omelet roll, please?
-Soju and an omelet roll?

419
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,367
-Yes.
-Soju and an omelet roll, please.

420
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:03,335
Okay.

421
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:05,804
What are you doing here?

422
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,241
You should be at the cafe.

423
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,744
I'm not the one
who should be at the cafe, you are.

424
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,614
You're always going to meet girls.

425
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,082
Why you...

426
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:20,352
What are you doing here, boss?

427
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,621
Tell me whether or not
you'll keep working at the cafe.

428
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:27,325
Well, I don't think
I'm of much help there,

429
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:31,129
-but it's the first job I ever got--
-Excuse me.

430
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,964
Where are our soju and omelet roll?

431
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,432
Do you know how to cook an omelet?

432
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,602
No? Are you serious? Can you do anything?

433
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:38,870
What, can you make it?

434
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,872
No.

435
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,174
How are you two running a tent bar?

436
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,342
Where are the eggs?

437
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,080
Happy birthday to you

438
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,283
Happy birthday to you

439
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,286
Happy birthday dear Jo

440
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,656
Happy birthday to you

441
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,561
-No! Don't go!
-Hey!

442
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,234
You all right?

443
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:25,850
NO PARKING

444
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,987
Are you all right, boss?

445
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,092
You ran out before I could stop you.

446
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,896
-It's not like I wanted to.
-Thank you.

447
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,497
This is for you.

448
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,967
It's all right. Take it.

449
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,402
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

450
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,503
Thank you very much.

451
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,440
-Have a nice evening. Goodbye. Here.
-Let's get going.

452
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,045
Are you crazy?
Were you trying to get yourself killed?

453
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,448
You overreacted.

454
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,752
It hurts.

455
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:06,024
Are you stupid or something?
Don't you know that you're bleeding?

456
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,629
That's why you shouldn't
have tackled me like that.

457
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,998
Were you filming an action movie
or something?

458
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,935
Don't worry. It will be fine in a day.

459
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,908
Hey. Where's the nearest hospital?

460
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:38,990
Drink some of this.

461
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,599
Were you very sick?

462
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,771
About this sick?

463
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,641
You still have a fever.

464
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,944
It came down. It was a lot worse earlier.

465
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,479
So why did you drink wine?

466
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,381
I just had one glass to help me sleep.

467
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,523
Why didn't you call me?

468
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,894
That is...

469
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:25,370
It's hard for me to bear
that you love your art more than me.

470
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,840
I suck, don't I?

471
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,575
A little.

472
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:44,689
You know, we must be made for each other.

473
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,659
I suck too.

474
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:58,903
When you told your friends
that I don't believe in marriage,

475
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:02,073
I was scared
that you were pushing me away.

476
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,375
And when you didn't call,

477
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,545
instead of calling you,

478
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,948
I stubbornly waited

479
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:15,019
until you gave in and called me.

480
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,390
And when you give in like this,
I get happy like a child.

481
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,627
I really suck, don't I?

482
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,230
Yeah, you do.

483
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,835
How about a kiss
if you're not angry at me anymore?

484
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,079
Let's get some ice on your head.
Hold on for a sec.

485
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,418
-Are you going to sleep over?
-Yeah. I think so.

486
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,390
TRADITIONAL MEDICINE CLINIC

487
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:57,095
You're even more hurt than I am.

488
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,597
Does it hurt?

489
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:00,965
No, it doesn't.

490
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:04,402
Why don't you say it hurts

491
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:09,307
and save that macho stuff
for your girlfriend?

492
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,608
It hurts.

493
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:18,650
When I was eight years old,

494
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:25,156
I was fooling around
on the third floor terrace and fell.

495
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,093
So that's why you're so screwed up.

496
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,068
But my dad caught me with both arms.

497
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,873
He fell as he did and broke his arm,

498
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,778
but he didn't even realize he was hurt
and rushed me to the hospital.

499
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:51,149
You reminded me of that.

500
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,052
You were kind of cool today.

501
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:59,557
By the way, why are you always
trying to help other people out?

502
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,961
You helped Ha-rim find a place to live,
and help Min-yeop with the tent bar.

503
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:04,829
Why are you like that?

504
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,497
I don't know if you know this,

505
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:09,934
but there's a little thing called loyalty
between people.

506
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:11,803
Loyalty?

507
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,571
Yeah, loyalty.

508
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,075
I don't know much about loyalty.

509
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,177
Then why did you go to Min-yeop?

510
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,981
That's because it's so difficult
to get good help these days.

511
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:26,684
You're a loyal person.

512
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,187
Or you wouldn't have saved me today.

513
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,922
It's not like you love me.

514
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:33,858
Get some sleep.

515
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,693
Your eyes are heavy with sleep.

516
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,062
Okay.

517
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,567
I set the alarm
so let's get an hour of sleep.

518
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:02,487
Oh, dear. That scorching sun is burning
into the depths of my soul.

519
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,223
-Oh, my god! What the heck?
-Ji-hyang!

520
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,292
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

521
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,428
The water must have thought
you were a flower.

522
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,197
Can't you stop with the flirting for once?

523
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,833
Anyway, it will all be just guys...

524
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,536
Don't worry about it. It's just one night.

525
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,938
Are you going somewhere?

526
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,105
A team building trip.

527
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:24,609
-I'll see you later.
-Okay. Be careful! You'll fall!

528
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,513
The owner of the rice store
told me that you're going

529
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:33,217
on a blind date with Mr. Park who owns
the toilet store. Tell me it isn't true.

530
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,487
That's none of your business, Mr. Gu.

531
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,323
Out of my way. I have to go to the market.

532
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,058
The market? I was on my way there myself.

533
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:44,329
Let's go together.
Wait a minute. Wait. Stop. Wait.

534
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,870
Did you book the condo?

535
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,507
We don't even have the funds
to go on a trip.

536
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,777
We already agreed to go
so just shut up and get in.

537
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,612
You're such a nag.

538
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,315
What are you looking at? Get in.

539
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:05,883
Han-gyeol, relax.

540
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,652
Mr. Hong said
that he'll take care of everything

541
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,619
so let's just trust him.

542
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:11,389
and have a fun time. Come on. Get in.

543
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,625
Don't think of going wild there.
We have to come back early and work.

544
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,963
Hey. What took you so long?
You live nearby.

545
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:23,301
I was so excited about going on the trip
that I couldn't sleep. I'm so tired.

546
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,873
Okay. We're off.

547
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,408
So where are we going?

548
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,777
-Where to?
-Let's just go.

549
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,288
These are so pretty. Are they organic?

550
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,024
Will you please stop touching them!

551
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,559
Why are you shouting at me?

552
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,428
How can I not shout at you?

553
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,631
Stop touching them
if you're not going to buy them!

554
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,367
Why are you looking for organic
at a street market?

555
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,971
Why I never.
I'm not going to buy anything.

556
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,707
Where do you think you're going?

557
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:05,910
You need to buy everything you touched!

558
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,980
-How much is it? Will 1,000 won do? Here.
-What?

559
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,549
How could 1,000 won cover everything?

560
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,918
Look at how many you touched!

561
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,020
What are you trying to do? Ruin me?

562
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,955
-What the...
-What's the matter with you?

563
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,859
How dare you grab
her delicate arm like that

564
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,694
with that big hand of yours?

565
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:27,098
-You big bully of a woman.
-Fine. I'm a bully. So what is it to you?

566
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,668
-I'm having a bad day as is! Get out!
-What... Stop that.

567
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,971
Get lost!

568
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,646
All women scare me other than you.

569
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,216
It was like a bull was charging at me.
She wasn't a woman.

570
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,952
She was just a strong organism.

571
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,722
I can't believe what just happened.

572
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:55,927
Someone classy like you
shouldn't deal with them.

573
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,795
Drop the empty praise.

574
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:02,266
It's the truth.
You're beautiful and graceful.

575
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,770
You look exactly like Sophia Lauren.

576
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,506
That's what my late husband used to say.

577
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,109
How I miss him.

578
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:13,511
Don't get sad on me.

579
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:19,984
Why don't we go catch a movie?
It would cheer you up.

580
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:21,719
Shall we?

581
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,759
By the way, I've heard
some pretty bad things about Mr. Park,

582
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:29,994
the owner of the toilet store.

583
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,664
Even though he seems rich,
he's neck deep in debt

584
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,600
and his face is pockmarked

585
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,903
with scars here and there.

586
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:43,141
You don't need to say that.
What kind of man would want me?

587
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,509
Why wouldn't they?

588
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,947
Mr. Gu, isn't our mom pretty?

589
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:54,051
Yes. Your mother is beautiful.

590
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:56,888
Mom, I don't mind if you get a boyfriend

591
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,689
or even get married.

592
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:02,994
You staying single would be a tragedy
for single men everywhere.

593
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:07,231
Stop. Stop eating ice cream
and eat real food.

594
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:10,468
-Mr. Gu.
-Yes?

595
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,205
I won't let my mom marry a man
who doesn't have much money.

596
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:21,412
Your daughter scares me sometimes.

597
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,314
Sometimes?

598
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:25,616
She scares me all the time.

599
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:35,626
When will we be able to see the sea?

600
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,528
I never said we were going to the sea.

601
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:42,400
Are we going to the mountains then?
Either is fine.

602
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:59,417
Since when were you so nice to Eun-chan?

603
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,686
Quiet. Keep it down.

604
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:02,753
Crazy bastard...

605
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:24,875
-Oh, my. Long time no see.
-It has been so long.

606
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,946
-It's nice to see you, ma'am.
-It's nice to see you too.

607
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,749
You've brought so many workers with you.

608
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:32,883
You know how popular I am.

609
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,719
I really appreciate this.

610
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,788
You're welcome. I just hope that
we can be of help to you.

611
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,924
I'm sure you'll be a big help.

612
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,659
All we ask is that you feed us.

613
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,895
Don't worry. I'll cook up
a storm for you, Mr. Hong.

614
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,033
What the heck?
Did you bring us here to work?

615
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,768
I'm sorry.

616
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:53,537
-Okay?
-Jeez. This is so annoying.

617
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,239
-Mr. Hong.
-Yes?

618
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:56,507
Where are we?

619
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,443
This is a friend's orchard.

620
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,647
The cost of apples is so low this year
that he doesn't have money to hire anyone.

621
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,583
We should help each other out.

622
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,686
I should have known when he volunteered
to plan the trip. Look at this place.

623
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,789
There aren't any girls here.
I vote that we leave.

624
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:15,893
I guess working together would be
good for increasing teamwork.

625
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,429
-Have fun.
-Where are you going?

626
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,364
He's slinking off somewhere.

627
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:21,699
Let's get to work.

628
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:24,535
-Let's go.
-Where are you going?

629
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,104
So, what should we do?

630
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,808
Young man.

631
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,243
It's a good thing I ran into you.

632
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,478
I have to use the bathroom right now.

633
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,581
You know the stand on the road
where I'm selling apples, right?

634
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,284
Could you watch it for a minute?
I'll be back in a jiffy.

635
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,421
Wait. Ma'am.

636
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:48,025
-Take a box and disperse.
-All right. Let's go.

637
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,329
What are we going to pick?

638
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,698
WE SELL APPLES

639
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:57,768
Mister. How much are these apples?

640
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:00,538
I'm not the owner...

641
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,350
Want an apple? Mister,
I would like two apples, please.

642
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,352
Two apples?

643
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,358
That's 1,000 won.

644
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,460
-Come on. Just take 500 won.
-But it's 1,000 won.

645
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,104
WE SELL APPLES

646
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,573
WE SELL APPLES

647
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,008
We sell apples. We sell delicious apples.

648
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,545
We sell delicious apples.

649
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:50,788
-Hello.
-Hello.

650
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,524
Wow, apples!

651
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,426
How much are these apples?

652
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,194
Can I try them?

653
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,099
These apples are delicious.

654
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,303
I'll take ten.

655
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,913
Goodbye.

656
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,515
Bye.

657
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,383
Have a nice day!

658
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,489
-How many would you like, sir?
-Actually, could I take a look at those?

659
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,057
-These?
-Yes.

660
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,193
-You want a lot?
-That's it.

661
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,132
That's the last of it.

662
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,867
-Those are 20 boxes, right?
-Yes.

663
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:14,972
Thank you. Have a nice day.

664
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,713
I'm sorry I'm late. My daughter called.

665
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,649
It's all right. Selling apples
was a lot more fun than I thought.

666
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:32,189
Where are all the apples
that used to be here?

667
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,492
Oh, those? I sold them all.

668
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,760
What?

669
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,533
What can we do about it? He didn't know.

670
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,935
He worked hard selling them.

671
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,506
Couldn't you hold it back in, woman?

672
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,574
Why can't you do anything right?

673
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:58,015
At that price, you practically gave
those grade A apples away.

674
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:00,618
I'm so sorry.

675
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,754
I'll compensate you.

676
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:08,325
There's no need.
You were only trying to help.

677
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:10,761
Anyway, what will you do,
now that the apples

678
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,196
you need to deliver to your client

679
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,065
tomorrow morning are gone?
You'll lose credibility.

680
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,934
There's nothing I can do about that.

681
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,972
So, you need 20 boxes? You just
need them by tomorrow morning, right?

682
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,213
How will we pick 20 boxes
of grade-A apples by then?

683
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:32,216
There are 6 of us
and we'll pick them in no time.

684
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,220
Let's experience the joy of labor.

685
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,325
Boss. Everybody makes mistakes.

686
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,161
Cheer up.

687
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:46,730
Boss.

688
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,026
Don't touch me. Jeez.

689
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,052
We came to pick apples,
but we're eating more

690
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,288
Eating more

691
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,656
Awesome.

692
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,257
I'll take that.

693
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,898
What’s this? When did you pick
all these apples? Oh, my.

694
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,266
We broke our backs picking these.

695
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,068
Wow, Gye-sik. Good work.

696
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,538
-Wow. Good work, everyone. Good work.
-Hey.

697
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,807
Thank you.

698
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,450
See any fish?

699
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,820
No. I don't see any... Here they are.

700
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,458
Sorry about my mistake today.

701
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:23,494
Thank you.

702
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,966
Hey, everyone. Han-gyeol just apologized.

703
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,271
-Wow, he apologized!
-It's cold.

704
00:44:45,916 --> 00:44:49,486
Hey! Stop!

705
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,257
-Why?
-Go over there and pee.

706
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,926
-Go up.
-Where?

707
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,929
That idiot. He had better not
blow my cover.

708
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,201
Be careful.

709
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,811
You should have left that beehive alone.

710
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:18,549
Those bastards abandoned me
and hightailed it out of there. Traitors.

711
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,584
You shouldn't have dragged us
there in the first place.

712
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:24,154
Idiot. I told him that it was a beehive.

713
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,557
Did you just rag on me in Japanese again?

714
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,292
Look over this way.

715
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:40,270
There was once a lady

716
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,905
That sounds lame.

717
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:48,011
There was once a lady

718
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,714
Oh, my angel.

719
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,050
Hey. Mr. Hong is singing about his angel.
Pipe down.

720
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:56,253
There was once a lady

721
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,354
Cheers.

722
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:02,626
There was once a man who loved the lady

723
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:07,264
She had pink nails and white teeth

724
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,199
You put it on.

725
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,872
That beautiful lady

726
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:20,878
That man loves only her

727
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:26,416
He made aromatic coffee for her

728
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:31,755
The man loves the woman

729
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:36,193
The man loves the woman

730
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:40,998
-Hey!
-The man loves the woman

731
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:45,936
-Sing along.
-The man still loves

732
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,640
Hey!

733
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,476
Go to sleep already.

734
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:57,648
Where did the couple's son
hang himself from? Was it here,

735
00:46:58,215 --> 00:46:59,349
or was it here?

736
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,989
Wait. Mr. Hong.

737
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:07,858
I'm tired.

738
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:09,092
-I'm spent.
-What the...

739
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,761
-Me too. Aren't you going?
-Boss.

740
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:14,131
After I finish this beer.

741
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,703
Really? I can't go if my Chan's not going.

742
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,875
-Have you known the boss for very long?
-What?

743
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:30,714
When and how did he meet
the woman he's in love with?

744
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,117
Do I look like a big mouth?

745
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,254
No. Just curious.

746
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,891
Han-gyeol's a romantic at heart.

747
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,627
He's harbored a crush
on the same woman for nine years.

748
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:47,097
I could never be like that.

749
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,467
That's as much as I tell you. Cheers.

750
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,385
This is nice. This is so nice.
This feels great.

751
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:51,128
What are you doing walking around
with that thing over your head?

752
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,697
Did you think I was a ghost or something?

753
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:57,801
Hey! Come over here.

754
00:48:58,669 --> 00:49:00,537
-Why?
-Come over here and stand guard.

755
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,742
-Are you taking a dump?
-Can't you tell?

756
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,844
You were too scared to take a dump.

757
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:09,880
Don't go anywhere.

758
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:12,749
Are you constipated?

759
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:29,199
One woman... You could get sick
harboring something like that for so long.

760
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:31,568
-Nine years...
-There's nothing I can do about it.

761
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:35,539
You should try your best and let go.
Just squeeze it out.

762
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,341
You're so gross.

763
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,209
It is gross.

764
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,978
If you keep it in there, it will smell

765
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:42,946
and cause all sorts of diseases.

766
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,282
1 WOMAN 9 YEARS
HABIT

767
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:48,318
-Darn it.
-A habit.

768
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,688
I can't concentrate because of you.

769
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,961
That was close.

770
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,635
You should drink lots of barley tea.
It's good for constipation.

771
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,479
It's so nice to lie here in the breeze.

772
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,549
I wish I could suck each of those stars
with a straw and eat them.

773
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,885
Why don't you just shove them all
in your mouth?

774
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,821
I want to savor them.

775
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:28,125
Then how would you eat that moon?

776
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,161
Since there's only half of it right now,

777
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:34,164
I would wait for it until it was full

778
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,066
and steam it.

779
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,935
It must be nice to see everything as food.

780
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:44,141
Are you really going to go to the US
when our revenues increase?

781
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:47,177
Can you really go after three months?

782
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,378
Why don't we make a bet?

783
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,113
You shouldn't bet on something like that.

784
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:54,951
But bets are nice.
They're a good way to test yourself.

785
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,255
Why do you want to make life
more complicated?

786
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:02,092
I've had enough tests
during my 12 years in school.

787
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,960
I don't need more.

788
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:12,302
I'll make something nice for you.

789
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,144
Wait. Don't look just yet.

790
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,248
Voila.

791
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:29,786
The Koh Eun-chan robot is here
to save Earth. It's for you.

792
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:34,124
Cool. You made that so quickly.

793
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,962
Wasn't today really tiring?

794
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:42,833
Oh, dear.

795
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,036
That's why you should try
to help others out

796
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,204
when they make mistakes

797
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,039
instead of getting angry at them.

798
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:51,942
What are your dreams, Eun-chan?

799
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:58,215
I think my dream is to live happily
with my mom and sister.

800
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,120
When I was working at the taekwondo gym,
it was to become a master.

801
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:07,357
But nowadays,
I want to make delicious coffee.

802
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,894
These days,
everything looks like coffee to me.

803
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,563
I guess everything
would look like ribs to me

804
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,432
if I worked at a barbecue place.

805
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:19,069
Anyway, I don't know
if it's a dream or not,

806
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:23,106
but these days, I want to become someone
who makes delicious coffee.

807
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,409
How about you?

808
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,844
Me?

809
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,216
I want to see
only the things I want to see,

810
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,819
and not what I don't want to see,

811
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,256
and live a happy and fun life.

812
00:52:40,223 --> 00:52:41,358
How about your habit?

813
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,631
You don't seem to be very happy
when you're with the woman you like.

814
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,033
What do you like so much about her?

815
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:52,802
Is it because she's pretty?

816
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,938
The reason I like her?

817
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,208
I could give you a million reasons.

818
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:03,180
A million reasons? How corny.

819
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:09,719
You're right.
I don't have a million reasons.

820
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:11,955
I just like her, that's all.

821
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,593
I want to stop liking her, but I can't.

822
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,428
That's why I keep liking her,

823
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,400
thinking I'll get better with time.

824
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,872
It's out of your control?
That sounds frightening.

825
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:39,416
Don't sleep.
The mosquitoes will eat you alive.

826
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:43,820
Hey. Did you drug the barley tea?
Why am I so sleepy?

827
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:45,422
Get up.

828
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:46,823
Hey.

829
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,493
Didn't you tell me
you couldn't sleep anywhere

830
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,662
except in your own home?

831
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:04,174
Goodnight, Mr. Romantic. Goodnight.

832
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:23,326
What a beautiful day.

833
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:29,799
This is the money for the apples.
Could you give it to your friend for me?

834
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,003
-Here's the money for the apples.
-Are you mad?

835
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,772
-Then should I pay them for their labor?
-Hey.

836
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,441
You really don't have to.

837
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:43,079
Thank you. We had fun.
You didn't have to give us so many apples.

838
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,514
Then just leave them behind.

839
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:47,150
Why don't you buy a few boxes?

840
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:48,985
Apples are great for constipation.

841
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:50,620
Stop it, will you?

842
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,789
They say an apple a day
keeps the doctor away.

843
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,993
How much are the apples?

844
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:01,564
Goodbye.

845
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:07,304
It will be a hit to serve apples
along with the coffee in the mornings.

846
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,306
You with all your cheap tricks.

847
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,708
It's the coffee that should
draw in customers.

848
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:15,245
Sure. I knew you would make
a snide comment.

849
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,247
How much did you pay for the apples?

850
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,983
I gave them
a little more than the usual price.

851
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,652
Fifty won per apple is just too cheap.

852
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:28,425
It must be so frustrating for farmers.
They barely make enough to make ends meet.

853
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:32,896
Do I detect a heart?

854
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,631
Punk.

855
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,734
Excuse me.

856
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:42,105
-What the heck?
-There's no room!

857
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:43,506
There's no room!

858
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,676
I get carsick.

859
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:52,148
-I'll feel better if I sit in the middle.
-Of all the...

860
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,918
Did I do good?

861
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,921
You smell. Gross.

862
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:13,970
Who? The musician?

863
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:17,107
No. It's someone else.

864
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,975
What is it with you and older guys?

865
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,212
What do you think about someone
saying that he can't help it?

866
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,314
You're confusing me again.

867
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,450
How could the same statement
sound so different?

868
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,518
What's this?

869
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,857
A habit. He can't help it...

870
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:39,162
A habit. He can't help it...

871
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:47,203
Hello? Hi, Mister.

872
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,607
You didn't forget about
our date tomorrow, did you?

873
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,677
I'll pick you up at around 2 p.m.

874
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,180
Are you sure I can wear just anything?

875
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,949
Sure. Just wear what you usually wear.

876
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,551
That's what I'm going to do.

877
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,019
But still.

878
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,623
It won't be easy, Mom.

879
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,659
We'll give it a shot anyway.

880
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:14,998
I told you it would be hard.

881
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,967
It's because we're not used to it.
If you keep looking at her...

882
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,636
She looks even weirder.

883
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:23,039
I think she looks a lot prettier
and more feminine than usual.

884
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:26,776
You're sure I don't look weird?

885
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,430
Hi.

886
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:55,305
I don't look good in dresses.
Is it strange?

887
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:58,942
Of course not. How can I put this?

888
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,545
It's a very unique look.

889
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:06,783
I borrowed my sister's dress
and she did my makeup.

890
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:11,488
You look dashing.

891
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,156
You look like a movie star.

892
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:16,426
Your carriage awaits, my lady.

893
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,323
I'm very sorry.

894
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,460
I'll send you the demo
by tomorrow afternoon.

895
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,897
Yes. I'm very sorry.

896
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:11,107
Hold on. I'll call you back
in a little while. Bye.

897
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,751
Have you seen Eun-chan anywhere?

898
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,720
Stop it.

899
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,713
Don't worry. No one will recognize you.

900
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,715
What in the world
am I doing to my breasts?

901
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:56,419
Prince? Anyway, we have a lot of dudes.

902
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:58,454
You've worked very hard the past month.

903
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,323
I hope you can be in
a good mood as you work.

904
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,958
Let me hug you.

905
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,127
Wait, Yoo-joo.

906
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:05,995
Mister. Do you have anything
I could change into?

907
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,463
You're making me jealous.

908
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:08,665
Please.

909
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:11,300
Ji-hyang. Let's go out.

910
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,303
Why does Guy 1
give Girl 2 such a hard time?

911
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,239
Does he have a crush on her?

912
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:19,042
Girl 2 is in love with someone.

913
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:46,602
