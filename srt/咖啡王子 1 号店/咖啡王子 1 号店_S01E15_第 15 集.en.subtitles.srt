1
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:34,868
Are you really going to stay here?

2
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,503
Yeah.

3
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,375
Are you really sure?

4
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,577
I'm going to get angry
if you ask me that one more time.

5
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,146
You've been asking me that
since yesterday.

6
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,552
-But are you--
-Yes! I'm sure!

7
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm really sure that I'm staying.

8
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,992
Are you really that happy
that I'm not going?

9
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,195
Sit down for a minute.

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,437
But it kind of gets to me
that you won't become a toy designer.

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,072
I thought that was your dream.

12
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,339
Maybe.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,442
I enjoyed toy designing

14
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,043
because it's something
that I could do alone

15
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,778
without the interference of others,

16
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:20,880
but business is fun, too.

17
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,317
It's nice to have so many people
come together to accomplish something.

18
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:25,952
That's fine too.

19
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,822
Meeting your grandma made me think that

20
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,425
I should become a really successful woman

21
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:33,993
so that I don't lag behind you.

22
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,465
Someone who doesn't just rely on others,
but someone who others can rely on.

23
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:39,833
That's what I'm going to do.

24
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,436
I'm going to work hard and give my mom
things she's wanted,

25
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,672
and be a sister that Eun-sae
can be proud of.

26
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,708
The meeting was constructive
for me in that sense.

27
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,045
Did you think only
about Eun-sae and your mom?

28
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,012
Then how about me?

29
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,148
Of course, I thought about you.

30
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,683
Do you have to ask?

31
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,384
But it's fun to ask you.

32
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:03,790
Anyway, what did your mom say
about me? How about Eun-sae?

33
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:06,192
Eun-sae? She thinks you're a jerk.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,363
And my mom is a little worried because
our family is so shabby compared to yours.

35
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,031
But I'm not worried about that at all.

36
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,070
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry
about my grandma.

37
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,338
It's all right.

38
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,473
I said some mean things about your grandma

39
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,376
in the restroom the other day.
I said, "She's such a big meanie!"

40
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,981
Let's go downstairs.
I'll make some iced coffee for you.

41
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,649
Really? All right!

42
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,986
She's not the type of girl to go out
with someone for their money.

43
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,755
She's a really nice kid.

44
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,859
But there's nothing about her to like.

45
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,395
She's not pretty, she doesn't come
from a good family.

46
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,364
There's nothing special about her.

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,866
So, how can you say
that she's such a nice person?

48
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,669
Even though she doesn't like to make
herself up, she's really pretty.

49
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:51,638
And you mentioned her family background.

50
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,140
Can't you tell her family background
just by looking at her character?

51
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,143
She's way ahead of Han-gyeol
in that department.

52
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,312
What? There's nothing wrong
with my grandson!

53
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,215
In all fairness, ma'am,

54
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,552
who do you think got your immature
grandson to settle down and shape up?

55
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,188
It was Eun-chan who acted as a bridge
between Han-gyeol and the employees

56
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:12,158
when Han-gyeol was finding it difficult
to fit in with them, and without Eun-chan,

57
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,461
we would never have been able
to triple your investment in three months!

58
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,800
You should be thanking that girl,
not be so jealous of her!

59
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,669
Who said I was jealous?

60
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,637
-Have you gone senile?
-What?

61
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,806
Didn't you try to buy Eun-chan off?

62
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,008
The fact that you're trying
to solve everything

63
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,711
with money shows that
you've gone completely senile.

64
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,813
I know that you think
you can do everything with money.

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,417
But Eun-chan's family would never accept
any of your money.

66
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,885
You should know that you're lucky!

67
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,187
Eun-chan is perfect to become
your granddaughter-in-law.

68
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,456
Eun-chan, my granddaughter-in-law!

69
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,593
How dare you say such a thing?

70
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,329
Well, I don't even know if Eun-chan's
interested in marriage.

71
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,030
It is Han-gyeol
who needs to get married soon.

72
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:51,965
What?

73
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,481
I like it. What do you think?

74
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:09,882
I don't think it's quite right.

75
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,385
How about we use a female vocalist?

76
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,786
What are you doing?

77
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,355
Take a look at this, Han-sung.

78
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,059
What do you think?

79
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,264
-He's so adorable!
-He's a complete charmer.

80
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,800
-Give me that. Let me take another look.
-No. Stop it!

81
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,003
If you're jealous,
ask Yoo-joo to hurry up and give birth.

82
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,238
The baby won't come out faster
by rushing her. Let me see that!

83
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,473
Just tell it to come out quickly!

84
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,375
-Give me that. Let me take another look!
-No!

85
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,576
Stingy fella!

86
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,012
I've been experiencing
such bad luck these days.

87
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:42,715
A couple of days ago, my mother-in-law
who has Alzheimer's pulled me by the hair,

88
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,485
the day before yesterday,
my brother-in-law came

89
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,253
begging to me to pay off his debts.

90
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,322
You shouldn't get married, dear.

91
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,558
You should lead a free life,
working and traveling as you please.

92
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,595
How can you say that when you married
four times yourself, Mom?

93
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,964
Your work will be affected
by your marriage.

94
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,799
You'll have to take care
of all the family affairs,

95
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,434
and work hard
to please your parents-in-law.

96
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,270
Has Han-sung told you
your past boyfriends don't matter to him?

97
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,405
Don't ever believe that.

98
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,673
When you begin living with him,

99
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:09,175
he'll bring up your past boyfriends
all the time.

100
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:12,345
I don't think you can deal with that.

101
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,881
Of course, I can deal with that.
Why couldn't I?

102
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,616
Are you really thinking about marriage?

103
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:17,817
Has Han-sung proposed to you?

104
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:22,188
You should just marry him
if he's proposed to you.

105
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,358
I thought you didn't want me
to get married.

106
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,727
I was just being facetious, dear.

107
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,662
But two is always better than one.

108
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,131
People can't live by themselves.

109
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,435
It's nice to have someone to lean on.

110
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,171
And by compromising as you live together,

111
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,239
you'll become a much better
and more thoughtful person.

112
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,809
Just look at how much
more relaxed I've become.

113
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,411
I only wish that I hadn't put on
so much weight.

114
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,282
-You should eat. Your food's getting cold.
-Okay. Let's eat, dear.

115
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,019
Anyways, what in the world
is keeping her so long?

116
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,455
Mrs. Choi! Are you coming out
within this decade?

117
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,757
I'm done! I'm sorry I'm coming out!

118
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,460
Don't hurry her like that.
The boss will kill you if he finds out.

119
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,262
It's so difficult to be considerate
of the boss's wife these days.

120
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,466
What's the matter, Min-yeop?

121
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,235
Why the sour expression?

122
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,604
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,473
I'll change in the restroom
starting tomorrow.

124
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,508
I think it would be better
if we changed in the restroom.

125
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,877
That would be better if we don't want
Han-gyeol to kick our butts.

126
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,645
God damn it!

127
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,815
What's wrong with him?

128
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,853
Oh! My sweet Chan!

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,289
-I mean, Mrs. Choi!
-Yeah?

130
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,192
I see you've been smiling

131
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,027
since Han-gyeol said
that he won't go to America.

132
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,832
If you have any questions about kissing

133
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,637
and making out with Han-gyeol,

134
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:49,475
feel free to ask for my advice. Oh my!

135
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,144
Hey!

136
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,745
If you do that one more time,

137
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,380
I will report you for sexual harassment.

138
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,882
How could you say that?

139
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,184
All I'm doing is trying to help you out.

140
00:06:58,651 --> 00:06:59,819
Help me out?

141
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,191
Ha-rim, can you show me your butt?

142
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,560
-I want to see your Playboy bunny!
-Stop it!

143
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,529
I want to see that Playboy bunny
on your butt!

144
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,439
Just what do you think you're doing?

145
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,943
I just need to finish
putting this poster up.

146
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,977
Have you eaten?

147
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,313
I've cooked kimchi stew for you.

148
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:41,627
Go back to your parents.

149
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,095
I don't want your parents to think of me

150
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,364
as an evil seductress
who seduced their precious son.

151
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,434
I've had enough of my husband
and your parents giving me a hard time.

152
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,270
Please go.

153
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,741
If you keep acting like this,
I'm going to disappear again.

154
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,112
Does it make you happy to have me
wander around, trying to avoid you?

155
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,817
I roasted some mackerel.
Doesn't it look good?

156
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,270
What are you doing?

157
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,873
Don't worry about it.
I'm just comfortable like this.

158
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,860
-Ow, jeez!
-Concentrate, will you?

159
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,969
Are you showing off
how long your legs are?

160
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,038
Yeah.

161
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:08,714
You want some more coffee?

162
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,616
No thanks.

163
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,486
Then how about ice cream?
Or you could brush your teeth

164
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,557
-or take a bath.
-No, no and no.

165
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,227
You're pretending to be
such a studious person.

166
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,296
I've been studying hard lately.

167
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,466
Is it fun?

168
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,435
This is the first time
I've ever found studying fun.

169
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,443
You want some ramen
or some kimchi fried rice?

170
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,812
No thanks.

171
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,683
Hey, why don't you look at me
when I talk to you?

172
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,685
Jeez, I have one page left.

173
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,588
But it's taken me 30 minutes get through
it because you've kept distracting me.

174
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,190
Darn. I should be getting back.

175
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,693
But you only just got here
a little while ago.

176
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,296
I wired the money to your account.

177
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:01,434
The money that I borrowed from you
before I started working at the shop.

178
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,603
But I've only been able
to come up with half of it.

179
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,439
I'll give you the rest
the month after next.

180
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,508
-And I'll add plenty of interest.
-What? Interest?

181
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,411
The closer you are, the more precise
you should be in monetary matters.

182
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,547
Hey, I never asked you for any interest.

183
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,283
You ditz! What do you think I am?
A loan shark?

184
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,451
Why would I want any interest?

185
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,387
Still, I want to be fair.

186
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,289
Then pay me back for everything!

187
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,092
Pay me back for all the money it cost me
to take you out to eat

188
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,294
and for the gas that it took
to drive you home every night!

189
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,063
Also, pay me back for the work I did
helping you clean up at the coffee shop.

190
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,965
And all the ramen
and coffee I've made for you!

191
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,200
You have to pay back everything.

192
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,002
Jeez, why are you acting
so angry all of a sudden?

193
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,004
I borrowed that money
before we were seeing each other.

194
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,839
And let's say that we were seeing
each other then.

195
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,641
Still, why shouldn't I pay you back?

196
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,944
It's not like I'm some charity case.

197
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,346
-Charity case? How could you say that?
-I'm leaving!

198
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,781
Don't you dare leave!

199
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,349
I'm not done talking to you!

200
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:55,921
Just sit down for a minute.

201
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,524
I know that you're independent

202
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,526
and that you're precise
when it comes to monetary stuff

203
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,694
but don't be like that with me.

204
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,729
I'll wire the money back
to your account tomorrow.

205
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,965
No. It's money I borrowed
from you so it's yours.

206
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,801
Would you take money from me?
Put yourself in my place!

207
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,604
What guy in his right mind would
take money from their hard off girlfriend?

208
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,906
They probably won't take the money
even if the girl wasn't poor!

209
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,007
Don't you take me so lightly!

210
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,342
I believe that even parents and kids

211
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,110
should pay back the money
they owe to each other.

212
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,779
It's not like I can't pay back the money,

213
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,714
and it's not like
I would go broke paying it back,

214
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,982
so why shouldn't it pay it back?

215
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,618
Stop acting like this!
I don't want your money!

216
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,486
But it makes me feel better
if I pay you back!

217
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,055
Why do you have to be so stubborn!

218
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,657
-Jeez! Anyways, I'm going home!
-Hey! Where do you think you're going!

219
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,692
You ditz! Stop right there!

220
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,895
One! Two! Two and a half! Three!
Hey! Freeze!

221
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,496
Hey! You didn't really leave, did you?

222
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,433
I know that you're outside my door!
Come in! Hey! Don't go!

223
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,509
Hey! One! Two! Two and a half!

224
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,744
Hey! Hello?

225
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,350
What are you smiling about?

226
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,524
They say pregnant women usually gain
around ten kilograms.

227
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,425
Can you imagine it?

228
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,596
So, you'll become like this, then?

229
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,332
This is pretty comfortable.

230
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,735
Your belly can act as
a book support later on.

231
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,236
Jeez!

232
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,174
Did you meet your mom?

233
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,679
Yeah. She said I shouldn't get married

234
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,514
because there isn't a man alive

235
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,082
who could bear living
with the likes of me.

236
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,985
Wait a minute. Hold on to this.

237
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:37,723
Here.

238
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,796
Am I that difficult to be with?

239
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,201
Well, once you start on a project,

240
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,438
you won't even think about coming out
for a month or two

241
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,007
and if there's a place you want to visit,

242
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,076
you'll visit it no matter what.

243
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,679
Also, you'll become interested
in other guys once in a while.

244
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,914
I think that's about it.

245
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,719
But I think I was able
to bear through all of that.

246
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,686
Is there anything else?

247
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,155
You're right.

248
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,190
Now here's a man who's able to bear me.

249
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:17,696
But your parents disapprove of me.

250
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,066
That kind of gets to me.

251
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,002
-Hold this for a sec.
-Okay.

252
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,614
Give me your hand.

253
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,390
Will you marry me?

254
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,061
How can you propose
with a cookie on my finger?

255
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:56,535
I want to raise our child
in a good environment.

256
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,205
So you want him to grow up with you,

257
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:03,242
the dad, and me, the mom, living together?

258
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,713
Will you give it some thought?

259
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,854
So you're not going to call me? Fine!

260
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,625
The customer cannot...

261
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,800
The customer's phone is turned off...

262
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,769
-It's turned off!
-and cannot be reached at the moment.

263
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,472
-Answer the phone! I'm counting to three!
-If you'd like to leave a message,

264
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:10,676
-One! Two! Two and a half! Three!
-please press one.

265
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,746
Jeez! What's going on?

266
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,749
Did she go home?

267
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,435
I bet her battery's dead.

268
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,511
Have you calmed down a little, Mr. Choi?

269
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:49,481
Oh, my! How many times has he called me?

270
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,117
I should text him.

271
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,188
I'm going to sleep.

272
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,726
I'll see you tomorrow.

273
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,332
Okay!

274
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,974
He's so stubborn.

275
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,505
-I'm...
-I'm...

276
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,842
-going to sleep.
-going to sleep?

277
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,944
See you tomorrow. Jerk.

278
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,847
She's playing with me, isn't she?

279
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,150
Damn it!

280
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,920
She insists on paying me back the money.

281
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,623
And not just the money she borrowed
from me but with interest too.

282
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,924
What a nut!

283
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,261
I should have just given her
a knock on the noggin!

284
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,263
That's nothing compared to my ordeal.

285
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,531
What do you mean?

286
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,567
I had to beat around the bush before
I proposed to the woman carrying my child

287
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,637
because I was afraid
that she'd get angry at me.

288
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:22,641
But she didn't even bother answering
my proposal. Just my luck!

289
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,909
What are you talking about?

290
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,379
-What?
-Look.

291
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,249
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY

292
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,889
-Is Yoo-joo pregnant?
-Yeah!

293
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,126
-Four weeks.
-Four weeks?

294
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,164
That's great, Han-sung!

295
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,203
-Let me see. So this is the baby?
-Take a look.

296
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,572
-So, where's the baby?
-The baby's here. Can't you see it?

297
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,407
Not really.

298
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,909
Come on, look. Isn't it cute?

299
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,244
Look at how happy you are.

300
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:04,616
But it'd be tragic if you had a daughter
and she took after you.

301
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,853
What? Hey!

302
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,523
I'm sure she'll take
after Yoo-joo if it's a girl.

303
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:15,694
I just wish Yoo-joo weren't so headstrong
and she would lean on me a little more.

304
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,297
But I know that
that's what makes Yoo-joo such a success.

305
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,599
So I guess I shouldn't wish
for my daughter to be any different.

306
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,069
I'm so jealous of you, Han-sung.

307
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,739
Why? Didn't you always say that
you didn't want any kids?

308
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,174
Did you change your mind?

309
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,478
I'm so in love with Eun-chan.
I want to live with her.

310
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,250
Jeez! You've really changed,
Han-gyeol! Wow!

311
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,853
I wonder if it's nice to be married.

312
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,988
I think it's better
to regret being married

313
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,490
-than regret not being married.
-I agree.

314
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,060
-I think it would be nice to get married.
-Exactly.

315
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,630
-What?
-It's nothing.

316
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,967
Marriage!

317
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,420
Eun-chan! Eun-sae!
Come downstairs and eat!

318
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,457
Eat? Oh, right. We have to eat breakfast.

319
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,031
Eun-chan, didn't Min-yeop
say something about me?

320
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,435
Why would he dare say anything
about you to me?

321
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,574
Jeez, his reaction is so slow considering
I even kissed him.

322
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,311
What? What did you say just now?

323
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,815
He hasn't already forgotten
the moist feeling of my lips, has he?

324
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:48,153
Hey! You're just a kid, and you did what?
I'm going to tell mom!

325
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,022
Don't you kiss your boyfriend?

326
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,824
That's not the same thing.

327
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,196
You're an 18-year-old high school student
and I'm a 24-year-old adult!

328
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,931
So, you and your boyfriend do kiss.

329
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,067
I'm coming down to eat, mom!

330
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,736
Hey! Eun-sae! Stop right there!

331
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,608
The brand image of the Coffee Prince
is centered around the barista.

332
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:13,512
The Coffee Prince is known
for coffee that's handmade

333
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,647
which is roasted and ground by a barista.

334
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,449
People come to our shop

335
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,585
'cause they respect and trust
the expertise of our barista.

336
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,353
Barista Hong Gye-sik

337
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,190
is what the brand image
of the 1st Coffee Prince is all about.

338
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,159
Simply put, the brand image
of the second Coffee Prince

339
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,227
will be that shop's barista.

340
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:31,997
The second concept is kind,
personalized service.

341
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:36,368
Although this doesn't sound like much,
in most of the large-scale coffee store

342
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,870
chains in Korea,
customers use self-service.

343
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,939
The biggest flaw of such service

344
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,175
is that there is no understanding
of the needs of the customer.

345
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,912
It's all right when I'm practicing,

346
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,548
but when the instructor says think
of this as the actual test

347
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,084
and starts looking at his watch,
my hands start shaking uncontrollably.

348
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,455
Then just think that you're practicing.

349
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,756
That's easy to say.

350
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,192
I don't think
the special lecture is enough.

351
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,860
I think I should just sign up
for the academy.

352
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,161
Has the chairwoman,

353
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:07,065
I mean, Han-gyeol's grandma
called you yet?

354
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,500
No. Why?

355
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,870
She just seemed quite worried
about matters of Han-gyeol's marriage.

356
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,140
Does she plan to set him up
with potential brides?

357
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,376
Don't you want to get married?

358
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,113
I think it's early to talk about marriage
since we've just started dating.

359
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,615
And you know I have lots
of things I want to do.

360
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,217
Is that what Han-gyeol also thinks?

361
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,219
Of course. He's even busier than me.

362
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,421
You don't think he'll go meet

363
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,690
the women his grandma
sets him up with, do you?

364
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,692
I'll kill him if he does.

365
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,066
I think I'm going to be a bit late today.
Don't wait up for me.

366
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,268
Does she feed you?

367
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,204
Yeah. She hasn't kicked me out
and she's feeding me.

368
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,206
Then why don't you just move in with her?

369
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,043
Who knows? Maybe she'll let you.

370
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,145
What for?
Things are fine the way they are.

371
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:54,713
Don't you think?

372
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,316
Yeah, I like the way things are right now.

373
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:03,989
Hello?

374
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,125
How are you doing?
This is Choi Han-gyeol's mom.

375
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,226
Hello, ma'am.

376
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,667
I like sushi because you can eat it
right away without cooking it.

377
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,968
What's this?

378
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,771
It's lotus shoot.

379
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,475
Eat this before anything else.
It's an appetizer.

380
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:24,976
Thank you.

381
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,618
They have a nice, bitter flavor.
But quite good.

382
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,688
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

383
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:38,957
Not really.

384
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,959
Of course, you feel
uncomfortable around me.

385
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,494
Don't you?

386
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:44,763
You don't have to be so formal.

387
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:52,437
It seems that Han-gyeol's thought
about marrying you.

388
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,506
Have you talked it over with him?

389
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,310
He's not one to say such things lightly.

390
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,179
But I'm worried that you two
are rushing things

391
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,516
considering that it has only been
three months since you first met.

392
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,920
I know that you and the chairwoman
are worried.

393
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,959
It's obvious even to me that the boss
could do a lot better than me.

394
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,828
He's such a good person.

395
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,798
He's handsome, smart and capable.

396
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,735
Seeing him made me have a goal.

397
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,872
It made me want to be successful like him.

398
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,008
That's why I can't get married right now.

399
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,379
I haven't accomplished anything
in my life yet.

400
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,882
What is it that you want to accomplish?

401
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,084
It's nothing really.

402
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,420
I just want to become a barista.

403
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,557
As you probably know...

404
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,494
the boss loves his family deeply.

405
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,897
And I'm sure he won't do anything
to worry you.

406
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,414
He's so cute!

407
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,253
I'm sorry I'm so late.

408
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,789
-You're here.
-What are you doing?

409
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,992
Hey! Wasn't I cute?

410
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,461
I'll wash up and be down in five.

411
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,339
It's been such a long time
since we've danced like this.

412
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,442
I have something to say to you.

413
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,745
I thought you would.

414
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,948
I thought something was up
when you asked me to dance.

415
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:47,819
I've thought it over
and I thought why not?

416
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:52,057
If we try it out
and it's not right for us,

417
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,758
we could always break up again.

418
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,461
God knows we've broken up enough
until now.

419
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,112
Will you marry me?

420
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,983
What are you doing?

421
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,722
I can't promise you the moon
and the stars.

422
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:27,926
And you're going to have to do
a lot of the housework.

423
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,764
But I promise I'll try.

424
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,167
Even when our love isn't enough
to keep me going,

425
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:40,639
I'll keep trying. Will you be my husband?

426
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,994
Wow! You are quite a shocker,
you know that, Yoo-joo?

427
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,499
I don't think I can be a daughter-in-law
that your parents approve of,

428
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,834
but I'll work hard at that too.

429
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,272
What am I supposed to say right now?

430
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,310
You've made me speechless.
My mind is completely blank right now.

431
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:23,281
I want to have a child
who looks like you, Han-sung.

432
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,789
Thank you for staying by my side.

433
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,863
-I love you.
-I love you too.

434
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,269
I love you even more than you love me.

435
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:47,973
Thanks.

436
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,125
-Hey, Han-sung.
-Guess what, Han-gyeol.

437
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:09,928
Yoo-joo just put a ring on my finger
and asked me to marry her!

438
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,563
I can't believe it!
It feels like I'm dreaming!

439
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,497
For real, Han-sung?

440
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,366
Let's get together!
The four of us should celebrate!

441
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,967
I can't right now.

442
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,205
My baby wants to eat cold noodles
and I'm on my way to get some.

443
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,941
Wow, Han-sung! You've finally done it!

444
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:24,976
So, how did you persuade her?

445
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,846
You didn't beg and tell her
you would do anything she wanted, huh?

446
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,214
Shut up! I'll talk to you later.

447
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,749
Why are you hanging up so soon?

448
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:33,151
Did you just call me to brag?

449
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,054
Of course, I called you to brag, stupid!

450
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:46,097
He must be really happy.

451
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,635
Hey! Eun-chan!

452
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,309
Fine! You win.

453
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,078
I'll accept what you wired me this time.

454
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,882
But you would better not even think
about wiring me any more money!

455
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,319
-Do you understand?
-No!

456
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:09,688
Wait a minute!

457
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,822
I'm not done talking to you!

458
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:12,390
Stop right there!

459
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:15,427
Jeez! She’s as stubborn as a mule!

460
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,662
"Ji-hyang's Five Commandments.

461
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:21,266
One, thou shall not bother
Ji-hyang anymore.

462
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,536
Two, thou shall only treat Ji-hyang
as a neighbor.

463
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,806
Three, thou shall no longer meddle
in Ji-hyang household affairs.

464
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,842
Four, thou shall not smile
whenever thy sees Ji-hyang.

465
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,445
Five, thou shall not go out
to greet Ji-hyang

466
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,846
whenever she passes by thine shop.

467
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,182
That's the only way to win Ji-hyang heart.

468
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,451
Or else she'll never give thou
the time of day. Again!

469
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:43,888
One, thou shall not bother
Ji-hyang anymore. Two..."

470
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,690
What are you doing right now?

471
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:54,265
Hello, Ji-hyang. What will it be?

472
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,001
I would like some beef for soup.

473
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,203
Coming right up!

474
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,081
Are you feeling better now?

475
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,218
Yes, thanks to you.

476
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,024
You don't have to give me so much.

477
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,760
We don't have that many people
in our household.

478
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,394
I'll give you a little extra.

479
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,698
You can barbeque with the kids,
and you can use the rest for soup.

480
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,870
Are you finally over me?

481
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,738
Yes.

482
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:39,344
I know that I've caused you
undue mental suffering until now,

483
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,378
and I'm sorry.

484
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,481
I won't bother you in the future,

485
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,251
so you don't have to feel uncomfortable
walking around in the neighborhood.

486
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,954
Who said I ever felt uncomfortable?

487
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,759
Frankly, I know that
I made you uncomfortable.

488
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,835
Oh! The plastic bag!

489
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:12,677
I'll think about it
after I've married the kids off.

490
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,114
Thank you.

491
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,685
You've made me feel like a woman again...

492
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,690
for the first time in a long time.

493
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,895
Ji-hyang! What are you saying?

494
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:35,133
Later on, after Eun-chan and Eun-sae...

495
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,404
find their own paths...

496
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:47,779
and you're still interested in me,
let's get married then.

497
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,848
Ji-hyang!

498
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,587
You forgot to take your beef!

499
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:57,922
Ji-hyang.

500
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:11,836
Time's up!

501
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,872
No way! Are you sure you timed it right?
Let me see.

502
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,774
Hey! You should never doubt the proctor!

503
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,476
You timed it wrong on purpose, didn't you?

504
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,144
Because you're angry
about me paying you back!

505
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,412
You may be like that, but I'm not.

506
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,716
I want you to pay me back
for every penny I lent you!

507
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:26,317
I don't plan to spend on you ever again.

508
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:29,821
I failed again! What could be the problem?

509
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,357
I could make you smile in half a second.
You want me to try?

510
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,092
-Not really.
-Come on!

511
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,361
Okay, go ahead.

512
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:40,231
Han-sung and Yoo-joo are getting married!

513
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,002
What? Really? When? They must be
so happy! I'm going to call them.

514
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,171
Hey! Just leave them alone.
They have lots to do tonight.

515
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,741
They have to check out
the ultrasound photos of the baby

516
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,142
since Yoo-joo is pregnant.

517
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:55,113
Pregnant? Oh, my god!
I bet their baby will be so cute!

518
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,582
Anyways, how can she already be pregnant?

519
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,155
How many kids do you plan to have?

520
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,129
Just three. How about you?

521
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,632
I guess about that many will be fine.

522
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,335
Do you like to clean?

523
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,504
Is there anyone in the world
who likes to clean?

524
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,973
-How about doing dishes?
-Can't you see how I break dishes?

525
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,375
Anyways, why do you ask?

526
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,945
Did you know that you snore
when you sleep?

527
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,214
No, I don't! That's just not true!

528
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:32,317
And I even have a witness.
Just ask Eun-sae.

529
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,153
Even though I do grind my teeth a bit.

530
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,327
It just won't work out.
We're too different.

531
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:46,064
And it's not like I'm a nice guy
who can accept everything.

532
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,367
Those things shouldn't matter
when you're in love.

533
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,836
Anyways, what won't work out?

534
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,638
-Living together.
-What?

535
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,940
You eat four, high-calorie meals a day,
don't you?

536
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,408
Your diet is different from mine.

537
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,978
And plus, you go to bed early
and get up early.

538
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,381
Even our daily cycles won't fit.
Jeez! We have no similarities whatsoever!

539
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,317
Don't worry about it!
I don't want to live with you.

540
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,719
Then why don't we just get married?

541
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,524
Oh! But you're careful with everything.

542
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,761
Don't you think it would be better
to live together before getting married?

543
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,231
Do you want to get married?

544
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,967
I was just talking hypothetically
for crying out loud!

545
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,969
It's so hard to talk to you!

546
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:28,039
I can see you're still angry
about me paying you back.

547
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,307
You're so petty.

548
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,476
What? What did you just say about me?

549
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,311
It’s getting late.
I should be getting home.

550
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,652
Hey, what kind of marriage proposal
do you want to receive?

551
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,488
What?

552
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:45,623
What kind of marriage proposal
do you want to receive?

553
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:48,893
Let's see.

554
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,630
I want to receive
a diamond the size of a walnut

555
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,832
and a million roses.

556
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:58,403
And I want someone to borrow
an entire cruise ship for me.

557
00:33:58,503 --> 00:34:00,972
Or I want someone to rent out
the entire top floor of the 63 Building

558
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,941
and play a movie made about my life
with pictures of my childhood.

559
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,944
-What else is there?
-Just go. Go.

560
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:10,348
It's like there isn't even a single
serious bone in your entire body!

561
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:11,649
Just forget about it!

562
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:17,455
-Are you angry?
-No.

563
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:26,831
Are you angry?

564
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,000
Hey! Shut up. I have to study!

565
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,572
Hey! Are you angry?

566
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:44,782
Go.

567
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,857
Don't go.

568
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,096
Don't go! Oh!

569
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:16,174
-You woke me up!
-I'm sorry!

570
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,379
Don't! You're tickling me!

571
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,593
-You're going to fall!
-Be careful!

572
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:41,365
Stop it! Let me down!

573
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:43,935
Hello?

574
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,050
Kiss me! Kiss me!

575
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,109
It seems that you're having
even more trouble eating these days, Mom.

576
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,978
It's not because I'm sick.

577
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,480
It's because I've been
so concerned about Han-gyeol.

578
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,749
When he couldn't seem to find his way,

579
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,885
my only wish was for him to find work
that he could be interested in.

580
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,757
But I never in my dreams thought
he would worry me because of a girl.

581
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:43,060
The biggest regret I have in life is that

582
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,232
I broke up with Han-gyeol's birth mother
because of your disapproval.

583
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,003
I hope that Han-gyeol won't have
to suffer the same fate, Mom.

584
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:57,074
Are you saying that you still
don't love your current wife?

585
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,676
That's not it.

586
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,882
Eat some fruit before you leave.

587
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:11,322
Why do you treat a husband who was
head over heels for another woman so well?

588
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,658
That's all in the past, Mom.

589
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,559
Is anything the matter?

590
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,762
It's nothing.

591
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:21,632
By the way, Mom,
I met that girl a few days ago.

592
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,834
-Who?
-Eun Chan.

593
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,938
Why did you go
and waste your time like that?

594
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,777
At first, I didn't think she was right
for Han-gyeol,

595
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,213
but I've found that she's kind,

596
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,516
considerate, unassuming
and she puts you at ease.

597
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,952
And I think she would do a great job
running the household.

598
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,689
She's different from Yoo-joo, Mom.

599
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,992
I don't feel easy around Yoo-joo.

600
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:51,462
I just can't act comfortably around her
even though I'm sure things

601
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,332
would be different if we grew close.

602
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:58,069
But Eun-chan puts me at ease.

603
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,606
You shouldn't trust her like that.

604
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,210
A girl like that is bound to stab you
in the back. Can't you tell?

605
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,779
At this age, you still don't know
about these things?

606
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,415
This way, you'll have great-grandchildren
sooner, Mom.

607
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,750
Stop talking nonsense!

608
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,453
Even though I want
to see Han-gyeol have children,

609
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,054
I don't want it to be with that girl.

610
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,257
Make sure to chew thoroughly, Mom.

611
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,633
You're already practically married,

612
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,369
packing Han-sung's lunch for him.

613
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,704
I want to be a good wife to him.

614
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,141
Why did you decide to get married?

615
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,243
What kind of question is that?

616
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,178
It sounds like you don't want me
to get married.

617
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:45,950
I'm just really,
really curious, that's all.

618
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,652
You think we'll end up fighting
every day, right?

619
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,688
I think you two have fought
a lifetime's worth of fights.

620
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,159
Oh no! I messed this one up.
You can have it.

621
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,162
This looks awful.

622
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,400
You look happy, Yoo-joo.

623
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,303
You look even prettier
now that you're getting married.

624
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:08,939
-Maybe we should have gotten together?
-Maybe?

625
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,109
I'm going to go check out wedding dresses
with Han-sung later on.

626
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:14,678
Why don't you come along?
It's free of charge.

627
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,248
I don't want this.

628
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,185
-There's one more stop, isn't there?
-No. I think we're done.

629
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,426
I talked to Han-sung on the phone
a little while ago and he seemed so happy.

630
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,994
Those two seem impatient to get married.

631
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,729
They're already looking
at wedding dresses.

632
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,765
Really? I've always wanted to wear
a wedding dress.

633
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,901
I'm so jealous.

634
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,238
Okay.

635
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,377
You would be so pretty.

636
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:20,411
Yoo-joo looks so pretty!

637
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:24,982
Wow!

638
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:27,818
Bravo!

639
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,087
What do you think?

640
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,490
You can stop posing now.
You're embarassing me.

641
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:33,958
It's pretty.

642
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,527
Han-sung's really happy.

643
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:37,862
Does it look okay?

644
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:42,066
-You try it on too.
-Why would I wear something like that?

645
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:44,902
That is really pretty though.

646
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,439
It's getting late.
Don't we have to get back to the shop?

647
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,744
Will you marry me in that?

648
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:56,113
What?

649
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:58,949
Let's get married, Eun-chan.

650
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,987
Are you proposing to me?

651
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,257
You must really want
to get married, Han-gyeol.

652
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,626
But still, this is no way
to propose to a woman.

653
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,395
How can you propose to me like this?

654
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:16,834
You don't have to answer me now.
I just want you to think it over.

655
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,836
I don't have to think it over.

656
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,605
Hey! You don't have to give me
an answer right now!

657
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,173
Think it over carefully!

658
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,744
Is there any question
that I would want to marry you?

659
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,948
-I love this dress.
-You didn't even pretend to act surprised.

660
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,484
You answered as if you were waiting for me
to propose to you all along.

661
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,687
And can't you act more moved
by my proposal

662
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,756
-and jump into my arms or something?
-What's up with them?

663
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:39,924
For the love of god!

664
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:44,094
Why? I am surprised. I'm so surprised.

665
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,066
You asked me to marry you
and I said I'd marry you,

666
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,234
so what's your problem?

667
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,236
I almost made a big mistake.

668
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,172
You're too high maintenance for me.
I take everything back.

669
00:42:55,773 --> 00:42:58,108
-What are you talking about?
-You'll tell me to eat in the morning,

670
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,310
sleep early at night,

671
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,345
to keep the calls short
and the house clean,

672
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,880
and to fold the laundry neatly.

673
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,149
I hate naggers. The marriage is off.

674
00:43:05,516 --> 00:43:07,384
-What? It's off?
-Yeah! It's off!

675
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:09,820
Are you trying to ruin
our wedding or something?

676
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,123
Take a look at us for crying out loud.

677
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:18,262
Do you think you'd find another guy
that's as great as me?

678
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,802
Hey! Stop right there! Hey! Come back!

679
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,738
-Hey! Get out!
-Hey!

680
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:30,074
Get out of here if you're going
to keep acting like that!

681
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,978
Hey, Han-gyeol, Grandma wants
to eat dinner with us tonight.

682
00:43:34,211 --> 00:43:35,145
Hey!

683
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,748
I want company headquarters

684
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,550
to oversee chain store selection
and management.

685
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:42,086
And we will open the stores one at a time,

686
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,588
emphasizing the taste of handmade coffee.

687
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,558
You will receive your salary
starting this month.

688
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,793
Why are you looking at me like that?

689
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,795
My company doesn't use people
without paying them.

690
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:54,131
I've also prepared a post for you
in the new ventures department.

691
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,466
I don't want your help.

692
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,670
Just do as you're doing right now
and nobody will think that.

693
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,207
Your grandma and mom seemed
quite against you seeing the girl.

694
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,775
Do you plan to marry her?

695
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,278
You're not opposed to her too.
Are you, Dad?

696
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,048
The women of our household
are quite stubborn.

697
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,483
You'll have to fight for it.

698
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,318
Don't worry. I'm pretty stubborn myself.

699
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,255
You're here, Yoo-joo! Welcome to our home!

700
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,857
-We should go greet the guests, Dad.
-Okay.

701
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,395
Han-sung's here, Grandma!

702
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,097
What's the matter?

703
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,833
It's nothing. Let's go.

704
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,104
-Put on your slippers.
-Hey.

705
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:37,207
Stop acting so nice to me! It won't work!

706
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,844
I'll never accept that girl,
not in a thousand years.

707
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,113
You look pretty even
when you're angry, Grandma!

708
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,815
I think I'll carry you out!

709
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:47,851
Stop it, you idiot! Are you all right?

710
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,656
-Let's go, grandma.
-Oh, my!

711
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:54,324
Stop being so angry.

712
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:57,828
You have such a soft touch, Grandma.

713
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:59,963
How can I not be mad?
You've never given me a day of peace!

714
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,633
Grandma is in the house!

715
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,269
-Hi, Grandma. I'm here.
-Hello.

716
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:06,737
Sit down.

717
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:12,876
Your parents said that they have a seminar
around the time of your wedding.

718
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:14,578
-Have they told you about it?
-Yes.

719
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:16,346
They said that we should
reschedule the wedding

720
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,115
because they couldn't make it on that day.

721
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:20,851
What the heck!
Just hold the wedding on that day.

722
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:24,021
It'll take forever for your
parents' schedule to clear up.

723
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,924
They're always so busy
with their academic pursuits.

724
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:31,795
What your grandma means
is that you shouldn't have your parents

725
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:35,733
come all the way back for the wedding,
but you should hold a simple ceremony

726
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,235
with a few relatives and go to where

727
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,605
your parents are for your honeymoon.

728
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,240
What do you think?

729
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,909
That would be better for us.

730
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,813
I don't want Yoo-joo to overexert herself
preparing the wedding anyway.

731
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,483
Why don't you just tell
the entire neighborhood?

732
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,985
So, you two have good news?

733
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,989
Mom, I think Yoo-joo is pregnant.

734
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:03,260
-Am I right?
-Yes.

735
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:06,697
I see you two have finally done something
that makes sense after breaking up,

736
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,599
and getting back together
again all those times.

737
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,400
How are you feeling, dear?

738
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:11,769
I'm good, ma'am.

739
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,906
-When's the due date?
-It's next March.

740
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,475
So you'll have the baby
when the flowers begin to blossom?

741
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,310
Oh, my!

742
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,184
Why can't you be more
like your cousin, Han-gyeol!

743
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,486
You imbecile!

744
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:34,458
God! Everyone seems
to dislike me these days.

745
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:37,928
-I'm so sad.
-Who else dislikes you?

746
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:41,865
-Did Eun-chan say she disliked you?
-Don't even bring her up!

747
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,901
She just won't listen to a word I say.

748
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:47,171
I keep telling her
that she shouldn't study so much

749
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,540
and hang out with me more,
but she won't listen to me.

750
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53,710
And she's so precise about money.

751
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,014
This is what really gets to me!
I lent her some money a long time ago

752
00:46:57,214 --> 00:47:00,150
and she insists on paying me back
everything with interest!

753
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:02,953
I told her not to pay me back
but she just won't listen to me!

754
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,589
And she's always nagging me!

755
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,859
Nagging me about using less toilet paper,

756
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,928
making sure that the faucets
are completely closed.

757
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:12,095
If I don’t finish all my food,

758
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,198
she'll tell me that there are millions
of people in Africa

759
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:16,033
who are dying to eat my leftover food.

760
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,336
But if I still don't finish my food,

761
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:22,206
she'll finish my food for me.
She is such a nagger!

762
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,808
A goody two shoes if I ever saw one!

763
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,977
Just look at him!

764
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,112
He's completely lost his mind
over that girl!

765
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,748
Try to be a little more discreet, son.

766
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,517
I can also give you
a grandchild this year!

767
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,652
Grandma, I can give you another
great-grandchild within a year.

768
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,588
Do you want me to give you
one like Han-sung?

769
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:41,124
Don't you bring us into this!
This is your problem, Han-gyeol.

770
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,393
Let me make myself clear.

771
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:46,196
I will never accept that girl,
Eun-chan, into our family.

772
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:50,367
Don't just say no
and think about it seriously.

773
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,336
I want to get married like other people,

774
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:54,371
not remain single for the rest of my life.

775
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,006
Single is better
than being married to her.

776
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:58,542
Eun-chan's a really nice girl, ma'am.

777
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,713
Grandma, frankly, she's a much better
person than Han-gyeol ever was.

778
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,181
What?

779
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:07,284
Wait a minute. Wait.

780
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:11,188
So the people who are for Eun-chan
are dad, Han-sung and Yoo-joo.

781
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,627
That makes four of us.

782
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,334
I'm kind of approving of her too.

783
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:26,937
What! How could you!

784
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,872
I love you so much, Mom!

785
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:33,010
Grandma, it looks like
I have the majority vote.

786
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,378
What should I do?

787
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,523
So you're really going
to start taking the class?

788
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:48,425
It's none of your business.

789
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:50,861
Why are you complicating
your life so needlessly?

790
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,196
Why don't you just concentrate
on your love life?

791
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:56,466
Han-gyeol's rich, so you can
leech off of him.

792
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,335
Why are you making yourself miserable?

793
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,070
Do you know how hard
it is to become a barista?

794
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,639
Why don't you just go leech off
some rich girl?

795
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,275
Han-gyeol hasn't proposed
to you yet, has he?

796
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:08,779
That's why you're looking
for a way to support yourself.

797
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:12,449
Anyways, why does that woman
keep looking at us?

798
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,958
That girl's been checking me out
for the past few days.

799
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,760
Maybe I should give her some love?

800
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:27,230
Ha-rim, God will punish you someday
if you keep making women cry.

801
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:32,069
It's an even bigger sin to ignore
such signals of love.

802
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,908
It would hurt...
It would hurt her pride as a woman.

803
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,982
Doesn't he ever hesitate?
Just look at him go!

804
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,895
Excuse me.
Could you hold this for a minute?

805
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:00,230
What?

806
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,733
I just need to wipe this table.

807
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:12,342
Could you follow me with that?

808
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,311
What? Wait!

809
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,914
I've got myself a new girl!

810
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,392
Excuse me. I've brought the glasses here.

811
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,293
Okay. Hold on.

812
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:33,830
-How old are you?
-Huh?

813
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,466
I'm 20 years old.

814
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,904
-Let's be friends.
-What? Okay.

815
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,107
You were here yesterday, weren't you?

816
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,278
I came here with my friends.

817
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,781
How did you know?

818
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,349
Because you kept looking at me.

819
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,352
Huh? I did not!

820
00:50:55,752 --> 00:50:57,721
The name's Jin Ha-rim. What's your name?

821
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:00,123
My name's Han Byeol.

822
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:03,894
Byeol. What a pretty name.

823
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,631
If you want to go out on a date with me,

824
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,901
I'm getting off in 30 minutes.

825
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:15,138
Wait for me at the Jeulbi wine bar
at the intersection

826
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:16,706
right in front of here.

827
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,415
Give me your number.

828
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,752
I might get off late.
That's why I need your number.

829
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,288
- My number?
- Don't you want to? Then forget it.

830
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,222
Wait!

831
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,561
Can you take this?

832
00:51:37,627 --> 00:51:41,098
-Okay. Here.
-Okay.

833
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:43,233
You're really cute.

834
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:49,973
Here you are.

835
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,879
-You can go now.
-Okay.

836
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,583
All right! Let's see.

837
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,186
"Byeol!"

838
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,491
-Is there lots of earwax?
-Yeah. Tons!

839
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:11,394
-That hurts.
-Move your hand.

840
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:12,696
Eun-sae.

841
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,466
You want to hear some big news?

842
00:52:16,533 --> 00:52:19,002
Did you sell like ten thousand cups
of coffee?

843
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:19,903
No.

844
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,471
Then did you sell,
like, a hundred waffles?

845
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:22,906
No.

846
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,107
Then what is it?

847
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:26,810
You're not going to tell me
that you're still hungry, are you?

848
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:27,711
No!

849
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,915
I was proposed to today.

850
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,317
Really?

851
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:36,219
Somebody really proposed to you?

852
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:40,123
Who? Are you really going
to marry your boss?

853
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,492
-Why not?
-When?

854
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,929
In about five years?
I wonder if that's too late.

855
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:50,667
I'll be 29 in five years and he'll be 34.

856
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,604
-Will your boss wait for you until then?
-Why wouldn't he?

857
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,874
Maybe we should get married earlier,

858
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,643
like in four years.

859
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,178
Four years?

860
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,780
Are you crazy!

861
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,448
Look at me, Eun-chan.

862
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,150
The ever-faithful Hwang Min-yeop
cheated on me

863
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,419
just because I gave him a hard time
for a couple of months.

864
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,087
But you'll make your boss
wait for four years?

865
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,823
Do you think that's too long?

866
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,493
How can you be so blind
to how the world works?

867
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,863
Do you even live in the same world
as the rest of us?

868
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:25,902
-You haven't done it with him, have you?
-What?

869
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:30,006
What? What else is there for a guy
and girl to do together except for that!

870
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,309
Try to keep your mind out of the gutter!

871
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:35,412
Hey! You didn't have to hit me.

872
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:36,846
Don't glare at me like that!

873
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,083
I didn't do it...

874
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:43,954
We haven't done it!

875
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:04,374
How old is the person you're planning
to give the ring to?

876
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,275
Twenty-four years old.

877
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,978
Then she'll like something bright,
like this.

878
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,713
It projects a very cute
and feminine image.

879
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,581
But my girlfriend's not very feminine.

880
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:22,993
Turn around.

881
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:25,762
March forward.

882
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:27,797
It was like this.

883
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:30,700
That's it! Put your legs together

884
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,869
and raise your heels gently.

885
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,471
Your butt!

886
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,939
Tighten your butt and look ahead of you!

887
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,174
Your legs!

888
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,176
This just won't work.

889
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,046
You should just wear pants.

890
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,482
I can do it with practice.

891
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,986
Put my legs together, raise my heels,

892
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,522
tighten my butt and look ahead...

893
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,197
Eun-chan. Eun-sae told me

894
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:04,334
that your boss proposed to you.

895
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,870
Don't worry. I won't get married
for another five years.

896
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:09,372
Is your boss all right with it?
He's at a marrying age,

897
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,908
and I'm sure his family wants him
to wed as soon as possible.

898
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,577
I met his mom
and she never mentioned that.

899
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:16,913
You've even met his mom? What did she say?

900
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,915
She didn't say much.

901
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,584
She asked me when we fell in love,

902
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,720
and she took me out for some tasty sushi.

903
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,722
She didn't say anything else?

904
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:27,290
No. She's just worried

905
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,359
'cause the boss already
mentioned marriage to his family

906
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:31,828
even though it hasn't been
long since we started seeing each other.

907
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,863
He's so impatient!

908
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,665
What is she so worried about?

909
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,400
I mean, your boss's mom.

910
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,302
What's she so worried about?

911
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:44,074
Is she embarrassed about
how poor our family is compared to hers?

912
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:46,476
It's nothing like that.

913
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,846
She was just worried
that we might be rushing into marriage.

914
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,414
I don't want you to marry so soon either.

915
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:55,385
It's not like I'm dying
to marry you off, you know.

916
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,087
For Pete's sake!

917
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,001
Yoo-joo! I'm so happy!

918
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,871
Are you happy? Are you really happy?

919
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,407
I've never felt this happy in my life!

920
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:51,808
Don't make it too obvious.

921
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:54,177
You should wear a flower like me.

922
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,249
Wow! This is exactly like a fairy tale.

923
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,317
Yoo-joo and Han-sung must be so happy!

924
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,587
Do you want to get married
in a place like this, too?

925
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,890
Yeah.

926
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:13,730
I don't want you to wear a skirt
that goes above your knees.

927
00:57:14,864 --> 00:57:15,832
You mean, like this?

928
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,001
Hey!

929
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,437
You're a lot more conservative
than you look.

930
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:22,839
Lots of women even wear
hot pants these days.

931
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,077
What?

932
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,066
Darn! It's too small.

933
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,570
Put it on here.

934
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,411
Did you get matching rings?

935
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,385
Will you be my bride?

936
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,492
Why aren't you answering me?

937
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,441
Shall we get married here?

938
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:35,278
Will this place still be open
in five years?

939
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:38,414
Maybe we should marry sooner.
Like in four years?

940
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,084
Four years? Five years?

941
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,087
I'm going to get married within this year.

942
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,155
What are you talking about,

943
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:48,992
"You're going to get married
within this year?"

944
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:50,894
That's ridiculous!

945
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,062
How's that ridiculous?

946
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,231
Eun-sae's still in high school,

947
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,500
and I still have lots of things
I want to do.

948
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,302
I'm only 24, you know.

949
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:02,338
Didn't you want to marry me in five years?

950
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:04,707
Five years is too long to wait.

951
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:13,149
Mom, I knew that Yoo-joo was pretty
but I didn't know how truly pretty

952
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,351
she was until today.
And she's a successful artist.

953
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,222
Plus, she has a kind and loving husband
like Han-sung.

954
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,424
Even I feel jealous of her.

955
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,360
Mom!

956
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,397
Mom!

957
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,065
Mom!

958
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,533
Mom!

959
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:32,168
Mom!

960
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,307
Okay.

961
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:40,009
Let's calmly talk things through.

962
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,779
What's the reason you want to wait
for five years until we get married?

963
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,983
I want to become a barista like Mr. Hong,

964
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,186
and I don't want
to get married until then.

965
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,688
How can you say that?

966
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:53,289
Didn't I tell you before?

967
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,526
My dream was to live happily
with Eun-sae and my mom.

968
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,495
Before, there was nothing more important
to me than making money.

969
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,864
But now, I want to become a barista.

970
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,100
I can do work that I enjoy and make money.

971
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:09,272
I finally have a dream
and I want to keep trying to the end.

972
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,509
I don't know what I am to you,

973
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,446
but you could do all that
after you get married.

974
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,848
You can become a barista
after we get married.

975
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,387
And if you're worried about your family,

976
01:00:25,655 --> 01:00:28,791
I'll take care of your mom and Eun-sae
so you don't have to worry about them.

977
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:30,560
Take care of them? How?

978
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,662
Until when do you plan
to take care of them?

979
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:35,031
Don't make promises that you can't keep.

980
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:37,300
It's not like you're going
to live forever!

981
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,602
What?

982
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:43,306
My dad always said that
he would take care of us, too.

983
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,508
But he couldn't.

984
01:00:46,109 --> 01:00:48,311
No one can take care of anyone else.

985
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,447
All you can do is take care of yourself!

986
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,217
I'm not going to get married
until I succeed on my own!

987
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,453
You're not going to get married?
Hey! Stop right there!

988
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:00,490
I've already told my family
and my grandma and my parents

989
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:01,924
have already given me their permission.

990
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,427
If you say yes,
we can get married right away!

991
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,162
You've already told your family

992
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,597
that we're getting married right away?

993
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,866
How can you do this to me?
You didn't even discuss it with me!

994
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,868
-This is unbelievable!
-Unbelievable?

995
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,639
You told me yourself that you would
marry me! Were you lying, then?

996
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,908
I didn't mean that
I'd marry you right away!

997
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:21,611
How could you decide that by yourself?
Am I...

998
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,779
Are we just a joke to you?

999
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,548
-How can you say that, Eun-chan!
-How can I not say that?

1000
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,384
Hey! Stop right there!

1001
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,354
I'm sorry, but I can't marry you
right now.

1002
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,090
Because you gave me your heart
while I'm trying to give you my money?

1003
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,792
Why can't you wait for me?

1004
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,326
Couldn’t you be more understanding of me?

1005
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,163
I'm used to your work coming ahead
of me by now,

1006
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,165
but shouldn't our child come
ahead of your work?

1007
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,434
Both are important to me.

1008
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:45,668
How could you be like that?

01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:47,904
Weren't you supposed to be understanding
if you loved somebody.

01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:51,441

she's become a barista, you idiot!

I'm not going abroad.

1012
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,044
I want you to broaden your horizons.

1013
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:58,414
I want to support you
so you can develop and better yourself.
