1
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,564
You shouldn't eat so late at night.

2
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,867
But I want seaweed rice balls.

3
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,469
Can you please buy me some, sis? Please?

4
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,605
You only call me "sis"
when you want something from me.

5
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,173
Bye.

6
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:50,550
Hello.

7
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,752
Hi.

8
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,291
How have you been?

9
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,630
I sent you a text message.
Why didn't you answer it?

10
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,666
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,035
About what?

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,939
About what happened the other day.

13
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,077
It was bothering me a little, too.

14
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,712
Should we forget about it?

15
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,717
I don't forget things easily.

16
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,021
Then maybe we should pretend
to have forgotten about it?

17
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,057
Why do we have to do that?

18
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,394
So we can be friends again.

19
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,296
Friends?

20
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,099
Do you want to be friends with me?

21
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:40,500
Yes.

22
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,770
You listen to what I have to say

23
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,305
and buy me a lot of food to eat.

24
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,576
But I guess I'm being selfish.

25
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,444
No, you're not.

26
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,449
It's better to tell me the truth
instead of being nice to me

27
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,285
and giving me a false sense of hope.

28
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:01,955
Hey!

29
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,058
At least I've made another good friend.

30
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,360
I'm so happy.

31
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,633
You should eat something.
Your stomach is growling for food.

32
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,136
I wasn't hungry just a moment ago.

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,072
I guess seeing you
brought back my appetite.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,942
I've never had a day like today
when I didn't feel hungry.

35
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,745
This will be a day to remember.

36
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,050
My boss told me not to come
to work anymore.

37
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,353
He seemed really angry.

38
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,724
It was rough.

39
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,326
I thought things were good between us.

40
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,595
I just don't understand him at all.

41
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:47,934
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,904
I guess it has become a habit
to tell you these things.

43
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,277
I think I've developed feelings
for my boss.

44
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,746
I've fallen in love with him.

45
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,617
Are you surprised?

46
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,519
No.

47
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,788
I already guessed as much.

48
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,125
It did seem like Girl 2
was in love with Guy 1.

49
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,328
Things must be so complicated now.

50
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,997
That man thinks this woman is a man.

51
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,900
Are you planning to tell him anytime soon?

52
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,304
I think it's better to be close...

53
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,675
to him as a man than be rejected
by him as a girl.

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,814
Let's grab a bite.

55
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,217
I'm buying to celebrate
our renewed friendship.

56
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,652
What are you in the mood for? A burger?

57
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,120
Maybe pizza?

58
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,424
-Anything will do.
-Anything?

59
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,994
-Something tasty.
-Something tasty?

60
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,168
Han-gyeol!

61
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,408
Han-gyeol.

62
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,377
What's going on?

63
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:06,579
Come in.

64
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,889
Are you moving, Han-gyeol?

65
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,725
Take a seat.

66
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,760
Where?

67
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,702
Have you been eating?

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,775
Should I not ask you any questions?

69
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:38,611
Do you want some?

70
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:43,216
Eun-chan has been depressed
and even lost weight after you left.

71
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,518
It would be better
if you didn't ask any questions.

72
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,754
Han-gyeol.

73
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,758
Han-gyeol.

74
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:58,998
I think...

75
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,535
I'm in love with him.

76
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,538
-I'm in love with Eun-chan.
-With my Chan?

77
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,742
So what, Han-gyeol? I love Eun-chan too.

78
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,813
He's making me lose my mind.

79
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,517
Damn it.

80
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,118
I don't even know what's going on anymore.

81
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,991
Does Eun-chan know about this?

82
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,994
How should I know if he knows?

83
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,766
It doesn't matter.
I'll put an end to this soon.

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,240
Damn it.

85
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,683
You should eat
instead of staring at your cell phone.

86
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,585
That buffoon Min-yeop won't call.

87
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,554
Good. That's what you wanted.

88
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,860
Why are you doing shoving food
into your mouth like that?

89
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,662
I have to eat in order to work.

90
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,397
Eat slowly.

91
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:35,628
Ha-rim, shouldn't we add more tables
since we have more customers?

92
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,030
Why won't Han-gyeol answer the phone?

93
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,333
Why hasn't the boss been coming in?
Is he sick?

94
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,669
The coffee shop is doing so well.
Did we do something to make him mad?

95
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,373
Hey, Eun-chan!

96
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,143
Han-gyeol hasn't shown up for days.
Aren't you worried about him?

97
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,646
He's leaving for America
in a month anyway.

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,847
Put it here.

99
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,084
We should work hard
regardless of the boss coming in,

100
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:58,985
don't you think?

101
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,354
Since he's going to be quitting anyway?

102
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,691
All you can say is "he's leaving anyway"
after all he has done for you?

103
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,995
You tagged him along everywhere
until a few days ago

104
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,330
and now that he isn't here,
you forget about him?

105
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,065
What else can I do?

106
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,468
Should I get on my knees
and beg for him to come back?

107
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,103
How can you say such things?

108
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,604
How can you be so heartless?

109
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,705
I didn't do anything wrong.

110
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,541
Boss!

111
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,015
-Oh, you're here.
-Yeah.

112
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,129
Are you busy?

113
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:44,964
I'm sorry about everything.

114
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,934
You stormed out of here like that
only to be absent for four days?

115
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,169
I thought you were never coming back.

116
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,438
Are the sales going up?

117
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,240
Take a seat and have a cup of tea.

118
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,176
Do you have something to tell me?

119
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,346
Do I have to have something to say
to drink tea with you? Take a seat.

120
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,685
You've lost weight.

121
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,086
Yeah.

122
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,021
Thank you.

123
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,557
Do you feel better now?

124
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,528
It will be three months soon.
I have to do it until the end.

125
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,763
Grandma wants to see me do this.

126
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,766
I want to show my grandma
that I can do a good job.

127
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,502
You've really matured, Han-gyeol.

128
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,939
I think we should add coffee shaved ice
to our menu.

129
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,041
For the summer. Is it all right with you?

130
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,711
Can't you maintain a good relationship
with Eun-chan?

131
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,813
I feel so awkward around you two.

132
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,383
I guess that's your business.

133
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:44,323
It's nice to have you back, boss.

134
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,561
Move the table near the entrance inside.

135
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,663
-It's blocking the entryway.
-Sure!

136
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,572
You look pale. Are you feeling all right?

137
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,810
Would you like something to eat?
How about some cake?

138
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,712
-You didn't have breakfast, did you?
-I'm fine.

139
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,121
Did he hurt your feelings?

140
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,857
You're getting what you deserve.

141
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,328
Those two are so cute.

142
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,234
What's the matter?

143
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,737
Boss must have been very sick.

144
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,106
He sure looked that way.

145
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,176
Oh, no!

146
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,646
He's going to scold me
when he finds out that I broke a dish.

147
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,757
So, are you going to New York?

148
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,961
He told me that other artists
would kill to be in my position

149
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,596
and that made me so mad.

150
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,833
I had half a mind to tell him
to use those other artists instead of me.

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,136
If you ask me, he won't be able
to get an artist of your talent.

152
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,440
That's probably why DK doesn't want
to lose you.

153
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:09,542
He's a smart guy.

154
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,946
I'm surprised that you praised DK.

155
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,048
Have you already made your decision to go?

156
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,020
I'm supposed to meet with DK later today.

157
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,524
Where is the best Korean
restaurant in Seoul?

158
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,629
He said we should meet
at the best Korean restaurant in Seoul.

159
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,231
-He's so unpredictable.
-Are you going to go?

160
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,606
Option number one.

161
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,743
I go.

162
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,612
Option number two.

163
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,382
I wait.

164
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,485
Option number three.

165
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,091
I don't go or wait.

166
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,431
And we break up. Choose.

167
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,312
Why don't you answer?

168
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,483
Can you give me a little time?

169
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:30,990
How long?

170
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,093
A week? Ten days?

171
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,200
I guess you'll need more time than that.

172
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,513
-Is it difficult to just see him?
-What do you mean?

173
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,582
It's written all over your face.

174
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,384
You won't even look
in Eun-chan's direction.

175
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,521
If you're going to wear that expression,
you should just run away.

176
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,557
Running away won't solve anything.

177
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,330
You better not tease me
about this later on.

178
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:55,374
Hey, boss.
Would you like a ride on my scooter?

179
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,129
Would you like a ride on my scooter?

180
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:19,899
-I'll pass.
-How is your grandma?

181
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,602
It's none of your business.

182
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,238
And I don't want you around me anymore.

183
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,207
Stay more than two meters away from me.

184
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,310
If you don't like that, just leave.

185
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,136
Why does he have to be so mean to me?

186
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,956
Here is your iced Americano
and your apple.

187
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:18,057
Have a nice day.

188
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,258
Hi, Han-gyeol.

189
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,163
What would you like?

190
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,565
-An iced mocha, please.
-An iced mocha?

191
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:28,901
Hey, Eun-chan.

192
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:32,204
What do you think about homosexuality?

193
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,373
I don't have an opinion.

194
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,009
Then what do you think about Han-gyeol?

195
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,047
It's the 21st century.

196
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,516
If you like someone, who cares if...

197
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,020
What am I saying?

198
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,689
I need to use the restroom.

199
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,726
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,931
-Let me see that.
-Wait a minute.

201
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,533
Angel.

202
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,335
Missed calls. Angel.

203
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,937
She has been bombarding you with calls.

204
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,640
She finally realizes your true worth.

205
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,842
I was thinking about calling her today.

206
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,845
If I keep this up,
Eun-sae may never forgive me.

207
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,580
Do you want Eun-sae to be yours or not?

208
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,250
Can Eun-sae be mine?

209
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,021
Just looking at the two of you
makes me feel good.

210
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,391
-Follow me. Just shut up and follow me.
-Where are we going?

211
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,060
Hi, this is the Coffee Prince.

212
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,230
This is Inguk Life Insurance.
Can you make a delivery?

213
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,198
-A delivery?
-What is this?

214
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,602
A pizza parlor?
Why is everyone asking for deliveries?

215
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,171
-This way, please.
-Sure, we can.

216
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,907
30 cups of coffee and 20 waffles?

217
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,176
What time will you need that by?

218
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,580
I'll make the deliveries.
An owner shouldn't be making deliveries.

219
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,183
Why not?

220
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,354
You've changed a lot.
You would have never done this before.

221
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,391
Hey, Eun-chan!

222
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,993
My dear Eun-chan! Come over here.

223
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,828
My stomach is killing me.

224
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,463
You make this delivery!

225
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,864
I need to use the restroom.

226
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,440
WAFFLE

227
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,676
We make deliveries of 20 cups of coffee
or more so call us any time.

228
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,744
Enjoy your coffee.

229
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,680
-We'll definitely be calling you again.
-Thank you.

230
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,183
What's that aroma?

231
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,051
That looks delicious!

232
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,721
-The coffee has such a nice aroma!
-There are waffles, too.

233
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,356
But I'm on a diet.

234
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,790
They smell so good.

235
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,492
This smells delicious!

236
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,428
-I can't wait to dive in.
-The coffee smells amazing!

237
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,431
-What shall I try first?
-This coffee was made by princes.

238
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,466
-Really?
-Yeah!

239
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,471
Boss. I'm impressed, boss.

240
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,773
I bet sales will skyrocket
now that we're making deliveries.

241
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:55,114
Am I not allowed to talk to him either?

242
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,439
Hey!

243
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,041
Get out of my car. Get out!

244
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,912
For crying out loud.

245
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,289
Get out. Get out of my car.

246
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:56,909
Move.

247
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,511
Why can't I come near you?

248
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,846
I said, move.

249
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,649
-If you're going to go, run over me.
-That's what I would love to do!

250
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,219
I would love to run you over
right this moment, do you know that?

251
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,088
How could you play
with my feelings like that?

252
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,923
I thought you liked me!

253
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:12,825
We even became blood brothers!

254
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,046
Did you really wish
that I was your brother?

255
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:36,915
Is that what you want?

256
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,150
I don't want to.

257
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,152
Do you think I wanted to?

258
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,387
You said you didn't want me to be a girl!

259
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,256
I thought you were glad that I was a guy!

260
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,492
What am I supposed to do

261
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,660
when you leave for America next month?

262
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,264
It was great going to the ocean with you.

263
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,834
I was fine by myself.

264
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,103
But look what you've done to me.

265
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,411
Didn't you ask me...

266
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,782
to leave you alone
to get rid of your feelings for me?

267
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,719
I'm asking you to do the same thing.

268
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:16,255
Just leave me alone.

269
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,458
Get in the car.

270
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,765
Aren't you going back to the shop?

271
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,583
I'll only be here for another month.

272
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,185
This will all be over in a month.

273
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,255
I'm going to bear it until then
so you bear it too.

274
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,700
You will be fine when you leave,
won't you?

275
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,670
You won't care about how I'll feel.

276
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,874
Fine.

277
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,444
Then let's be together
for just the remaining month.

278
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:14,980
Shut up.

279
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,616
I swear I'll punch you
if you don't shut up!

280
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,725
"Why?"

281
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,193
I say, "What's up?" and he asks, "Why?"

282
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,562
I ought to kill that jerk!

283
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,099
Eun-sae.

284
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:47,105
I got into a screaming match
with my boss today.

285
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,808
I asked him why he was being so moody

286
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,077
and why he is playing with my feelings.

287
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,916
And he said that his heart
was in pain because of me.

288
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,422
I'm so stupid.

289
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:05,924
If you think about it,

290
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,226
I'm the one who's lying.

291
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:17,235
But I'm the one crying
and screaming at him.

292
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,873
What am I going to do?

293
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,277
I'm putting him through so much pain.

294
00:22:26,878 --> 00:22:30,115
Worrying like that won't solve anything.

295
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,784
You should just tell him the truth.

296
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,853
Your boss
is in love with you too, isn't he?

297
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,255
Didn't you tell me not to tell him?

298
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:40,492
That was because I didn't know
that you were so deeply in love with him.

299
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,962
I might never be able
to see him again if I tell him.

300
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,433
And I'm scared that he'll get mad at me
for lying to him.

301
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,138
I shouldn't keep lying to him like this.

302
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:57,175
But he's going back to America in a month.

303
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,412
Just for one more month,

304
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:06,785
if things could be the way they are...

305
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,628
How do you expect to put on a concert
after only a few rehearsals?

306
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,764
That's why I need your help.

307
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,804
Yoo-joo told me that you cheated on her.
What's all that about?

308
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,574
Are you really in love with someone else?

309
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,642
What if I am?

310
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,911
Are you going to steal Yoo-joo from me?

311
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,115
Maybe I should and we'll elope
to an uninhabited island somewhere.

312
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:38,984
Shut up.

313
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,222
Isn't it funny?

314
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,428
I think it is.

315
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,080
Hey! What the heck
do you think you're doing?

316
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,149
Can't you even keep a beat?

317
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,351
And you!
You can't just pound away like that!

318
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,620
Forget it.

319
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,623
The way we're playing,
they'll just throw rocks at us.

320
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,227
This is a real problem considering
the concert is just around the corner.

321
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,829
This is really great for relieving stress.

322
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:24,996
Let's try it again.

323
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,798
We should at least try not to get stoned.

324
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,467
One, two, three, go!

325
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:29,701
COFFEE PRINCE CONCERT

326
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,209
Hi, boss.

327
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,147
What a racket!

328
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,083
Are you guys trying
to scare off the crows?

329
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,732
Goodness.

330
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,168
How are you doing?

331
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,572
-You seem rather well, ma'am.
-Hey, you.

332
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,608
You should've at least visited me
in the hospital.

333
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:45,477
How could you ignore a sick old woman?

334
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,679
I would have just
ended up raising your blood pressure

335
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:48,780
by visiting you.

336
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,048
You with all your excuses.

337
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,685
She's much better now.
She has even returned to the company.

338
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:54,853
That's a relief to know!

339
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,757
I was worried about how you two slackers
were running the shop

340
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,425
and I'm pleasantly surprised.

341
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,260
I'm impressed with Han-gyeol.

342
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,664
I didn't think he would be up
to the task but...

343
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,335
Have you ever seen me
invest my money without just cause?

344
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,637
But don't tell him what I said.

345
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,607
He's so full of himself that if he finds
out I praised him, it will go to his head.

346
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,708
I see you know him well.

347
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,376
Grandma!

348
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,011
You are here too, mom.

349
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:22,914
I see you've done quite well.

350
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,118
Is there any place here where I could sit?

351
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:29,254
-Of course there is. Take a seat.
-Okay.

352
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,922
Is it all right for you to have coffee?

353
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,257
Of course, it is.

354
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,126
Sit over here, grandma.

355
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:36,828
-And sit over there, mom.
-Okay.

356
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,964
-Two coffees and a slice of cake, right?
-Yes.

357
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,505
Will you take a look at him?

358
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,709
He's quite strong for someone his size.

359
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,544
He looked like a child at the hospital,

360
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:56,081
but he's quite a handsome young man.

361
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:57,349
Hey!

362
00:26:58,650 --> 00:26:59,651
How are you doing?

363
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,021
Hello, ma'am.

364
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:04,823
Hello, ma'am.

365
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,192
I hope you're working hard here.

366
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,128
Of course. I work really hard, ma'am.

367
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:18,770
Are you really planning to go to America?

368
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,472
Of course, I am.

369
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,743
I wish you wouldn't go to America.

370
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:26,811
Couldn't you just stay in Korea?

371
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,481
Why don't we elope together, mom?

372
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,449
You have to keep your promise.

373
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,487
You can't keep your children
by your side forever.

374
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,190
Can I get the check here, please?

375
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:41,226
Okay. Just a minute.

376
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,870
-Don't overexert yourself with your work.
-Stop worrying!

377
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,639
-Okay, grandma?
-Okay.

378
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,077
Watch your head.

379
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,286
I heard everything from your dad.

380
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,889
You must have been so hurt.

381
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,395
I want to go on a trip with you.

382
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,931
Make time for me.

383
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:21,766
Can you do that?

384
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,969
People might think we've eloped together.

385
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,742
-I'll see you later, mom.
-Bye.

386
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:46,177
Why are you acting like a child
towards me?

387
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,279
You said that you didn't like me.

388
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:51,516
That's why I'm going to ignore you
from now on.

389
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,117
I said I didn't like you as a man.

390
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,485
But I like you as a friend.

391
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,386
I don't want to be...

392
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,655
Well...

393
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,524
I don't want to be your friend, Ji-hyang!

394
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,994
Look here! We've been neighbors
for the past seven years

395
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,865
and then suddenly, you ask me
to be your girlfriend and it's awkward.

396
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,600
I've decided to go on blind dates
from now on.

397
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,070
I've decided to give up on you.

398
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,140
Go on your stupid blind dates!

399
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,577
I won't stop you.
How could you be so mean?

400
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,913
You very petty man!

401
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:23,348
Good day!

402
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,119
Jeez!

403
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,856
-Eun-chan!
-What are you doing here?

404
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,192
We're here for the concert.

405
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,127
You guys better watch your mouths!

406
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,629
Don't you worry!

407
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,864
I've made them promise not to tell anyone.

408
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,200
Anyways, where is Seon-gi?

409
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,202
-Break a leg, Eun-chan!
-I wonder where he is?

410
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:45,570
Don't do anything stupid!

411
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,405
Drop the cable, Han-gyeol!

412
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:49,641
Okay!

413
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,444
Cool.

414
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,113
This is impressive.

415
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,347
You're here.

416
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:57,582
Congratulations!

417
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,217
Thanks!

418
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:00,852
Where is Han-gyeol?

419
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,220
He's inside.

420
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,722
Hey, Ha-rim!

421
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:05,957
Han-sung, how are you doing?

422
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:15,600
PRINCE CONCERT
7:30 P.M. TONIGHT AT THE COFFEE PRINCE

423
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,197
APPLAUSE!

424
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:08,619
The lights are so beautiful!

425
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,091
MINI CONCERT OF PRINCES

426
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,130
Hello, everyone!

427
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:27,739
I would like to thank you for coming
to our concert in this hot weather.

428
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,977
I'm DJ Min-yeop, the youngest prince!

429
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,351
Now, introducing the princes
of the Coffee Prince Shop!

430
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:43,888
Here's Everything-Is-Such-a-Bother,
Mr. Hong!

431
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:49,327
Dreamy Han-gyeol!

432
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,598
Eun-chan the Cute Klutz!

433
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,302
Smug Ha-rim!

434
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,441
Waffle Seon-gi!

435
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,345
And last but not least,

436
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,248
who is your favorite prince?

437
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:12,216
Min-yeop!

438
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,818
Thank you very much!

439
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:20,224
We'll begin the first piece of the night!

440
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,492
Hit it!

441
00:35:14,912 --> 00:35:18,583
-Coffee Prince!
-Coffee Prince!

442
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:22,286
-Coffee Prince!
-Coffee Prince!

443
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,422
One, two!

444
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,615
We should have made this place
into a nightclub.

445
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:29,720
Come over here, Eun-chan. And you, too.

446
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,089
It must be nice to be young. Great.

447
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,168
-This way.
-Ha-rim!

448
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,744
What are you doing? Stop it!

449
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:57,014
I said, stop it!

450
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,584
Hey, Seon-gi, let's dance together.

451
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,654
Is this how you do it? Like this?

452
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,361
Like this?

453
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,464
Don't stop!

454
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:15,733
I'm so beat!

455
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,237
I have a present for you.

456
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:20,771
What?

457
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,044
What's this?

458
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,013
It's the first coffee bean
I've ever roasted.

459
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,582
Even though it's not good,
they have sentimental value.

460
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,252
Thanks for helping us out
with the concert.

461
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:35,953
There's something for Sweeper too.

462
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,056
It's a chew toy!

463
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,458
Sweeper will love this.

464
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,027
Is it really all right for me
to take this coffee?

465
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,663
I'm just worried that you might
get a stomachache from it.

466
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,565
I'm still only a beginner.

467
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,967
Thanks.

468
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:53,638
Why do you talk to him
like you're talking to a woman?

469
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,741
Are you into guys, Eun-chan?

470
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,012
You used to come on to me.
Is he your next target?

471
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,284
How do you feel when Eun-chan
acts this way towards you, Han-sung?

472
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:08,653
I like it.

473
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,822
-Really?
-Yes.

474
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,761
I don't really like it.

475
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,332
I'm beginning to feel like
a third wheel around you two.

476
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,000
You guys are acting like a couple.

477
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,569
I wonder if there's anybody for me.

478
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:27,972
Oh, I know!

479
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,141
There's Yoo-joo.

480
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,243
Hey.

481
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,214
I should get going.
I'm not feeling so well.

482
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:38,849
Eun-chan!

483
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,486
Why are you giving him such a hard time?

484
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:44,388
I'm going after him.

485
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,599
You should go.

486
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:58,903
Didn't Yoo-joo say she would visit you?

487
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,340
It's all right.

488
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,580
The boss says
that I shouldn't come to work anymore.

489
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,984
Even Mr. Hong seems to agree with him.

490
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,687
You know what?

491
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,857
I don't want to quit.

492
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,663
I have to make money.

493
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,167
That's an excuse.

494
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:33,804
It's because I like coffee so much.

495
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,641
Actually, that's an excuse, too.

496
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:44,115
He's so warm, caring, and funny.

497
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,653
I like him so much
that I forget that I'm deceiving him.

498
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,158
I know that I shouldn't deceive him.

499
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,494
But I wish...

500
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:04,101
I wish he would just stay by my side.

501
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,438
I wish he would only love me.

502
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,142
I wish he wouldn't go to America.

503
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,448
But just look at me.

504
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,950
I'm not a guy and I'm not a girl either!

505
00:40:20,384 --> 00:40:22,319
I'm too scared to tell him the truth.

506
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:16,507
Choi Han-gyeol!

507
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,383
Thanks for everything.

508
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,788
I'm so tired of saying thanks to everyone.

509
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,158
I'm always saying
thanks day in and day out.

510
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,829
Aren't you tired of being thanked?

511
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:44,468
Good night.

512
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,538
I don't know what this feeling is.

513
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,379
I just like staying by your side
and watching you laugh and cry.

514
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,382
It makes me happy.

515
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:02,720
That's what I like.

516
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:13,998
Promise me one thing.

517
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,068
Act whatever way you want in front of me.

518
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,771
Promise me that you'll never hide

519
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,941
your feelings from me. Okay?

520
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,680
Promise.

521
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,451
I promise.

522
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:54,939
You should go now.

523
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:23,934
Hey.

524
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:25,469
Where are you right now?

525
00:43:25,903 --> 00:43:27,071
I'm on my way home.

526
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:30,174
Is Eun-chan with you?

527
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:37,314
Did you take her home?

528
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,184
Yeah.

529
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:42,686
Really?

530
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,057
I'm with Han-gyeol right now.

531
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,362
They are in love.

532
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,332
Han-gyeol and Eun-chan are in love.

533
00:43:58,202 --> 00:43:59,670
I don't know what to say to that.

534
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:01,872
Should I be comforting you?

535
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,278
No, I'm all right.

536
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:12,149
Okay. Bye.

537
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,640
I'm so sorry, Han-gyeol.

538
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,544
Why are you sorry to me?

539
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,984
You called Han-sung to see him.
Why aren't you meeting him?

540
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:48,919
Are you avoiding each other?

541
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,895
I was hoping that no one would get hurt.

542
00:44:59,663 --> 00:45:01,031
That's too much to ask for.

543
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,449
-Here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

544
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,416
Thank you.

545
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,619
Your performance yesterday was so great.

546
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:24,555
Thank you.

547
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,457
I guess the performance
yesterday really did go well.

548
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,626
Thanks to Han-sung.

549
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,729
Are you close to Han-sung?

550
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,931
Yeah. We see each other often.

551
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,365
What do you do together?

552
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,803
We play with the dog, ride bikes,
eat together,

553
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,172
-and go out for drinks.
-Isn't that a date?

554
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,343
You're a lot closer to men
than you should be.

555
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,768
Men don't usually walk like this.

556
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,637
Then do they walk backward?

557
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,073
Men don't walk leisurely on the grass

558
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,610
like this in their bare feet.

559
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,113
They only do it when they're trying
to impress women.

560
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,051
Here.

561
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,657
DK, I haven't...

562
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,563
The plants in our New York home are dying.

563
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:40,831
I need you to revive them.

564
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,934
I thought you didn't keep plants.

565
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:46,203
Didn't you say you're not good
at keeping them?

566
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:48,438
People are bound to change.

567
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,541
Come and see if you don't believe me.

568
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,611
I guess you're right. People do change.

569
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,414
I'm hungry.

570
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:58,882
Let's get something to eat.

571
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,941
Who are you, sir?

572
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,076
A cook.

573
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,313
How old are you?

574
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,515
Four years old.

575
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:36,253
Mom!

576
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,155
No-eul is here.

577
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:40,791
Mom! No-eul is here.

578
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,498
-Mom!
-Hello! My little No-eul is here.

579
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:51,001
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Have a nice day, ma'am.

580
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,438
-Bye.
-Hi, No-eul. Did you have fun today?

581
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,180
We received a large order.

582
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,049
They want it by 7:30 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

583
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,818
To where?

584
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,587
The stock company near the intersection.

585
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,423
Someone will have to come in really early.

586
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:15,626
I'll do it.

587
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,996
I've already talked to Seon-gi about it.

588
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,762
Look how tiny your waist is.

589
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,699
What are we going to do
with someone this weak?

590
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,938
I'll do it.

591
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,751
Eun-chan!

592
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,055
Take a look at this!

593
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:19,723
What's that?

594
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,559
"Let's meet tomorrow evening at 7:00 p.m.
I'll be waiting for you."

595
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,027
Eun-sae says she'll be waiting for me.

596
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,196
She'll be waiting for me!

597
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:28,732
-Eun-chan!
-Stop it!

598
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,200
Eun-chan!

599
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,069
Let go of me!

600
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,172
Hey, wait a minute!
What is it? Let me see!

601
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:36,740
-Would you like to see, boss?
-Yeah.

602
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:40,877
My angel seems to have given into me
and she wants to meet tomorrow!

603
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,583
What has gotten into him?

604
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,719
Go ahead.

605
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,587
Okay.

606
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,662
I see you are still full of surprises,

607
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,263
showing up like this unexpectedly.

608
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:02,265
It has been 15 years, hasn't it?

609
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:08,005
I didn't think you would,
but you've grown old.

610
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,077
Have you told your mom that I'm here?

611
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,681
Han-gyeol is doing well.

612
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:30,961
I'm about to start a new business venture

613
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:32,929
in Libya.

614
00:50:34,898 --> 00:50:39,436
When things get going there,
I'll be in the Middle East for years.

615
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:43,974
What a great view.

616
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,010
I heard you visited Seoul last year.

617
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,146
Why didn't you call me?

618
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,185
You must miss Han-gyeol.

619
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,892
This coffee has a nice aroma.

620
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,193
It's really delicious.

621
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,294
Really?

622
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,595
Is it really delicious?

623
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:09,166
I roasted it for a long time
and it's a little dark.

624
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,802
I guess you like dark coffee.

625
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:13,737
That's a relief.

626
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,339
Where is Seon-gi?

627
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,408
He is in the restroom.

628
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,914
I'll talk to you later.

629
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,849
Okay. Is Han-gyeol there?

630
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,585
-Yeah.
-Then I'll call you later. Bye.

631
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,025
Hey.

632
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,462
I love the aroma of this coffee.
Can I have some too?

633
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,334
Hey. Who washed this cup?

634
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:48,805
I can't believe what a hard time
that lady's giving me about this cup!

635
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:49,706
What's the matter?

636
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,641
This lady kept complaining
about this dirty cup.

637
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,844
I had to apologize to her,
like, seven times.

638
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,246
God. My ears hurt
from all her complaining.

639
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,948
Who washed this cup?

640
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,584
I don't know.

641
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,352
I think maybe I did.

642
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,055
This is what happens
when you are on the phone all day long!

643
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,058
I'm sorry. I'll shape up, boss.

644
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,160
Do you think sorry is going to cut it?

645
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,394
Stop it, Han-gyeol.

646
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,063
There are customers outside.

647
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:14,731
You clean up tonight.

648
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,501
I'll clean everything spick and span.

649
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,035
I'm sorry.

650
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,043
What a temper.

651
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,690
I just got all the necessary documents.

652
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,361
I'm going to New York with DK.

653
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,364
I think the work will be fun.

654
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,567
And I want to start over with DK.

655
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:55,472
DK says he's still in love with me

656
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,641
and seeing him makes me feel the same way.

657
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,410
I've always been that kind of girl.

658
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,212
You know how fickle I am.

659
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:04,080
I won't let you go.

660
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:07,884
Don't go.

661
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,655
Thanks for saying that.

662
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,223
You're right.

663
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,928
I had feelings for Eun-chan.

664
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,365
Actually, I still do.

665
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,001
But don't leave.

666
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:29,606
I'm going to return to you soon
so you don't go!

667
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,475
They are not just feelings.

668
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,846
You are in love with Eun-chan.

669
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,585
You are so foolish.

670
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,523
You don't even know that
you're in love with someone new.

671
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,630
I don't really want to talk anymore.

672
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,148
-Good night.
-Good night, Mr. Hong.

673
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:15,018
-Let's go out drinking!
-Eun-chan!

674
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,689
I made him clean the shop
because he didn't focus on his job.

675
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:22,659
You guys better not fool around at work!

676
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:23,793
Okay.

677
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,463
Can you massage my back?

678
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,865
-"I'll be waiting for you!"
-That will be 1,000 won.

679
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,900
You're so obsessed with money.

680
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,404
Han-gyeol shows his affection
in a strange way.

681
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,806
Eun-chan is in for a difficult evening
of cleaning.

682
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:41,077
I know. Cleaning the entire coffee shop
is no job for a woman.

683
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:42,279
A woman?

684
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,447
It would be so nice if he were a woman.

685
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:47,884
Leave them alone.
Gender doesn't matter when you're in love.

686
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,322
Do you know something that I don't,
Mr. Hong?

687
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,723
Everybody knows it.

688
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,325
They make a lovely couple.

689
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,093
How can you say such a thing?

690
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,495
Eun-chan is a girl.

691
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,697
There's no reason they can't be together.

692
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,400
And what if she was a guy?

693
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:08,972
Is Eun-chan a girl?

694
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:11,174
It's none of your business.

695
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:12,742
Really?

696
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,879
It's top secret!

697
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,213
You idiot.

698
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,321
-Let's go! Let's go on in!
-Hey!

699
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:28,325
You've got to shape up, Eun-chan!

700
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,795
How can you do such a slack job
just because of a man?

701
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:35,332
You don't even read coffee books anymore!
What are you going to do?

702
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,139
That's strange.

703
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,013
How could you keep that a secret,
Mr. Hong?

704
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:53,516
Do you know how much heartache
Han-gyeol went through so far?

705
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,353
And how could you two do that?

706
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,887
It's strictly between those two.

707
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:01,057
Don't stick your nose
in other people's business.

708
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,459
Are his feelings that serious?

709
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,994
I didn't know
that he was in love with her.

710
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,796
How could you!

711
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,932
He's been going through hell

712
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:10,233
and you've just been laughing.

713
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:13,103
He's just in love with someone,
not dying of cancer.

714
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,572
And the pain that he is feeling
is a good kind of pain.

715
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,006
Just leave them be!

716
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:20,076
He is going through those feelings
because he can, don't you think?

717
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,344
How could you say that?

718
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:22,412
You almost died of love--

719
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,315
I was the happiest I've ever been
as I was dying of love.

720
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,718
Han-gyeol's going to think
the same way later on.

721
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,453
How can you be so self-centered?

722
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,755
I understand Eun-chan.

723
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:33,923
She has to support her poor family.

724
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,925
She did what she had to do for the job.

725
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,828
It's not like she was happy about lying.

726
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,065
Then she should have told the truth
after she got the job!

727
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:43,199
Ha-rim.

728
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,834
Why are you so angry?

729
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,202
You're no better than those two.

730
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,104
You fooled us.

731
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,975
-What a jerk.
-Get his phone.

732
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,378
Ha-rim!

733
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:56,980
Sit down.

734
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:59,482
-Hey! Let go of me!
-Open the door.

735
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,286
Calm down, Ha-rim!

736
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,789
Open the door! Open the damn door!

737
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,725
Hey! The neighbors might call the police.

738
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:13,830
Han-gyeol!

739
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:15,765
Han-gyeol!

740
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:17,600
Han-gyeol!

741
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:19,335
Han-gyeol!

742
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,750
Why did you come back?

743
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,924
I wasn't trying to ruin the mural.

744
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:50,193
I was just touching it up.

745
00:59:53,523 --> 00:59:54,657
Just once...

746
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,596
I'm going to tell you
this just once so listen closely.

747
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,501
I love you.

748
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:11,374
Whether you're a guy

749
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,077
or an alien,

750
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:16,512
I don't care anymore.

751
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,521
It's just too difficult for me
to forget about you.

752
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,027
So let's take this all the way.

753
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,635
All the way.

754
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:15,805
Why did we both have to be men, Eun-chan?

755
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:21,477
I feel this aching and heaviness
in my heart as if it were full of ice.

756
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:24,247
I'm leaving a little early
because of DK's schedule.

757
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:25,915
We're leaving next Sunday.

758
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:27,884
Do you really know how I feel?

759
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,887
I mean if you think about it,
there's no evidence that he's a man.

760
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:32,555
Have you ever seen her ID, Han-gyeol?

761
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:34,657
Why didn't you tell me
that Eun-chan is a girl?

762
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,160
What if you didn't want to see me again?

763
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,029
Because I have to see you again.

764
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,976
