1
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,262
You got hurt!

2
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,263
Are you very close?

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,164
She's a habit.

4
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,432
I just can't bear not seeing her.

5
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,135
I try, but I keep going to see her.
It's a bad habit.

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,469
Sounds like you really like her.

7
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,304
We'll go with "Coffee Prince."

8
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,007
There will be three to four workers,
all princes, just like the café name.

9
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,308
Prince? Guys?

10
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,276
What about me?

11
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,310
You lied to me, didn't you?

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,211
Min-yeop!

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,913
Order the coffee beans.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,182
What do you mean,
20 pieces of 20-kilo bags?

15
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,884
Send the 14 million won
by the end of the day.

16
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,519
-I'm sorry.
-Do you think this is a joke?

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,487
Your mistake may kill the shop.

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,655
Don't you feel guilty at all?

19
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,190
I apparently misjudged you.

20
00:00:57,257 --> 00:01:00,427
If you're going to keep fooling around,
just quit right now!

21
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,900
You finally seem human.

22
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,170
You were always too chill.

23
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,808
You didn't take life seriously,
and did everything half-heartedly.

24
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:18,144
But you seemed different today.

25
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,281
I liked it, Choi Han-gyeol.

26
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,819
Sorry, but I don't think
I can drive you home today.

27
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,088
I should get back.

28
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:32,025
Let's walk for a while.

29
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,796
When you're in a bad mood,

30
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,867
you should swing your arms like this
and take big steps.

31
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,703
It will make you feel better.

32
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,239
Like this!

33
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,617
How could he be so mean?

34
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,187
Especially in front of that girl.

35
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,894
Hey.

36
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,230
Didn't I say two-kilo bags?

37
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,164
Say something.

38
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,699
You meathead.

39
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,701
Did I say 2kg or 20kg?

40
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:18,104
I don't know. I really can't remember.

41
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,408
You called out the phone number
so quickly.

42
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,676
I didn't write it down.

43
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,080
What's the point in arguing?

44
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,115
I shouldn't have trusted you with it
in the first place.

45
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,417
Just go home.

46
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,219
Okay.

47
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,962
Eun-chan, let's roast the beans.

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,231
What are you doing?

49
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,566
Come over here.

50
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,173
We specially imported beans
which aren't sold domestically,

51
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,241
so it will cost us money to return them.

52
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,110
That's why we can't take them back.

53
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,280
Grandma, are you busy?

54
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,849
You must be busier than I am,
so why are you calling?

55
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,418
No reason. I just wanted to chat
with my grandma.

56
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,153
How's the café coming along?

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,355
Everything's going smoothly, of course.

58
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:10,990
You'll come to the grand opening, right?

59
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,892
I heard that you bought
20 bags of coffee beans.

60
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,327
How will you use them all?

61
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,329
Will you bake with them?

62
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,731
News really travels fast.

63
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,900
You probably don't have money left.

64
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,368
Do you want me to lend you money?

65
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,204
My interest rate is ten percent.

66
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,573
Buy them from me. They're of high quality.

67
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,473
Forget it.

68
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,010
Our company sells coffee beans.
What would I do with them?

69
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,579
Then I have nothing to say.

70
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,214
Goodbye.

71
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,254
He's all worked up.

72
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,892
Why am I drooling like this?

73
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,801
What are you doing?

74
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,170
Han-gyeol! Look, I designed the package.

75
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,041
Why are you roasting the fresh beans?

76
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:05,111
Well-roasted coffee beans can be sold
at ten times their price.

77
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,713
It's 20 bags.

78
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,147
Small profits, quick returns.

79
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,550
With my skills, we won't lose money.

80
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,653
I will handle the deliveries.

81
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,390
Hello? Hyeong-min!

82
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,394
Of course, it is 100% arabica beans.
You know I don't sell cheap stuff.

83
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,597
What? You want a sample?

84
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,201
Don't you trust my roasting expertise?

85
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,403
Forget it then.

86
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,339
Samples, my foot.

87
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,711
Eun-chan, pack 1kg bags
and load them onto the scooter.

88
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,481
I'll call you when I get the orders,
so deliver them right away.

89
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,750
Why aren't you answering?

90
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,151
Okay.

91
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:46,386
Ha-rim.

92
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,155
Send 100g bags to the nearby shops.
Tell them it is a free sample.

93
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,124
-Don't forget to promote our shop.
-Okay.

94
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,925
Min-yeop, pack 1kg bags and load the car.

95
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,627
-I'll deliver them now.
-Okay.

96
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,699
Hello, Mr. Um. This is Choi Han-gyeol.

97
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,567
I have a little favor to ask you.

98
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,937
May I get a list of retailers
that Dongin supplies?

99
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,673
Rascal.

100
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,975
He's quick on his feet.

101
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,544
Thank you.

102
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:20,586
Thank you.

103
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:21,654
COFFEE PRINCE

104
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,232
Why would my roasting skills
have gotten rusty?

105
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,967
You punk. How dare you...

106
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,170
How old are you?

107
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,772
Yes. Just give it a taste.

108
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,107
Hello?

109
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,543
No, they are free samples.

110
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,114
Yes. Thank you.

111
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,095
KARAOKE

112
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,598
Hey, it's over this way.

113
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,368
Get on.

114
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,352
Cool. You're done already.

115
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,154
Thanks.

116
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,056
I had fun.

117
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:32,725
So, what happened with the beans?

118
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,660
We still have 14 sacks left.

119
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,030
What?

120
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,433
You were super cool today.

121
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,002
Hey, Eun-chan.

122
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:45,638
Eun-chan.

123
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,040
Hey, Eun-chan!

124
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,180
Have you been repenting?

125
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:59,185
If you make another mistake like that,
you're fired.

126
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,086
Got it?

127
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,523
What's with the attitude?

128
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,926
You're incorrigible.

129
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,597
Do you know how many people
suffered today because of you?

130
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,001
Round one, start!

131
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,703
You take no responsibility
for your mistakes,

132
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,439
you have no consideration
for the others...

133
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,010
If you're going to keep this up, get out.
I don't need you.

134
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,748
You refuse to apologize.

135
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:31,050
Han-gyeol, don't be like that.

136
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,686
Relax.

137
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,887
Answer me!

138
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,193
Hey!

139
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,461
Boss!

140
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,896
It was my fault.

141
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,936
I was the one
who ordered the coffee beans.

142
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:54,207
I can't remember whether Eun-chan said
2kg or 20kg,

143
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,677
but I heard 20kg, so... I'm really sorry.

144
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,958
Does he think my employment is a joke?

145
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,560
It's not even a big deal.

146
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,128
He should just get mad and move on,

147
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,798
but he keeps telling me to leave.

148
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,643
May I sit with you?

149
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,251
I had a similar experience

150
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,953
when I was terribly wronged.

151
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,557
When I was in high school,

152
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:50,530
there was a flasher who would appear
near the fence during lunchtime.

153
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,332
That day, the flasher appeared again,

154
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,270
and all other kids were screaming
out the window at him.

155
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,806
To be honest, I wanted to look too,

156
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,644
but I was too embarrassed, and I figured
there wouldn't be much to see.

157
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,180
So I pretended to study.

158
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:12,885
Then suddenly, the girls yelled,
"It's Heo Jeong-wu!"

159
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,623
He was our handsome, single gym teacher.

160
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,125
I had a big crush on him.

161
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,528
So I burrowed my way through the others

162
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,263
and asked, "Where? Where?"

163
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,567
Then someone pulled me by my ear.

164
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,169
I hit the hand away, going,
"Who's doing that?"

165
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,005
And it was my physics teacher,

166
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
whom I liked even more than Mr. Heo,
grabbing my ear.

167
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:40,680
He said, "You punk. You naughty girl.
What are you trying to see?

168
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,082
Do you want to see it that badly?"

169
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,987
You must've been humiliated.

170
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,523
I was humiliated and felt so wronged.

171
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,491
It's still humiliating.

172
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,062
Want to know how to get rid of a flasher?

173
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:04,103
Flashers get more excited
the more you scream.

174
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,706
So you shouldn't scream
if you run into one.

175
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:12,945
And stare right at his you-know-what
like it's nothing. Like this.

176
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,251
Keep your eyes steady
and say this while looking at it.

177
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,389
"That's all?"

178
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,299
You seem pretty cool.

179
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,534
You're pretty,

180
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,903
and you're a good artist.

181
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,806
You even have a great personality.

182
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,608
Well,

183
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,677
I am kind of cool like that.

184
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,783
When I was in high school,
I liked art, too.

185
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:57,289
Actually, it wasn't art,
but the art teacher that I liked.

186
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,492
She must have been very pretty.

187
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,863
He was single and was so good-looking.

188
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,599
It's all right.

189
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,435
I also liked a female teacher before.

190
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,906
I liked her so much,
that I wished I was a guy.

191
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,012
Excuse me.

192
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,117
-Hey, what's up?
-You idiot.

193
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,320
I was about to leave. Have you eaten yet?

194
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,057
Why is Han-gyeol hung up on a woman
who likes another guy?

195
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:33,592
My Chan, your eyes are all puffy.

196
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,361
You're still pretty, though.

197
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,563
Stop it. You're grossing me out.

198
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,699
You are exactly my type.
Where are you going?

199
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,235
You are at fault too.

200
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,737
Mr. Hong told you to do it.

201
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,272
Why did you pass it onto Min-yeop?

202
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:48,674
You should have done it yourself.

203
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,776
Although Min-yeop made a mistake,

204
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,578
you and Mr. Hong are at fault, too.

205
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,080
Am I wrong?

206
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,681
And of course, you're blameless.

207
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,783
Stop grumbling like some chick.

208
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,951
Let go. I'm leaving.

209
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,954
Punk. Seriously.

210
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,224
-Get him.
-Paddle back!

211
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,392
Stop being angry.

212
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,527
Min-yeop! Paddle back!

213
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,733
Say, "I will work harder in the future!"

214
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,601
-Come on.
-Stop it!

215
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,741
If you're not mad anymore,
it's all good? That hurts!

216
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,711
Maybe we were too hard on him. Hey.

217
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,248
The line is busy. Your call will be
forwarded to voicemail.

218
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,516
Come on, answer the phone.

219
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,018
Please leave a message after the beep.

220
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,956
At every interview, they ask
what do I intend to draw next.

221
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:40,092
The honest answer is, "I don't know."

222
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,694
How should I answer?

223
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,562
I think you should still say
you don't know.

224
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,997
That's the truth.

225
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,065
Sweeper!

226
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,368
Hey, boy!

227
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,637
-Sweeper smells!
-Who is that?

228
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,139
Oh, it's Terry's friend.

229
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,974
-I'll call you back.
-Good boy.

230
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,644
Let's howl together.

231
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,317
-Why isn't he howling?
-Terry, sit.

232
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,522
He's responding late today.

233
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,224
Good boy!

234
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:13,893
I tried calling you.

235
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,227
Really?

236
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,429
I must have been on the phone.

237
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,664
Why did you call?

238
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,800
I was kind of feeling down.

239
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,035
And I missed Sweeper.

240
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,103
Just Sweeper?

241
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,312
I'm so bitter that the beer tastes sweet.

242
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,647
Why are you feeling down?

243
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,520
Something really unfair happened
to me today.

244
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,058
This guy thinks that this girl is a guy.

245
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,594
One is the employer,
the other is the employee.

246
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,963
At first, he praised the employee

247
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:56,635
for being hardworking and responsible.

248
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,507
But then, he screamed at the girl,
whom he thinks is a guy,

249
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,578
saying that she's worthless and stuff.

250
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,479
Hold on. For convenience sake,

251
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,216
let's say Guy 1 and Girl 2.

252
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,151
Guy 1 is the boss,

253
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,687
and Girl 2 is the employee, right?

254
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,089
Yes.

255
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,657
Does Girl 2 like Guy 1?

256
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,292
No, that's not it.

257
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,668
They're like friends,
but they're boss and employee.

258
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:35,174
They're a guy and girl,
but they're not in love.

259
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,543
They're just, you know...

260
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,577
"Just"?

261
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,079
"Just" what?

262
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,648
Just...

263
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,284
"Just" what?

264
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,988
Just... That's all. Nothing more.

265
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,458
There's nothing more because...

266
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:56,862
To Girl 2,

267
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:01,133
Guy A is...

268
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,279
Wow, there are so many stars.

269
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,483
It was rainy for a while,
but there are so many stars out today.

270
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,387
I'm so jealous of you.

271
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,223
No matter how tough life gets,

272
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,427
you can still look at the sky
and the stars,

273
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,930
and smile like a little kid.

274
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,266
Life must be so nice then.

275
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,001
I can't be like that.

276
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,070
It's a compliment.

277
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,175
Let's drink.

278
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:44,944
Cheers!

279
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,618
Did you spill again?

280
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,555
I'm a little clumsy.

281
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,626
You didn't have to walk me home.

282
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,162
I could have walked home by myself.

283
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,397
I know you don't mean it.

284
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,465
We're here.

285
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,566
This is my place.

286
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,836
How pretty.

287
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,540
Thank you for walking me home.

288
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:18,510
Actually, it's the first time
someone walked me home.

289
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,512
Call me anytime.

290
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,281
I will walk you home.

291
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:25,784
You remind me of my dad.

292
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,358
Girl B is lucky. Right, Sweeper?

293
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,660
I'll buy you something yummy next time.

294
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,228
Paw.

295
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:37,930
This paw too.

296
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,698
Goodbye.

297
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:40,599
Good night.

298
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,301
Go on in.

299
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,870
Let's go.

300
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,108
Get back safely!

301
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,386
Doesn't she put you in a good mood?

302
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,353
Right?

303
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,990
Let's go.

304
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,805
Jerk!

305
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,393
Is that job still available?

306
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,496
I thought you couldn't work
for other people.

307
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,565
They confiscated my stand.

308
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:49,635
Do you want to join us?

309
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,170
If not, why would I have come?

310
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,740
Say hi. He'll be in charge
of the side menu.

311
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,476
-I'm No Seon-gi.
-I'm Koh Eun-chan.

312
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:00,145
I loved your waffles.
It's so good to see you.

313
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,413
I am Jin Ha-rim.

314
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,148
-How old are you?
-I'm 25.

315
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,783
Wow, we're the same age.

316
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,018
Let's be friends.

317
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,388
Hey, Min Yeop.
Come say hi to our new coworker.

318
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,656
Coworker?

319
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,459
What's with the guys here?

320
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:17,062
I can't tell
whether you're a guy or a girl.

321
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,664
You too.

322
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,265
Are you a gorilla or a human?

323
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:27,306
Do I have to work with these buffoons?

324
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,410
Hey, what did you just say?

325
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,945
Did you just rag on me?

326
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,012
What the heck are you?

327
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,581
Are you Japanese or Korean?

328
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,982
What do you care?

329
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,351
He's a patriot, desu.

330
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,955
He cries when he hears
the national anthem, desu.

331
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,224
But he loves Japanese food, desu.

332
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,359
In other words, he's a birdbrain, desu.

333
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:49,428
What are you saying?

334
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,097
I understood. How could you not?

335
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,298
Come with me.

336
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,334
You understood him fine?

337
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,735
Who is he?

338
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,537
The one in charge of the side orders.

339
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,272
Get rid of him.

340
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,041
We don't need side dishes
at a coffee place.

341
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,443
I'm the boss. Come with me.

342
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:06,645
Why you little...

343
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,469
YOO-JOO

344
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,371
They're spray carnations.

345
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,673
Once you touch them, they will glisten.

346
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,679
Where are you?

347
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,748
You know...

348
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:44,850
It's really nice.

349
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,884
What is?

350
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,322
The person who just asked, "What is?"

351
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,959
Hold on for a sec.

352
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,328
Listen.

353
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,301
Someday in the distant future

354
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,103
This sunlight

355
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,173
Will remember

356
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,278
The trip I took

357
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,014
To visit you

358
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,518
My beautiful love

359
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:24,122
Somewhere

360
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:26,925
In a faraway sea

361
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:31,263
Or in that sky

362
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,000
Please cherish

363
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,869
Our precious

364
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,940
Memories

365
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,011
Blindingly blue

366
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,680
You are

367
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,985
My ocean

368
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,922
If I reach out

369
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,558
Your dreams crumbled

370
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,762
Like waves on the shore

371
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,833
I plan to take a trip

372
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,569
A deep trip

373
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:14,973
Into the sea

374
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,710
I will wash my body

375
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,446
In the soft silvery water

376
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,450
And go to you

377
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,588
Blindingly blue

378
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,391
You are

379
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,762
My ocean

380
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:40,499
If I reach out

381
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,302
Your dreams crumbled

382
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:47,572
Like waves on the shore

383
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,476
Do you know

384
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,546
That I love you

385
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:58,884
Very much

386
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:03,722
Hug me

387
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,458
Warmly

388
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:10,962
Please

389
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:14,766
Hello?

390
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,173
I'm getting sad...

391
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,344
in case...

392
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,480
it will hurt later on...

393
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,316
when I hear this song.

394
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,812
Will you just look at him eat.

395
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,347
That's practically raw.

396
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,949
He eats it as soon as
it touches the grill.

397
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,117
Why aren't you eating?

398
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,719
I'm not eating
because my angel likes thin guys.

399
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,454
-So what?
-Poor you.

400
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:15,727
What's up with him?

401
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,462
Are you curious about him?

402
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,730
This is what he's like.

403
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,041
He's so Eun-chan-esque.

404
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,844
What does it mean to be Eun-chan-esque?

405
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,581
Eating food exceeding the volume
and weight containable.

406
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,851
Knocking into an item within
a two-meter radius and breaking it.

407
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,654
Not feeling pain even when injured.

408
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:44,890
Thus, Eun-chan-esque.

409
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,725
Eun-chan-like. Eun-chanly.

410
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:51,430
What do you think?
Do you like it, My Chan?

411
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:56,868
I like that. Eun-chan-esque,
Eun-chan-like, Eun-chanly.

412
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,373
What about Han-gyeol-esque?

413
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,209
Faking being fair, but overworking people,

414
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,077
and screaming in front of people.

415
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,813
To describe pompous bastards.

416
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,881
Han-gyeol-esque, Han-gyeol-like,
Han-gyeolly.

417
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:10,882
Pompous?

418
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,052
That's pretty good.

419
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,690
Han-gyeol-esque. I like how
it describes a pompous bastard.

420
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,994
What? Are you offended?

421
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,866
Let's just eat quietly.

422
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:29,067
Good idea.

423
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:33,238
It's our first company dinner.
Let's all get along, okay?

424
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,041
Can we get another bottle of soju here?

425
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:37,042
Okay.

426
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,893
What the heck? Are you crazy?

427
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,396
Don't do it! Don't you dare!

428
00:24:58,463 --> 00:25:02,434
Hey! No! Not there! No! Not my big toe!

429
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,137
Boss.

430
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,279
Go away!

431
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,314
What are you doing?

432
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,859
You asshole! Are you mad?

433
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,395
What the hell?

434
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,564
You are so dead!

435
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,234
You asshole!

436
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,204
What a pervert!

437
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,540
That perverted bastard
went after his lips this time.

438
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,707
Hey, Min-yeop!

439
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:45,544
What do you think you're doing?
Eun-chan is mine!

440
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,612
How is he yours? He's mine.

441
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,817
-You're getting what you deserve.
-What do you think you're doing?

442
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:53,752
What the hell?

443
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,654
-Why you!
-Stop it.

444
00:25:57,489 --> 00:25:58,356
Here's more!

445
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:01,526
-Mr. Hong! The garlic!
-It stings!

446
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,933
-Water!
-Here.

447
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,334
Water.

448
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,543
Did you enjoy it?

449
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,547
Did you enjoy your kiss with Min-yeop?

450
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,117
You're blushing.

451
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,285
Did it make you hot?

452
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,420
Was it electric?

453
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,224
Not as much as with you.

454
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,630
Min-yeop is not my type, you are.

455
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,165
Didn't you know?

456
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,734
Stop it. You're grossing me out.

457
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,503
I don't like you either.

458
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,105
You're the one who started it.

459
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,975
When will I ever go to New York
at this rate?

460
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,876
Are you going to New York?

461
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,512
Why? When? What for?

462
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,714
What is it to you?

463
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,683
Everything you say is such a turnoff.

464
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,187
When was I ever a turn on?

465
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,032
Hey.

466
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:15,834
Are you really going...

467
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:19,604
Forget it.

468
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:27,379
Wait.

469
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,049
What?

470
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,121
Good night.

471
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,925
Stupid.

472
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,719
COFFEE PRINCE

473
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,970
COFFEE PRINCE SHOP NO.1

474
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,105
ANGEL

475
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:44,048
COFFEE PRINCE
GRAND OPENING

476
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:46,484
Straighten your name tag, Eun-chan.

477
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,987
How about a speech?

478
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,389
You should give a speech to the troops.

479
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,124
Can't you stop picking your nose?

480
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,492
What if the customers see you?

481
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,161
Okay.

482
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,699
Coffee.

483
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:02,600
Prince!

484
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,804
You should say, "Prince."

485
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,172
-Prince!
-Prince!

486
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,842
-Prince!
-Prince!

487
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,028
Enjoy your coffee.

488
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,932
My son, Mom's here!

489
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:35,466
Over here!

490
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:39,737
Why did you come?

491
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,674
Don't look at me. Mom dragged me here.
Can't you tell by my sweats?

492
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,442
This place is completely different.

493
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,379
I don't know how well it will do
given the location.

494
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,481
Stop with the negativity!

495
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:51,816
Did I say anything?

496
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,985
I didn't hear anything.

497
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,461
Angel.

498
00:31:04,395 --> 00:31:05,496
I drew this.

499
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,731
Are you stupid?

500
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:07,899
My head is not that big!

501
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,902
Well, I was going to draw just your head,

502
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,338
but then I decided
to draw your arms and legs, too.

503
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,109
Angel.

504
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,714
Oh, my! This café is so nice!

505
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,183
It's perfect!

506
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,218
-Hey, Ji-hyang.
-Hi!

507
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,988
Ji-hyang. I think we should get going.

508
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,923
It's going to get hot out pretty soon.

509
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,326
And I don't want you
to burn your beautiful skin

510
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,362
in the scorching afternoon sun.

511
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,299
Since we're out, why don't we stroll
around the Promenade of Love?

512
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,134
Stop bothering her.

513
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,570
Why would you want to stroll with her

514
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,338
if you're worried
about her getting sunburned?

515
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:49,807
Mom, I have to work, so you should go.

516
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,277
Go ahead and work. I won't bother you.

517
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:57,348
I don't know
if it's because of the uniform,

518
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,284
but you look extra handsome today.

519
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,020
Don't I know it!

520
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,056
Why don't we go and see
what's on the second floor?

521
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,224
Good idea.

522
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,959
There's nothing to see
on the second floor.

523
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,662
That's what we're going to see. Let's go.

524
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,000
"That's what we're going to see." Freak.

525
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:21,539
Don't they have rice cakes?

526
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,776
They should. Don't they serve rice cakes
at grand openings?

527
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,611
Let's pack all this food.

528
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,212
-Stop packing the food!
-It's all right.

529
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,315
All this food will go to waste anyway.

530
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:33,518
Do you mind if I take this home?

531
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,520
Han-gyeol's family is arriving.

532
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,425
Look at that car.

533
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,392
Hi, Grandma.

534
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,395
Hi, Mom.

535
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,964
This place looks fantastic!

536
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:47,332
Good work, son.

537
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,802
His mother is really pretty.
She looks like royalty.

538
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,670
She's nothing short of royalty.

539
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,405
She's the wife
of the owner of Dongin Foods.

540
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:59,110
She grew up in a rich family
and married into a rich family.

541
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,545
Of course, she's pretty.

542
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,479
Then,

543
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,982
is our boss really the heir
to Dongin Foods?

544
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,050
I'm quite close to the chairman.

545
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,653
That's why she entrusted me
with her problematic grandson,

546
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,355
although I kept refusing.

547
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:15,660
If this were the olden age, I'm like
the tutor teaching the crown prince.

548
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:18,830
I should go say hi.

549
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,566
Crown prince?

550
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,671
Mister!

551
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,173
Hey!

552
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,274
What is he doing here?

553
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,014
-This mural is by Yoo-joo, Mom.
-She's quite talented.

554
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,482
Grandma! Auntie.

555
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,683
Come over here.

556
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,751
Congratulations.

557
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,319
-Thank you.
-Hi, Han-sung.

558
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,121
I'm sorry I'm late.

559
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,856
-The traffic was really bad.
-Glad you made it.

560
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,790
-Grandma.
-Yes?

561
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:48,993
-So did you pay for the mural?
-Mister!

562
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,628
-Mister!
-Yoo-joo did it for free.

563
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,231
-You good for nothing boy...
-Mister!

564
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,067
-Sit down, Han-sung.
-Yes, sit.

565
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,902
-Okay.
-Bring another chair here.

566
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,773
Mister! Don't talk about me.
Don't mention me at all.

567
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:05,810
Don't talk about me!

568
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:12,917
It's a real work of art.
The art may be better than the coffee.

569
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,353
It looks real.

570
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,188
My gosh.

571
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,526
Hello, mister.

572
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:22,860
Where are you?

573
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,796
I'm near the entrance. By the door.

574
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,165
Then listen to what I say carefully
and don't answer back, okay?

575
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,066
Okay.

576
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,034
-Don't answer back.
-What?

577
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,036
Don't ask anything!

578
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:36,741
Start walking and keep going straight.
Just keep going straight.

579
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,708
Keep going.

580
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,746
Now, do you see the food?
Take a left there. A left!

581
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,314
Now if you walk a little bit,

582
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,883
you'll see a big tree and flowers.

583
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,253
Now, go left! Make a left turn,
now, from there...

584
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,122
Hurry up, mister!

585
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,023
Hey.

586
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,724
What in the world are you doing?

587
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,594
Did you talk about me or not?

588
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,296
-What?
-Do you know our boss?

589
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,330
Yes.

590
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,531
How do you know him?

591
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,600
He's my cousin.

592
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,237
Then do this for me.

593
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,805
Can you pretend to not know me?

594
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:08,906
What?

595
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,709
I lied to him to get a job here.

596
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,111
About what? Your age?

597
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,514
He was only hiring guys.

598
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:17,748
So...

599
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,819
Anyway, if my boss finds out
that I'm a girl, he'll fire me.

600
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,322
So don't tell him that
I'm a girl no matter what.

601
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:25,823
Please.

602
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,125
What are you talking about?

603
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,794
How could he think you're a guy?
You're clearly a girl.

604
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,230
Han-gyeol really thinks you're a guy?

605
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,533
He's probably pretending not to know.

606
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,237
He really doesn't know. He thought
that I was a guy from the beginning...

607
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:43,307
My head's spinning.
What crappy luck is this?

608
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,375
Wait a minute.

609
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:48,079
So Guy-1 is Han-gyeol, and you're Girl-2?

610
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:50,214
For real?

611
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,983
How could you laugh?

612
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,986
-I'm about to lose my mind!
-Okay.

613
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,457
Actually, you look good in that.

614
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,591
Mister!

615
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,692
Okay, I'm sorry.

616
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,562
You'll keep my secret, right?

617
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:05,830
-Promise me.
-Okay.

618
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:06,731
Promise!

619
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:09,967
-Okay. I promise.
-Don't tell him, okay?

620
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,904
I'm going to trust you
and go back to work, okay?

621
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,072
Wait for a little
and come back later. Bye.

622
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:22,446
Come in.

623
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:30,087
COFFEE PRINCE
GRAND OPENING

624
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,089
Good work, everyone!

625
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:32,990
Good work!

626
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,159
-Good night!
-Good night!

627
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,764
Boss.

628
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,401
I had fun today.

629
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:46,804
Also, thank you for forgiving me
for ordering the bean incorrectly.

630
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:47,939
I'll see you tomorrow.

631
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,951
Oh, not again.

632
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,589
Hey, runt. Get in. I'll give you a lift.

633
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,591
I'm fine. It will start
after a few more tries.

634
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,926
I'm tired. Just get in already.

635
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,362
Why won't it start?

636
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,131
Hi, Yoo-joo.

637
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:15,833
Right now?

638
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:17,101
Okay.

639
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,769
Okay. See you there.

640
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,873
Sorry, but something urgent came up.
I need to go.

641
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,676
Can't you drop me off on the way?

642
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,677
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:28,913
I'm really sorry!

644
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,120
Look at him take off.

645
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:45,696
Thanks for the present. And I have news.

646
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,165
Everyone loved your mural today.

647
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:50,234
Sorry I couldn't make it.

648
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,738
But I'm the first person
to give you a birthday gift, aren't I?

649
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:55,273
There's still one more week.

650
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,041
I'm giving you a gift today

651
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,010
so you can enjoy counting
the days up to your birthday.

652
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,745
Want to come in for some coffee?

653
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,380
I'm too tired.

654
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,749
I'm so tired that I can't think straight.

655
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,486
What if I suddenly grab your hand?

656
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,621
Punk.

657
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,630
Don't.

658
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,637
Bye.

659
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,585
KEEP LAUGHING JUST LIKE THAT!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY. YOO-JOO

660
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,032
THANKS, BEAUTIFUL

661
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,905
My Chan, my...

662
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,841
Hey!

663
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:44,809
Welcome!

664
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,278
Someone's ready to work.

665
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,213
I'm bored. Let's play.

666
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,281
This isn't a playground.

667
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,950
How could we not have a single customer?

668
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,619
They flocked to this place
when we were serving free coffee.

669
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,321
Where are they now?

670
00:40:58,989 --> 00:40:59,824
Hey!

671
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,759
You're still seeing Eun-sae, aren't you?

672
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:05,129
What is he babbling about?
I'm already not in a good mood.

673
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:07,865
Hey, come out. Let's duke it out!

674
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,334
Come out!

675
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,306
It's a fight!

676
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:16,640
Hey!

677
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,078
We'll compete to see who can dig faster.

678
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:22,580
Come on.

679
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:24,048
You go first.

680
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,316
Fine.

681
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,826
You need to be quicker than that!

682
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:43,968
He's really good.

683
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,736
He's a digging machine!

684
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,544
You're the best!

685
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,457
I finished in 30 minutes.
It's your turn now.

686
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,660
Come on, dig! I'm so tired.

687
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,903
Let's bury him!

688
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,707
Let's run away!

689
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:24,975
Aren't you going to dig?

690
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,251
I'm going to start.

691
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,153
Ready, go!

692
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,128
Eun-chan! Drink more. He's catching up.

693
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,362
Oh, okay!

694
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,805
You have to drink more!

695
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,006
I can't drink anymore!

696
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,776
Come on! Quickly!

697
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,623
Mr. Hong!

698
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:14,558
Mr. Hong!

699
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,761
-Mr. Hong!
-Yes?

700
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,497
Where is everyone? The cafê's empty.

701
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:21,899
What?

702
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,201
Where did they all go?

703
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,404
They went off to play basketball.

704
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:28,906
Let me sleep!

705
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,878
You go out to play because it's slow?

706
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,515
You left the café completely empty!

707
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:42,753
You must think it's the same
as cutting class.

708
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:43,988
Okay.

709
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,725
I'll treat you all
like the delinquents you are!

710
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,295
You like playing basketball, right?

711
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,299
Fine, then let's play.

712
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,268
I'm sorry, Han... I mean, boss!

713
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,437
Can't you let it slide just this once?

714
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,874
Min-yeop, Eun-chan.

715
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,209
You guys like to compete, right?

716
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,444
You two be a team, and I'll play alone.

717
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,912
We'll play for an hour straight!

718
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,948
If you take a break or forfeit,
you're dead.

719
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,051
What are you waiting for?
Aren't you going to play?

720
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,755
You're a crybaby who sulks for days
if you get scolded.

721
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:20,190
What? Are you going to cry again?

722
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:24,261
Let's start.

723
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,466
What the heck?

724
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,302
Do we have to hold this position
for an hour?

725
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,954
Put it in. Come on!

726
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:28,992
Put me down!

727
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,543
I can't... I can't do it.

728
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,888
Get up.

729
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:04,394
I'm so tired.

730
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,066
Can't I take a shot?

731
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,641
I'm so tired.

732
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:47,771
Time's up.

733
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,581
I'm impressed, Eun-chan.

734
00:46:58,582 --> 00:46:59,483
What?

735
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,086
You did well, not giving up
until the very end.

736
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:08,625
Here.

737
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:19,837
You just figured that out?

738
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,044
I thought my head was going to explode
from all the blood rushing to it.

739
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:28,145
Right?

740
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,915
Boss, I'm really sorry about today.

741
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,686
Also, I won't compete with him again.

742
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,389
What am I doing here?

743
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,592
You're speaking Japanese again!

744
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,727
Boss.

745
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,195
Let's do a cheer!

746
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,797
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

747
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,565
-We can do it!
-Forget it.

748
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,300
-Coffee Prince!
-Coffee Prince!

749
00:47:58,141 --> 00:48:01,011
Let me triple Grandma's investment!

750
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,070
I hope nobody saw me.

751
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,540
Those guys must be crazy,
playing in a fountain like that.

752
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,508
Min-yeop!

753
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,744
-Thank goodness I wore this.
-Clean this up!

754
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:35,712
Okay!

755
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,514
Min-yeop.

756
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,186
I'm completely soaked.

757
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,222
It's all your fault.

758
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:48,158
We had fun, so stop whining.

759
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,099
What the heck? Is this broken?

760
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,303
That locker is malfunctioning
just like its owner.

761
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:00,971
Move.

762
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,079
Oh, my gosh!

763
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:13,116
Surprise! I win this time.

764
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:17,354
Eun-chan scores a KO in overtime.

765
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:21,224
My chips! That jerk ate them all!

766
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,294
We haven't had a customer all day long.

767
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:27,698
We wasted money renovating the café.

768
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:30,600
How can we triple the investment
in three months?

769
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,670
Triple the investment? What do you mean?

770
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:35,639
That bastard.

771
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:38,208
If he doesn't go to the US,
he'll just join the company, right?

772
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:39,743
My life depends on this.

773
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,645
Just look at this place!
It's completely empty!

774
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,814
Is Boss going to the US?

775
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,150
There you go being negative again.

776
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,852
What?

777
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,856
I mean, Han-gyeol and the rest of us
are working our butts off,

778
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,858
and we're being diligent.

779
00:49:54,958 --> 00:49:58,462
If you're not going to help,
at least stop with the negativity.

780
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:01,331
How dare you say that? I'm not negative!

781
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,500
Really.

782
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,502
Really?

783
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,170
Did you just give me an attitude?

784
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,905
Calm down, Mr. Hong.

785
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,408
-Let's not fight.
-Mr. Hong.

786
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,076
Did you think about the menu?

787
00:50:13,143 --> 00:50:15,512
I told you to change our ice cream menu.

788
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,214
What's with that tone of voice?

789
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,249
"Mr. Hong, did you think about the menu?"

790
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,484
What if I didn't?

791
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,818
Am I your servant?

792
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:23,253
Are you ordering me around?

793
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,288
When did I order you around?

794
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,724
When? Always, you punk!

795
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:30,694
I told you we should make this café
a '70s and '80s theme.

796
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,363
I told you coffee isn't for kids,
but you won't listen.

797
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,399
You ignore everything I say.

798
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:38,668
And today, you yelled at me
for taking a nap when we were slow,

799
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,271
while you took the guys to hang out.

800
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,174
I asked you where you went,
and you walked right past me!

801
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,376
Mr. Hong, Han-gyeol didn't ignore you.

802
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,112
He was wet, so he wanted to change...

803
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,848
I know you have no respect for me.

804
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:56,453
But we sold as much of the beans as we did
thanks to my roasting skills. Got that?

805
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,122
Because we charged a fifth
what everyone else charges.

806
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,158
We wouldn't have sold any
if we charged full price.

807
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,560
What? You prick!

808
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,395
-Calm down, Mr. Hong!
-Han-gyeol!

809
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,097
Go. Aren't you going home
for your birthday?

810
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,398
You should go.

811
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:10,100
Don't be like that.

812
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:12,302
You always come late,
constantly look pissed off,

813
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,838
and grumble about everything!

814
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,207
How can the café do well
when the boss is like that?

815
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,842
Are you done? You little...

816
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,976
Forget it!

817
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,745
What? Forget what?

818
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,480
-Get back here!
-Stop it.

819
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,649
You shouldn't fight!

820
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,350
We're all family here.

821
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,586
Let go of me.

822
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:32,589
Where's the chair?

823
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,029
How are things going?
Are things going well?

824
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:42,799
-They're good.
-You look good.

825
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,304
I've been hearing a lot of rumors
about your café.

826
00:51:48,171 --> 00:51:49,673
What kind of rumors?

827
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,374
Are they good rumors?

828
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,444
They say every seat in the house
is always available.

829
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,781
They just opened.

830
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:01,017
It will take time to get established.

831
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,486
He's right.

832
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,421
It takes time for word to get out.

833
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:07,557
Report the café's profits to your father.

834
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,134
Hey, that day...

835
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,471
Were you offended at Yoo-joo's place?

836
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,940
Forget about it.
I don't feel like talking about it.

837
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,510
It took a lot for me to bring it up,

838
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,445
but you just brush it aside.

839
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,949
I saw in the papers
that Yoo-joo is going to hold an exhibit.

840
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:35,886
Why can't I get used to her?

841
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,754
Because you're trying to tame her.

842
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,358
Yoo-joo can't be a butterfly in a frame.

843
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:45,262
She's a live butterfly.
Naturally, she'll change constantly.

844
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,663
That is also her charm.

845
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,499
So that is her charm.

846
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:51,835
I didn't know.

847
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:58,808
Anyway, there's a small, round-faced kid
working at your café, right?

848
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,011
-Koh Eun-chan?
-Yes.

849
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:01,945
You know him?

850
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,515
He delivers milk to my place.

851
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,118
How did you two meet? At an interview?

852
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,453
It's a long story with him.

853
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,556
-Did you hear about my blind dates?
-Yes.

854
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,393
So that's who...

855
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,428
-Really?
-That's right.

856
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:20,764
He's so funny.

857
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,866
He's really quite a character.

858
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,008
What are you doing?

859
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,915
So, is this how you do it?

860
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,019
Your wrist is too stiff.

861
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,522
You know-it-all.

862
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:50,227
I'm doing exactly what you're doing.

863
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,195
It may look like that at first glance.

864
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,297
But there's a difference.

865
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:58,501
Don't use your wrist, use your shoulder.

866
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:00,503
Shoulder.

867
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,576
-Dang it.
-Don't pour it all at once.

868
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,345
Why is it so hard to pour water?

869
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:10,814
I'm good, aren't I?

870
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,983
I've been practicing every night.

871
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,684
You're so diligent.

872
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,154
Are you still angry?

873
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:19,990
Who said I was angry?

874
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,398
Taste it.

875
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:33,803
This is delicious.

876
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:35,138
It is.

877
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,641
The coffee tastes great,

878
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,544
and the lighting
and the mood are just right.

879
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:45,548
Go home. I have to work.

880
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,485
What are you doing? I can help.

881
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,453
It's nothing you can help with.

882
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,122
I'm good at everything.

883
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:55,992
I said go. I can't work
if there's someone there.

884
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:56,926
Go.

885
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,595
You got a whole bunch of presents.

886
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,830
Open them. I want to see.

887
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,199
-Go.
-I'll go even if you tell me not to.

888
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:05,201
I also have a lot of things to do.

889
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:10,073
I have to brush my teeth,
wash my hair, sleep, and dream.

890
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:11,875
Good night!

891
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,517
Boss!

892
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,621
Happy birthday to you

893
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:27,624
Happy birthday, dear Boss
Happy birthday to you

894
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,007
Triple the investment in three months?

895
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,411
He'll stay if he fails
and go to the US if he succeeds.

896
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,047
Which one is better?

897
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,916
Going to the US is better, of course.

898
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,384
But he might not be able to.

899
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,019
We have zero business.

900
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:57,520
What are you talking about?

901
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,459
By the way, how is my Seon-gi doing?

902
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,461
When did he become your Seon-gi?

903
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:09,265
And why do you keep calling Min-yeop
if you're not even interested in him?

904
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,567
I don't want to give him up.

905
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,068
And 50. Done.

906
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:13,937
I'm so tired.

907
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,238
Here.

908
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,640
You shouldn't string him along.

909
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,776
I'm just playing the field.
It's all in the family.

910
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:23,079
Just look at Mom.
She's playing both Mr. Hong and Mr. Gu.

911
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:25,982
Maybe that's what I'm doing.

912
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:33,823
There is this guy.

913
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,192
When I see him,

914
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,930
I feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

915
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:46,436
He's like a warm cotton blanket
or the morning sun.

916
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:49,906
You know what I mean?

917
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:51,908
Yes. Continue.

918
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,145
Well, there's this other guy.

919
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,517
Though I hate him sometimes,
he's all right, too.

920
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,087
He's really hotheaded,

921
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,191
but he's not a bad person.

922
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,226
But he's not a good person either.

923
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,695
He goes back and forth.

924
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,231
I don't know what I'm saying.

925
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:16,666
I know what you're saying.

926
00:57:17,834 --> 00:57:19,135
You're playing both guys!

927
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,608
Anyway, both of them
are really good looking.

928
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:29,946
Look at you,
I bet neither of them knows how you feel.

929
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:30,880
Nope.

930
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,685
Do you have nothing better to do
at your age?

931
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,888
Having a crush on two men at once
and drooling while thinking of them.

932
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,758
I can't believe you're my big sister.

933
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,387
-No! Don't go!
-Hey!

934
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,322
You're a loyal person.

935
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,191
You have the ability to make others happy.

936
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:23,960
Let's take a trip together.

937
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,996
Did you bring us here to work?

938
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,400
Boss. Everybody makes mistakes.

939
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,303
You were great today, Boss.

940
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:36,973
It's the truth. You're beautiful
beyond measure.

941
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,575
Yoo-joo doesn't believe in marriage.

942
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:39,976
How did you know I was sick?

943
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,211
This is a women's bathhouse!

944
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,314
I really had no choice.

945
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,043
