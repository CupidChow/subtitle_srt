1
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,830
He's going to die of suffocation.

2
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,322
Who are you?

3
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,469
Doesn't your head feel heavy
with that bird's nest on top of it?

4
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,906
Are we brothers now?

5
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,410
Why? You don't want to?

6
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,880
Sure, I want to. Just wondering
what the changes between us are.

7
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,916
Will you love me more?

8
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,453
What do you mean love?

9
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,489
Then are you going to be nicer to me?

10
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,827
Sure. I guess I can be nicer to you.

11
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,063
How are you going to do that?

12
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,567
Like this?

13
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,474
Ham.

14
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:26,079
And bean sprouts.

15
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,314
Here.

16
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,916
Kimchi.

17
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,521
So you'll give me anything I want?

18
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,591
Then I want a scooter, a new house,
a car and what else is there?

19
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,760
Two scooters.

20
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,462
One car.

21
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,364
One house.

22
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,033
What else do you want? An airplane?

23
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,070
Here's one. And here's a train.

24
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,311
That came out rather well
considering I did it while I was drunk.

25
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,280
It hurts!

26
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,981
Take a look. I pierced it all right.

27
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:03,816
It hurts.

28
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,352
You're exaggerating, boy.

29
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,758
Han-gyeol.

30
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,165
Han-gyeol!

31
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,367
What?

32
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,102
Han-gyeol.

33
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,476
-Han-gyeol!
-Jeez!

34
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,679
What is so funny?

35
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,682
Han-gyeol.

36
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,150
Han-gyeol.

37
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,799
Hello.

38
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,223
It's me.

39
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,263
What are you doing right now?

40
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,531
Do you want to eat lunch together?

41
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,433
I'll come pick you up.

42
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,801
I have an appointment.

43
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,473
Are you avoiding me?

44
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,809
I can't say that I'm not.

45
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:39,846
How long do you plan to keep this up?

46
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,383
Okay.

47
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,153
I will wait until you're ready.

48
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,421
Call me.

49
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,302
Han-gyeol! Can you ring up table seven?

50
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,003
Okay!

51
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,642
-Anything else with your lattes?
-Eun-chan?

52
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,678
Yes, Han-gyeol?

53
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,080
Thank you, goodbye.

54
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,985
Just felt like seeing you.

55
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,054
I'm really busy.

56
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,823
Oh, Eun-chan!

57
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,993
What?

58
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,262
I just felt like seeing you again.

59
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,365
You're teasing me
just because I teased you this morning.

60
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,766
You're childish.

61
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,335
Koh Eun-chan!

62
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,305
So, were you with the boss this morning?

63
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,341
Do you like each other?

64
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,979
You're talking nonsense.

65
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,781
Why would the boss like someone like me?

66
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,483
Also, I'm a guy.

67
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,851
You're a girl.

68
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,456
What matters is that you're drawn
to the person.

69
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,559
Are you threatening me right now?

70
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,927
But I promised to clean your place!

71
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,895
When? Today?

72
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,097
Tomorrow?

73
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,832
I'll clean it this week.

74
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,836
Why do you keep laughing? Is this funny?

75
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,504
Don't you think this is funny?

76
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:14,941
Jeez!

77
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:18,211
Jeez! Watch where you're going!

78
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,614
This is the manager's earring!

79
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,649
It's mine, you idiot!

80
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,886
Even if it is yours,
you don't need to shout.

81
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,992
Boss, can I get a latte... I mean...

82
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,662
-Say something. What the heck?
-Darn it.

83
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,131
What?

84
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,235
So tell me!

85
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:45,037
Since when were you guys blood brothers?

86
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,339
Since yesterday.

87
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,609
My grandma thought he was cute
and said we should be blood brothers.

88
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,977
Blood brothers?

89
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,080
Then you two will share the inheritance!

90
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,049
How could your grandma do such a thing?

91
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,253
I knew you first
and I'm much closer to you.

92
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,955
Does that bind you legally to him?

93
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,557
Get to work.

94
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,197
Take the waffles, Ha-rim!

95
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,303
Jeez! How could Han-gyeol do this to me?

96
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,907
I'm a lot closer to him than Eun-chan is.

97
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,010
But he became blood brothers
with Eun-chan instead of me!

98
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,679
-Are you that blind?
-What do you mean?

99
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,815
The manager likes Eun-chan.
Didn't you know?

100
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,416
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,319
The two like each other. Is that weird?

102
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,055
It happens all the time in Japan.

103
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,591
You knew that too, Mr. Hong.

104
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:40,026
That Eun-chan and boss are in love.

105
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,795
Those boys don't like each other.

106
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,331
If you have the time
for such idle chatter,

107
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:46,699
get to work!

108
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,969
I think you know what I'm talking about.

109
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,472
I knew Min-yeop couldn't keep
his mouth shut.

110
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,481
Hello?

111
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:05,117
Eun-chan, this is Han Yoo-joo.

112
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,419
Hello.

113
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,146
Try the pastries.

114
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,349
Okay.

115
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,722
I know I should say something,

116
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,458
but I don't know what to say
now that you are here.

117
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,827
I think I'm nervous.

118
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,329
I am too, a bit.

119
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,872
I was hesitant to see you, Eun-chan.

120
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:06,679
Honestly, I used to have
a crush on Han-sung...

121
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,750
before I knew that you were Girl B.

122
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:13,920
How about now?

123
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,988
I still like him a lot,

124
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,224
but not in that way.

125
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,726
I have someone I like.

126
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,495
Han-gyeol?

127
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,364
Stop joking around with me.

128
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:29,602
Yes.

129
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,405
Why aren't you telling Han-gyeol
that you're a girl?

130
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,608
I thought about it a lot too.

131
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,344
But he wants me to be his blood brother.

132
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,082
If he finds out that I'm a girl,
I can't be around him like now.

133
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,885
Plus, things aren't bad the way they are.

134
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,761
I don't know
what this is going to sound like,

135
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,364
but you don't have to worry about me.

136
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,667
Okay, I won't.

137
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:08,975
What?

138
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,544
Tell me, Han-gyeol.
Are you in love with Eun-chan?

139
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,347
Why would I be in love with a man?

140
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:18,451
Then you shouldn't hang out
with him all the time.

141
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:20,987
Why are you acting like this?

142
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,591
I didn't want to tell you this.

143
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,663
But Seon-gi keeps telling people
that you and Eun-chan are in love.

144
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,898
It's not just Seon-gi.

145
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:37,169
Mr. Hong keeps smiling
when he sees the two of you together.

146
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,406
Min-yeop keeps gawking
at you and Eun-chan.

147
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,210
The cafÃ©'s atmosphere is weird
these days with you two.

148
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,412
Do people have nothing better
to do than spread rumors?

149
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,315
Anyway, how are things with your dad?

150
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,486
He says he doesn't need a son
who doesn't follow his will.

151
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:56,389
He said that it was a mistake spending
so much money on tutors

152
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,325
to send an idiot like me
to medical school.

153
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:03,663
He was screaming at me,
saying I'm a waste of his money!

154
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,798
Why is he so obsessed with money?

155
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,700
It must be difficult for you too.

156
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:30,056
Did you waver
because I gave you a hard time?

157
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,125
No, it's not like that.

158
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:35,528
It would be easier
if it was because of me.

159
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,431
Then all I would have to do is change.

160
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,669
I'm still trying to figure out

161
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,672
what came over me.

162
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,745
All I know is...

163
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,919
that this has happened to you too.

164
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,155
For the two years after we separated,

165
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:08,327
I wasted so much time
trying to understand you.

166
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,199
Now that it's happening to me...

167
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:18,504
Are you saying that it isn't a mistake?
That it's love?

168
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,109
I was in love with him at that time.

169
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,384
What do you want me to do?

170
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,421
I'll take care of things with Eun-chan.

171
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:41,894
I was worried that Eun-chan
would end up hurting you.

172
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,299
But she ended up hurting me instead.

173
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,415
Let's go on a vacation.

174
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,921
Please?

175
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,224
Stop.

176
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,260
Wow, you're fast.

177
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,863
Why didn't you tell me you're going
grocery shopping for eggs?

178
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,566
You're always telling me
to just follow you.

179
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,235
Are you trying to be a man of mystery?

180
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,670
Maybe a movie star?

181
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,440
Do I have to brief you that we need milk,

182
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,876
chocolate syrup, kiwis to top waffles,

183
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,279
and a new plate since you broke one today?

184
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,815
When was your first kiss?

185
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,718
You always change the topic
if you have nothing to say.

186
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,854
Was it with Yoo-joo?

187
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:47,059
Hey! What kind of person would I be
if I kissed my cousin's girlfriend?

188
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,830
I tried. But I got rejected.

189
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:55,267
Then was I your first kiss?

190
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,670
Idiot.

191
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,540
Since Yoo-joo was your first love,

192
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,177
if you didn't kiss her,
then that leaves me.

193
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:09,582
I told you that I loved Han Yoo-joo
for nine years,

194
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,251
but I didn't say that I loved
only Han Yoo-joo for nine years.

195
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:14,720
Isn't that the same thing?

196
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:17,990
How is that the same thing?

197
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,527
Saying that I loved Han Yoo-joo means
I loved Han Yoo-joo.

198
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,164
But saying that I loved only Han Yoo-joo
means I loved only Han Yoo-joo.

199
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,232
Get it?

200
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:31,470
Then who was your first kiss?

201
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,806
Another Korean student in America.

202
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,542
How many times did you meet her?

203
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,676
Three times.

204
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,045
So you kissed her after seeing
her three times?

205
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,981
Did you sleep with her?

206
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,182
We didn't sleep together.

207
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,751
Why is that?

208
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:47,052
I liked her friend.

209
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,121
What?

210
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,656
You're so mean!

211
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:53,893
You jerk.

212
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,262
Don't you talk to your brother like that!

213
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:58,330
-What? I'm mean?
-It hurts.

214
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,132
Say, "I'm sorry, Han-gyeol."

215
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,167
You're being mean!

216
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,169
-If you don't listen, I'll pinch you.
-Ouch!

217
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,971
I didn't do anything wrong!

218
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,273
I'm sorry, Han-gyeol!

219
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,374
Say, "You're hot, Han-gyeol."

220
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,608
But you're not that hot at all.

221
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,677
-You're hot, Han-gyeol.
-There you go.

222
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,456
Why do we have to spend our summer working

223
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,625
-while everyone else is going on vacation?
-That feels great.

224
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,328
This air-conditioned shop
is better than going on vacation.

225
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,330
But it's no fun here.

226
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,133
Anyway, what do we do about the concert?
Shouldn't we prepare?

227
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,234
Stop!

228
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,336
I want to play a big instrument.

229
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,307
A drum this big or a trumpet this big.

230
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,309
-Or a--
-Do you know how to play them?

231
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,710
-No.
-Just massage my shoulders.

232
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,013
How about we throw a party
instead of a concert?

233
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,850
I'm a pretty good dancer, you know.

234
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:55,454
How about wrestling, boxing,
or Korean wrestling?

235
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,656
-Wrestling!
-Korean wrestling!

236
00:15:57,723 --> 00:15:59,358
Will you shut up and clean?

237
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:00,960
Okay, Han-gyeol.

238
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,165
It must be nice
to be able to call the boss by his name.

239
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,034
Why don't you just tell him
that you're a girl?

240
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,104
You'd better shut up! What the heck?

241
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,440
On guard! Take that!

242
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,209
I'll dance to accompany your sword fight.

243
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,711
Hey, go clean.

244
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,551
This is fun!

245
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:32,491
-All together!
-This is so fun!

246
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:37,563
It hurts.

247
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,531
What were you doing,

248
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:42,067
jumping from the second floor
in your bare feet?

249
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,804
My dad was trying to cut my hair
and locked me up inside the house.

250
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,273
Your family is so strange,
trying to lock you up

251
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,010
when you just wanted to visit
your mom for her birthday.

252
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,012
Your dad must like you a lot.

253
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:55,280
If I were him,
I would have thrown you out.

254
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,882
I wish he would just leave me alone.

255
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,386
Oh, my god! A cockroach! It's a cockroach!

256
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:07,192
How can you live in a place like this,
Seon-gi?

257
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,928
I don't think I can live here
even for one day.

258
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,830
Then don't come here next time.

259
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,700
That's not what I meant.

260
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,404
What do you think you're doing?
Hitting Seon-gi like that!

261
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,705
You conniving bastard!

262
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,740
Why are you making Eun-chan clean for you?

263
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,942
Couldn't you just keep her secret
out of good will?

264
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,681
Angel! I bought what you told me to buy.

265
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,983
Angel my butt.

266
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,586
Your angel hasn't left Seon-gi's side
since we got here.

267
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,159
Why are you doing this?

268
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,627
Just sit down and rest.

269
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,961
I'll do everything.

270
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,130
Then you should go.

271
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,302
And wash these, okay?

272
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,338
Okay.

273
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,748
Hey, the television!

274
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,416
Bring that back!

275
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,584
Does it even work?

276
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,619
Throw this away!

277
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,189
And throw away this mosquito net!

278
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,325
What does this say?

279
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,160
Try reading it aloud?

280
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,762
Try reading it aloud.

281
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,532
Angel.

282
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,767
Let's go out now.

283
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,102
I'll buy you chicken feet.

284
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,771
Hey, what do you mean chicken feet?

285
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,139
Did you do the dishes?

286
00:18:27,206 --> 00:18:28,440
No, I was about to hang these.

287
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,608
Then wash the dishes.

288
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,277
And take the garbage out.

289
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,514
I'll hang Seon-gi's clothes.

290
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,884
What are you waiting for?

291
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,422
Hey! Don't do it, Min-yeop.

292
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,692
Is Min-yeop your servant?

293
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:51,763
He always does everything
I tell him to do.

294
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,532
Don't you, Min-yeop?

295
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,109
Hey.

296
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,145
Move over, I'll do it.

297
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,248
You'll just end up breaking the dishes.
Move aside.

298
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,687
What else did you tell me to do?

299
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,290
Can you get me a glass of water, Min-yeop?

300
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,230
Get your water yourself.

301
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,433
Hey! Stop.

302
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,941
You, follow me.

303
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,710
Hey!

304
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,618
I like those guys a lot.

305
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,421
How can you embarrass me in front of them?

306
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,924
What are you going to do? Hit me?

307
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,928
You shouldn't walk all over me
just because I'm in love with you!

308
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,497
I never asked you to love me!

309
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,466
Just give up!
I don't like you following me around.

310
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,036
You're stupid and just strong.

311
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,605
It's embarrassing to show you
to my friends.

312
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,510
Goddamn it!

313
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,827
I knew that Min-yeop would blow a fuse
at you one of these days.

314
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,996
Do you really hate Min Yeop?

315
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,165
Just go and apologize to him tomorrow.

316
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,471
Beg for his forgiveness.

317
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,674
People bond as they fight, you know.

318
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,510
Like you and your manager?

319
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,847
Did you have to bring that up?

320
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,585
Him and I, we're blood brothers now.

321
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,921
Blood brothers?

322
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:31,790
Fine. Laugh all you want.

323
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,295
But I still get to see him every day,
be with him,

324
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,899
fool around with him, and talk to him.
It's great.

325
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,402
You would want to become more than that.

326
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:47,205
You'll want to hold his hand,
hug him, and even kiss him.

327
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,207
You have such a dirty mind!

328
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,877
I like the way things are right now, okay?

329
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:56,381
By the way, that musician guy
hasn't called you in a while.

330
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,485
He must be busy.

331
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,488
Something happened, right?

332
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,665
We kissed.

333
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,134
I knew it.

334
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,870
I thought you were being too nice
to him these days.

335
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,807
Keep that up and you'll end up
getting involved with both men.

336
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,042
I'm over that guy already, okay?

337
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,610
He has a girlfriend.

338
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,679
But why did he do that to me?

339
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,515
Did I confuse him?

340
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,051
You should draw the line.

341
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:41,259
-Take that!
-No, just leave it.

342
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,162
-Oh, my god!
-The weather is so incredibly hot today!

343
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,598
-For crying out loud!
-Hold on.

344
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,867
-Ma'am!
-Jeez!

345
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:51,203
Are you guys married?

346
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,537
Do we look like it?

347
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,339
Don't get married if you're not.

348
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,241
Things seem perfect
between you two as they are.

349
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,744
She says she doesn't want to marry me.

350
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:03,915
I can tell from that sly smile
that you're quite a playboy.

351
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,752
I caught him cheating on me not long ago.

352
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:10,088
She left me for another guy two years ago
and came back to me just recently.

353
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,457
Good for you.

354
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,659
Ma'am, do you have
any PokÃ©mon figures here?

355
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,727
Of course.

356
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,296
-We could have gone further!
-Let's do it again.

357
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,931
Why are you so bad at this?

358
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,203
Flower watching in the spring
and going to the ocean in the summer.

359
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,807
Watching the leaves in the fall
and the snow in the winter.

360
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,976
And?

361
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,012
Eat delicious food
and experience fun things together.

362
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,616
And?

363
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,286
Get married and have children.

364
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:44,990
I'm afraid of what you'll say next.

365
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,858
Maybe you get my hopes up
just to shatter them.

366
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,528
You asked me to tell you
what I would like to do with you.

367
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,097
The things I would like to do with you,
not what I'm going to.

368
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,072
Take it.

369
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,411
3 MISSED CALLS, KIDDO

370
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,147
It was cut off.

371
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,045
Are you okay?

372
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,551
I'm sorry!

373
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,458
I had my scariest experience
when I was in ninth grade.

374
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,328
My mom had a big fight with her lover.

375
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:02,133
So I got angry, stormed into my room,
and slammed the door shut by mistake.

376
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:07,305
I was shaking all over
because I was afraid she would hit me.

377
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:09,140
No way. Did you?

378
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:10,842
I'm a very timid person.

379
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,645
I have a lot of fear.

380
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,617
I met Eun-chan yesterday.

381
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,455
Give her a call.

382
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,393
The kid is trying to put this behind her
and you should help her as an adult.

383
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,330
I will when I'm ready.

384
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:36,468
Adults are slow to act
because we think too much.

385
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,705
1 TEXT MESSAGE, KIDDO

386
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,741
You got a text message.

387
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,179
Aren't you curious about what it says?

388
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,522
I bet you were the one
who kissed Eun-chan.

389
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,033
Oh, I can't remember.

390
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,102
Oh, my. You're trying to avoid it.

391
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,141
-My stomach!
-Where are you going?

392
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,176
-To the restroom.
-You smell!

393
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,846
You're so funny.

394
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,519
Even if I call him,

395
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,421
what am I going to say?

396
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,523
"How are you?"

397
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,031
Are you doing well?

398
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,533
I'm doing well.

399
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,402
Please call me when you have time.

400
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:45,937
Bye!

401
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,701
Did you enjoy it?

402
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,336
Hello? I have a question.

403
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,705
It's called the Jeonga Kindergarten. Yes.

404
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:21,973
I asked you if you enjoyed it.

405
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,010
Yes, street number three? Okay, thank you.

406
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:28,880
Give it to me!

407
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,782
That's why you should have
answered my question!

408
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,552
How did it feel to have Eun-sae
stick by you like that?

409
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,322
Give me that memo.

410
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:44,496
I really liked you
and did everything you asked but you...

411
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,099
Instead of discouraging her,

412
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,935
you kept on talking to Eun-sae
and smiling at her!

413
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,871
Let go of me!

414
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,472
You stupid bastard!

415
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,241
I told you not to curse in Japanese!

416
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,746
You fell for a bitch
and now you forgot your chain of command.

417
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,281
She is not a bitch!

418
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,250
Do you want to fight me too?

419
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:06,518
Let go of me!

420
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,856
Hey, where are you going?

421
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,543
Hello?

422
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,111
How are you doing?

423
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,747
This is Myeong-jae.

424
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,283
Oh, hello.

425
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,952
Are you in Sydney right now?

426
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,954
No. I'm in Korea.

427
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,191
I'm here to meet a buyer.

428
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,095
How are your mom and wife...

429
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,665
How is Han-gyeol doing?

430
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,536
You're okay with wine, right?

431
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,839
Just drink half a glass.

432
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,554
I was going to go home on the weekend.

433
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,925
I've been calling grandma
every two to three days.

434
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:25,563
Cancer progresses much
more slowly for the elderly

435
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,299
so don't worry too much.

436
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,270
I would appreciate it
if you didn't tell mom

437
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,640
that I knew the secret of my birth.

438
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,811
Why did you ask me to come here?

439
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:42,814
How much do you know?

440
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,953
You had an affair
and I was born out of wedlock.

441
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,591
My mom right now
isn't my biological mother.

442
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:59,564
You only took me in after leaving me
in an orphanage for three years.

443
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:04,736
What kind of a person was my birth mother?

444
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,741
She was a warm and affectionate person.

445
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,247
She studied hard from a young age
and became a middle school math teacher.

446
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,786
She was a very tenacious woman
who didn't like to lose.

447
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,288
Did she leave you?

448
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,959
Or did you leave her, Dad?

449
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,299
I left her.

450
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,436
There was nothing else I could do then.

451
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:41,940
How did she pass away?

452
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,411
From a car accident,
before you turned one year old.

453
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:52,584
I wasn't ready to take on
a burden of a child at the time.

454
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:58,456
I wasn't confident
that I could persuade your grandma.

455
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,228
I wasn't good enough.

456
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,662
Of course.

457
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,432
No wonder you sent me to an orphanage!

458
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,887
Jeez, why isn't he answering his phone?

459
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,923
I'll try calling him again.

460
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,197
Hello?

461
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,398
Hello, son.

462
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,334
You're doing well, right?

463
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,937
Of course, I'm good.

464
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,538
Is your business going well?

465
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,140
Yes.

466
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,378
Mom.

467
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,914
What is it?

468
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,316
Do you have a favor to ask me?

469
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,819
You know how much I love you, don't you?

470
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,223
Of course.

471
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,625
I love you too, son.

472
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,665
Thank you, mom.

473
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,001
Thank you.

474
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,305
Why are you acting like this
all of a sudden?

475
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,807
Should I put your grandma on?

476
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,310
No, I'm hanging up now.

477
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,880
Okay. Goodbye.

478
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,817
Han-gyeol says that he is thankful.

479
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,523
That softhearted child
must have gone through such worry.

480
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,429
You did the right thing.

481
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,131
It's better that you take the blame, son.

482
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,735
So, is Lee Myeong-jae in Korea?

483
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,139
It would be better if he stayed away.

484
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,210
He said he came for business reasons.

485
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,411
Business?

486
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,449
Then he should mind his business
and leave instead of calling you.

487
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:06,517
What is he trying to do?

488
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,320
You better take care of this.

489
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,557
I can't let Han-gyeol meet him.

490
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,826
It's his first time in Seoul in 15 years.

491
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,128
I can't just let him go back like that.

492
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,298
I should at least talk to him in person.

493
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:23,267
This is why I hate you.

494
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:25,603
I won't give up my son!

495
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:28,006
How dare he walk back into our lives.

496
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,708
Lee Myeong-jae didn't say
anything about that.

497
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:32,910
Why are you jumping to conclusions?

498
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:36,047
Let's wait and see what happens.

499
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,515
Mom.

500
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,152
If he says something about Han-gyeol,
bring him to me.

501
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,922
He wouldn't do that.

502
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,527
You better take care of this.

503
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,697
Otherwise, it's over between you and me!

504
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,933
Hi, this is the delicious Coffee Prince.

505
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,836
Is delicious Coffee Prince your name?

506
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,471
Boss?

507
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,605
Boss?

508
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,507
I mean, Han-gyeol!

509
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,582
-Were you sleeping?
-No, I wasn't.

510
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,384
Anyways, where are you?

511
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,219
Well...

512
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,788
Why didn't you pick up the phone all day?

513
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,659
Well...

514
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,695
You're making me curious again.

515
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,197
Where are you?

516
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,399
Well...

517
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,901
Are you home or at the coffee shop?

518
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,511
What's this sound?

519
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,486
You're here!

520
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:24,322
I've been looking for you all day long!

521
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,192
Hi!

522
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,872
If I win, you owe me a lobster this big!

523
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,773
You're always thinking about food.

524
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,809
There's no going back on the bet.

525
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,511
Don't ask me to cut it out of your salary.

526
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,113
Not this time. I want cash.

527
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,985
Bend your knees.

528
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,957
How many times do I have to tell you?
Bend your knees.

529
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,927
Hold your stance like this.

530
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,229
Hit the ball like that.

531
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,464
You must be a good batter.

532
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,699
-I'm going to put the money in.
-Okay, put it in.

533
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:10,635
-Keep your eyes open.
-Eyes open.

534
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,203
-Think of someone you hate!
-Koh Eun-chan!

535
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,805
Jeez! Go!

536
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,741
It's coming. Come on!

537
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,446
Hit it! Swing the bat!

538
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,616
Are all those muscles just for show?

539
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,552
I haven't done this in a long time.

540
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,320
So, why are we playing ball this late?

541
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,622
-Because I'm frustrated.
-Why are you frustrated?

542
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,292
Koh Eun-chan. Let's go see the ocean.

543
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,693
The ocean?

544
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,395
Okay!

545
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,066
Hey! Jeez!

546
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:44,468
Hey, you have to slow down on the curves.

547
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,070
Do you think this is a scooter?

548
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,708
Gosh, aren't you scared for your life?

549
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,144
Stop the car!

550
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,113
Stop telling me how to drive.

551
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,982
I'm doing fine on my own.

552
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,353
For Pete's sake!
I guess my life is in your hands.

553
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,690
-If you make a scratch!
-"I'll take money from your salary!"

554
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,525
Is that what you were going to say?

555
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,694
It's fine by me.

556
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,163
Jeez!

557
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,435
What?

558
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:21,272
I think I just saw a ghost
in the rearview mirror!

559
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,908
Don't lie to me!

560
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:25,276
Take a look!

561
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,219
Oh, my god!

562
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:37,989
This is so fun.

563
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,024
Were you scared?

564
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:50,868
It's so dark.
It feels like we are in a whale's belly.

565
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,739
We are inside a whale's belly.

566
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,874
Pinocchio.

567
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:03,114
I wonder if the whale will throw us up
if we light a candle?

568
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,051
Throw us up!

569
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,765
You jerk! Come on in!

570
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,767
It's really cool in here.

571
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,135
I'll pass.

572
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,443
Hey. When is your birthday?

573
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,612
In December.

574
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,946
Blood type?

575
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,014
Type O.

576
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,115
I'm type B.

577
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,418
I hate men with type B blood.

578
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,720
Why don't you like them?

579
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,122
They're ill-tempered, petty,
and really mean.

580
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,224
That's not true.

581
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,593
That's just a stereotype.
You shouldn't think that.

582
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,228
Men with type B blood are all different.

583
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,798
They're tough, loyal, warm...

584
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,934
Forget about it.

585
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,304
Hey, wait for me!

586
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,441
What kind of a person does that?

587
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:05,876
You have your facts wrong.

588
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,244
Men with type A blood are like that.

589
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,813
Okay, I know.

590
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,549
Jeez! You're so annoying sometimes.

591
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:12,583
Stop.

592
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,053
Since when did you start liking toys?

593
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:21,625
I played a lot with toys since I was young
and it just happened.

594
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,461
Didn't you have friends?

595
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,162
Why did you play with toys?

596
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,464
The other kids hated me.

597
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:28,099
Why?

598
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,569
As you know, I have a bad temper.

599
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,205
It was ten times worse then.

600
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:39,610
I got angry at people who were nice to me
and punched people easily.

601
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:40,745
Why?

602
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,280
I don't know.

603
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:48,285
I think I just got angry for no reason,
now that I think about it.

604
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:58,262
I heard that my birth mother
was a middle school math teacher.

605
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,098
My dad finally told me.

606
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,237
Why are you smiling, talking about that?

607
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,905
It's not funny at all.

608
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,551
Koh Eun-chan.

609
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,755
Isn't it nice to have a brother?

610
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:31,162
Do you like me just as a brother?

611
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,068
What do you like most about me?

612
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,371
What?

613
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,074
I mean, as a brother.

614
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,213
You're joking around again.

615
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,319
What do you like most about me?

616
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,588
I'm really cute, aren't I?

617
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,027
How about you? What do you like about me?

618
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,495
Everything.

619
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,203
Just as a brother.

620
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,647
Peekaboo!

621
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,039
Let's go.

622
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,780
Why are you looking around?

623
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,350
It's just between brothers.

624
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:02,953
I guess.

625
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:33,284
I found it!

626
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,555
Let's just go home.

627
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,758
We need to see the sunrise
now that we're here.

628
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,092
It's really hard to come here often.

629
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,297
Wouldn't it be better to go home
and get some sleep

630
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,965
since we have to work tomorrow?

631
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:50,701
It's not like we're going to faint
if we don't sleep for a day.

632
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,337
It might be a little difficult for you
since you're so old.

633
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,979
You look really sleepy.

634
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:04,548
Sleep for a little bit.

635
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,227
It's just between brothers.

636
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,265
Koh Eun-chan.

637
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,538
I don't think I can take it any longer.

638
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,711
As of today, you're fired.

639
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,458
Mom's going to kill you when you get home.

640
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,993
Oh, I'm dead.

641
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,235
You must be so tired.

642
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,104
You should go home and get some rest.

643
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,139
You're fired.

644
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,674
What?

645
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:01,044
Being blood brothers won't work.
We shouldn't see each other again.

646
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,748
Stop with the jokes, will you?
I'll see you later.

647
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:28,805
Hey!

648
00:48:28,872 --> 00:48:31,675
When did you come home this morning?

649
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,876
I got back very early.

650
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:36,780
Sure, you did! How could you
stay out all night like that?

651
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,148
Quit your job if you'll keep this up!

652
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,650
Mom, I'm late. Bye!

653
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,185
-Hi!
-Hello, Mr. Gu!

654
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,288
-Be careful or you'll choke!
-Okay.

655
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,890
Ji-hyang!

656
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:49,793
What are you doing here so early?

657
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,796
Why did you ignore my calls
and keep avoiding me?

658
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:54,932
I did no such thing.

659
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,967
I just figured
that we would run into each other

660
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,002
since we live in the same neighborhood.

661
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:02,406
I need a definite answer today
no matter what.

662
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:08,245
If you didn't like my proposal,
then I can propose again in a better way.

663
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:11,114
Forget it.
I don't want you to propose to me.

664
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,917
Ji-hyang, why don't we go on
a cruise down the Han River?

665
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:18,121
We'll be able to see
the beautiful night skyline of Seoul!

666
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:22,526
I already did that a long time ago.
I'm good.

667
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:26,296
Is it because of Mr. Hong? Is that it?

668
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:27,597
Goodness!

669
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,201
I don't want to accept your proposal
and that's final!

670
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,570
Mom, your friend
Dong-suk's on the line for you.

671
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:36,106
Ji-hyang!

672
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,407
Ji-hyang!

673
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,301
Hello.

674
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,036
You're late again!

675
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,871
Hello!

676
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,955
Hello.

677
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,268
Boss!

678
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:42,139
Did you sleep well?

679
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,874
Boss!

680
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,076
Did something happen?

681
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,412
Boss!

682
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,082
Is there something wrong?

683
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,553
You need to tell me what's going on.

684
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,360
Did I do something wrong again?

685
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,935
I told you that you're fired this morning.

686
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,715
Why so suddenly?

687
00:51:26,283 --> 00:51:28,485
I'll clear your debt.
Don't come back to the cafÃ© anymore.

688
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,187
Why are you doing this to me?

689
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,891
Don't ever show up here again.
Do you hear me?

690
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,394
Why are you acting like this again?

691
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,264
You always fire me whenever you get angry.

692
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:42,699
I'm not leaving.

693
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,167
I'm never going to leave!

694
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,571
Working here might be a joke to you
but for me...

695
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:50,807
But, I'm... I'm never leaving!

696
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:54,010
Okay, then I'll leave.

697
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,147
Aren't you being a bit too mean?

698
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:01,351
You're the one
who wanted to be blood brothers!

699
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,888
So how can you change
like this all of a sudden?

700
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:08,859
I'm this kind of a person.
Didn't you know?

701
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,161
No, I didn't know.

702
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:14,598
How can you play around
with a person's feelings like this?

703
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:16,967
I don't like you.

704
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,938
I don't like you anymore.
So don't ever bother me again!

705
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:31,581
You'll change your mind someday.

706
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:35,585
You always change your mind so you will.

707
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:40,323
I really hate you.

708
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,595
Why? Because you love me?

709
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,505
Why are you laughing?

710
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,611
Is it that easy for you?

711
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,584
I guess it is.

712
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,521
Oh, I guess it's nothing for you.

713
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,659
But I can't handle it.

714
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:36,172
I'm here to set things straight
once and for all.

715
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:39,709
Do you like Ji-hyang? Do you?

716
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,679
Give me a definite answer!

717
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,614
-What?
-Well?

718
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:48,151
-Jeez!
-Why do I have to--

719
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:50,754
This is so annoying! Why am I doing this?

720
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,756
Kim Ji-hyang, this is Hong Gye-sik.

721
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:56,459
Are you in love with Yeong-dal
from the butcher shop?

722
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,461
Then do you like me?

723
00:54:58,528 --> 00:54:59,896
Because you're not my type!

724
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,933
You're not my type either! All right?

725
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:06,703
You heard it correctly, right?

726
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,873
Then what is the impediment

727
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:12,175
that is blocking our love?

728
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,843
Gye-sik, I beg of you!

729
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:17,881
Please be a bridge
for Ji-hyang and my love!

730
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,417
Leave me out of your lover's quarrel!

731
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,718
Oh, my god!

732
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:25,355
-A cafÃ© Americano.
-Okay.

733
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,360
Eun-chan is in a bad mood.

734
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,763
Min-yeop is also in a bad mood.

735
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,765
Han-gyeol is nowhere to be seen.

736
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,568
There is also a customer
who wants the seeds out of the kiwi juice.

737
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,338
Talk about a bad day.

738
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,040
It's a text message from Han-gyeol.

739
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,243
I'm going to rest.
Please take care of the shop.

740
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,878
Is he sick?

741
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:51,181
-Here's your coffee.
-Okay.

742
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:53,516
Give me a cup of espresso.

743
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,784
Okay.

744
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,794
How long will you keep it a secret
that you're a woman from Han-gyeol?

745
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,063
If I tell him,
everything is going to be over.

746
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,666
He said it was a relief that I'm a guy.

747
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,068
Jeez. You've got to be kidding me!

748
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,038
Here.

749
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:31,955
Boss! Han-gyeol!

750
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,990
Can't you just come to work?

751
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,577
What is that?

752
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:16,132
How can a manager be absent
for several days in a row?

753
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,890
RECEIVED TEXT MESSAGES
WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS, BOSS?

754
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,158
HAN-GYEOL!
DILIGENT KID

755
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:43,493
BOSS!
DILIGENT KID

756
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,590
Boss!

757
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,426
Boss!

758
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,533
Boss!

759
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,401
Why are you acting like this?

760
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:27,804
Boss!

761
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,172
Boss!

762
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:37,080
Don't do this.

763
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:38,815
Boss!

764
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:43,453
Boss!

765
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:48,958
Boss!

766
00:59:01,938 --> 00:59:04,574
I miss you.

767
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,013
Where are you?

768
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,686
Please call me.

769
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:27,864
I love you.

770
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,243
BOSS

771
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,951
You jerk!

772
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,020
Why aren't you calling me?

773
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,157
You are making me worry.

774
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:11,407
I got into a screaming match
with my boss today.

775
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:12,976
Just tell him the truth.

776
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,111
Your boss is in love with you too,
isn't he?

777
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,113
I'm going to New York with DK.

778
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,848
Can you give me a little time?

779
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:23,319
I just like staying by your side
and watching you laugh and cry.

780
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:25,488
It will be three months soon.
I have to do it until the end.

781
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:28,191
I want to show my grandma
that I can do a good job.

782
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,094
The boss says
that I shouldn't come to work anymore.

783
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,230
You know what? I don't want to quit.

784
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:36,332
Do you know something that I don't,
Mr. Hong?

785
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:37,834
Is Eun-chan a girl?

786
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:59,255
