1
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:33,900
Do you want me to cheer you up?

2
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,292
What do you think you're doing?
Are you crazy?

3
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,227
You crazy bastard!

4
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,697
See? You're more energetic now.

5
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,901
My kiss always energizes people.

6
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,436
Just go home.

7
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,604
You did the same thing to me.

8
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,573
You kissed me

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,508
during your blind dates.

10
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,111
Why do I even bother?

11
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,913
Then why did you close your eyes?

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,050
You closed your eyes, just like this.

13
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,720
I did not!

14
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,922
Jeez.

15
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,534
Trying to make me feel better again?

16
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,103
You're dead meat if you do.

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,041
That's so Han-gyeol-esque!

18
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,276
Do you know what that means?

19
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,347
To pretend to be all right
even when one is going through difficulty

20
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,117
and not being able to admit it
when one likes something.

21
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,619
Stop making things up.

22
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,722
Shouldn't you go see your grandma?

23
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,724
I guess I should.

24
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,264
But how should I look when I see her
and what should I say?

25
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,705
My dad passed away after a long illness.

26
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,575
But I would show him my report card,

27
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,579
tell on my mom when she scolded me,

28
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,217
and I even slept in his hospital bed.

29
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,988
On the day he passed away,

30
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,491
as I left him to go to school,

31
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,227
I could tell...

32
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,598
that he might not be there anymore

33
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,635
when I returned.

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,938
And...

35
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,679
You punk.

36
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,250
What if I were a girl?

37
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,454
Could we date

38
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:11,157
if I were a girl?

39
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,629
It's a good thing that you're not.

40
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,499
Why?

41
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,536
It would be such a headache

42
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,606
if a ditz like you had a crush on me
and wanted to be with me.

43
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,541
What the heck?

44
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,310
Talk about narcissistic.

45
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,377
Who says I would want you?

46
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,747
My partying days are over

47
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,784
and I don't want to play
childish love games anymore.

48
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,055
I'm going to marry a woman
that my mom and grandma approve of.

49
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:48,461
Someone like a billionaire's daughter?

50
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,230
Sure, why not?

51
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:56,603
Someone who grew up in a gilded cage
and has never experienced any difficulty.

52
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,806
That's what my grandma wants
and what my mom is.

53
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,016
Just you wait.

54
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,352
I'll release an album
before this year is through

55
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,987
and sing a duet with a popular singer.

56
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,292
Should I tell him that I'm a girl?

57
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,763
Please calm down.

58
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,034
Do you think your boss will be
like, "I love you," if you tell him?

59
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,836
What will you do
if he doesn't like you as a girl?

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,971
Can you still stay by his side?

61
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,742
When I was at the cafÃ© the other day,

62
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,311
a thought popped into my mind.

63
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:44,050
That I would be satisfied
just being by his side.

64
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,654
That I would want for nothing then.

65
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,490
There are two ways to go.

66
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,659
You can tell him your secret
and risk losing him completely,

67
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:56,029
or you can give up on being with him,
but stay by his side as long as you want.

68
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,533
Just like Oscar
from The Rose of Versailles

69
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,069
who disguised herself as a man
for her country.

70
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,872
I'm hardly doing this for my country.

71
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,212
But you can do it for love, Eun-chan.

72
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,849
Pretending to be a guy
just to stay by the guy she likes.

73
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,925
We have to drop by Suseo.

74
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:31,230
After we deliver the beans there,
we'll be done with today's deliveries.

75
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,501
I'll drop you off at the station
so go back first.

76
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:36,869
What about you?

77
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:38,404
I need to drop by the hospital.

78
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,609
You'll go to work afterward, right?

79
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,978
Then let's go together.

80
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,215
It's rude not to visit your grandma
when I know she's in the hospital.

81
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,520
Plus, my knee has been acting up lately.

82
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,844
It has been so long since I've hugged you.

83
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,380
You must have been so shocked.

84
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,391
Your grandma would prefer it
if you acted like you didn't know.

85
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,061
So don't treat her any differently
and act like usual, okay?

86
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,367
You're looking so pale today.

87
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,774
Hello, ma'am.

88
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,342
Who...

89
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,277
An employee.
He wanted to drop in on grandma too.

90
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,713
-Is that what you bought?
-They said

91
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,615
100% juice is okay for her to drink.

92
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,788
How thoughtful of you. Thank you.

93
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:03,956
Come on in.

94
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:17,136
You hurt your stomach
because you like such hot and spicy food.

95
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:20,773
My poor grandma.
There goes ever having shaved ice again.

96
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,342
Why you mean boy!

97
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,580
Are you having fun? Do you like
teasing your sick old grandma?

98
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,350
Not at all.
I'm actually really devastated.

99
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,520
I might have to go into the bathroom
and sob in a minute or two.

100
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,955
Jeez! You pathetic boy!

101
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,260
I can't even get sick because of you!

102
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,564
It's hard enough being sick

103
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,632
without having you act like
I've met my end.

104
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,306
Anyway, what are you doing
just standing there like that?

105
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,341
Introduce yourself.

106
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,911
I said hi a little while ago.

107
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,913
Hello.

108
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,949
My name is Koh Eun-chan
and I work at Coffee Prince.

109
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,951
Feel better, ma'am!

110
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,422
Do you think I'm deaf?

111
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,925
Why did you hire such a thoughtless boy?

112
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,360
Fire him at once!

113
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,833
What's all this?

114
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,803
You've folded so many.

115
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,005
There must be 1,000 of them in here!

116
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,409
What wish did you make while folding them?

117
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,579
That my grandma won't leave us too soon

118
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,082
and that she won't suffer too much.

119
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,853
Paper cranes are so childish!

120
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,390
But I guess that's why I like you so much.

121
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,195
There's nothing to take.

122
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,532
-Jeez!
-Okay.

123
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,068
-Yes.
-Yes.

124
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:57,770
Hong dan.

125
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:05,011
Oh, dear, there's nothing to take.

126
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,515
-All right, that's it!
-Oh, dear.

127
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,518
-You took everything.
-What...

128
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,753
You guys are cheating!

129
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:17,056
How dare you call me a cheater!

130
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,292
Do you have proof? Do you?

131
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,660
Yes, I do!

132
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,863
When the boss touched his nose,
you threw out the pi card.

133
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,500
And when you touched your ear,
he played the eight card, which you took.

134
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,235
Don't deny it!

135
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,038
Hey! I touched my nose
because it was itching, that's all!

136
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,006
Be quiet! You were an accomplice.

137
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,876
-Forget it. I won't play!
-Hey!

138
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,312
How dare you call me a cheater?

139
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,682
And who in the world do you think you are?

140
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:46,319
Did you come to visit a sick old woman
or raise her blood pressure?

141
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,622
I didn't even want to play cards,
but you insisted

142
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,991
and now you call me a cheater?

143
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,994
I hate poor sportsmanship! Just leave!

144
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,663
Throwing a tantrum doesn't make you right.

145
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,699
Let's play just one more game

146
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,634
or give me back the money you won from me.

147
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,503
Why should I do that? The money's mine!

148
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,808
-Hi.
-Hey.

149
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,376
Hello.

150
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,144
You're looking good, Grandma.

151
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:13,980
Hello, Grandma.

152
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,648
Hi, Eun-chan.

153
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:16,682
Hi.

154
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,453
Is this someone's wake?
Why is everyone coming here?

155
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,687
Where are you going?

156
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,123
I'm going to pee!
Do I need your permission?

157
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,925
I'll help you. Let's go.

158
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,059
You punk.

159
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,428
I may be old, but I'm still a woman.

160
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,031
Don't you dare treat me
as if I were senile.

161
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,633
Gosh. Forget it.

162
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,834
I'll take you.

163
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,369
There's no need.

164
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,903
It's just over there.

165
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,207
Let's go.

166
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,975
I bet you need to go badly.

167
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,144
I'm in.

168
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,812
-Now lock the door.
-What are you doing here?

169
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,715
-We were playing cards.
-Leave me alone!

170
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,450
-Sit down.
-Did you win any money?

171
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,685
Not at all.

172
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,687
Those two were cheating.

173
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,955
I only have 1,000 won left.

174
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,189
Get out of the bathroom!

175
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,245
Where's Han-sung?

176
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,648
Your grandma wanted some porridge
so he went off to buy some.

177
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,251
-And Eun-chan?
-They went together.

178
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,853
I said I wanted to stay with you.

179
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,925
Eun-chan's so strange.

180
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,296
I always feel tense and uncomfortable
around older people.

181
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,466
But he seems so comfortable
around your grandma.

182
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,035
He's nice to everyone.

183
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,237
He's very outgoing

184
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,174
and even though he acts kind of ditzy,
he makes friends quickly.

185
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,309
He hasn't had many chances in life,

186
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,111
but I'm sure
he would do well in anything he does.

187
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,614
He's quite a character.

188
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,018
I guess you've taken a liking to him too.

189
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,355
Your grandma doesn't seem as ill
as I thought she would be.

190
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,325
I was so worried
when I heard the news from Han-sung.

191
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,662
I can't believe it took
such a big incident for me to shape up.

192
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,632
Last night, I remembered
that I hadn't gone night fishing

193
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,836
with my grandma in a long time.

194
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,941
My grandma is great at fishing.

195
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,044
Want to borrow this?

196
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,213
You know this shoulder is reserved
for Choi Han-gyeol only.

197
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,148
No.

198
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,624
It's tough, isn't it?

199
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:43,195
I feel guilty
about not going fishing with her,

200
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:47,700
even though I knew that she only wanted
to go fishing

201
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,504
to spend time with me.

202
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,647
Are you happy to be back at the cafÃ©?

203
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,983
How did you know?

204
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,019
Why else would you be here with Han-gyeol?

205
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,589
He begged me to return,
saying that he needed me

206
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,226
and that business was going
down the drain without me

207
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,162
so I finally gave in.

208
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,998
So, Han-gyeol begged to you?

209
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,366
Something like that.

210
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,669
I saw your name in a movie.

211
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,639
"Music director, Choi Han-sung."
It was so cool.

212
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,940
Which movie was that?

213
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,609
I forgot.

214
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,335
Let's grab a bite.

215
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,771
No.

216
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,675
What's your problem?

217
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,944
Don't worry about it and just drive.

218
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,780
You must be hungry.

219
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,216
That's why
you shouldn't have come with me.

220
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,218
I'll buy you two bowls
of short rib soup. Happy?

221
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,020
I don't want to eat. Let's just go back.

222
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,156
Are you feeling all right?

223
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,660
I'm feeling fine. I'm not hungry.
Let's just go!

224
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:22,795
Stop annoying me.

225
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,197
Jeez! What are you shouting at me for?

226
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,766
Do you think you can walk all over me
just because I'm nice to you?

227
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,401
How could you be like that?

228
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,470
Lying with your head
on your cousin's girlfriend's lap

229
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,239
right when he wasn't there.

230
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,674
You're such a loser,
drooling over her like that!

231
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,809
What? Drooling?

232
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,844
How could you be so thoughtless?

233
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,980
How do you think that made
Mr. Han-sung feel?

234
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,182
You're so selfish!

235
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,718
Mr. Han-sung didn't say anything about it
because he's so nice!

236
00:14:47,152 --> 00:14:47,987
You better stop it.

237
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,889
If you like her so much,
just steal her from him!

238
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,892
Is that all you take me for?

239
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,961
I couldn't do that to my cousin.

240
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,764
Don't pretend to be moral
after doing all sorts of stuff.

241
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,333
How could you have a crush

242
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,702
on another man's girlfriend
for all those years?

243
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,070
You pathetic loser!

244
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,506
Jeez!

245
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:11,143
I've never heard anything
so insulting in my life.

246
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,511
-Damn it!
-Jeez!

247
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,281
Jeez.

248
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,984
Damn it!

249
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,496
What do you think?

250
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:33,799
The title is the "Corny Tumor."

251
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,671
Why are you getting cooler and cooler?
You're making me nervous.

252
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:45,511
I was nervous throughout
the nine years that we were together,

253
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,346
but you're only nervous now?

254
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,517
How was I in my '20s?

255
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,885
You in your '20s?

256
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,089
You were

257
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,426
always busy, disorganized, and impatient.

258
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,829
It always seemed like you were
being chased by something

259
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,365
and that you were always chasing
after something.

260
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,435
But you didn't know
what that something was.

261
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:18,243
I've been looking back on my life
these days because of Eun-chan.

262
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,414
Why wasn't I as innocent
and naive in my '20s?

263
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,118
You're still innocent and naive.

264
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,522
Don't like her too much, okay?

265
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,028
I just think that she's cute, that's all.

266
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,631
I'm not going to stand for it anymore.

267
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,568
Okay?

268
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,536
Okay?

269
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,139
And what if you don't stand for it?

270
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,174
-What then?
-I'm just not going to stand for it!

271
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,018
What the heck? Hey!

272
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,824
-Eun-chan.
-Move out of my way!

273
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,026
Eun-sae--

274
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,197
Damn it!

275
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,504
Mr. Hong, what's the matter
with those two?

276
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,841
They're just in the middle
of a little fight, that's all.

277
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,210
Why won't Eun-sae answer my calls?

278
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:38,724
I need to ask you for some advice,
Seon-gi.

279
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:44,997
My Eun-sae hasn't answered my calls
all day long.

280
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,965
What would you do in my situation?

281
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:50,235
You've waited for one woman
for three years.

282
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,805
-How did you do that?
-Watch your mouth.

283
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,106
You don't have to worry.

284
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,542
I'll take the secret
of your beautiful love to the grave.

285
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:57,476
I swear!

286
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,913
Can I let you in on another secret?

287
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,184
I'm actually Japanese.

288
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:07,686
Nihonjin desu.

289
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,391
So you're Japanese?

290
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,159
No wonder you speak Japanese so fluently!

291
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,696
I'm so sorry for ragging on you
about speaking Japanese.

292
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,099
My lips are sealed so don't worry.

293
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,438
Golly. You've revealed
all your secrets to me.

294
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,775
What should I do? I was really
going to keep this a secret,

295
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,311
but I don't think it's fair to
keep secrets from you.

296
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,354
Eun-chan's actually a girl.

297
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,790
What?

298
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,158
She's a girl.

299
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,430
I'm serious! She's a girl.

300
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,475
I kiss him, I go to the hospital with him,

301
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,179
and I make him laugh,
but all he cares about is her.

302
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,608
When will the rest
of the results come out?

303
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,077
-Hello, boss!
-Good morning.

304
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:42,414
It would be nice if she stayed
in the hospital until the results are out.

305
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,022
Okay. I'll see you at home.

306
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,526
A little more to the left.

307
00:19:56,595 --> 00:20:00,065
Wait! It's not straight!
Can't you even see that?

308
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,370
Move it a little to the right.

309
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,774
A little more. Yeah.

310
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,811
Jeez! Can't you see that it's crooked?
Are you blind?

311
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,551
And the picture's upside down!

312
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,087
How can you not see that?

313
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,364
Hey! I don't know why
I have to explain this to you,

314
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:36,335
but I'm not the kind of jerk who wants
to steal his cousin's girlfriend.

315
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,804
Yoo-joo and I, we're just...

316
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,006
I mean, we used to be like that

317
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,108
but now we're just old friends...

318
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,981
What? I guess that was hanging
upside down until now.

319
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,324
Darn it!

320
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,568
MH ENTERTAINMENT 1ST AUDITION

321
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,203
Hello!

322
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,572
We're the Mighty Ducklings!

323
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,188
Look what I just dragged in.

324
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,025
It's Superstar Jang Dong-gun!

325
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,461
Aren't I just adorable?

326
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,768
Next. Please leave.

327
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:44,303
-Next.
-One more time.

328
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,039
-This.
-We've seen enough.

329
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,273
-Look.
-Next!

330
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,788
Hey, I watched a movie
with a regular yesterday.

331
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,956
Isn't that against the rules?

332
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:05,991
What rules?

333
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,927
What rule can there be against
a man and a woman falling in love?

334
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:11,663
But still,
keep this a secret from Han-gyeol.

335
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,599
Hey! Check this out.

336
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,004
She's so in love with me.

337
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,506
It looks like
you're the one who's in love.

338
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:25,177
That's not true. Look at this picture.
She's the one who's gaga over me!

339
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,246
Why don't I have her set you up
on a blind...

340
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,415
I'm starved.

341
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,884
I'm on my way to the farm
to pick up the apples.

342
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,619
He said he would deliver them for us.

343
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,188
Did you write down the bean orders?

344
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,757
I put the beans and the delivery list
in your car.

345
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:41,626
Let's deliver them together after we eat.

346
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,161
You should go with Ha-rim.

347
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,663
I'm kind of busy.

348
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,998
Where are you going? You barely ate.

349
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:48,834
I'm full. I'll see you later.

350
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,603
He won't even look at me!

351
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,305
Hey!

352
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,650
What's your problem?
If you're mad, just say it.

353
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,052
Why are you acting like this?

354
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,453
Acting like what?

355
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,456
I have enough problems as it is.

356
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:14,059
Stop annoying me and tell me what it is!
What's your problem?

357
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,093
I like you.

358
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,230
What?

359
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,533
I said I like you.

360
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,171
But that's not right

361
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,940
since we're both guys.

362
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,616
I told you to stop playing around. Hey!

363
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,419
That's why I'm trying to move on.

364
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,354
So just leave me alone, will you?

365
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,051
That runt is driving me out of my mind.

366
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,859
The Department of Psychiatry.

367
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,028
The Department of Psychiatry.

368
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,246
Would you like some coffee?

369
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,516
No. I think I'll pass.

370
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,585
Have you ever kissed anyone?

371
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,288
When did you first feel the urge
to become a woman?

372
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,390
The urge to wear makeup?

373
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,959
When did you start

374
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:58,630
getting aroused anytime you saw a man?

375
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,602
-I've never--
-Gets aroused

376
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,138
whenever he sees a man.

377
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,608
I'm sorry.
I think I'll just come back later.

378
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,876
All you need is medication.

379
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,347
I'll give you three days worth.

380
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:17,449
Try it.

381
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,286
I try not to be, but I keep getting angry.

382
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,822
And whenever I see him, I feel like
something's burning inside of me.

383
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:24,756
Because you like him?

384
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,192
I really don't know.

385
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,794
Sometimes I like him,
sometimes I hate him,

386
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,930
and other times I'm angry at him.

387
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:35,066
You can't make anything pretty
while scowling like that.

388
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,502
Hey. What is that?

389
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,670
She's drawing an angel.

390
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,273
-I've ruined it again!
-Hey.

391
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,218
My angel!

392
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,056
What are you doing here?

393
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,025
I told you not to come to the academy.

394
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,427
You weren't taking my calls.

395
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:04,329
I thought we could catch a movie together.

396
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,666
Have you seen this movie?

397
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,068
They say that it's really good.

398
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,070
Why would I want to watch
a movie with you?

399
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,439
Angel.

400
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,009
Let's watch it together.

401
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,613
I'm not going to say this again,
so listen carefully.

402
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,517
I like men who are smart.
Not ignoramuses like you.

403
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,085
But I'm going to study.

404
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,621
I've even registered for a GED class!

405
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,426
Regardless, don't call
or come to see me anymore.

406
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,163
Don't send me text messages
filled with typos either.

407
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,099
Wait. I do that on purpose

408
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,101
to make you laugh.

409
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,469
Wait.

410
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,805
Take this.

411
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:05,624
I don't think it will work out

412
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,892
between us no matter what I do.

413
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,298
Is love liking someone even though

414
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:15,533
you know...

415
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,339
it won't work out?

416
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,508
Just end it.

417
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,076
Don't be pathetic and clingy.

418
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,346
Yes, that's what I plan to do.

419
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,423
Hey. Want to get some ice cream?

420
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,058
Hey!

421
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:44,896
What's wrong?

422
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:48,967
I flunked another audition.

423
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,776
Give me a kiss.

424
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,121
Are you crying?

425
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:16,861
Don't cry.

426
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,570
Joo!

427
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:28,973
You're finally here!

428
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,047
Do you remember
when I had my first exhibit?

429
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,951
I'll never forget that run-down cellar.

430
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,820
It had such a stench.

431
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,888
And you bit down on your lip not to cry.

432
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,524
I fell in love with you because of that.

433
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:50,995
Didn't you say you were in love
with my artistic inspiration and talent?

434
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:52,764
That too.

435
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,100
How's it going with the musician?

436
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,568
How's it going with the lingerie model?

437
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,105
It's going well.

438
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,174
He's warm
and he puts me at ease. It's nice.

439
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:08,713
I'm here for you.

440
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,651
I'm going to start a restaurant
and I want to decorate it with your works.

441
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,055
I want you to design the doorknob,

442
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:21,159
lighting, and even the spoons.

443
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,861
I want you to take part
in the making of it.

444
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,430
I'll give you a share of the restaurant.

445
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,099
I love this.

446
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,602
Can I have it?

447
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,716
You know those pancakes you made before?

448
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,451
Why don't you make them smaller,

449
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,054
into single servings,
and sell them for 3,000 won each?

450
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,290
We won't make any profit then.

451
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:53,358
Really?

452
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,931
Your face and your general demeanor
are so mysterious.

453
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,467
At first, I thought you were Japanese.

454
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,535
I am Japanese.

455
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:04,869
Really?

456
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,971
So why is your Korean so good?

457
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:08,273
Because my mom is Korean.

458
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,176
Let me ask you a question.

459
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,179
What did you do to your breasts?

460
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,283
Is your chest normally flat?

461
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,560
Min-yeop!

462
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:33,598
What in the world do you see in her?

463
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:37,101
I mean, this goes beyond
playing hard-to-get.

464
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,903
She's just plain mean!

465
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,541
Jeez! Just look at the state you're in
because of her!

466
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,642
I don't want any.

467
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,744
There's plenty of fish in the sea.

468
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,780
She's my first love,

469
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,381
and the first girl I ever kissed.

470
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,484
Eun-sae is the only one for me!

471
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,586
Min-yeop.

472
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,388
Your first love isn't everything.

473
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:00,692
If there's a first, there's a second,
third, hundredth, thousandth...

474
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,864
Hey, I have a great idea.

475
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,699
Leave me alone. I'm in no mood for jokes.

476
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,735
Hey! I've decided to help you out.

477
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,504
Just do as I say
and Eun-sae will be yours--

478
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,743
Come here. Follow me!

479
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,011
What's the matter?

480
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,247
What did you tell Seon-gi?

481
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,883
Well, the thing is...

482
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,285
-Wait...
-You would sell out your own mom.

483
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,320
-Well, the thing is...
-Shut up!

484
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:32,690
What do you think you're doing
in front of the customers?

485
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:33,658
Go inside!

486
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,328
You're the one who was shouting.

487
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,164
What did you say?

488
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,234
You almost made me go deaf.
Look at the customers.

489
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,036
They agree you were the loudest.

490
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,404
What?

491
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,106
Did you park here again?

492
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,041
How many times do I have to tell you
not to park here?

493
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,378
People keep touching your car
as they pass by and it gets all smudged.

494
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:54,712
Move your car.

495
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,814
Who are you to tell me
to move my car? Go inside!

496
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,484
Seriously...

497
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,398
-Goodnight!
-Goodnight!

498
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:16,634
-Goodnight!
-Goodnight!

499
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,136
And we're out.

500
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,909
Let's go out for a drink. How about it?

501
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,511
-What?
-Come on.

502
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,246
-Good night.
-Call me if you change your mind.

503
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,647
Okay, good night.

504
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,951
Did you move on?

505
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,158
You said you would move on
and get over your feelings for me.

506
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,492
So, did you?

507
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,461
Almost.

508
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,664
I'll tell you
when I've completely moved on.

509
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,232
Good night.

510
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:09,921
Aren't I good?

511
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,492
How do you play this? Let's see.

512
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,272
I can see why Kenny G's face is so pointy.

513
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,308
-Do you want to learn?
-No.

514
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,943
I'm not very musically talented.

515
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,012
My mom sent me to learn piano
when I was little,

516
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,313
but I ended up breaking the piano.

517
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,814
I'm famous for that incident.

518
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,350
Play me something.

519
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,586
I shouldn't. I might break it.

520
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,854
It's all right. Play me something.

521
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:52,296
You're rather good.
Do you know how to play that?

522
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,032
Shall we play together?

523
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,476
You seem to be in a good mood today.

524
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,478
I've realized that it's better

525
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,714
to follow your heart
even if it's difficult,

526
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,284
instead of doing the opposite
of what your heart tells you to do.

527
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,524
You remind me of Santa Claus.

528
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:21,893
Have I gained that much weight?

529
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,362
Come to think of it, your shape...

530
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,764
Is it showing?

531
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:32,070
Every time I see you,

532
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,971
I feel like I'm receiving
a Christmas present.

533
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,442
You always say the nicest things.

534
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,578
-Begin.
-Begin.

535
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,225
You promise to keep it a secret?
If you tell--

536
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,760
Come over and clean our place.

537
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,030
Once a week. Then I'll promise.

538
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,233
Can't you just promise me
without any conditions?

539
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,234
Forget it, then.

540
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,502
Fine! You win.

541
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,106
So all I have to do is clean?
No to changing your mind.

542
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,508
What are you talking about?

543
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,378
Check if that's cracked.

544
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,581
How can you study with that head of yours?

545
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:17,949
Stop being mean.

546
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,684
I'll have you know
that my IQ is above average.

547
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,353
Have you read the books I gave you?

548
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,557
I've been a little tired lately,
but I've skimmed through them.

549
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,359
The temperature of milk for latte art?

550
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,293
65 degrees.

551
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,629
I guess you did open it.

552
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,500
You don't learn that from books,
but through practice.

553
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,069
Do you like shaved ice?

554
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,939
Okay. I'll try asking her.

555
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,808
Bye.

556
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,144
Who was that?

557
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,112
Han-gyeol.

558
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,949
He wanted to know if you would like
to go for a drive tonight.

559
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,052
A drive in the middle of the night?

560
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,220
Why not?

561
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:59,590
You can see the beautiful lights
of the city at night.

562
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,495
I appreciate you

563
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,299
not sending Han-gyeol to the orphanage.

564
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:13,638
Thanks to you, I have a great son now.

565
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,775
I could never have made that decision
if it weren't for your advice...

566
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,949
Here. This is for you.

567
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,852
But Mom...

568
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,821
This is one of your most cherished...

569
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,392
Are you sure?

570
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,195
You can't take it back.

571
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:42,300
Let me use it just one more time first.

572
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,669
-Hey!
-Hey!

573
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,070
Give me that!

574
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,972
This will get hot pretty soon, ma'am.

575
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,174
-I'm eating something cold.
-Hold still.

576
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,943
What are you doing?

577
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,479
-That's why we want to warm your stomach.
-Oh, my dear.

578
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,814
Jeez!

579
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,116
Why are you making such a commotion?

580
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,053
It's because of your grandson.
This is so cold.

581
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,389
We could've gotten soup, eel,
or pork trotters,

582
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,592
but he insisted on shaved ice.

583
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:09,760
That's what you want to eat.

584
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,497
He got bad grades when he was
in school, didn't he?

585
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,633
Isn't it obvious?

586
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,036
I bet you had really expensive tutors
and you went to New York

587
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,406
because you couldn't get
into college here. Right?

588
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,242
If I had good grades to go
with this handsome face,

589
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,944
wouldn't life be too unfair?
Right, Grandma?

590
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,045
That's true.

591
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,048
Anyway, why are you two always
hanging around each other

592
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,451
and getting into squabbles
as if you were Sonny and Cher?

593
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:37,255
Are you talking about the duo
that sang "I Got You Babe?"

594
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,823
I know that song.

595
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,691
You even know that song?

596
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,029
This is delicious.

597
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:48,099
I feel so much better now.

598
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,202
Hold on. I'll be right back.

599
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,038
MADU GRANNY'S SHAVED ICE

600
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,741
He looks so pretty for a boy.

601
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,910
And he's such an affable child,
I'm sure he'll do well in life.

602
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,848
Should I make him my brother?

603
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,220
How's the cafÃ© doing?
Did you run it into the ground yet?

604
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,855
I saved it with apples.

605
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,358
Now I'm planning a second promotion.
It will be very special.

606
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,762
I'll show you how I succeed.

607
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,698
I'm impressed already.

608
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:25,770
Ma'am.

609
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,609
You should alternate
between this hot drink and the cold food.

610
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,110
You'll get a stomachache otherwise.

611
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:35,880
But I'm eating this precisely
because it's cold.

612
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,482
It would defeat the purpose
if I drink something hot.

613
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:41,085
-You had some of the cold food, so drink.
-What in the world?

614
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,689
Hold on. So I should drink this
before eating this?

615
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,325
This is hot!

616
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:52,263
Here.

617
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,899
This is nice!

618
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,035
Oh, my!

619
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,172
-Now drink this. Quickly!
-It's too hot to drink quickly.

620
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,879
-Grandma!
-What?

621
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:10,748
Look over here.

622
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:11,949
-Me too.
-What? Okay.

623
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,152
One, two, three.

624
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:25,463
Don't be so scared, babe.

625
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,932
We just want to talk to you.

626
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,533
Relax.

627
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,146
My angel is so feisty.

628
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,049
Are you playing with us?

629
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,917
I don't know which neighborhood
you're from,

630
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,588
but my boyfriend is the leader of the gang
in these parts.

631
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:53,190
He'll pluck out your eyeballs
and juggle them.

632
00:39:53,758 --> 00:39:55,993
Our eyeballs. How is she an angel?

633
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,995
Min-yeop has such strange taste in women.

634
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,565
I'm going to take this to the police.

635
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,000
You guys are dead meat.

636
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,103
-Hey! Get her.
-Hello?

637
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,139
-Get her.
-Police? I'm at--

638
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,842
Take her phone.

639
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,745
You call this loyalty?

640
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,247
What loyalty? I'm paying you.

641
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:17,748
-Give me a break.
-Get off of me!

642
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,983
Hey! Move over!

643
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,918
-Get it.
-Get off of me!

644
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,720
Get off!

645
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,823
I'll kill you if you touch me!

646
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,691
My angel!

647
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,326
-Get off me!
-Get off of her!

648
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,595
Who are you people?

649
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,663
Hey!

650
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:35,699
Are you all right, my angel?

651
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:37,301
Get up.

652
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,404
Oh, no.

653
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,107
You're all dead meat!

654
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,343
-Why you...
-Min-yeop!

655
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,248
You bastards!

656
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:53,918
-What is he doing?
-What the heck!

657
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,729
What happened to those three?

658
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,665
Thank you!

659
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,501
He's all scratched up but he seems happy.

660
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,839
Enjoy.

661
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,911
I just lost my mind
when I saw Eun-sae cry and...

662
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,880
You're the traitor, you bastard.

663
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,415
I should be wearing that, not you.

664
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,283
Don't take that! Eun-sae gave that to me!

665
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,418
-Ha-rim!
-Hey!

666
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,652
Follow me.

667
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,820
What is it now?

668
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,823
What are you doing?

669
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:38,028
I just can't forgive you
for what you've done!

670
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,232
Wait a minute! What are you doing?

671
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,867
I want you to write it in blood,
you bastard!

672
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,768
Hey! Jeez! Wait!

673
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,939
If you ever tell anyone again,
I'll stitch that pie hole of yours shut!

674
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,276
I've aged because of you.

675
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:58,716
I'm sorry, Eun-chan.
I'll never betray you again.

676
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,185
Can you swear it on Eun-sae?

677
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,154
Eun-sae? I swear!

678
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,923
Do you like her that much?

679
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,931
Can I ask you something?

680
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,133
What do you think...

681
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,770
about a girl like me?

682
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,739
What?

683
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:26,143
You know that I'm a girl
even though everybody thinks I'm a guy.

684
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,046
So if I were a girl...

685
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,817
I must be out of my mind,
talking about this with a dunce like you.

686
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,085
I don't think...

687
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,689
I could ever like you as a girl.

688
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:39,757
What?

689
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,392
I can't tell whether
you're a girl or a guy.

690
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:43,127
You're not pretty like Eun-sae,

691
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,796
and I don't like women
who are stronger than I am.

692
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,466
I must be crazy to be talking to you
about this.

693
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:52,136
I'm sorry. It's just that my standards
are a little high.

694
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,210
Tell me which instruments you can play.

695
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,279
How can we put on a concert?
We're not a band.

696
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:04,281
You're always ordering us around.

697
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:05,816
You can build a stage, right?

698
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,052
Sure I can build a stage.

699
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,488
But I don't think us putting on a concert
is very feasible.

700
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:12,957
Concert? Are you talking about something

701
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,825
like a rock concert?

702
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,462
Seon-gi, don't you play the guitar?

703
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:19,897
Not well enough to perform.

704
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:22,166
Stop wasting time!

705
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,667
A concert won't be much of a promotion.

706
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,202
Only the regulars will come.

707
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:28,005
Your useless ideas won't get us anywhere.

708
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:29,974
We'll do this without Mr. Hong.

709
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,976
I'll assign each of you a part,
so practice.

710
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:33,744
Sales are on the rise,

711
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,613
so let's promote it more
and set it on fire.

712
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,614
Dismissed.

713
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,916
What do you mean, dismissed?
We don't want to do it.

714
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,785
Is it because you don't have the money
to hire a band?

715
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:44,188
Then how about we bring in
a karaoke machine?

716
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,389
Good idea.

717
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,428
Jeez.

718
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,138
KIDDO

719
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,553
That's really good.

720
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,188
This is difficult too.

721
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:19,857
I guess all instruments are difficult.

722
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,661
I want to play well at the concert
and show my boss.

723
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,497
Do you two quarrel a lot these days?

724
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,065
I'm trying to be patient with him.

725
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,738
Why is he such a jerk?
His mom seems so nice.

726
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,774
Yes. My aunt is a very nice person.

727
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:40,077
I was jealous of Han-gyeol
whenever I went over.

728
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:43,213
She would prepare dinner
with all home-cooked food,

729
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,049
and change the curtains every season.

730
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:47,785
I was so jealous of that.

731
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,688
Wasn't your mom like that?

732
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,458
My parents were very busy studying.

733
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:58,095
That's why my nanny practically raised me.

734
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:01,131
You must have been very lonely.

735
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,768
I hated being by myself

736
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:07,504
so I would turn on
all the lights at night,

737
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,307
and I had music playing at all times.

738
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,310
That's how I got to like music.

739
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,015
By the way, what does a music director do?

740
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,251
Why don't I show you? Follow me.

741
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:32,096
Listen to this.

742
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:41,872
When will the music start?

743
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,543
It has started.

744
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,316
This is so cool.

745
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,256
Did you really do this?

746
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:04,962
This is really cool.

747
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,566
I love it.

748
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,807
You're so great!

749
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,223
What's the matter?

750
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:07,291
Hello.

751
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:09,893
Hi.

752
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,996
I'll call you tomorrow.

753
00:47:58,308 --> 00:48:02,880
WAFFLE, TASTE THEIR SWEET SEDUCTION
WITH BITTER COFFEE

754
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,448
Have you tried kissing?

755
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:06,650
You mean with the regular?

756
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:08,719
You two kissed already?

757
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:11,355
There was no reason to put it off.

758
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,056
We kissed yesterday.

759
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,527
How can you take kissing so lightly?
Just kissing anybody like that!

760
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:20,564
There are a lot of more important things
in a relationship than kissing.

761
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,003
Wait a minute!

762
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,540
You got yourself a girl, didn't you?
Do I know her?

763
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:34,044
I'm glad! I was beginning to get worried
about your lack of a love life.

764
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:35,946
Han-gyeol.

765
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:39,049
I think Eun-chan met a girl.

766
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,118
Don't you think we should give him
some advice?

767
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,386
He's so naive.

768
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:43,720
I never said I met a girl.

769
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,256
Bring her over.
We'll give you our opinion.

770
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,959
Yeah. Bring her over here
so I can see what she's like.

771
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:50,527
Jeez!

772
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,125
You're worrying me way too much lately,
Lady Park.

773
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,662
This is going to happen

774
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,066
dozens of times before I die.

775
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,668
Are you going to rush over

776
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:35,205
looking as pale as a ghost
whenever this happens?

777
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,645
I'll be extra nice today.

778
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,983
I bet you haven't rested your head
on a man's arm since Grandpa passed away.

779
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,755
Han-gyeol!

780
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,691
Why don't you join me for a drink?

781
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,163
Start working at the company.

782
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,702
You're not young enough
to waste your time on useless things.

783
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:42,706
You can't live life doing

784
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,942
-only what you want--
-Do you even know what I want?

785
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:47,978
You know,

786
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:52,449
this is the first time you've asked me
to drink with you,

787
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,519
so I was curious
about what you were going to say.

788
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,788
But you're just nagging again,

789
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:01,591
I'm leaving.

790
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,061
I've prepared a position for you
in marketing.

791
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,243
I can't drink strong alcohol.
A single shot makes me pass out.

792
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:24,281
I'm going to New York in three months
as I promised Grandma.

793
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:30,187
Is making stupid toys your dream?

794
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,824
You loser.

795
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:36,226
Those are the genes you gave me.

796
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,864
You won't even get angry at me.

797
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,201
You're incredible.

798
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,903
Even when I ran away for a month,

799
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,539
even when I threatened
not to go to college,

800
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,041
even when I did worse--

801
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,909
Stop acting like a child
craving attention!

802
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,212
There used to be a time when I wished
that you would slap me!

803
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,486
If you were going to ignore me like this,

804
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,021
you shouldn't have brought me home.

805
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,051
Why did you suddenly
want to use a face mask?

806
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,287
-Because I'm down.
-What now?

807
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,323
People's feelings got entangled
in a gigantic web.

808
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,460
That's what scissors are for.
To cut out the knots.

809
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,162
You're so cruel.

810
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,130
Hey.

811
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:49,733
How could you buy Min-yeop sunglasses

812
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,601
when you've never given me anything ever?

813
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:55,705
You should be nicer to people you dislike.

814
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,776
-Smell my feet!
-Stop it.

815
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:08,051
Hello?

816
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:12,389
The nightingale sings, rousing me
from my deep morning slumber.

817
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,694
The nightingale sings on my window sill.

818
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,531
It coos and begs me not to go

819
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:26,102
like waves ceaselessly kissing the sand.

820
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:28,672
Wow, I bet this is the way

821
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,407
you seduced that lady you used
to live with.

822
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,177
Where did you find that poem?

823
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,079
I wrote it.

824
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,249
Gye-sik is a man of many talents.

825
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:41,184
Why don't you sing a song for us?

826
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:42,919
Maybe later.

827
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,223
First, how about a cold glass of beer?

828
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,325
-Beer?
-Yeah. Are you buying?

829
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,527
Aren't you leaving?

830
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,429
Aren't you going to sleep?

831
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:53,997
I can't sleep because of the hot weather!

832
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,565
-Jeez.
-Jeez.

833
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:57,634
Stop that! I'll do that for her.

834
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:00,370
Jeez! Nobody invited you to come.

835
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,575
Why is it so quiet?

836
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,612
Why?

837
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,880
Would you like me to turn on the TV?

838
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,950
I called you here to yap as usual.
Why are you so quiet?

839
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,787
Then I'll do the yapping.

840
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:21,625
It's a boring old story,
but listen anyway.

841
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,527
You know old stories?

842
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,866
It was the summer of my junior year
in high school.

843
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,738
I was playing hooky
and I sneaked into my house

844
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:37,641
where I saw my aunt from the US

845
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,844
sobbing in front of my grandma and dad.

846
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,214
She was upset over the fact

847
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,851
that not only did my dad make my mom

848
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,022
raise the child he had from an affair,

849
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:54,991
but he also made her cook

850
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:56,726
for my birth mother's memorial
for ten years.

851
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:01,064
Do you know what I thought at that moment?

852
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,001
That I should sneak out of the house
before I got caught.

853
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,873
I didn't say anything for all these years,

854
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,444
but I blew up today.

855
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,847
So,

856
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,751
your current mother
isn't your birth mother?

857
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,923
She has been even better
than a birth mother to me.

858
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,697
I had kept my mouth shut until now

859
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,900
because I didn't think
I could deal with it.

860
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,304
I regret saying anything.

861
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,096
Jeez! You're just pretending
to be drunk, aren't you?

862
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,698
Always making me carry you
around like this!

863
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:11,101
I can't believe my luck!

864
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:12,902
Jeez!

865
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,373
One, two, three, four.

866
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,885
You're gay, aren't you?

867
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,797
Well, I'm not.

868
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,637
So stop trying to seduce me.

869
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,942
Then you shouldn't have called me here

870
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,977
in the middle of the night.

871
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,183
Let's become blood brothers.

872
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,655
This isn't Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

873
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,303
Have you even read that book?

874
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:57,474
Then you must know
about the Oath of the Peach Garden.

875
00:57:59,008 --> 00:57:59,976
Of course I do.

876
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,278
It also came out in a graphic novel.

877
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,183
It's about Liu Bei, Guan Yu,
and Zhang Fei, isn't it?

878
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:08,651
Yeah.

879
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:12,555
They became blood brothers
who were closer than biological brothers.

880
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,161
I guess we wouldn't part

881
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:20,163
unless we die then.

882
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,112
I want you to call me by my name
from now on.

883
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,051
Hold on.

884
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:45,021
We'll need a token of our brotherhood.

885
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,095
Are your ears pierced?

886
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:56,633
A token? What do you think this is,
a kung fu movie?

887
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,005
Hey, call me by my name.

888
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:03,473
But you're my boss.

889
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,941
Come over here.

890
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:06,776
Let me go.

891
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:09,712
Call me by my name just once.

892
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:11,381
Stop bothering me!

893
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:21,591
Try calling me Han-gyeol!

894
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:22,559
I don't want to.

895
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,566
Come here!

896
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,936
-Hey! Let go of me!
-Come over here!

897
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,180
Say, "Han-gyeol,
I want to have my ears pierced."

898
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,016
Han-gyeol.

899
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,490
I wanted to stay by his side

900
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:57,527
even if it was as his brother.

901
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:02,031
I wanted to keep him by my side

902
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,435
even if it was as my brother.

903
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,808
Are we brothers now?

904
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,910
Will you love me more?

905
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,613
Why would I be in love with a man?

906
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,749
What matters is that you're drawn
to the person.

907
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,987
Are you telling me that it wasn't
a mistake? That it's love?

908
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:25,855
Are my prayers
finally going to be answered?

909
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,824
How much do you know?

910
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,794
I would appreciate it if you didn't
tell Mom that I know the truth.

911
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,163
I think I'm in love with him.

912
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,033
How could you fall in love
with Eun-chan of all people?

913
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,961
