1
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,524
Mister, it's dark.

2
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,426
A ghost could pop out.

3
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:04,397
-Boo.
-Don't do that. Please don't.

4
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,267
What is that?

5
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,537
That was made by cutting small pieces
of mother-of-pearl and sticking them on.

6
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,205
The stuff on wardrobes and dressers?

7
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,940
-Right.
-Amazing!

8
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:19,546
That looks like a conch
and also like a turtle shell.

9
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,182
It's like the sea.

10
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,352
When I was young, I went swimming
in the sea with my family.

11
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,856
I fell into the water and started sinking,
swallowing water and stuff.

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,159
When I opened my eyes,
the sea looked exactly like that.

13
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,196
It had an aura of mystery.

14
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,141
The artist would be very pleased
to hear that.

15
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,243
Do you know the artist?

16
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:51,911
You could say that.

17
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,616
I know I saw some food somewhere.

18
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,319
There it is.

19
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,764
What is this?

20
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,133
It looks like caviar.

21
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,268
-Caviar?
-Sturgeon roe.

22
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,403
Sturgeon roe? I knew that.

23
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:20,573
How do you feel? Are you happy?

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,641
Nervous.

25
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,845
-They're beautiful. Congratulations.
-Thanks.

26
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,882
She is the artist.

27
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:33,453
So the artist who made these
is Han Yoo-joo?

28
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,754
Do you know her?

29
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,491
Hello. Who is she?

30
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,093
She's cute.

31
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,861
She's a friend of mine.

32
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,065
What's gotten into you,
bringing a girlfriend?

33
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:48,234
She wanted to see the exhibit,

34
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,803
and I wanted to show off my girlfriend.

35
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,972
You're quite brave, my friend.

36
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,308
Introducing your girlfriend
to another girlfriend.

37
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,577
You're making me jealous.

38
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,847
What is it?

39
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,615
The restroom...

40
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,218
I'll be right here.

41
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,821
-Isn't she cute?
-She is.

42
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,693
I'm impressed, Yoo-joo.

43
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,398
I'm so excited to be able to show you
how I've succeeded.

44
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,033
Aren't I shallow?

45
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,334
No, you're not.

46
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,137
My successful girlfriend
makes me look good.

47
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:29,008
I hope she didn't recognize me.

48
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,110
Why did I have to run into Yoo-joo?

49
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,612
I almost had a heart attack.

50
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,148
I thought I was going to melt.

51
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,418
I'm so hot. My wig.

52
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,123
This feels good.

53
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,807
What in the world
am I doing to my breasts?

54
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,576
It's the plains one day,
and Mt. Everest the next.

55
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:09,082
Did you hear that Han Yoo-joo is drawing
for Hyujin Group's building?

56
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:11,784
I'm so jealous.
And she only just got back from New York.

57
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,186
She's so lucky.

58
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,988
I bet she's making tons of money.

59
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,523
So Han Yoo-joo is Girl B?

60
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,828
Dang it! Girl B has to be ugly.

61
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,963
This stinks!

62
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,977
They really look good together.

63
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,492
He really didn't recognize me!

64
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,077
Cousins fighting over the same woman.

65
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,578
How despicable.

66
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,749
You are really pathetic.

67
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,020
Han-gyeol.

68
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,755
Hey.

69
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:36,302
You shouldn't leave your date all alone.
You have no manners. Bring her over.

70
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,672
Okay. Hold on.

71
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,310
Don't come.

72
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,680
No one will recognize you. Don't worry.

73
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,916
What if they do?

74
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,919
-Who is she?
-Han-sung's girlfriend,

75
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,654
whom he has known for only two months.

76
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,890
She's a lot more novel than I am.

77
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,793
Congratulations.

78
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,962
I knew you would succeed
but still, it's beyond expectations.

79
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,431
I'm telling you this on the sly,

80
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,133
but I'm really happy right now.

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,168
You really worked hard for it.

82
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,170
You have the right to enjoy it.

83
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,407
It'll be fine.

84
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,643
-Hold on for a minute.
-Straighten your hair.

85
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,746
-Is it all right now?
-It looks nice.

86
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,981
Mister, wait a minute. Wait.

87
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,327
How is it? Was it fun?

88
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,029
I wanted the exhibit to be fun.

89
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,531
Awesome.

90
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,134
Really? Thank you.

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,035
To be honest, I was nervous.

92
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:47,106
Say hi. This is Han-sung's girlfriend.

93
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,144
Hello.

94
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,113
Excuse me, Ms. Han.

95
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:56,048
-Just a moment.
-Okay.

96
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,619
You said you couldn't make it today.

97
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,020
You look a little tanned.

98
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,423
I went on a trip with my employees.

99
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,093
It looks like you made up with Yoo-joo.

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,327
Yeah.

101
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,566
It's not like I'm a mediator
or an arbitrator,

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,102
but I keep getting pulled in.

103
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,739
Get along. Please.
You're giving me a headache.

104
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,941
Okay.

105
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,910
Nobody told you to care.

106
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,479
He keeps digging his own grave.

107
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,615
I have to go out to dinner
with the collectors.

108
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,750
Could you come along?

109
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:31,918
Sure.

110
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,122
I should better be getting back home.

111
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,291
Thanks for coming. Call you later.

112
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,392
See you later, Han-sung.

113
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,326
Bye.

114
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,564
I also should get going, too.

115
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,167
Hey, wait a minute. Hold on.

116
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,770
I can take you home.

117
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,072
It's all right. There's really no need.

118
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,007
-Bye.
-But...

119
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:00,012
Why did he have to show up
and ruin the day like that?

120
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,987
What's the matter? Are you okay?

121
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,288
Did you twist your ankle?

122
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:10,957
No. I'm fine.

123
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:12,658
My ankle is really strong.

124
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,061
Look at how thick they are.

125
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:16,629
I'm sorry.

126
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,331
I didn't know
that Han-gyeol would come too.

127
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:19,966
You were really surprised, right?

128
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,368
No. I'll be going.

129
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,905
Wait. You're mad. I'm sorry.

130
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,474
I shouldn't have let you run
into him like that.

131
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:33,946
No need to be sorry.
I had fun and it was thrilling.

132
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,150
How could he not recognize his employee
he saw every day for an entire month?

133
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,786
He's a little slow, isn't he?

134
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,756
Come on, I'll take you home.

135
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,425
No. That lady must be waiting.

136
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,263
She's Girl B, isn't she?

137
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,867
I'm so hungry.

138
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,136
I can't wait to get home
and get something to eat.

139
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,170
Bye.

140
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,839
Hey, wait.

141
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,541
Take a cab.

142
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,944
People are going to stare at you
if you take the bus in that getup. Here.

143
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,314
No. I'll call a car now. Wait.

144
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,515
It's all right.

145
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,584
There are lots of cabs down there.

146
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,221
I'm so excited. I get to take a cab.

147
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,758
Thanks for inviting me to the exhibit.

148
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,096
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

149
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,825
Shoot! It's only the left slipper.

150
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,908
I'm so tired.

151
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,722
Guy A.

152
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,760
Girl B.

153
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,431
There's no room for me.

154
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,002
They're way out of my league.

155
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,532
That hurts!

156
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:17,470
Hey! Just end it with those old guys.

157
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,306
Don't bother with superficial guys
who only like pretty girls.

158
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:23,008
You've finally said something right.

159
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,245
He should be looking
for a meaningful relationship,

160
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,048
not just another pretty face.

161
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,416
And is he blind?

162
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,018
Can't he see how pretty you are?

163
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,520
That's only what you think.

164
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,691
So, what are you going to do
about that old guy?

165
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,426
Like I have a choice.

166
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:43,395
I'll just have to admit
that he's way out of my league,

167
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,131
and just concentrate on making money.

168
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,667
These shoes are so pretty.

169
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,203
-I'm going to return them.
-I know that.

170
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,740
Anyway, you're trying to do everything
in the movies.

171
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,743
When the rich main guy
buys the poor main girl

172
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,213
expensive clothes and shoes,
she accepts them willingly,

173
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,350
but when things go south, she pretends
to be good and wants to return them.

174
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,285
You shouldn't have accepted them
in the first place.

175
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,388
Saying you'll return them
is all a part of the game.

176
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,024
Who is it?

177
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,192
BIG JERK

178
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,660
Big Jerk?

179
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,764
What am I, your slave?

180
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:22,735
You could've just ordered delivery
instead of making me bring it.

181
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,144
Here, keep the change.

182
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,748
Why is everyone giving me money today?

183
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:37,883
No, thanks.

184
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,553
-What's with you?
-Nothing.

185
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,359
Mister, which do you think
is more difficult?

186
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:52,064
Giving up on a crush
or continuing to have a crush,

187
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:56,669
even though you know that the other person
has no interest in you?

188
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,070
Alternating between the two.

189
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,014
What now?

190
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,183
Why would I want to just sit with you?

191
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,551
Coffee bean test.

192
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,119
What do you mean "test"?

193
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,724
Do you just sit around all day
figuring out ways to bother me?

194
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,059
How did you know?

195
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:33,739
Fine.

196
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,774
But if I guess right, let me see the room

197
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,510
that you wouldn't let me see
the other day.

198
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,015
I'm not going to display
my incredible sense of smell for nothing.

199
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,584
Forget it then.

200
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,587
Deal?

201
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,590
Deal.

202
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,663
It smells like chocolate and dirt.
It's Mocha Mattari.

203
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,838
The bet is over.

204
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,079
Wait a minute.

205
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,081
The smell of the pizza is throwing me off.

206
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,501
-It smells like wood.
-You have five seconds.

207
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,269
-One, two, five.
-Wait.

208
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,639
-Hey.
-Again. One, five.

209
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,375
Count correctly!

210
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,254
What is all of this?

211
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,489
My toys.

212
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,926
Did you play like this in the US?

213
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,662
There's a job where they pay you
for playing with these.

214
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,298
I did this in the US.

215
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,636
Is that why you want to go back?

216
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,272
Isn't it cool?

217
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,641
Being the owner
of your own little village.

218
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,844
I can do whatever I want here.

219
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,580
Isn't that how you live in real life?

220
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,954
En garde, Black Knight.

221
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,824
I'll bring justice to this land
with my sword...

222
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,727
So we meet again.

223
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,629
-Clang. Die!
-Clang.

224
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,732
Clang. Die!

225
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:43,035
Fire the catapult straight ahead.
Die, dragon!

226
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,471
Destroy everything with an excavator!

227
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,706
-Black Knight.
-I've destroyed everything.

228
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,509
That's the wrong era. Take that out.

229
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,711
-That's a bad guy.
-Fly, dragon, fly.

230
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,914
Don't you fly around like that,
you cowardly dragon.

231
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:58,384
Bite him!

232
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,119
Good job.

233
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:16,168
-What are you looking at?
-Nothing.

234
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,873
Where did you go today?

235
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,009
To Yoo-joo's exhibit.

236
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,914
How was it? Did you like it?

237
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,216
It was all right.

238
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,885
Why don't you just give up?

239
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:34,887
You're no match for that girl.

240
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,588
Watch whom you call a girl.

241
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:39,258
She's older than you.
And why am I no match for her?

242
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,794
You can't talk like this
in front of her, can you?

243
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,431
Loser.

244
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,399
Why you little...

245
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,706
You're right.

246
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,711
I plan to stop being a loser
who likes a girl who's taken.

247
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,580
You made the right choice.

248
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:07,553
We should give them
our most heartfelt blessings,

249
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,757
and wish all the best for them saying,
"Goodbye," to our crushes.

250
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,626
Our crushes?

251
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,229
Don't pry into my personal life.

252
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,869
Just because a crush is one-sided,
it doesn't mean...

253
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,240
you can end it alone.

254
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,045
You need the other person's cooperation.

255
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,483
Yoo-joo is doing really well
in that sense.

256
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:40,352
She never gives me even a glimmer of hope.

257
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,724
I really didn't feel like
eating alone today.

258
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,097
Why did I think of you when I was down?

259
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,535
Hey, runt. Are you asleep?

260
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,215
Hot. Why is it so hot today?

261
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,758
Hey.

262
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,760
Hey.

263
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,429
Hey. Go home and sleep.

264
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:58,864
What?

265
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,599
Go home and sleep.

266
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,109
-What would you like?
-A cup of coffee.

267
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,612
Oh, my gosh.
Would you please look this way?

268
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,380
You should try this as well.

269
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,450
Hey. Move closer to him.

270
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,185
What would you like?

271
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,487
-Iced coffee, please.
-I want iced coffee too.

272
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,822
Here you go.

273
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,191
He's so dreamy.

274
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,859
He's the best one here.

275
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:32,331
-Mr. Boss has got it going on too.
-People like the apples.

276
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,600
Okay, looking good.

277
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:35,634
MORNING COFFEE + AN APPLE

278
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,172
Everything my camera catches is gold.

279
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,873
Pure gold.

280
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,910
Angel, what brings you here?

281
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,812
You're messing up my shot, you gorilla.

282
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,181
Wait, Angel.

283
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,819
Aren't you happy
that your exhibit was such a success?

284
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:59,224
I thought that's how I would feel,
but not entirely.

285
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,328
I get sad when my pieces get sold
and taken away.

286
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,163
Am I being a brat?

287
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,033
Your patron DK wouldn't be
so happy to hear that.

288
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,635
DK?

289
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:13,238
Oh, that person I knew
one million years ago.

290
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,743
Where did you learn
to add chili paste to spaghetti?

291
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,345
Did you learn it
from that little girlfriend of yours?

292
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,015
No. I saw it on a cooking program.

293
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,585
By the way, she said

294
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,756
that your works look like the sea.

295
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,791
Even the way she talks is pretty.

296
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,661
Where did you get those yellow gloves?

297
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,463
Oh, these? I got them as a gift.

298
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,199
The inside is cotton so it's really soft.
It's really nice.

299
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:46,004
I realize, I'm selfish
at times like these.

300
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,541
I think that if this is marriage,
marriage would be all right.

301
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,245
But then, the calculating part
of my brain kicks in and I think,

302
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:56,481
it's better to stay single.

303
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,757
Then pay me for the food.

304
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:15,600
Is that enough?

305
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,639
I think it'll look better over there.
Move it over there.

306
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,740
It was there before.

307
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:23,909
Just go and put it back there.
Position it differently.

308
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,277
Differently?

309
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,545
Here?

310
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,314
Okay?

311
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:32,551
No. It'll get in the way of people
walking by. Put it back there.

312
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,252
You're driving me crazy.

313
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:37,089
-Over here.
-There you go.

314
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,691
Wait a minute. Can you move it
three centimeters to the right?

315
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:40,592
Just three centimeters.

316
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:42,627
Okay. A little more. Stop.

317
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,729
There.

318
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,131
The flower's facing the wall.
Turn it around so it's facing out.

319
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,567
-Okay.
-Done.

320
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,803
Okay. Take that to the terrace.
I don't like it here.

321
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,039
Why didn't you say so before?

322
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:55,941
To the terrace.

323
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,746
Hey. You're damaging the pot.
Stop dragging it.

324
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:06,918
Are you bored?
Why are you messing with him?

325
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:09,521
His expressions are so funny.

326
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,757
He has no decision-making skills.

327
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,794
He goes back and forth.

328
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,633
You should have just asked me
to do this. This is no job for a woman.

329
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,101
Just announce it, why don't you?

330
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,603
Where should I put it?

331
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,271
-Put it on the terrace.
-Okay.

332
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,474
That idiot's going
to end up driving me crazy.

333
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,607
Darn it. I knew
I should have washed my hair.

334
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:04,976
Enjoy.

335
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,480
Watch...

336
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,082
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

337
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,584
He's so clumsy.

338
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,955
How's your...

339
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,726
My head hurts just watching that.

340
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:26,965
Eun-chan.

341
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,344
I kept going out in the morning
to see you,

342
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,413
but you didn't come for the past few days.

343
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,553
I thought you were avoiding me,
so I came to complain.

344
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,123
I have to go to work earlier,

345
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,194
so I make my deliveries earlier
in the morning.

346
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,897
Oh, I see.

347
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,199
It must be so tiring,

348
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,202
having to deliver milk
and working at the café.

349
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:43,074
That's why I'm going to stop
delivering milk after this week.

350
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,179
I'm kind of sad.

351
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,517
I'm really going to miss Sweeper.

352
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,621
And me?

353
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:01,660
We can always meet up...

354
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,363
can't we?

355
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,366
Would your girlfriend dislike it
if we did?

356
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,271
You were hurt on the day
of the exhibit, weren't you?

357
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,075
I shouldn't have sent you home like that.

358
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,177
I regretted it afterward.

359
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,213
I'm sorry.

360
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,283
No.

361
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,987
You even gave me cab fare.

362
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:30,822
No.

363
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,458
I was being inconsiderate.

364
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,530
Also, your clothes and shoes
were in my car.

365
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:44,202
You must have been so startled
to have run into Han-gyeol like that.

366
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,404
I'm really sorry.

367
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:51,343
That's not it.

368
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,547
It's just that you're such a nice guy...

369
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,683
Because I like you...

370
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,524
I didn't know...

371
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,695
just how much I liked you.

372
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,600
My heart just ached when I was going home.

373
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,874
But I'm fine now.

374
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:30,315
Your girlfriend is so pretty and cool.

375
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,453
I'm going to let her have you.

376
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,459
I hope the two of you are happy together.

377
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,804
I'm really all right now.

378
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:22,000
-Here you go. Come again.
-Bye.

379
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,271
Where did Eun-chan go?

380
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,908
Is he goofing of somewhere again?

381
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,346
What?

382
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,450
If you like him, just say so.

383
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,485
Don't bug him for no reason.

384
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,923
I didn't bug him.

385
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:47,559
Do you think this coffee's too dark?

386
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,867
-Is Eun-chan working this afternoon?
-Yeah.

387
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,937
Are you going somewhere?

388
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,639
Yeah, I'm off to see a friend.

389
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,376
Come straight home
after your singing academy.

390
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,679
Don't hang out at the karaoke again, okay?

391
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,613
Whatever.

392
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,649
What's the difference between practicing
at the academy or at karaoke?

393
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,284
-Why I ought to...
-I got it. Got it.

394
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,187
-I'll go first. Have a nice day.
-You too.

395
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,024
IGNORAMOUS

396
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:22,327
Jeez, can't this guy ever leave me alone?

397
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,996
What is it? I'm busy.

398
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:27,065
Are you sure? So you'll come today?

399
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,535
-What? Waffle Seon-gi?
-I even got waffles for you...

400
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:32,570
-What's that?
-Just a minute.

401
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,506
-Oh, waffles. We have. Why?
-Mr. Hong.

402
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,875
Please keep it down. I'm on a call.

403
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,243
-Prince?
-If you don't come,

404
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,545
-I'll go to your school.
-Prince? What prince?

405
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,813
Hello? Eun-sae.

406
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,815
Anyway, we have a lot of dudes.

407
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,583
Okay. Come.

408
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,757
That brat hung up on me.
She's so impatient.

409
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,963
Let's go in.

410
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:02,934
I haven't been to the movies in so long.

411
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,170
It's been about 15 years for me.

412
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,905
-I can't even remember.
-Really?

413
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:12,177
In the past, I would come with the kids,
but they're so busy now.

414
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:16,314
I could tell that you were just dying
to go to the movies.

415
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,183
I read your mind, didn't I?

416
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,786
If you read my mind,
you wouldn't have worn that bow tie.

417
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:27,025
This bow tie is to express that
every day I go on with you

418
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,727
is an extravagant gift to myself.

419
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,564
Just being able to watch a movie
in the presence of such divine beauty--

420
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,934
Jeez, can you stop it with the chatter?

421
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,002
Be careful, Ji-hyang.

422
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,205
What happened? Why aren't they coming?

423
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,540
Stop nagging. They aren't that late.

424
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:43,975
It has been an hour.

425
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:46,878
-I'm going home.
-They're just taking too long.

426
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,346
We're just going to go, Eun-sae.

427
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:51,716
Hey, wait just a little bit more.
I'll buy you guys something to eat.

428
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,518
Sorry. Have fun waiting.

429
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:59,757
Did that dimwit figure out
what I was trying to do?

430
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:06,531
-Hello.
-Hey. What did you do with our pictures?

431
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,399
A NEW AGE OF MASCULINE BEAUTY
HAS ARRIVED...

432
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:18,276
ALONG WITH TWO CAFÉ OWNERS
AND THEIR PRINCES

433
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,944
DREAMY HAN-GYEOL

434
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,379
OH, MY GOSH.

435
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,683
HE'S THE DREAMY BOSS OF THE PRINCES!

436
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:28,486
EUN-CHAN THE CUTE KLUTZ

437
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,388
NO MORE VIOLENCE, PLEASE.

438
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:33,925
HE'S A REGULAR JAMES DEAN

439
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,426
WAFFLE SEON-GI

440
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,295
DAZZLING X 10,000

441
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,365
YOU SHOULD QUIT MAKING WAFFLES
AND BECOME A MODEL.

442
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:41,900
DAZZLE

443
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,535
FARTY PANTS MIN-YEOP

444
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,872
FART.

445
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:49,941
YOU'RE JUST AN ANIMAL.

446
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,410
NARCISSIST HA-RIM

447
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,580
TRY TO BE A LITTLE MODEST

448
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,815
HE'S SO INTO HIMSELF

449
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,351
EVERYTHING'S-SUCH-A-BOTHER MR. HONG

450
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,121
IS LIFE THAT MUCH OF A BOTHER TO YOU?

451
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,657
BUT YOU STILL LOOK GREAT
PLAYING THE GUITAR

452
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,558
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DRINK COFFEE
MADE BY THESE PRINCES?

453
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,295
THEN ZOOM ON OVER TO COFFEE PRINCE!

454
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,580
-Look over here.
-Look over here.

455
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:33,551
-They're so good looking.
-They're just dreamy.

456
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,154
Can you look over here?

457
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,289
Jesus.

458
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,625
It was a complete pandemonium today.

459
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,394
I can't believe how many people came here
because of the online video.

460
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:46,597
Han-gyeol, shouldn't we at least
thank Eun-chan's sister?

461
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:51,469
This is all useless.
What we really need are regulars.

462
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,072
Shoot. She's not answering her phone.

463
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:57,375
If she won't see me
because I didn't show up...

464
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,310
It's not like you didn't go on purpose.

465
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,846
Eun-sae's a lot more understanding
than you think.

466
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,817
Boss, I need some time off on Wednesday.

467
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,653
Hey. Do you think you're the only one here
who needs time off?

468
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,290
I need a break too.

469
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:17,662
Keep your mouth shut
instead of confirming you're an idiot.

470
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,198
Okay. But come for the evening shift.

471
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,299
Okay.

472
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,134
Let's all clean up and go home.

473
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:24,235
Okay.

474
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:28,639
What's with the sigh?

475
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,541
Is it because of Yoo-joo
or something at home?

476
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,249
-There is something nagging me.
-What is it?

477
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,118
It's none of your business. Get to work.

478
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,791
Time really flew by today.

479
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:50,895
Thanks for everything.

480
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,664
I know how stingy you are,

481
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,034
but you treated me to dinner and a movie.

482
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,735
You really spent big bucks today.

483
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,903
Ji-hyang.

484
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,042
Ji-hyang.

485
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:05,543
Let's go out.

486
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,080
What are you talking about, going out?
Go home.

487
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:17,021
The nightingales sing of love
but my heart cries in pain...

488
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,589
Please.

489
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:24,062
I was just trying to express
how I feel about you through the poem.

490
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,296
Good night.

491
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,698
Oh, how embarrassing.

492
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:13,845
Damn it.

493
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,100
Hey, how are you doing?

494
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,403
Min-ho opened his practice, right?

495
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,275
Someone I know is looking for a therapist.

496
00:35:50,948 --> 00:35:54,852
Can those be saved?

497
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,121
I came out really good.

498
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:00,291
The boss looks better.

499
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm so tired. So tired.

500
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:25,383
Are you okay?

501
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,451
Yes. I'm fine.

502
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,153
Are you hurt anywhere?

503
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,688
I'm sorry.

504
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:39,630
Hey. Eun-chan!

505
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:47,104
Hey, why don't you pay attention?

506
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:48,539
What's wrong?

507
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,742
It's true that I was dozing off,
but that car rammed into me.

508
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:54,812
So you were dozing off?
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

509
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,014
You have to pay attention
when you're on you're on the road.

510
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,983
Don't ride again
if that's your attitude...

511
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,353
Hello? Insurance?
I was just in an accident.

512
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,988
-I'm sorry.
-Just a moment.

513
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,090
-My employee tends to be a little clumsy.
-It's all right.

514
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,726
Please call me if there are any problems.

515
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,661
-My apologies.
-It's all right.

516
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,467
What's with him?

517
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,870
Enjoy your coffee.

518
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,340
He was just worried about you, that's all.

519
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,275
Regardless, Han-gyeol took care
of the accident.

520
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,645
You weren't there so you don't know.
He just flipped out.

521
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,780
Why is he acting like that
when business is so good?

522
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,452
Mister.

523
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,189
Are you busy? I'm done over here.

524
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,690
You ended earlier than expected.

525
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,925
-Yoo-joo
-Yeah?

526
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:44,028
I was in a middle of a call.
Sorry. Just a minute.

527
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,899
Yeah. So you weren't hurt anywhere?

528
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,901
I scraped my elbow but that's about it.

529
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:52,837
I have fast reflexes, you know.

530
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,474
I turned my body as I fell, avoiding harm.

531
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,942
That's good to hear.

532
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:08,319
Are you still at the café?

533
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:10,888
It's insane because of that online video.

534
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,757
It's a madhouse.

535
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:13,724
Hey. Eun-chan!

536
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,893
My prickly boss is calling me.

537
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,329
Are you sure he's your cousin?

538
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,563
You guys are total opposites.

539
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,698
Talk to you later.

540
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,768
All right, let's talk later. Bye.

541
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,005
Sorry about that. Did you wait long?

542
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,807
I'll pick you up.

543
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,711
You're in a cab already?

544
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,781
Why? You should've have waited.

545
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,417
Oh. Okay.

546
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:43,287
Then I'll call you when I get back. Bye.

547
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,025
I heard you broke up
more than three years ago.

548
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:50,628
I haven't seen her in a year, either.

549
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,763
So you really don't know where she is?

550
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,532
I really don't know.

551
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,134
I feel so sorry for you,

552
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:59,003
with what happened in Japan and now, here.

553
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:01,439
If you find out where she is...

554
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:06,644
could you please give me a ring?

555
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,669
Damn mosquitoes.

556
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,404
Can you turn on the lights, Mr. Hong?

557
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,774
Mr. Hong. Can you turn on the lights?

558
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,576
The light. Turn it on.

559
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:41,812
What?

560
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,781
What a jerk.

561
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,419
I can't believe you're using
that mosquito net all by yourself.

562
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,187
Shut up and let me sleep.

563
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,790
If I die, I'm going to let everyone know

564
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,825
that I suffocated to death
in this filthy hellhole.

565
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,027
This place is a complete
and utter disaster area.

566
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,896
Hey, Seon-gi, you wake up too.

567
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:01,132
How can you sleep in a place like this?

568
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:06,804
For the love of god.

569
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,779
I like the fact
that we're doing good business,

570
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,114
but we barely have any time to eat.

571
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:20,251
By the way, when are you going
to set me up with Eun-sae?

572
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,552
You promised to help me.

573
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:23,854
Do you know how swamped she is,

574
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,125
going to school
and going to her singing academy?

575
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,630
Fine, I promise to make her call you.
I promise.

576
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,365
Really? You promise?

577
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,436
You need to learn to trust people.

578
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,440
And eat quickly
before that mean boss of ours barges in.

579
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,409
Now that business is good,
he has lost his mind.

580
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:46,610
He flip-flops like mad.

581
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,480
I would have kicked his butt
if he weren't the boss.

582
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,682
But you know, he keeps looking at you.

583
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:52,917
Hey.

584
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,353
His gaze follows you wherever you go.

585
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,156
Even when you go to the restroom.

586
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:01,492
Maybe he's caught onto me?

587
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:04,128
-I think he's keeping you in check.
-Me? Why?

588
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:05,729
To see if you do your work or not.

589
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,965
What a complete jerk.

590
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,537
Where are you going, my Chan?

591
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:16,474
What are you doing here?

592
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,975
Didn't you go home early today?

593
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,445
I came here because I didn't want to die.

594
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,581
If I stay there any longer,

595
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,183
I may die of some disease.

596
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,922
Here. Have some gimbap.

597
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,693
I want to live long.

598
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,502
Mom, are you all right?

599
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,704
I think you should go to the hospital--

600
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,607
I'm fine. All I need is an antacid.

601
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:55,379
Why are you two overreacting like that?

602
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,482
I've lost my appetite now.

603
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,584
You should eat a little more.

604
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,387
Bring me some tea.

605
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:04,655
Okay.

606
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,649
You even put our pay in envelopes.

607
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,652
Mr. Hwang Min-yeop.
Why did he write "mister"?

608
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:36,954
It's already been a month,

609
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:40,157
and I'm extremely happy to be able
to give you your wages.

610
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,259
You've worked very hard the past month.

611
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:48,232
I'm giving these to you in the morning
so that you can work today in a good mood.

612
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:50,801
Why is he being so nice?

613
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:54,038
This is why I can't help but like you.

614
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,740
Thank you so much, boss.
I'll work even harder from now.

615
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,909
I would prefer direct deposit
in the future.

616
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,045
Why is there so much in here?
Did you pay yourself too?

617
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,981
Don't worry. I didn't get paid
more than you, Mr. Hong.

618
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,717
Dismissed.

619
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,495
He didn't take any pay
so he could give the employees more money.

620
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,803
You go first.

621
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,672
Look where you are going.

622
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,908
What's with the two of them?

623
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,010
They act so uncomfortably
around each other.

624
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,578
It must be good to be young.

625
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,813
Pardon?

626
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,215
Guy-girl relationships are so cute.

627
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,652
Where are you going, boss?

628
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:44,355
What's it to you? Just make sure
to lock up before you leave.

629
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,125
Jeez, one moment he's nice,
and then the next moment, he's a jerk.

630
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,260
He could have just told me
where he was going.

631
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,237
Why are you here with me?
Where's Han-sung?

632
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,440
Sometimes, it's better to be
with a friend than a boyfriend.

633
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:29,667
Spit it out instead of just staring at me.

634
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,573
Let me hug you.

635
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,822
I'm relieved.

636
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:53,590
Thank you, Yoo-joo.

637
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,694
I don't think I'll need to go
to a mental hospital.

638
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,496
Thank you, too.

639
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:01,999
What are you thanking me for?

640
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,735
Just everything.

641
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:14,445
You're suffocating me.

642
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,282
I like you so much.

643
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,107
COOPERATE WITH THE NEW KING
OF FAR FAR AWAY, YOU FREAKS!

644
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,809
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THE KING OF THE STUPIDS!

645
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,278
Let's go.

646
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,280
You're so smart.

647
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:03,520
-Run.
-Jump.

648
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,856
Roll.

649
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,691
Good boy.

650
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:11,094
-Roll.
-This way.

651
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:15,199
-Here.
-Caught it. Here.

652
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:24,241
Is the café doing well?

653
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,043
Yes, it's very well.

654
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,580
By the way, does Han-gyeol
still not know your secret identity?

655
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,616
Why? Are you planning to squeal on me?

656
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,451
We'll have to see about that.

657
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,055
Anyway, about your cousin.
He was a pain before too,

658
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:42,359
but he's acting even stranger
than usual these days.

659
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,861
I can't stand him.

660
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,929
It's like he has multiple personalities.

661
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:48,966
Why does Guy 1 give Girl 2
such a hard time?

662
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,801
Does he have a crush on her?

663
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,805
No. Guy 1 has a crush
on this other very beautiful woman.

664
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,443
Then what is Guy 1 to Girl 2?

665
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,981
Her boss.

666
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,582
Is that it?

667
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:07,751
Yes.

668
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:12,890
Girl 2 is in love with someone dashing.

669
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:18,128
-Mister.
-Yeah?

670
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,130
Do you know how interesting coffee is?

671
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:24,034
It tastes different depending
on what kind of beans you use,

672
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,603
how you roast them,

673
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,805
and even the temperature of the water.

674
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,377
The world of coffee is boundless.

675
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:39,483
Then, shall we have a cup
of that infinite coffee at my place?

676
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,251
Okay.

677
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,619
Okay.

678
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,757
Terry.

679
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,298
You're all sweaty.
Why don't you take a shower?

680
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:56,066
I'll wait outside.

681
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,568
I couldn't shower in someone else's home.

682
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,604
Why not? Just wash up.

683
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,005
The bathroom's there.

684
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:08,111
By the way, the bathroom door
is broken and it won't lock.

685
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,846
The door doesn't lock.

686
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:10,948
Pardon?

687
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,785
Just kidding. It locks fine, so wash up.

688
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,320
Let me know when you're done.

689
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,099
Terry.

690
00:49:31,601 --> 00:49:34,137
Where's your master?
Where's your master, boy?

691
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:38,275
Let's go to him. Where could he be?
Let's go find him.

692
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,511
Good boy.

693
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,083
What are you doing there?

694
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:48,518
What are you doing here?

695
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:51,188
I brought breakfast.

696
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:54,624
I'm famished because I walked.
Let's go in and eat.

697
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,860
Okay. Wait, Yoo-joo.

698
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,563
Mister. Do you have anything
I could change into?

699
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:01,031
Anything will do.

700
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,080
She delivers my milk.

701
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,118
I saw her around since we live
in the same neighborhood.

702
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,354
I was so shocked when I saw her
at Han-gyeol's café's grand opening.

703
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:26,356
Isn't she so funny?

704
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:30,327
You feel bad for lying to me, right?

705
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:32,596
What?

706
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,937
Why didn't you wear what I gave you?

707
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,374
It's okay. I prefer to wear
my own clothes.

708
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,178
I should get going.

709
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,115
You can't go like that.

710
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,584
It's a quick ride on my bike.

711
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,121
He's right. Those clothes are too wet.

712
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,591
Han-sung, didn't I leave a shirt
here the other day?

713
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:05,195
No, really. I can just go like this.

714
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:08,465
You'll catch a cold.
Do you know where it is?

715
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,633
What?

716
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:14,504
I think it's in my closet.
Oh, yeah. Hold on.

717
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,441
Why are you so flustered?
Do you feel guilty or something?

718
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,810
Really, I'm fine going like this.

719
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,446
Don't. Come sit with me.

720
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,085
Take a seat.

721
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,627
How could you fool everyone like that?

722
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,571
Is the person I met at the exhibit,

723
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,506
the person before me,

724
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:53,276
and the person from
Han-gyeol's café all the same person?

725
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,651
I have so many questions to ask.

726
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:08,658
Come to think of it,
I should have known when you said

727
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,727
that you had a crush on that male teacher.

728
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,232
I'm sorry.
There were some circumstances...

729
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,637
I really have a good reason
for pretending to be a guy,

730
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,207
so could you keep this secret
from my boss? Please?

731
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,945
May I ask what those reasons are?

732
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:31,248
It's kind of complicated,

733
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,184
and it's a really long story.

734
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,389
My boss will fire me
if he finds out I'm a girl.

735
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:43,627
Han-gyeol isn't that cold-hearted.

736
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:45,795
I plan on telling him someday.

737
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,797
But I want to be the one to tell him.

738
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:49,466
Later.

739
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:55,205
How did you pretend to be a guy so well?

740
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,474
Isn't it difficult?

741
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,444
Here.

742
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,287
It isn't so difficult for me.

743
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,590
As you can see, I kind of look like a guy.

744
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:19,396
That's why lots of girls at my high school
thought I was a guy.

745
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:27,370
And I also put on some performances
to be even more convincing.

746
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:29,739
Like what?

747
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,311
I went to extreme lengths
to convince people I was a guy.

748
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,012
I would even stand in front of a urinal

749
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,617
in the men's restroom
until someone saw me.

750
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,721
I was wondering...

751
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:49,159
can we be friends?

752
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:53,496
It would be a pleasure
to be friends with you.

753
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,645
I'll bring you back the clothes later on.

754
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,348
Thanks for the coffee.

755
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,984
You can keep the clothes.
I'll see you around.

756
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,185
Thank you.

757
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:16,953
Wait.

758
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:22,959
Careful.

759
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,729
Goodbye.

760
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:33,470
Don't worry. She'll keep your secret.

761
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,605
She promised she wouldn't tell.

762
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,909
Girl B seems like a really cool person.
You're a lucky guy.

763
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,148
Bye.

764
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,951
Take care. I'll call you.

765
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,932
You're smiling a lot today.

766
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,634
What do you mean?

767
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,871
You like her, don't you?

768
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,774
What are you talking about?

769
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,809
Oh, you're avoiding my eyes.

770
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,044
What are you talking about?

771
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,378
-It's so hot.
-You're being weird.

772
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,315
-How am I being weird? It's hot.
-Stop changing the subject.

773
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:19,449
It's so hot.

774
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:22,152
-Why are you hot? You're fine before.
-It's so hot.

775
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,620
Do you want ice cream?

776
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:25,622
Yeah, but...

777
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,491
Load the coffee beans onto the car.

778
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:29,893
Right now?

779
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,528
I'll deliver them on my way in tomorrow.

780
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:32,662
Okay.

781
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,064
-Okay.
-Okay.

782
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:35,665
Did you change the light bulb upstairs?

783
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,634
-Yes.
-Yes.

784
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,835
The weeds?

785
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,837
I've eliminated them completely.

786
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,073
-The terrace railing?
-Yes.

787
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,350
-Put on antibacterial ointment.
-Yes.

788
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,085
Pardon?

789
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,454
The ointment is in the cabinet.

790
00:55:59,055 --> 00:55:59,889
Okay.

791
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:07,864
Don't clean only where it's visible.
Clean every corner.

792
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,566
Clean the restrooms.

793
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:13,503
And when you come in tomorrow morning,
wash the parasol. It's white with dust.

794
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,140
And be careful when you water the plants.

795
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:19,642
Why? Do you have a problem?

796
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,846
Not yet. But if you keep acting like this,
I'll have a big problem.

797
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,514
Why are you treating me this way nowadays?

798
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,317
If you're mad at me, just tell me.

799
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,324
Don't do that.

800
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,526
Now you're complaining about my habits.

801
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,890
I didn't say anything wrong. I'm just...

802
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,262
I'm just doing the best I can.

803
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,298
What the heck? Have I been found out?

804
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,968
What do I do? Should I just run away?

805
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,805
The beans.
I need to load them into the car.

806
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:25,208
Eun-chan.

807
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,143
Yes?

808
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,280
Let me hug you once.

809
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,652
I can't do anything lately because of you,

810
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,822
so let me hug you just once.
I think that'll make everything clear.

811
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:46,729
Hey. Why are you backing away?
I won't eat you alive.

812
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:51,100
I just need to hug you for a moment.
So stay still.

813
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:54,237
Are you feeling all right, boss?
Why would you want to hug me?

814
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,172
Jeez, stop being so difficult.

815
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:58,341
We did all kinds of things
for the blind dates.

816
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,777
Wait...

817
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,895
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HUGGED ME.

818
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:58,902
BECAUSE IT MADE ME WANT
TO SAY I'M A GIRL...

819
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,409
Does he have a crush on me?

820
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:07,744
When are you going to come?

821
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,145
There must be 1,000 cranes in here.

822
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,448
Boss. Why do you watching Eun-chan?

823
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,351
And don't forget
that your boss thinks you're a guy.

824
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:20,123
The fact that you get excited
when you see a man is...

825
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,095
I kept you around
because I felt sorry for you.

826
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,865
I can't stand you.
Then, I should just quit.

827
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:02,932
