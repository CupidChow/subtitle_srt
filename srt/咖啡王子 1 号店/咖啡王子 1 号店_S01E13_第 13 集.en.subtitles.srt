1
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:40,040
Ninety-three degrees. Seems okay.

2
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,143
Let's check to make sure.

3
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,948
It's 92.75.

4
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,784
Awesome!

5
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:00,026
The weather really is hot.

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,662
-Give me a cup of water.
-Okay.

7
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,043
Do you have time tonight?

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,278
Is anything going on?

9
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,847
We don't need a specific reason
to spend time together.

10
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,217
-Let's go out on a date.
-Today?

11
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,520
But I was planning to go home early
and study.

12
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,857
You sound like you're really serious
about studying.

13
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,492
Starting today, I want to study hard.

14
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,894
-Start tomorrow.
-Even so, I can't go tonight.

15
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,131
Mom complains about how her daughter
always comes home late.

16
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,333
I have to sew stuffed dolls' eyes
and shell the chestnuts.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,036
Hey! Then when are we going
to go on a date?

18
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,005
Are you playing hard to get?

19
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,774
Then how about we go to the movies?

20
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:49,409
I hate places that are loud and crowded.

21
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,811
Then, how about an amusement park?

22
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,148
Right, you don't like crowds.

23
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,250
How about a theater?

24
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,618
Shopping?

25
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,386
A musical?

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,255
If you don't want that...

27
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,528
we could go to the park and talk,
or go for a drive.

28
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,096
Come to my house.

29
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,764
Let's watch a DVD together.

30
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,708
After kicking up all that fuss,

31
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,710
look at him grin!

32
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,215
Angel, sit here.

33
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,853
Should I go buy you a milk to drink?

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,754
Are you okay?

35
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,863
Excuse us!

36
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,765
Sir, can you just move out of the way?

37
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,467
-What the heck!
-Out of the way!

38
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:01,981
How is it?

39
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:09,289
Young man, you have to pay.

40
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,957
5,000 won.

41
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,821
I won't.

42
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,456
I won't date any woman except Eun-sae.

43
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,024
Standing outside the washroom
with her bag,

44
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,159
and your toenails are painted.

45
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,927
Are you a servant or a guinea pig?

46
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,162
Don't let her walk all over you.

47
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,664
So what? Seon-gi did a pedicure, too.

48
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,634
He paints his nails because he wants to,
not because he's forced to like you!

49
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,935
What's the big deal?

50
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,238
-Jeez! Why I ought to!
-What?

51
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,673
What's your problem?
Why are you so angry at me these days?

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,344
He can't get over the fact
that you've seen his butt.

53
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,648
You mean that tattoo of the Playboy bunny?

54
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,783
You flat-chested little...

55
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,418
What if I'm flat-chested?
What is it to you?

56
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,687
You jerk.

57
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,390
Come here.

58
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,725
Come here quick.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,029
Dump Eun-chan's sister
and I'll set you up with a girl I know.

60
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,265
-No.
-Do as I say!

61
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,332
Why?

62
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,335
Don't ask why, go see her!
You big gorilla.

63
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,970
But Eun-sae is my one and only.

64
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,805
Go clean.

65
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,946
Do you want me to break the noodle?

66
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,281
Break it once.

67
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,019
-I only eat egg whites.
-I only eat egg yolks.

68
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,588
-How about crumbled seaweed?
-I only put spice powder.

69
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,990
Okay.

70
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,965
Hey. How come you can't do anything right?

71
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,700
How can you use scissors
to cut green onions?

72
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,808
You do the dishes
since I did most of the cooking.

73
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,277
That's not true, we cooked together!

74
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,413
Let's do this fairly
with rock-paper-scissors.

75
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,316
Rock-paper-scissors is so childish.

76
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,518
How about we speak only in five words?

77
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:19,652
The loser washes the dishes.

78
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,521
-Okay?
-Okay.

79
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,092
You like me, don't you?

80
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,929
Do you have to ask?

81
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,932
Since when has that been?

82
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,201
When you first kissed me.

83
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,037
Which kiss do you mean?

84
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,407
One on a blind date.

85
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,742
You loved me that soon?

86
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,279
Look, our ramen is done!

87
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,984
What a little weirdo you are.

88
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,120
"What a little weirdo you are."

89
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,988
Nine words. You wash the dishes.

90
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,623
All right.

91
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,527
The cover is mine.

92
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,396
Says who? Give me that.

93
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,400
-I'm not eating.
-Don't eat then.

94
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,077
You look so happy eating that.

95
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,949
It's really hot.

96
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,387
What do I like about you?
Why are you asking this type of question?

97
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,355
Well,

98
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:33,092
Min-yeop says I'm just strong
and not feminine.

99
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,128
So he doesn't like me.

100
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:37,430
You're good looking and you come
from a privileged background,

101
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,933
so I'm sure there are lots of pretty women

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,436
who would love to go out with you.

103
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,372
But frankly, I'm a tomboy,

104
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,307
and I'm not very pretty.

105
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,276
I don't come from a very good family,

106
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,745
and I'm not very well-educated.

107
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,483
There's nothing about me to like
but you're in love with me.

108
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,619
No kidding.

109
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:03,523
But what can I do?

110
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,793
I like you despite those things.

111
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,129
You are too honest.

112
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,337
Cheers!

113
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,715
I can't do that.

114
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,657
This tastes good
right after brushing your teeth, right?

115
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:39,692
It's my habit.

116
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,594
What a weird habit.

117
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,467
You'll be leaving to America
one month from now.

118
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,801
How about I don't go?

119
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,303
You will go anyway.

120
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,838
How about we go together?

121
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:58,044
We'll live in an old apartment in Chelsea
with lots of trees.

122
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:04,250
After I go to work, you read books
under the sunlight in a nearby park.

123
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,319
And when I leave from work,

124
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,689
you come to my office in East Village,
and we go eat dinner together.

125
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,224
Then go listen to music.

126
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,060
If we get hungry,

127
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,196
we walk over to John's Pizza Parlor
and have a slice of pizza.

128
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,434
You need to eat a whole pizza.

129
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,837
I'm excited just thinking about it.

130
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,508
You say you're excited but
why is your expression like that?

131
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:32,078
It's because I can imagine it
but I can't really go.

132
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,380
Why can't you really go?

133
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:39,552
I don't plan on marrying yet.

134
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,887
What?

135
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,455
You said we should go to America together.

136
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,490
Then isn't that living together?

137
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,659
Will you live with me if we go together?

138
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,396
Hey! We can live together
even without getting married.

139
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,597
What?

140
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,803
Well, I mean, the thing is,

141
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,239
if you really feel uncomfortable,
we can live separately.

142
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,977
You're not going to tell me

143
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:08,047
we have to get married
if we sleep together, are you?

144
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,051
What? Did I say anything wrong?

145
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,521
Don't you think that two consenting adults
who are in love

146
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,489
should sleep together?

147
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,797
Gosh, you're making me feel
really uncomfortable right now.

148
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,936
It's not me that's making you
feel uncomfortable,

149
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,371
it's the weather that's too hot.

150
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,813
And by the way,

151
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,848
we have to get married
if we sleep together.

152
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,885
Hey, if we have to get married
if we sleep together,

153
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,220
does that mean we have to get
engaged if we hold hands?

154
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,492
Well, is that how it is?

155
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,234
Hey! Look at how much ice cream we left.

156
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,403
Go ahead and eat.

157
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,812
I am really glad you're a woman.

158
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:16,015
It's all melted.

159
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,029
New York.

160
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,498
New.

161
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,868
New York.

162
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,141
What did you say?

163
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,809
Are you deaf, mom?

164
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,812
Eun-chan's boss asked her
to go to New York with him.

165
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,547
He proposed to you, didn't he?

166
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,216
When did he say you are getting married?

167
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,984
I'm not getting married.

168
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,887
Even if we go together,
we wouldn't have to live together.

169
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,189
Mom.

170
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,894
Our manager is a freelancer working
at New York's biggest toy company.

171
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,763
You're not going to get married?

172
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,833
Then what about us? Your boss will
at least buy us an apartment, won't he?

173
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,135
Hey, little girl.

174
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,371
Why would he give you an apartment?
Think about it!

175
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:14,473
Hey, Hey!

176
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,275
Quickly finish eating and get out.

177
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,777
Don't you have to meet your friends?

178
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,845
I'm not in the mood to see friends!

179
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,615
She just said she's going to New York
all by herself!

180
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,352
You don't care how we are
as long as you're happy.

181
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,588
It's fine as long as you're doing well,
is that it?

182
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,957
What's the matter with you?

183
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,260
Are you jealous now that things
are looking up for me?

184
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,795
Yeah! So what if I am?

185
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,597
Why are you screaming and yelling
over the table early in the morning?

186
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,566
Why do you always scold me?

187
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,201
What are we going to do
if Eun-chan leaves?

188
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,970
We're barely scraping by as it is!

189
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,338
How are we going to make ends meet

190
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,908
with Eun-chan gone?
I don't even have money to go to college!

191
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,750
Don't worry about her and eat.

192
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,686
She's just worried

193
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,990
about losing you to your boyfriend.

194
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,680
Who is it?

195
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,351
Long time no see.

196
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,794
Let's take Han-gyeol to Byeokje tomorrow
where his birth mother is buried.

197
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,598
And let's have him meet his birth father.

198
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,102
I think that's the right thing to do.

199
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,005
I'll tell Han-gyeol's mom that--

200
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,607
I already told her.

201
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:56,976
What did she say?

202
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,978
She agreed with me.

203
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,623
I was interested in her
but I'll let you have her now.

204
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,759
Look at how perfect she is.

205
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,196
Long and straight hair.
Soft and pale skin.

206
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,666
Also, captivating eyes.

207
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,935
What do you think? Isn't she hot?

208
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,605
But the real clincher is...

209
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,941
Please eat.

210
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:34,346
Her kind and considerate personality.
Isn't she perfect?

211
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,818
Don't be too forward.
Women hate that sort of thing.

212
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,356
Don't be nervous.

213
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,859
Be confident.

214
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,994
Start!

215
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,100
You are very beautiful.

216
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,172
Is it all right
if we see each other again?

217
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,476
Yeah.

218
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,315
Why am I so good at this?

219
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,483
I must be a born playboy!

220
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,059
-I'm really busy right now.
-You, busy?

221
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,494
You've got to be kidding me.

222
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,096
I'm near the singing academy.

223
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,098
I'm hungry, so hurry up and come over.

224
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,299
No.

225
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:29,835
No?

226
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,571
Have you suddenly lost your mind?

227
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,807
I'm perfectly fine, thank you.

228
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,941
Bye.

229
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:39,845
Jeez!

230
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,620
Eun-sae.

231
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,022
Are you coming back
from your singing academy?

232
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,857
Where were you, Mr. Gu?

233
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,560
I didn't see you around
these past few days.

234
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,131
Yes, I went on a trip.

235
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,233
I followed the wind and the clouds

236
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,068
like a homeless wanderer.

237
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,203
I wandered around and--

238
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,738
You really are blessed.

239
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,040
You're so lucky that you can just leave
any time you want.

240
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,709
It must be nice to be single.

241
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,778
Why would you want to marry my mom?

242
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,315
That is because...

243
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,883
I like your mom.

244
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,020
And it's better to be with someone
than by yourself.

245
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,524
Is anything the matter, dear?

246
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,828
The guy who used to have a crush on me
won't even answer my calls,

247
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,098
and my sister might be getting married.

248
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:34,433
Marry?

249
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,271
Well, I heard that
she's seeing the owner of the coffee shop.

250
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,639
Is that true?

251
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,544
My gosh! Eun-chan met such a nice man!

252
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,179
What's so nice about him?

253
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,681
Is it the fact that he is rich?

254
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,884
She's not the type of person
to fall in love for someone's money.

255
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,987
That's not what I meant.

256
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,889
I never said he is nice
because he is rich.

257
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,557
I just said he is nice.

258
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,125
You're jumping to conclusions!

259
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:04,463
Are you unhappy about it?

260
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,333
I was going to buy Eun-chan a car

261
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,470
and a coffee shop
when I get my first platinum album.

262
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,640
But she's head over heels for some guy.

263
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,510
Now, I'll be left completely alone
if mom gets married, too.

264
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:21,814
Eun-sae.

265
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,416
I like your mom.

266
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,687
But if you don't want me to,
I won't marry her.

267
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:32,491
I'll marry her only
if you're all right with it.

268
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,428
And you wouldn't be left alone
even if your mom gets married.

269
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,200
You'll just have a new dad.

270
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,903
You're a really nice guy, Mr. Gu.
But you're also annoying.

271
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:50,109
Hey, why didn't you come straight home
after school?

272
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,610
What are you doing here?

273
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,513
Will you stop nagging me? I'm going home.

274
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,948
Why that little!

275
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,723
Where have you been?
I haven't seen you around.

276
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,525
Yes.

277
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,931
What is up with him?

278
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,203
Not that I should care.
I have enough things to worry about.

279
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,874
But for the love of God!

280
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,352
Hey, Min-yeop! Come here.

281
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:36,455
I've become a real trot music fan.

282
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,756
Do you know this song? Shanghai...

283
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,659
-Really?
-Who are you talking to?

284
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,028
What are you doing?

285
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,898
Have you heard this song?
Shanghai, Shanghai...

286
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:47,499
It has such a nice feel to it.

287
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,401
It's perfect music for dancing.

288
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:53,672
-What?
-I'm jealous of you.

289
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,307
Shanghai! Dancing the Shanghai Twist!

290
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,110
It makes you want to move your body.

291
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,846
Seon-gi, look at the boss' shoulders.

292
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,347
Aren't they broad?

293
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,116
They are on the broad side.

294
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,820
Don't answer carelessly and take a look.

295
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:11,190
He has such long legs
and he can pull off any outfit.

296
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,692
He has such a great sense of style.

297
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,895
Although he seems to have a bad temper,
he's a very warm person.

298
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,498
Although he seems like a playboy,
he's a hopeless romantic.

299
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,500
He's just full of charm!

300
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,769
Seon-gi, I bet you've never seen
the boss drive.

301
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,304
He drives with one hand like this.

302
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,373
If you were a woman,
you'd have a crush on him, too.

303
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,811
All the girls were just staring
at him during the concert.

304
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,614
They were practically drooling over him.
It made me nervous.

305
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,349
When is manager going to America?

306
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,319
He actually asked me to come with him.

307
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,623
But I have a family to support.
I'm the breadwinner.

308
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,759
Why don't you discuss it with the boss
instead of worrying about it by yourself?

309
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,862
No. I don't want to talk about this.

310
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,366
I guess he'll be leaving
in a little while,

311
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,034
and I won't be able to see him then.

312
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,102
Tell him not to go.

313
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,973
He liked you
even when he thought you were a guy.

314
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,742
If he's that passionate about you,
he might not go.

315
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,215
He is an ambitious man.

316
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:15,754
They say holding someone back for love
isn't the right thing to do.

317
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,004
HAN YOO-JOO

318
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,327
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Please leave a message.

319
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,133
Yoo-joo, it's me.

320
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,303
I see that your phone is finally on.

321
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,641
I guess you're still not home.

322
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,714
Yoo-joo, it's okay if you take your time
coming back home,

323
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,551
but can you please leave your phone on,

324
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,920
and answer it if it's possible.

325
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,992
If you eat like that at night,

326
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,694
your face will get puffy.

327
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,130
-Did Eun-Sae go to bed already?
-Yes.

328
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:38,070
Are you in a serious relationship
with your boss?

329
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,038
Why?

330
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,476
What do you mean, why?
Because it's so strange.

331
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:49,681
I was nervous seeing you acting like a man
and cautiously going to work in the shop.

332
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,384
In the end, you meet this kind of fate.

333
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,857
When did a small little girl
grow up so much already?

334
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:00,659
You've raised me for over twenty years.

335
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,027
Of course, I've grown.

336
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,895
It would be weird if I hadn't.

337
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,264
That's true.

338
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,866
-Let's eat together.
-Okay.

339
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,007
But don't you think

340
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:19,811
that our family is too poor compared
to your boyfriend's family?

341
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,249
Relationships are much easier when
the couple comes from similar backgrounds.

342
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,184
What's wrong with our family?

343
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,021
This is delicious.

344
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,628
-I'll taste it.
-Okay.

345
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,138
This is delicious!

346
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,108
Where am I going to find a girl
who cooks as well as you, mom?

347
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,678
Is there anything you can't do?

348
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,180
Jeez, you playboy!

349
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,415
Look at how you spoil him.

350
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,685
Why did you go so far early
in the morning to buy crabs?

351
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,920
You've made him a mama's boy.

352
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,123
Are you jealous, Grandma?

353
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,692
Excuse me.

354
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,961
Mom.

355
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:12,164
I'll be right back, Mom.

356
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,404
Eat well. We have somewhere to go.

357
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,577
JEONG EUN-SOOK

358
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,295
Han-gyeol.

359
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,631
A few days ago,

360
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,600
you met someone named
Lee Myeong-jae, right?

361
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:51,870
Yes.

362
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:55,807
He's your birth father.

363
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,123
I told Han-gyeol about his birth.

364
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:16,628
But you can't expect Han-gyeol
to understand you fully.

365
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,665
Try to be understanding of him
if he lashes out at you

366
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,601
about keeping his birth a secret.

367
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:28,240
It was probably difficult enough for him
to have visited his birth mother's grave.

368
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,411
I'm leaving first.

369
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,814
You and Han-gyeol come back together.

370
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:36,948
Okay.

371
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:42,187
I'm proud of everything you've done, son.

372
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,037
Very good.

373
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,439
You're getting pretty good at this.

374
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,015
Come over here, Cheeta!

375
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,585
-Take it quickly!
-Okay.

376
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Seems like you've practiced a lot.

377
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,326
You're even better
at making drawings than I am.

378
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,894
Mr. Hong.

379
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,996
Do you think I should take the test
to become a barista?

380
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,632
I thought you were going
to be a taekwondo master?

381
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,403
I don't have the money to set up a gym,

382
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,274
and more than anything else,
I love coffee.

383
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:14,012
But Mr. Hong,
do baristas make lots of money?

384
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,049
When I was in Torino,

385
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,820
I was at a café
which was about half the size of our shop,

386
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,622
but rumor has it that the cafés
makes more money

387
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,291
than even some small corporations.

388
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,392
Really?

389
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,294
It all depends on how it's operated.

390
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,632
But you shouldn't expect to suddenly make
a six-figure income.

391
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,966
For me,

392
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,636
I'll be satisfied if I can earn
two times of the pay right now.

393
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,539
I won't have to worry
about Eun-sae's tuition.

394
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,040
And I can give my mom some allowance.

395
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,675
That's all I want.

396
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,978
You should want more.

397
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,780
Or you'll end up like me.

398
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,395
Han-gyeol must be so distressed.

399
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,832
I wish he would give me a call.

400
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,541
I was deeply in love
with your birth mother.

401
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,847
I was drawn to the way she struggled
to put herself through college.

402
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,317
She, Myeong-jae, and I were friends.

403
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:27,018
Both Myeong-jae and I
were in love with her.

404
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,854
I asked her to marry me.

405
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,358
I promised her that we wouldn't part
no matter what,

406
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:37,929
but grandma so adamantly opposed
because she was an orphan.

407
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,302
Actually, I left her

408
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:45,904
because I changed my mind.

409
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:50,408
But she never once expressed
any resentment.

410
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,211
Whenever I look at you, I feel guilty

411
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,484
towards your current and your late mom,

412
00:27:01,386 --> 00:27:04,723
but... whilst raising you,

413
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,926
I felt very happy.

414
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:20,705
I'm angry.

415
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,307
But...

416
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,111
I don't know exactly why.

417
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,915
If I'm angry at my birth father
who showed up after all this time,

418
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:36,221
or at my dad and grandma
who suddenly decided to reveal the truth,

419
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:43,161
or at myself for believing for so long
that I was your real son.

420
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,296
-Han-gyeol.
-Not today.

421
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:49,701
I don't want to talk
about it anymore, Dad.

422
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,209
COFFEE PRINCE SHOP NO.1

423
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,553
He didn't pick up for the whole day.
It's really strange.

424
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,323
Hey, girl.
Did something happen to your lover?

425
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,894
Just now he said he'll come back
after going to see his grandma.

426
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,162
It seems like he can't come back.

427
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,864
I guess although he won't answer
my calls all day long,

428
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:24,069
you have a direct hotline
to him, Mrs. Choi.

429
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,438
He doesn't care about
ruining our eight-year friendship.

430
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,640
-Will you stop teasing me?
-Teasing you?

431
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,741
Are you kidding?

432
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:33,078
I wouldn't dare tease Mrs. Choi

433
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,081
lest Mr. Choi find out about it
and kick my butt.

434
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,782
Aren't I right, Mrs. Choi?

435
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:39,951
But about Han-gyeol,

436
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,253
everyone's talking
about throwing a farewell party.

437
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,889
Have you two talked about it?
What will you do after he leaves?

438
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,091
Ha-rim,

439
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:48,727
does Han-gyeol have to go to America
to become a toy designer?

440
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,428
Of course.

441
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,397
America is the place for toys.

442
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,501
Do you think being asked to be an official
designer in three years is an easy feat?

443
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,871
Really? When?

444
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,907
I heard he was contacted last week.

445
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:05,810
Isn't Han-gyeol incredible?

446
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:09,314
He slept only two or three hours a day
after starting out as a block designer.

447
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,617
And after three years of that,
he's finally being offered the job.

448
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,087
Plus, he even turned the Coffee Prince
into a success.

449
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:20,291
Let me give you
a word of advice, Eun-chan.

450
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,996
You shouldn't hinder your man's ambition
in the name of love.

451
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,500
You don't have to worry.
I wouldn't do such a thing.

452
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,468
If you don't want to part,
then go to America together.

453
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,837
It's not the same as moving across town,
you know.

454
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:37,142
How will I afford the flight ticket
and the cost of living there?

455
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,610
What's the problem with that?

456
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,879
Your rich boyfriend will pay
for everything.

457
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,947
He'll buy you a house and a car--

458
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,849
What does that have to do with anything?

459
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,718
He has his own thing and I have mine.

460
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,353
And what if he buys me those things?

461
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,455
Do I look like a kind of girl
who would take them?

462
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:54,125
Fine, you're not.
But why are you overreacting like this?

463
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,494
So don't say those things in front of me.

464
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,564
Even if you don't tell me to,
I would still let him go.

465
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,212
BIG JERK

466
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:17,482
Hello?

467
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,018
Are you home.

468
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,954
I think I'm near it.

469
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,690
Or maybe I'm on my way home.

470
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:28,159
What do you mean "maybe"?

471
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,930
Maybe I'm near your house.

472
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,999
Do you want to drop by?

473
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,402
Not really. But I'll drop by if you want.

474
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,637
No, you must be tired. Get some rest.

475
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,307
No, I'm not tired.

476
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,579
-When will you be here?
-In three minutes.

477
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:55,587
You want to know what happened?
A lot of things happened.

478
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:58,323
Someone ordered 20 waffles by 9:00 a.m.,

479
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,058
and we barely got them delivered on time.

480
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,360
Anything else?

481
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:06,364
And some punks came in the evening
and complained about grease in the coffee,

482
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,901
but when we explained that comes
naturally from the coffee beans,

483
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,738
they kept on insisting
that it came from the dirty cup.

484
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,673
-Anything else?
-Why do you keep saying anything else?

485
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,713
I kind of missed you.

486
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,084
Me too. I missed you too.

487
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,989
Did you go somewhere with grandma?

488
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,894
We went my birthmother's grave
to meet my birth mother.

489
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,365
They told me that I'm adopted, Eun-chan.

490
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,471
They said that the man
who gave me the picture of my mom

491
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,973
not too long ago is my real dad.

492
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:56,848
I don't know what you're talking about.

493
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,052
My birth parents
and my current dad were friends.

494
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,423
And a year later,
my birth parents divorced.

495
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:09,027
My birth father went to Australia
and they lost contact with him.

496
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,229
After that, I was born
and my mom died in an accident.

497
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:16,834
Since I was alone and had nowhere to go,
my current parents took me in.

498
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,938
My dad raised the son of a friend,

499
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,640
the son of a woman that he once loved

500
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,977
like his own son until now.

501
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,752
I was completely fooled
by my grandma, mom, and dad.

502
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,388
I had no idea that I was adopted
because they gave me so much love.

503
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,460
They treated me so well.

504
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,400
But I still feel resentment towards them.
Why didn't they tell me?

505
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:55,707
If they weren't going to tell me,
they should have done so until the end.

506
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,375
Why did they have to tell me now?

507
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,580
Aren't I such a pathetic son,

508
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,418
always fighting with him,
hating him for 12 years

509
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,154
because I thought he had me

510
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,724
through an extramarital affair.

511
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,370
You didn't know.

512
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,473
You had no way of knowing.

513
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,961
I finally understand
why people play with these.

514
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:53,164
They really help clear your mind.

515
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,203
You're not very good at that.

516
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:02,673
The job you've been offered
at the New York headquarters

517
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,209
is a big deal from what I've heard.

518
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:09,480
Is there anything you can't do?
You're always so good at everything.

519
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,050
Did Ha-rim tell you?

520
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,352
Why are you so happy? I'm sad.

521
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:17,522
Let's go together.

522
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,759
I'll wait for you here
so you go to America by yourself.

523
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,863
But I'll keep sending you letters.

524
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,799
More than once every week.

525
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,168
Aren't you coming with me?

526
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,437
I'll just get in your way
if I went with you,

527
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,905
and I have to work

528
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,208
since I have to support my family.

529
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,779
If it's because of your family, I'll...

530
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:45,783
It's my responsibility!
You don't have to worry.

531
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,120
We've done all right without
anybody's help until now

532
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,656
and we'll continue to do well.

533
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:56,994
So just go and make toys in America
and try not to cheat on me.

534
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,201
I wasn't going to tell you this
because I know it'll go to your head,

535
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,671
but you shouldn't wear black shirts.

536
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:12,577
Last time you did,
all the female customers kept staring.

537
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,813
Is there anything else?

538
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,884
I think they also stare at me
when I brush my hair back like this.

539
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,018
Look at that. Look.

540
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,055
You're always smiling at other girls
and showing them your dimples!

541
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,225
You better not show that to anyone.

542
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,473
-Eun-chan.
-Yes?

543
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:45,877
Should I not go?

544
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:49,313
What do you mean not go?

545
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,582
You worked your butt off
for three years to get that job.

546
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,587
I'll wait for you until you come back.

547
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,590
Just remember, you're dead meat
if you cheat on me.

548
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,096
You're so cute.

549
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,865
Are you that sad?

550
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:10,334
If you're going to miss me that much,

551
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:14,138
I'll come once a month.
No, once a week to see you.

552
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,441
You can come visit me and I'll visit you.

553
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,444
Do you know how expensive
flight tickets are?

554
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,080
-I'll buy them for you.
-Forget about it!

555
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,082
I'll save the money
for the tickets myself.

556
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:31,155
I don't want to not see you for too long,
so I'll visit once a year.

557
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,425
Once every six months?

558
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:37,061
Once every six months?

559
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,865
No way.

560
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,669
I don't know if I can live
without seeing you for six months.

561
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,075
You'll just have to try and bear it.

562
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:12,697
-Ouch, hold on.
-Are you okay?

563
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:39,323
This is Han Jeong-hwan of Cheongun Films.
I've sent you the screenplay.

564
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,225
Please call me after you look at it.

565
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,211
Why are you working until this late?

566
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:35,713
No wonder your hands are blistering.

567
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,716
It's because I have no skill.

568
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:43,187
The lady upstairs shells twice
as many chestnuts but her hands are fine.

569
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,859
Aren't you coming home late
too often these days?

570
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,595
I know.

571
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,968
Look at your fingers.

572
00:38:58,035 --> 00:38:59,770
Let me see your other finger too.

573
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,973
I'm fine now. Go in and get to bed.

574
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,677
-I'll do it.
-It's okay. It's tiring.

575
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,580
-I'll do it.
-It's okay.

576
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:29,033
Good night, Manager Choi.

577
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:35,873
Good night, sweetie?

578
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,111
"Sweetie"? How corny!

579
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,741
I'm hungry but your fridge was empty.

580
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:45,543
I'll go get some groceries.

581
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,344
Have you forgiven me?

582
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:49,914
Sleep a little more.

583
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:55,653
Yoo-joo! Come back quickly.

584
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,523
Okay.

585
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:13,604
Darn it!

586
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,209
How dare you glare
at your big sister like that?

587
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,710
Stop glaring at me.

588
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:23,180
What are you so mad about?
I didn't do anything wrong.

589
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,950
You were mad for the past few days.

590
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,918
-I hate you!
-You hate me?

591
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,856
I've decided not to go with my boss
so stop being so angry.

592
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,023
Really?

593
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,391
Why would I lie to you?

594
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,262
And now you're going to blame us
for ruining your life, aren't you?

595
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,864
Just go. Go.

596
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,833
Bring me the brush and sit down here.

597
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,907
I get scolded whether
I say I'm going or I'm not going.

598
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,676
You'll lose your voice like that.
And just look at the state of your hair.

599
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,413
But your boss is going to be sad.

600
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,552
He was sobbing.
He said he'll come see me once a week.

601
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,287
Do you know how much a flight costs?

602
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,724
So I scolded him
to not waste money like that.

603
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,595
Honestly, if we're going to break up
like that, it's better to do it now.

604
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,799
Your hair is as troublesome as you are!

605
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:21,672
Eun-chan, I think Min-yeop
might be cheating on me.

606
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,841
He's not won't return my calls
and text messages.

607
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,743
Min-yeop must be crazy to cheat on you!

608
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,646
How could he cheat on my angel?
I'll kick his butt.

609
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,116
Hey, let's make spicy rice cakes
for dinner with a lot of fishcakes.

610
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:35,352
-See you.
-Bye.

611
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:41,692
-Mom, see you.
-Okay.

612
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,829
Mom.

613
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,364
Eun-chan's not going to America.

614
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,200
She's not going? What about her boss?

615
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,835
Her boss is going there alone.

616
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,604
Just the boss?

617
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:54,972
Isn't that great?

618
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,302
Good morning.

619
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,505
You don't listen, do you?

620
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,808
You wore that black shirt anyway.

621
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:34,011
If someone asks me not to do something,
I do it even more.

622
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,348
Are you okay? I was worried.

623
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,985
You mean, about my adoption?
I'm all right.

624
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:46,957
You are really cool, Manager Choi.

625
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,228
I'm not one to skip work just because
I'm going through rough times.

626
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,001
-Good morning!
-Hi.

627
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,404
Eun-chan, you need to clean the bathroom.

628
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,806
Someone missed the urinal badly
and peed all over the floor.

629
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,074
Okay.

630
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:08,278
My Chan, the bathroom is out of pads.
Restock it.

631
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:09,847
Okay.

632
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,428
What is this? This is mine.

633
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,730
That? Isn't it mine?

634
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,533
You gave it to me as a gift two years ago.

635
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,835
Let me see.

636
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:36,040
I know these!
I bought these with my card last year.

637
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,409
At least that's what I think.

638
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:42,112
Do you know how surprised I was
when I found out my CDs were missing?

639
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,714
There are lots of my CDs here too.

640
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,182
No, there aren't.

641
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,217
All right. You can have them all.

642
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,519
Did you go grocery shopping?

643
00:44:48,585 --> 00:44:50,754
Yeah. I'll cook you some soybean stew.

644
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,190
Should we have a party?

645
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:56,460
Let's invite Han-gyeol and Eun-chan
and have a party.

646
00:44:57,895 --> 00:44:58,962
Don't you want to?

647
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,098
Of course, I do.

648
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:02,266
Okay.

649
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:05,202
I'll help you after I organize this.

650
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,470
Okay.

651
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:16,246
-Yeah, Han-gyeol.
-Has Yoo-joo called you yet?

652
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,948
I think her cell phone works.

653
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,284
She came back yesterday.

654
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,585
Really?

655
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,954
Where in the world was she?

656
00:45:25,355 --> 00:45:28,192
Hey, Yoo-joo wanted me to invite you
and Eun-chan over for dinner.

657
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,060
Do you have some time tomorrow?

658
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,895
Why is she inviting Eun-chan?

659
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,631
Does she have a grudge against Eun-chan?

660
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,800
I don't know.
It's up to you whether you come or not.

661
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,635
I'm hanging up. I'm busy. Bye.

662
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,243
How is it?

663
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,578
This is fantastic!

664
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:01,058
Where were you?

665
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,027
I was at the beach.

666
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,063
What's the phone number of the place
where you stayed?

667
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,999
I want you to give me that number,

668
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,001
and the numbers of your friends
and family, okay?

669
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:15,506
Why did you come back?

670
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:17,674
Because how I acted wasn't reasonable.

671
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:21,979
I left you just because you had feelings
for someone else

672
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:25,115
without thinking
about all my past actions.

673
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:28,452
I missed you a lot.

674
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,788
When?

675
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,222
When the wind blew,

676
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,091
when I was walking,

677
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,827
when I fell asleep by myself,

678
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,062
and when I woke up alone in the morning.

679
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,398
In short, pretty much all the time.

680
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,599
What about Eun-chan?

681
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,203
I had feelings for her,

682
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,808
but I got over her as soon as I saw you
pack your bags to leave.

683
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:01,451
Thank you for coming back.

684
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,059
I never once thought
that you would leave me,

685
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:15,132
because I always thought you loved me
more than I loved you.

686
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:20,671
And it was a devastating experience

687
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,207
to see the small changes in your gaze,

688
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,144
the way you talked to me,
and your every expression.

689
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,480
Yoo-joo.

690
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:35,819
It's funny that as my feelings for you
started to grow,

691
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,590
I began to lose confidence in you.

692
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,961
So I thought,
I'd save my last remaining bit of pride,

693
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,965
by leaving you before you left me.

694
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,367
That's why I ran away.

695
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,473
I was so scared

696
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,576
that you wouldn't ask me to come back.

697
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,147
Jeez, you sly fox!

698
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:08,318
Thanks for asking me to come back.

699
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,557
The weather is nice.

700
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:16,660
It's so cool!

701
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:26,003
So the two of you were alone together
in Han-gyeol's place,

702
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:30,007
in the middle of the night
and all you did was play with LEGOs?

703
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,110
-We had ramen too.
-You just had ramen at midnight?

704
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,913
You guys didn't make out or anything?

705
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,483
We did hug.

706
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:43,020
Gosh, you're the type of girl
who drives men crazy!

707
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:47,124
Women don't know men at all.

708
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:50,327
Although women might not think about it
even once a day,

709
00:48:50,527 --> 00:48:53,797
men think about it dozens of times a day.
Every 52 seconds to be precise!

710
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,132
What is "it"?

711
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,937
You know the thing
that makes men go crazy!

712
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:04,274
The thing that makes men so hot
that they feel like they'll burst!

713
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,411
Do you get my drift?

714
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,447
Really?

715
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,051
Jeez!
I guess it's up to me to teach you that.

716
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,987
So, what do you do every time
you think about it?

717
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,055
Me?

718
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,926
It depends on the situation.

719
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:27,164
Sometimes I'll read a magazine
and at other times I'll watch a movie.

720
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,398
Jin Ha-rim!

721
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,310
What are you telling her?

722
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:42,679
I'm trying to help you out, Han-gyeol.

723
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:47,451
I know how difficult it must be
for you every night,

724
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,786
especially since she has no clue.

725
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:53,056
But you shouldn't be the one
to teach her that!

726
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,491
I guess you're right.

727
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:57,728
That smell! The second floor restroom
is clogged up again.

728
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,365
Eun-chan! Could you unclog the toilet?

729
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:02,799
Eun-chan! Could you unclog the toilet?

730
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:05,869
Eun-chan, could you go to the storehouse
and bring me a sack of flour?

731
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,539
Hey! Why are all of you so lazy?

732
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,942
Why are you asking Eun-chan
to unclog the toilet,

733
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,643
and bring the flour,

734
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,746
when you should be doing it yourselves?

735
00:50:15,812 --> 00:50:17,180
Hey! Jin Ha-rim!

736
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,717
Don't ever talk about how guys are like
to Eun-chan, okay?

737
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,853
What's wrong with that?

738
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,088
I'm teaching her the facts of life.

739
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:28,325
And my sweet Chan is in charge of
the second floor restroom anyways.

740
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,926
"My sweet Chan"?

741
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,628
Why is Eun-chan you're Chan?
She's my Chan!

742
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,264
And why can't you be a little more
considerate of her since she's a girl?

743
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,432
Bastards!

744
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,870
So what should I call her
if I don't call her "my sweet Chan"?

745
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,371
Should I call her Mrs. Choi?

746
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,540
-Jeez!
-Jeez!

747
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,043
As if we didn't know
he's in love with Eun-chan.

748
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,979
Considerate? Fine!

749
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,982
I'll show him
considerate if that's what he wants!

750
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,420
That's so heavy! Give it to me.

751
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,456
-Hey!
-Mrs. Choi, sit down here.

752
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,228
Hey!

753
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,464
Here's a something
to quench your thirst, Mrs. Choi.

754
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,466
What are you doing?

755
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,268
We're being considerate
of the boss's future wife.

756
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:14,471
Please put in a good word for us.

757
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:15,772
What are you talking about?

758
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,941
The sun must be damaging
your eyes, Mrs. Choi.

759
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,543
Why are you doing this?

760
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,877
What are you doing up there?

761
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,547
We're being considerate to your wife!

762
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,486
I don't want it.
Will you guys just stop it!

763
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:33,657
Goodness.

764
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:35,892
Mrs. Choi is coming downstairs!

765
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,128
Make way!

766
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,702
You told them to do that, didn't you? Why?

767
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,106
Because you seem tired.

768
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,276
Hold on.

769
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,049
Yes, Mom. I was going to call.

770
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,219
I'll visit on the weekend.

771
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,221
I need you to go to the airport tomorrow.

772
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:05,722
Why the airport?

773
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,791
Your birth father is leaving tomorrow.

774
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,694
If you let him leave like this
you will feel bad too.

775
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,295
He is leaving tomorrow?

776
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,336
FILTER
COFFEE

777
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,571
AMERICAN COFFEE
ESPRESSO

778
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,740
Really?

779
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,041
So, did you see Yoo-joo?

780
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,009
No.

781
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,978
But I talked to Han-sung on the phone.

782
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,514
They invited us to dinner
at Han-sung's place.

783
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:32,449
Is it really all right if I go?

784
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,086
Is Yoo-joo really all right with it?

785
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,687
It's all right for you to go.

786
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,357
Just try not to shock our hosts
by eating too much.

787
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,493
They already know I eat a lot.

788
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:49,766
I'll bring a watermelon over tomorrow.

789
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,737
You overheard the phone conversation
about my dad's friend.

790
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:58,175
Mom wants me to see him off
at the airport tomorrow morning.

791
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,776
Yes.

792
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,611
Isn't she an angel?

793
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:05,348
She called me to tell me
to see my birth father off.

794
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,756
Are you listening?

795
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:15,926
I was thinking about

796
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:18,061
how I didn't know about anything.

797
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,497
I don't know if I should cheer you up.

798
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,567
I don't know what to say to you.

799
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,371
I would think the same.

800
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,273
What can you say in your situation?

801
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:31,841
Did I tell you this before?

802
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,011
Actually, I shouldn't,
or it'll just go to your head.

803
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,113
I just won't tell you.

804
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,014
What is it?

805
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,716
You're making me curious.

806
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:45,188
Well, it's just...

807
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,292
You have a really nice phone voice.

808
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,460
Good night.

809
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,266
Jeez, what a kid!

810
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:06,676
What?

811
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,380
I just wanted to tell you to have
a nice time with your birth father.

812
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:14,217
Shoot.

813
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:16,086
Maybe I shouldn't have said that to you.

814
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,822
Everything will be all right.

815
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,458
Thank you, Koh Eun-chan.

816
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,940
I guess we don't have many days left
to be together.

817
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,995
CAUTION
WOMEN ARE FORBIDDEN TO ENTER

818
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,535
HAHAHA

819
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:45,108
Milk from Eun-chan
to give you superpowers.

820
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:54,751
Cheer up! Hugs and kisses.

821
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,393
Hello, this is Lee Myeong-jae.

822
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:04,794
This is Choi Han-gyeol.

823
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,463
Yes, Han-gyeol.

824
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:11,301
I would like to see you.
Is it all right if we meet right now?

825
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:24,214
How did you know I was leaving today?

826
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,217
My mom told me.

827
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,886
Have you had breakfast?

828
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:35,458
A working man should
always have breakfast.

829
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:44,267
I actually met with your dad,

830
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,203
a couple of days ago.

831
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,940
He told me about
what was going on with your life.

832
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,544
I didn't think
I would get a chance to see you.

833
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,881
When do you plan to come back to Korea?

834
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,619
Would you like me to come back?

835
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:08,024
Notice to all passengers.

836
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,796
All passengers taking Hanguk Airlines
flight to Sydney,

837
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,498
please board at gate number 8.

838
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:21,504
How tall are you?

839
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,041
I'm about 184 centimeters.

840
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,354
This is my contact information.

841
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:42,492
Give me a ring
if you ever visit Australia.

842
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,264
I hope to see you again.

843
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,205
Excuse me.

844
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,443
I heard you had a son.

845
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:02,812
What is his name?

846
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:08,351
His name is Han-yeong.
Lee Han-yeong. He's 20 years old.

847
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:13,623
He's about your height
and he takes after you in many ways.

848
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,974
Hello?

849
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,947
Choi Han-gyeol reporting back at 6:30 a.m.

850
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:14,350
I drank the milk provided by Koh Eun-chan
which filled me with energy.

851
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,553
At 8:10 a.m., I arrived at the airport.

852
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,823
At 8:20 a.m., I had a dramatic reunion
with my birth father,

853
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:25,295
and at 8:50 a.m., I shook hands
with my birth father but did not cry

854
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:28,498
as father left for Australia.

855
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:32,368
Right now, it's 9:10 a.m.,

856
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,437
and Choi Han-gyeol is on his way
to meet his grandma.

857
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,308
In order to notify her that we have
successfully reached our sales goals,

858
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,543
and is expected to be back around
12:00 p.m.

859
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,779
The three months aren't over yet.

860
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:45,715
Do you have to tell me that we've reached
our sales goals so soon?

861
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,284
Couldn't you come in a little earlier?

862
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,320
Eun-chan.

863
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,189
Yes.

864
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:56,025
Let's tell each other everything.

865
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,961
About what?

866
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:59,596
Just everything.

867
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,332
Say we love each other,

868
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,233
and let's talk about being sad,
missing each other,

869
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,369
being mad at each other,
even hating each other.

870
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:07,637
Everything.

871
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:12,976
Let's not hurt each other anymore

872
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,712
by not telling each other everything.

873
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:21,451
Let's tell each other everything, okay?

874
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:25,888
Okay. I will tell you everything.

875
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:29,258
I won't keep anything from you.

876
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:31,728
I'll tell you everything

877
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,563
that there is to know.

878
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,331
That's all I want.

879
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,527
-A habit?
-A meaningless habit.

880
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,664
You really ought to thank Eun-chan

881
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,466
since she breathed life
into that scarecrow.

882
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,435
I'm in love with Eun-chan.

883
01:01:12,635 --> 01:01:14,604
I wasn't sure about her at first either,

884
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:18,508
but the more you get to know her,
the more adorable she is.

885
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:19,909
No matter how angry you were,

886
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,078
you shouldn't have told your grandma
you won't go to America.

887
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,012
You obviously will.

888
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,148
We're going to have a baby.

889
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:27,850
I feel a huge responsibility.

890
01:01:28,384 --> 01:01:29,886
It's a really strange feeling.

891
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,969
