1
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,765
Seems like just yesterday
you were in diapers.

2
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,634
How is Joon-pil? How's your dad?

3
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,537
I haven't seen him in ages.

4
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,073
When are you going to start work?

5
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:44,711
We'll have to clear the spider webs,
and catch some mice.

6
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,680
Do you want to start today?

7
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,182
Gross.

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,419
Are you leaving?

9
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,054
Yes.

10
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,257
They say every family has a delinquent.

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,626
You should at least give a proper goodbye.

12
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,828
You're such a prick.

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,439
-Hello?
-The place needs to be renovated, right?

14
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,340
Grandma, are you kidding me?

15
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,177
This is a bit much for a joke, though.

16
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,245
This isn't a café, it's a pigsty!

17
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,713
So? You won't do it?

18
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,715
Then don't,

19
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,685
but I'll confiscate
your apartment and car.

20
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:35,728
My car!

21
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,998
I didn't even get to say goodbye
to the kids.

22
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,435
He must have had his reasons.

23
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:44,070
That's your problem.

24
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,408
Even if he had his reasons,
he can't do this to you.

25
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,046
Didn't you like your boss
even better than me?

26
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,181
What did I tell you?

27
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,585
I told you not to trust anyone but me,
including Mr. Hong.

28
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,753
But you didn't listen. What did you do?

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,690
You gave your heart to Mr. Hong
and to your boss.

30
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,961
But you were distant from me,
who likes your mom.

31
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,028
Mr. Gu!

32
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:10,230
Ji-hyang.

33
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,332
-Mom.
-What are you doing?

34
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,034
Do you have any idea
how upset Eun-chan is?

35
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,970
But rather than comfort her...

36
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,572
-What? Who likes whom?
-So...

37
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,643
I'm saying it's a nice day
and the wind is blowing,

38
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:27,080
but even if a typhoon comes,
the sun will rise again.

39
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,617
Even if this jerk mistreated Eun-chan...

40
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:34,154
Good arises out of bad.
Life is full of surprises.

41
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,556
Justice will prevail in the end.

42
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:37,991
Shut up!

43
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,027
I will shut my mouth.

44
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,762
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

45
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,436
You must feel terrible.

46
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,873
I'm upset too.

47
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,111
He wasn't a bad person from the start.

48
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,614
He must have been desperate to do that.

49
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,252
I should be understanding, right?

50
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,623
What other choice do you have?
It will just kill you inside.

51
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,331
My mom is really kind.

52
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,108
I'll go get the dolls.

53
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,009
Okay.

54
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,493
Who is it?

55
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,495
I'm from the real estate agency.

56
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,533
Please come in.

57
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,801
How may I help you?

58
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,036
You put this place up for sale.
We're here to have a look.

59
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,404
What do you mean?

60
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,173
Isn't this Bang Nam-jeong's property?

61
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,941
We just received the call.

62
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,611
She said she wanted to dump it
right away for cheap.

63
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,779
Bang Nam-jeong?

64
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,050
Han-gyeol isn't only the one who's upset,
I'm more agitated at you.

65
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,686
What? "Mom, I think
this is too much as well"?

66
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,055
How is this too much?

67
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,857
Your son is the one who's too much.

68
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,261
He's almost 30,
but he never once had a decent job.

69
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,096
He's half-hearted with his studies
and life.

70
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,431
How did you raise your child?

71
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:28,735
Come on, Grandma.

72
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:32,405
If you're upset about something, tell me.
Don't take it out on Mom.

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,574
Is this about the blind dates?

74
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,943
So that is it.

75
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,746
You're right. I acted in bad faith.

76
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,081
I'll do it for real this time, okay?

77
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,384
That boat has already sailed.

78
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,787
If you won't run the café,
just live as you wish.

79
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,790
Fine. Then...

80
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,727
give me a job at the company.
If you make me a general manager--

81
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,963
Do you think our company is a playground?

82
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,232
We don't hire slackers like you!

83
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,368
You're being harsh today, Grandma.

84
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,370
You have three months
to triple the investment.

85
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,007
If you succeed, I'll give you
your inheritance early.

86
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,176
Mom, how could you say--

87
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,946
That will support you for life
as long as you don't blow it big.

88
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,848
Grandma! Why would you die?

89
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,650
You're stronger than young people.

90
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,918
-You punk!
-See?

91
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,154
See? Look how strong you are.

92
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,222
So what will you do?

93
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,425
I don't know.
I don't want to run a business.

94
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,094
I'm suited to bum around without working.

95
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,629
Whatever. I won't do it.

96
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,830
I refuse.

97
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,499
Really? Then start with the renovations.

98
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,802
Your starting salary
is 800,000 won per month.

99
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,739
Please leave me be.
Why are you doing this?

100
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,775
Why do you bother?
He doesn't try hard with anything.

101
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,944
Just keep living like that.

102
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,281
You'll get sick
of not doing anything eventually.

103
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:51,250
If you don't even realize that,
you're a hopeless cause.

104
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,986
Aren't you late?

105
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,457
You should hurry,
if you're going all the way to Namwon.

106
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,858
I'll see you later, Mom.

107
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,300
You need respect yourself first.

108
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,370
Why would anyone do it if you won't?

109
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,958
You're making me work way too much today.

110
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,527
The dishes, cleaning the storage room...

111
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,996
Am I your housekeeper?

112
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,599
Do you have that little to say to me?

113
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,601
You're making me work
because you feel awkward.

114
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:43,269
It's because I need help.

115
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,605
You're sweating. Should I turn
the air conditioning on?

116
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,706
No, it's fine.

117
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,574
Oh, right.
You don't like air conditioning.

118
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,477
All done.

119
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,179
Good work.

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,181
Come over here.

121
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,315
Why?

122
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,817
Just come.

123
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,052
What now? What will you make me do now?

124
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,593
These new shoes are killing me.

125
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,228
What is this hole?

126
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,664
Nice. It is soft.

127
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,533
Jump!

128
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,269
It's gone.

129
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,071
I should keep going.

130
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,640
Where is this?

131
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,744
What a strange smell.

132
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,281
Gross! Help!

133
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,782
I need to run away!

134
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,188
I've escaped. What is this place?

135
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,894
I'll have to leave the shoe.

136
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,634
This is so soft. What is this?

137
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,937
Monster!

138
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,373
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,851
Hey.

140
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,352
Where are you?

141
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,620
At home.

142
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,690
May I come over?

143
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,526
I won't, if you're working.

144
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,494
It's okay.

145
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,729
I'm not working today, come over.

146
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,532
Oh, okay.

147
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,183
Hey.

148
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,687
Hey. Where's Yoo-joo?

149
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,556
She's washing the dishes. Come in.

150
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,131
You don't even drink. How did you know
that I was craving wine?

151
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,333
You two always got each other
better than I did.

152
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,238
Anyway, how long has it been
since the three of us hung out like this?

153
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,640
Three years,

154
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,809
since Yoo-joo left you three years ago.

155
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,213
You're such a punk.

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,447
Drink up.

157
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:13,686
You guys look good.

158
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,022
Did you have a dramatic reconciliation?

159
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:18,057
Was it dramatic?

160
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,593
A bit.

161
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,596
I should get going.

162
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,164
I can tell that I'm intruding.

163
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:27,633
I'm sorry for interrupting
your romantic time.

164
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,035
Hey, what's wrong with you?

165
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,204
Don't leave.

166
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,609
What's wrong with you?

167
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,445
Why did you ask me over?

168
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,547
I wouldn't have come if I had known.

169
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:43,883
But that doesn't matter to you, does it?

170
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:45,918
It only matters to me.

171
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,087
Where have you been?

172
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,422
Home.

173
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,824
Did you see your dad?

174
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,060
Yes.

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,127
Was it bad?

176
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:57,563
Can't you free yourself
from your issues with your dad now?

177
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,132
It's dragging on for too long.

178
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,268
Too long?

179
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,372
I didn't tell you about my issues
with my dad...

180
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,809
so you could attack me.

181
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,413
-Han-gyeol.
-A 17-year-old kid's hatred of his dad...

182
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:18,884
Forget it.

183
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:23,089
Yoo-joo. When a problem stays
with someone for a long time,

184
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,125
it's because there's a reason for it.

185
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,760
It's not for nothing.

186
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:32,932
Han-gyeol.

187
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,769
You're really leaving?

188
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,372
Hey, Han-gyeol!

189
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,809
Mister, I'll take two bags this time.

190
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:45,945
Don't be greedy, just do one.

191
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,947
You can't finish it by Thursday.

192
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,282
I can do it.

193
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,617
Give me one more bag.

194
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,853
I have a lot of free time now. Okay?

195
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:00,960
Babe, your shoelace is untied.

196
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,066
-What the hell?
-I'm sorry.

197
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,970
What are you doing?
Watch where you're going!

198
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:13,005
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

199
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,809
Look at this!

200
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,345
Why you little! What should we do?

201
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,447
-I'm sorry!
-What the hell?

202
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:24,216
How dare you touch my woman's breast?

203
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,752
This can't get wet. Hang on.

204
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,955
This little punk. Hey. Are you kidding me?

205
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,294
Where do you think you're going?
Get over here!

206
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,339
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

207
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,974
-Babe, it's not a big deal.
-You punk.

208
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,510
Why are you starting a fight?

209
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,446
-What? It's not a big deal?
-Let's just go.

210
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,181
Is it him this time?

211
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:58,350
You were flirting with that other punk
last time. Is it him this time?

212
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,753
You're making me lose my temper.

213
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,321
-Screw you.
-Hey.

214
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,889
-Where are you going?
-Let go!

215
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,659
-What's the hell? Let go!
-Enough.

216
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,694
-Mister.
-Hey! Stop right there!

217
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,464
You're dead if you don't stop!

218
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,065
Let go! Shit!

219
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,067
Hey, you.

220
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,638
-Hey, you. You just won't stop.
-What?

221
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,241
You let go, and you're dead.

222
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,043
-Wait, what I--
-Hey.

223
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,746
Why would I let you kill me? Tell me!

224
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:31,917
-What? Let us both die.
-What the hell? Why are you hitting me?

225
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:37,289
Where are you going? When will you change
that temper of yours?

226
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,091
Hey! Stop right there!

227
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,827
Get back here. Say that again.

228
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,697
-Say that again!
-Sorry. Don't be mad.

229
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,317
This day sucks.

230
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,418
Why?

231
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,621
-Whatever.
-Why?

232
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,523
-Just run.
-Okay.

233
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,173
This is nice.

234
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,287
Hey, Mom.

235
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,456
Me? I'm at a friend's house.

236
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,326
It suddenly started to rain.

237
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,398
I'll go back once the rain stops.

238
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,433
I don't think the rain will stop today.

239
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,136
Don't get the dolls wet,
and just sleep over.

240
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,437
What? Don't come home?

241
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,540
You tell your daughter not to come home?
Aren't you even worried?

242
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,576
Your face itself is a weapon.

243
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,611
Okay, I'll take care of it.

244
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:18,350
One, two, three. Attack!

245
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,277
What are you doing?

246
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,813
Don't touch them with your wet hands.

247
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,485
I'm sorry.

248
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:35,561
Hey.

249
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:37,696
Are you crying?

250
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:38,764
No.

251
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,302
Collecting records is my hobby,
and your wet hands were touching them.

252
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,170
Are you angry?

253
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,940
My dad liked to collect these too.

254
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,609
He had this too.

255
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,345
Is something wrong?

256
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,147
No.

257
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,316
Hey. Water...

258
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,219
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,491
The taekwondo gym is closed.

260
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,161
The master packed up and fled.

261
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,231
I didn't get paid,

262
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,901
and I didn't get to say goodbye
to the kids.

263
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,170
Just find another gym.

264
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,906
A guy shouldn't cry
over something like that.

265
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,374
Shake it off.

266
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,578
Shake it off.

267
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,447
It's easier said than done.

268
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,651
Go change.

269
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,253
You look like a wet mouse.

270
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,567
Oh, you're making kimchi fried rice?

271
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,369
You know how to cook?

272
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,539
You don't look like you would.

273
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,307
Get the rice.

274
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,447
It's hot. Hurry!

275
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,487
You must have a high tolerance for heat.

276
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:10,556
Did your dad pass away?

277
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,859
So, you're the head of the family?

278
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,564
Aren't you going to eat?

279
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,034
It's done.

280
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,441
Hurry.

281
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,415
-Hot. It's hot.
-It's hot.

282
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,784
It's really good.

283
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,491
Do you have some more rice and kimchi?

284
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,682
You're good at sewing.

285
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,618
That's unexpected.

286
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,686
You can do anything in order to survive.

287
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,488
How much do you get for each of those?

288
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:17,689
Do you get 500 won?

289
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:18,957
No, 50 won.

290
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,660
Who would pay 500 won
for simple labor like this?

291
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,995
That's ridiculous.

292
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,197
That looks fun. I want to try.

293
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,133
You can't do it.

294
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,269
Why not? I'll show you.

295
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,040
Watch carefully.

296
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,279
If you miss the center,
it will be cross-eyed, so do it right.

297
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,780
It's harder to take it apart.

298
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,285
Hey.

299
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,787
Why don't you have facial hair?

300
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,291
You're 24... 25?

301
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,593
You're old enough. Why are you so behind?

302
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,062
It's because I don't eat much.

303
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:58,897
You don't eat much?

304
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,066
Enough. You need to focus.

305
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,236
Hurry up! You should better do it right.

306
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,671
Okay.

307
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,210
How does a guy have such pretty hands?

308
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:12,878
Look who's talking?

309
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,814
Are you feeling down today?

310
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:20,252
You said before while we were running
that this day sucked.

311
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,422
Why?

312
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,657
Girl problems?

313
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,497
Tell me. I'm good at
giving relationship advice.

314
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,202
My grandma can't stand to watch me
laze around and not work,

315
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,838
so she wants me to run a ridiculous café.

316
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:40,772
That's why.

317
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,541
It really isn't girl problems?

318
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,713
The other time...

319
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:50,582
"You got hurt!"

320
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,785
Are you seeing her?

321
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,754
I am.

322
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,157
So you are.

323
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,194
Are you very close?

324
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:04,997
She's a habit.

325
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,500
Like drinking water in the morning.

326
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:09,868
I just can't bear not seeing her.

327
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,106
I try, but I keep going to see her.
It's a bad habit.

328
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,344
Sounds like you really like her.

329
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,815
I guess you'll marry her, right?

330
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,450
That's enough.

331
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:27,719
Okay.

332
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,457
It's a coffee shop nearby, right?

333
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,026
What is it called?

334
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,329
It's not a coffee shop, it's a pigsty.

335
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,065
It's no prince. It's a pauper's cave.

336
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,400
Prince Coffee?

337
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,002
-You live nearby, so you must know.
-Is it really Prince Coffee?

338
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,471
Mr. Hong sold it?

339
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,273
That's weird.

340
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:51,476
Run that coffee shop. Please?

341
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,911
It's in a great location. Do it.

342
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,513
Why are you so excited?

343
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,982
Do it. And let me work there.

344
00:21:57,215 --> 00:22:00,419
I can clean well and I'm strong.
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

345
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,821
I still owe you money.

346
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,790
I can't pay you back without a job.

347
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,592
Come on. Let me work there too. Do it.

348
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,694
It's a bother.

349
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,729
And it's not a bother to breathe?

350
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,700
You laze around instead of working.
That's why the girl's family disapproves.

351
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,737
You're not desperate enough,
so everything is a bother.

352
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,106
I would do it just to show them.

353
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,010
I would show the girl I like
how successful I could be.

354
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:26,945
Enough.

355
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,246
Enough what?

356
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,248
If it fails,

357
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,651
then, so be it.

358
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,387
You have nothing to lose anyway.

359
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,523
If it goes under,
you can just bum around again.

360
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,725
Am I wrong?

361
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:43,795
Well, that does make sense.

362
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,201
If it succeeds, you can impress
your grandma,

363
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,403
and your girl.

364
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,872
If it fails, you can go back
to your current life.

365
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,942
Run the coffee shop. Okay?

366
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,844
-Come on, do it.
-Hold on.

367
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,812
Go brush your teeth first.

368
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,647
You smell like kimchi. It's gross.

369
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,486
Go!

370
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:10,689
Run the coffee shop.

371
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,357
Shut up. Don't say anything.

372
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,428
Habit.

373
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:18,897
Bad habit.

374
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:23,168
Like drinking water in the morning?
What does that mean?

375
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,670
I don't drink water in the morning.

376
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,213
What are you doing? I'm brushing my teeth!

377
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,550
You grumble even when
you're brushing your teeth?

378
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,918
Wipe your mouth.

379
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,686
You have no manners.

380
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,221
Why do I need manners with another dude?

381
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,322
You can sleep on the sofa.

382
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,591
I'm not sleeping over.
I'll leave once the rain stops.

383
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,298
It splattered on my pants.

384
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:00,338
Hey, why is your butt so small?

385
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,741
Why did you slap my butt?

386
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,344
Your butt won't wear out
just because I slapped it.

387
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,080
It's just funny how small it is,
that's all.

388
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,468
Here.

389
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:32,637
Are you going to sleep?

390
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,307
Let's hang out some more.

391
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:36,908
I'm tired.

392
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,611
I have some good stuff.
Do you want to see?

393
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,380
Are you a teen, watching stuff like that?

394
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,782
Just don't take it with you.

395
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,904
-Are you sleeping?
-Yeah.

396
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,873
Good night.

397
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,007
Okay.

398
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,427
He acts like he's so clean.

399
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,242
The eyes are crooked
and the stain won't come out.

400
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,378
What can I do with this? You keep it.

401
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,215
Also, you should run the café.
And hire me too.

402
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,718
Think it over. Promise!

403
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,219
He's so cute.

404
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,983
Grandma, give me my car.

405
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,919
What do you mean, "Why?"
You said to run the café.

406
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,656
I'm not doing this as a joke.

407
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,925
When I do something, I do it right.

408
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,121
Hey, Hungry. Are you busy?

409
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,063
Hey. You lied to me, didn't you?

410
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,832
How is this a good location?

411
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,135
If you clean up a bit and advertise...

412
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,337
Shut up and get in.
We need to do a market research.

413
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:27,405
You know the area, right?

414
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,276
Of course, I know it inside-out--
Are you hiring me?

415
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:32,377
We'll see.

416
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,412
Are you really the boss?

417
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,680
What?

418
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,616
Regardless, you need to pay me well
for today.

419
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,618
I blew off an important job.

420
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,220
It will be 100,000 won, okay?

421
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:44,723
You see me as money, right?

422
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,757
Yes.

423
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,227
But it won't be easy in that car.

424
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,803
Get off of me!

425
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,973
But we're going downhill!
I can't push my butt back.

426
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,375
Do it. Stop overreacting.

427
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:11,282
There's Star Café. Bean Café's over there.

428
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,553
Two big cafés within 500 meters.

429
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,622
This sucks.

430
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,258
Stop.

431
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,329
Why is there such a big crowd there?

432
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:27,432
It's the most famous waffle place
in the area.

433
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,534
Why are they all girls?

434
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,735
That's a women's college.

435
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,470
-Really?
-Yes.

436
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,914
One waffle, please.

437
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,582
That looks good!

438
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,385
-It's so good.
-One for me, too.

439
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,087
I want the freshest one.

440
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,822
Seon-gi, the cops are coming.

441
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,157
Okay. Thank you.

442
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,462
Hey, follow him.

443
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,597
-What?
-Hurry.

444
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,574
Excuse me!

445
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,543
I would like us to work together.
Are you interested?

446
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,479
Don't you want to work
in a proper setting?

447
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:15,980
What's with that guy?

448
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,216
I can't work under someone else.

449
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,286
Think about it.

450
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,887
Please come to Prince Coffee!

451
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,222
Go.

452
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,774
What? Pretend you're a guy?

453
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,076
That's nonsense.

454
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,278
A girl is a girl. A girl isn't a guy.

455
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:48,613
Please.

456
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,583
Even if you do fool him right now,
what about later on?

457
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,052
I'll tell him later on.

458
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,187
Let me get the job first.

459
00:30:56,287 --> 00:31:00,225
I lied to him that I was a guy
and I made a lot on a part-time gig.

460
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:03,862
So why did you take his money?

461
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,330
I know.

462
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,065
I hate myself too.

463
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,467
But if I tell him now,
he'll get really mad.

464
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,137
Please, just this once.
I'll tell him later. I promise.

465
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,140
Let's get some decent baristas.

466
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,676
Mr. Hong is the barista.

467
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,645
It's my kitchen. No one else can run it.

468
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,413
Do you know why your shop is such a mess?

469
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:24,082
Because your coffee sucks.

470
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:25,183
It doesn't suck.

471
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,951
Yes, it's dirty, but...

472
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,555
The coffee tastes incredible.

473
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,626
Try some.

474
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:35,927
-Put that away.
-Try it.

475
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,028
I don't want it.

476
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:40,365
Forget it. He doesn't know anything
about coffee.

477
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:42,233
He probably only drinks alcohol.

478
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,835
He can't drink.

479
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,236
He passes out after one shot.

480
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,005
Where are the bean samples?

481
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,406
What?

482
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,943
We'll target women in their 20s,
since there's a women's college nearby.

483
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,213
Just stick to the 70's and 80's concept.

484
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,082
We'll go for variety in the side menu.

485
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:59,317
Waffles.

486
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,219
A side menu? Give me a break.

487
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,388
You're so superficial.

488
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,523
Those waffles.

489
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,360
There's that famous waffle guy
by the women's college you like.

490
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,630
You're kind of smart.

491
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,799
Let's change the name first.

492
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:17,068
-We'll go with "Coffee Prince."
-That's the same thing.

493
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:20,138
There will be three to four workers,
all princes, just like the café name.

494
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,940
Prince? Guys?

495
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,908
What about me?

496
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,476
Not you. What if...

497
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,477
Why not?

498
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,780
He's my first recruit.

499
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,548
He's trustworthy and responsible.

500
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,051
Start working from tomorrow.

501
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,485
Be right back.

502
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,854
Hi.

503
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,921
How have you been, DK?

504
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,549
Who was that?

505
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,084
DK.

506
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,754
This song is really nice.

507
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,224
Why did you hang up so quickly?

508
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,026
He just called to ask how I'm doing.

509
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,366
Do you not like my talking to DK--

510
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,467
It's fine.

511
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,503
You don't look like it's fine.

512
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,743
Give me some time.

513
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,049
I'm hungry.

514
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,418
-Something spicy?
-The spiciest.

515
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,920
Okay, in ten minutes.

516
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,254
Five.

517
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,423
-Seven.
-One minute.

518
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:07,972
What are you doing over there?

519
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,177
What are you hiding?

520
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,412
I saw everything.

521
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,282
A present?

522
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,251
It's a free gift.

523
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,087
I took a bigger one. It should be useful.

524
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,123
Thank you.

525
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,864
It's a ladle.

526
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,867
I brought it especially for you.
We usually only give out the gloves.

527
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:38,302
You won't get in trouble?

528
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,537
It's fine.

529
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:40,671
I'll get going.

530
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,340
Take care.

531
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,010
How are things going
with Guy A and Girl B?

532
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,979
Oh, that...

533
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,214
I heard they eat together,

534
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,417
take walks and have tea together,
things like that.

535
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,021
So it worked out, then.

536
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,160
That's great. Congratulations.

537
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,397
I guess you won't need
my counseling anymore.

538
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,500
I heard something else, though.

539
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,636
Girl B has a Guy C.

540
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,738
-An old flame.
-Come here.

541
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,108
Then...

542
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,644
Did Guy A not know about Guy C?

543
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,711
He did.

544
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,213
He knew,

545
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,249
but he wasn't so pleased
when Girl B talked to Guy C

546
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,318
on the phone.

547
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,021
-Isn't he pathetic?
-No.

548
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,423
I can totally understand Guy A.

549
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,093
They broke up. Why is she talking
to her ex-boyfriend?

550
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:37,762
Girl B is kind of... You know.

551
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,397
Paw.

552
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,900
But...

553
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,071
Is Guy A that insecure about himself
regarding Girl B?

554
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:51,008
Tell him I think he's pretty cool,
and to have confidence.

555
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,345
I will.

556
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,415
May I ask you a question?

557
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,583
What?

558
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,652
There's this guy who thinks this girl...

559
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,755
is a guy.

560
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,391
What do you mean?

561
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,429
My deliveries are backed up.

562
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,030
I'll tell you next time.

563
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,166
-Okay.
-Bye, Sweeper. Bye!

564
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,368
Thank you.

565
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,071
-Hey!
-Yeah?

566
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,406
Sorry for bugging you.

567
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,743
I don't know whether or not
we'll run into each other, but...

568
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:30,381
So, in case we don't, will you give me
your number so I can call...

569
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,582
Never mind if you don't want to.

570
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:32,883
I don't mind...

571
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,719
What's your number?

572
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:42,393
It's 010-2917-1215.

573
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,062
What's your name?

574
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,465
-Han...
-Sweeper's dad.

575
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:49,734
Sweeper.

576
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,269
See you.

577
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,303
Take care.

578
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:00,478
010-2917-1215

579
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:06,250
010-2917-1215

580
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,354
I got it finally. Choi Han-sung.

581
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:18,229
010-2917-1215

582
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,833
We'll redo the interior,

583
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,070
replace the equipment, kitchen tools,
furniture, sign, and hire new workers.

584
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,372
That will be 100 to 150 million won.

585
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,275
And work on Mr. Hong.

586
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,545
I won't work with him
if he shoots down all my ideas.

587
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:39,784
How did you meet someone like that?

588
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:43,888
-Mr. Hong is equal in rank with you.
-Equal?

589
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:49,260
In other words, you're both CEOs.
Neither of you can fire the other.

590
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,164
You can do the interior yourself
for 700,000 to 800,000 won.

591
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:55,166
Use the equipment you already have.

592
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,268
You can pay the workers
with what you make.

593
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,270
I'll give you 50 million won.

594
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,406
And you must submit receipts
for everything.

595
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,877
Grandma, how can you go
from 150 million to 50 million?

596
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm going to a meeting.

597
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,584
She's impossible.

598
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,560
-Did you look around?
-Of course.

599
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,795
Dong-su's factory will provide the paint.

600
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:28,999
Min-cheol will provide the furniture.

601
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,668
I'm leaving the interior to you.

602
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:33,170
I may be unable to pay you properly.

603
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,207
I owe you so much.

604
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:39,343
We're built on trust, okay?

605
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,045
Thanks.

606
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:50,020
Move. You're blocking me.

607
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,028
Do it anyway.

608
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,498
Work hard if you want a nice figure.

609
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,099
She can't have a nice figure.

610
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,801
She's a guy starting tomorrow.

611
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,069
Right.

612
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,270
Then...

613
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:09,173
I should build up muscles.

614
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,579
Are you really going to act like a guy?
What if you get caught?

615
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:16,881
Don't worry.

616
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,716
They won't know
as long as we don't bathe together.

617
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:20,518
I totally agree with her.

618
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,720
Her front is as flat as her back.

619
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,024
Anyway, I know I can do it,
so don't worry.

620
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,228
Once I get paid, I'll pay off the debt
and buy you shoes.

621
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,063
I don't need...

622
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,534
I'll just bring you
some snacks then, okay?

623
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,769
Don't come. What if I get caught?

624
00:40:38,836 --> 00:40:40,337
Don't worry.

625
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:42,072
I'll say you're my son.

626
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,042
I'll say you're definitely my son.

627
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,548
Down your drink

628
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,885
Cool. The shop
is the definition of "amazing."

629
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,121
This is incredible.

630
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,092
I'm burning with desire
to tear everything down.

631
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,863
Does he even know what he's doing?

632
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:07,765
We'll open up the kitchen.

633
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,668
You're not opening up my kitchen.

634
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,538
Opening your kitchen means
showing everyone your know-how.

635
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,107
True know-how can't be copied,
even if seen.

636
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,143
Let's just open half of it.

637
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,679
Half will be open,
and the other half closed.

638
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,215
We'll kill two birds with one stone, okay?

639
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,649
Good morning.

640
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,621
A sharp nose.

641
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,590
Slim jawline.

642
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:34,191
Full lips.

643
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,060
Are you a guy or a girl?

644
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,662
-Who is this?
-My lover.

645
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,197
That lover.

646
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,666
No wonder rumors were flying.

647
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,168
That must have been nice.

648
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,836
He's totally my type.

649
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,672
Hi, I'm Jin Ha-rim.

650
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,074
How old are you?

651
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:51,675
Twenty-two?

652
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:52,910
Twenty-three?

653
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,278
Twenty-four, Koh Eun-chan.

654
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:55,880
Okay. Eun-chan.

655
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,682
You look cuter the more I look at you.

656
00:41:58,749 --> 00:41:59,850
Let's get started now.

657
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,185
What time are they coming?

658
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,486
They'll be here soon.

659
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,754
Let's dump the trash first.

660
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,156
When will we finish cleaning this?
It's so filthy.

661
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,326
-What? What is that?
-Hey.

662
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:11,529
Hey, what's wrong?

663
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,566
Mouse.

664
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,102
Is that all it was?

665
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:19,603
Did you catch it?

666
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,739
It got away.

667
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,875
The mouse was as big as a cat.

668
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,810
I nearly peed my pants.

669
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,812
I got it!

670
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,117
I got it!

671
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,387
-I caught a full bottle. I'll light it up!
-Seriously!

672
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,291
That kid has got guts.

673
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,579
Get the ceiling here, please.

674
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,780
Okay.

675
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,161
Who's that?

676
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:19,730
What are you doing here? Move.

677
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:23,534
Eun-sae refuses to see me because of you!

678
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,270
You took away my only angel.

679
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,906
I saved you from going to prison.

680
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,775
Leave quietly. I'm busy right now.

681
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:37,247
There cannot be two suns in the same sky.

682
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,216
Let's finish this!

683
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,386
Fine. We can do it
after I finish moving this stuff.

684
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:45,322
Help out.

685
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,525
Are you crazy? Why should I do that?

686
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:52,930
Move quickly, so we can fight quickly.
You're so dumb.

687
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:57,234
Okay, fine. Then I'll finish this quickly.

688
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,120
What is he doing?

689
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,822
Is this Hercules' home?

690
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,392
Do they eat ginseng every day?

691
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,029
Hey, it would be nice
to have someone like that around.

692
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,830
Hey, you. Who are you?

693
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:27,965
And who are you?

694
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:31,635
Do you want to work here?

695
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,971
No.

696
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,439
I'm the boss here.

697
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:38,409
If you need a job, work here.

698
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,512
Don't you dare. You do, and you're dead.

699
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,915
Okay, let's battle now.

700
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,830
Here. Use this.

701
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:40,637
Look at your skin.

702
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,007
What was that for?

703
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,042
Apologize.

704
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,211
Apologize. Now!

705
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,847
There he goes again with the "apologize."

706
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,548
I'm so sick of that.

707
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,118
-He's so obsessive.
-Apologize. Now.

708
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,253
-Mr. Hong, order the coffee beans.
-Apologize.

709
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,622
Eun-chan!

710
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:01,391
Order the beans
I told you about yesterday.

711
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,593
Okay!

712
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,261
Apologize right now.

713
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:06,330
I'm sorry.

714
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,067
Look at my eyes and apologize sincerely.

715
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,368
Aren't you going to order them?

716
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,269
I'll do it!

717
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,771
That's enough.

718
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,442
Min-yeop!

719
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:19,843
What is it?

720
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,078
Order the coffee beans.

721
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,179
The number is

722
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,682
010-6980-4213. Twenty, two-kilo bags.

723
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,785
-Apologize.
-What is the number again?

724
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:30,154
010-6980-4213. Twenty, two-kilo bags!

725
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:32,856
010-6980-4213. Twenty, two-kilo bags!

726
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,424
Make me repeat it again, and you're dead!

727
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,827
010-6980-4213.

728
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:38,962
-Twenty, two-kilo bags...
-I'm scared.

729
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,165
-Apologize.
-Wait.

730
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,267
-How many bags?
-Apologize!

731
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,768
Enough, okay?

732
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,504
How long will you do this?

733
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,575
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

734
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,813
Let's get to work.

735
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,452
He's just a jerk with a pretty face.

736
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,723
Serves you right.

737
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,870
What is it, Han Yoo-joo?

738
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,572
Were you sleeping?

739
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:22,773
No.

740
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:25,976
I'm sorry.

741
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,412
For what?

742
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,714
That day...

743
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,650
I didn't consider your feelings.

744
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,222
I shouldn't have said that

745
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,991
about your dad.

746
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,128
I won't make excuses. I'm sorry.

747
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,000
Are you really sorry?

748
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,502
Yeah.

749
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:54,805
Then do me a favor.

750
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,708
I need a mural in my shop.

751
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,578
So you agreed to do it.

752
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,046
Yeah.

753
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:08,218
Did we overcome an obstacle
in our relationship now?

754
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,687
I was so scared before.

755
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,358
Do you actually get scared, too?

756
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,492
Of course.

757
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,160
I'm scared of you and your cousin.

758
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,197
Han-sung is always between us.

759
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,634
Friend.

760
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,369
Don't be like that.

761
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:29,806
Fine, I won't.

762
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,477
You sound very tired.

763
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,713
I want to sleep,

764
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,216
but I can't.

765
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,351
Maybe I'm overly tired.

766
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,288
You know I have insomnia.

767
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,192
What now? Do something.

768
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:54,598
Then, do you want to paint the mural now?

769
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,433
Now?

770
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:57,968
No?

771
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:00,904
Okay.

772
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,143
Let's meet there in an hour.

773
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,203
Han-gyeol.

774
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:36,907
You're here.

775
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:50,921
I was worried we wouldn't have wine.

776
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,190
I'm impressed.

777
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,326
How can Yoo-joo work without wine?

778
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:57,961
There's music too.

779
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,731
I'll be able to draw well now.

780
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:02,899
Pour me a glass.

781
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,373
There.

782
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:44,234
My flat chest will get even flatter.

783
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,103
Hey, boobs. This is like...

784
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,708
guys choking their necks with neckties.

785
00:51:52,876 --> 00:51:55,212
I'm definitely not torturing you.

786
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,414
Done.

787
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,487
Eun-chan.

788
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,557
Now that you've got a job,
it will be smooth sailing ahead.

789
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,460
I can do this!

790
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:13,163
COFFEE PRINCE SHOP NO.1

791
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:26,376
He's early.

792
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,363
Who are you?

793
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,766
Who are you?

794
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,270
I think we've met before.

795
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:55,805
Scooter?

796
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:58,508
Right? Don't you remember me?

797
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:01,912
How can he not remember?

798
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,115
He's the guy who snatched your purse.

799
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,253
I feel like I've been beaten all over.

800
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:15,792
That's nice.

801
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,762
I thought it went well
with the color of the cement.

802
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:19,963
Looks good.

803
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,566
How are you two...

804
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,005
It's a long story. Right?

805
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,607
My head isn't your armrest.

806
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,108
Stop resting your hand and arm on it.

807
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:36,613
Did you on a painkiller patch?

808
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,716
You plastered your body with them
after doing that little work?

809
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,352
Yes, I know you're a bloodhound.

810
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,988
My name is Han Yoo-joo.

811
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:48,491
Let's go eat.

812
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,694
You must be hungry from working all night.

813
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:52,162
Let me greet him properly first...

814
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,064
You can greet him later.

815
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:57,634
Clean the wine glasses
and that stuff over there.

816
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,603
What should we eat? Tofu soup?

817
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,772
My stomach isn't so great.
Let's get something light.

818
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,407
Something light?

819
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,326
The coffee beans are here.

820
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,698
What do you mean,
20 pieces of 20-kilo bags?

821
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,200
We ordered for 2-kilo bags.

822
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,570
Mr. Hong, what's going on?

823
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:35,872
What happened?

824
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:38,475
-You placed the order...
-Quiet.

825
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,644
I'm sorry.

826
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,813
I must have mistakenly ordered
20-kilo bags.

827
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,215
Can we have a refund?

828
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,084
-Are you kidding me?
-Who would kid in this situation?

829
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,453
And even if we did order that,

830
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,923
why would a new café
order 20-kilo bags of beans

831
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,760
that cost hundreds of thousands
of won each?

832
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,664
You knew it was a mistake,
but you sent them anyway!

833
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,733
I thought it was strange too,
so I confirmed over and over again.

834
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,870
"Are you sure you want
the 20-kilo bags, not 2-kilo bags?"

835
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,672
Didn't I ask you that?

836
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:11,374
We will not take them back.

837
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:13,910
Sir!

838
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,613
I'm sorry, but is there any way?

839
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,415
Send the 14 million won
by the end of the day.

840
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,150
Wait! You can't just leave like this!

841
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:24,154
Eun-chan.

842
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:25,655
Come with me.

843
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:37,167
Didn't you go to grade school?

844
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,803
Can't you even differentiate 20 and 2?

845
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,440
I'm sorry.

846
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,608
I'll go and try to talk to them--

847
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,610
Business is built on trust.
Do you realize that?

848
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,648
If we return beans from the beginning,

849
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:52,949
who will trust us later?

850
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,352
Who would want to do business with us?

851
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,220
Stop yelling at the kid.

852
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,590
I'll call your grandma and...

853
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,759
Is this how you've been doing business?

854
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:05,428
All you do is depend on others.

855
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,664
You insist on your way, and if you fail,
you put it on others.

856
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:08,998
What was that?

857
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,434
-You punk.
-Mr. Hong, calm down.

858
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,136
You really are a prick.

859
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,307
People make mistakes.
Why must you berate him like that?

860
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:19,776
Stop it.

861
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,678
Getting angry won't fix it--

862
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,613
Why do you think I'm angry?

863
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,215
Do you think this is a joke?

864
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,550
Your mistake may kill the shop.

865
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,018
Don't you feel guilty at all?

866
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,353
I'm just getting angry?

867
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,422
You disrespectful brat!

868
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,892
Are you crying? Hey.

869
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,660
Does crying solve anything?

870
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,830
You cry at the drop of a hat. Stop crying!

871
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:44,134
Let's get some fresh air. Come out.

872
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:45,769
I'm fine.

873
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,004
I apparently misjudged you.

874
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,875
If you're going to keep fooling around,
just quit right now!

875
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,717
Would you please excuse us?

876
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:02,619
Okay.

877
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:11,060
Eun-chan, if you don't mind,
how about we get some coffee?

878
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:13,730
I'm fine.

879
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,465
You should go to him.

880
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:23,406
I heard you bought 20 bags of beans.

881
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,175
Eun-chan. Let's roast the beans.

882
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:26,810
What are you doing?

883
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:28,244
I said to taste it.

884
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,648
If you're going to keep this up, get out.
I don't need you.

885
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,784
You're curious about him?
This is what he's like.

886
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,186
Let's change the name first.

887
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,387
We'll go with "Coffee Prince."

888
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,255
-Coffee...
-Prince!

889
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:40,990
Prince!

890
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:43,593
My son, Mom's here!

891
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:44,994
Hey, Ji-hyang.

892
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,396
I think we should get going.

893
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:48,097
Did you say anything about me?

894
00:57:48,331 --> 00:57:49,666
Do you know our boss?

895
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:51,935
