1
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,097
I don't want to send you away either.

2
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:35,035
I wouldn't want to work here
without you around,

3
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,137
so, why would I want you to go?

4
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,739
But I want you to broaden your horizons.

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,109
You said that becoming a barista
was the first dream you've ever had.

6
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,146
If you're going to become a barista,
become the best.

7
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:50,817
I don't want you to give up
your dreams because of me.

8
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,821
I want to support you
so you can develop and better yourself.

9
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,725
Although we'll be apart
for the time being, later on,

10
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:01,127
when you make your first batch of kimchi,

11
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,396
when you hold our first child,

12
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,365
I'll always be by your side.

13
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,301
Even though it may be hard
while we're apart,

14
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,736
let's try our best to bear it out.

15
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,977
These pants are stuck!

16
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,486
Did you sleep well?

17
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,457
The day has gotten bright.

18
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,661
Oh, no! My mom's going to kill me.

19
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,062
I came out without telling her.

20
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,871
I'll go with you and tell your mom
that you were at my place.

21
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,839
No. I'll tell her.

22
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,107
Where did my clothes go?

23
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,776
There. I'll get them for you.

24
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,911
No! I'll pick them up. I will.

25
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,348
Hold on.

26
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,393
It's embarrassing.
Could you leave me alone for a minute?

27
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:50,563
What's so wrong
with me looking at my girl?

28
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,134
When did these fall down?

29
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,174
-What? What now?
-There's one right here too.

30
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,979
Hold on.

31
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,148
You're light as a feather!

32
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,561
You should eat as much of this as possible

33
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,263
because you won't be able
to eat this in Italy.

34
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,567
What is this girl going to eat
when she can't even eat greasy stuff?

35
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,002
It's a worry to send you.

36
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:31,137
What should we eat?

37
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,238
Train.

38
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:36,542
What's this? A spaceship?

39
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,247
You have to call often.

40
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,349
You have to call at least once a day.

41
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,152
What's up with the requests?
It's not like you're going to go tomorrow.

42
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,688
When I said that I was going to New York,

43
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,623
you said that you were going
to call me once a week.

44
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,225
That was then and this is now.

45
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,260
You're so selfish.

46
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,698
Don't grow your hair out there
or wear miniskirts.

47
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,000
If men ask if you have a boyfriend,
tell them you're married.

48
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,202
Actually, don't even hang around guys.
Okay?

49
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,439
Then what am I supposed to do?
Live like a hermit?

50
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,141
Don't make excuses.

51
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,743
You can just say yes,
but you just complain.

52
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,420
Don't overwork. If your head hurts, rest.

53
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,490
Also, make sure to relax
when your shoulders feel stiff. Okay?

54
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,893
You're the one
who should watch out for her health.

55
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,128
It's a difficult thing being sick
in a foreign land.

56
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:30,763
Make sure to call me
if you're feeling sick.

57
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,333
If you just stupidly endure it,
then I'm going to give you a scolding.

58
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,768
I think we'll miss each other, right?

59
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,036
Yeah.

60
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,074
I'll have to see you
as much as possible before I leave.

61
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,277
Eyes, nose, and mouth, all mine.

62
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,080
It's all mine.

63
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:48,915
Stop it. It's ticklish.

64
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,251
Get on my back!

65
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,161
Let's go on a date every day
before you leave.

66
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,597
Where did you say
that you wanted to go before?

67
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,966
Theme park? 63 Building? Movie theater?

68
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,267
Minsokchon?

69
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,604
Let's go to all of them.

70
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,741
Let's go to all of them.

71
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,313
What about the Namsan Tower?

72
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,515
Namsan? Namsan.

73
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,655
-Oh, Eun-sae.
-Hey!

74
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,724
Are you in your right mind?

75
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,026
You were with your boyfriend last night,
weren't you?

76
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,295
What am I doing asking you?

77
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,396
Listen carefully.

78
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,865
I said that you were going straight
to the cafÃ©, after you exercise,

79
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,667
so don't come home
and go straight to work.

80
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,736
All right. Thanks.

81
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,338
You two owe me. You know that, right?

82
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,374
Okay! I'll talk to you later.

83
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,243
Was that your sister?

84
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,713
Eun-sae seems to have made excuses
for me to our mom.

85
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,549
I should give her lots
of allowance money then.

86
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,950
What allowance money?

87
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,752
Her personality's going to get worse.

88
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:13,993
Why are you coming together?

89
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,162
We ran into each other.

90
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,232
We should prepare to open.

91
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,467
There's something. Something smells fishy.

92
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,802
She's still in the same clothes!

93
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,171
-Something happened at night, right?
-I should help her.

94
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:27,240
Did you hit a home run? Is that it?

95
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:30,076
Stop with the useless chatter
and get back to work.

96
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,777
I'm right.
Where are you trying to run away?

97
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,745
Look. Look into my eyes.

98
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,580
She always wears the same clothes
for three days!

99
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,982
Eun-chan!

100
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:39,552
What should we do for Eun-chan
when she leaves?

101
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,021
I think she will need
living expenses the most,

102
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,389
but I don't think she will accept it.

103
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,658
We should get a round-trip airplane ticket
for Han-gyeol.

104
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,627
He's so down because Eun-chan's going.

105
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,663
We don't know if he will go and come back
once a month if he goes on like this.

106
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,266
That's very different than someone I know.

107
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:54,934
What? Me?

108
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,369
What did I do?

109
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,337
When I went to study overseas in Paris,

110
00:08:58,404 --> 00:08:59,539
how many times did you visit?

111
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,841
I wanted to go,

112
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,243
but I was so busy with my final paper.

113
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,613
Han-gyeol would have visited
regardless of his final paper.

114
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,450
I'm so jealous of Eun-chan.

115
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:13,886
I'm so jealous of Han-gyeol.

116
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:18,691
Eun-chan's probably six years
younger than you, right?

117
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,393
-Are you really done talking?
-Yeah.

118
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,062
Really?

119
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,730
Don't do it!

120
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,066
-Hey! Stop it! Stop!
-Say that again!

121
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,445
What are you doing scuttling
around like that?

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,614
I have my reasons.

123
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,152
Hey! Eun-chan! Jeez! Keep working.

124
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,359
Why are you like that?

125
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,294
-Does that feel good?
-Stop it! You're tickling me!

126
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,466
Congratulations!

127
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,535
-Be quiet!
-Congratulations!

128
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:04,303
-Mr. Hong!
-Ha-rim.

129
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,739
Eun-chan and Manager Choi
were in the bathroom,

130
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:10,042
lowering their pants and were kissing!

131
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,078
This isn't the first time
they've been caught in the act.

132
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,546
Just leave them alone!

133
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:17,350
Look at him sweat. Oh! Your zipper's open!

134
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,755
Go to the bathroom
and look at Eun-chan's face.

135
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,357
Her face is shining.

136
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,925
She came out!

137
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,827
Isn't it completely different
than yesterday?

138
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,929
-It's sweat.
-Sweat? It's sweat?

139
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,965
Hey! I think I saw Byeol around.

140
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,835
Byeol? My Byeol? Where is she? Where?

141
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,676
What kind of situation is this?

142
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,446
She's kind of suspicious.
Isn't she a player?

143
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,217
Say something that makes sense.
What do you look in her to take her for...

144
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,653
I really can't figure her out.

145
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,955
The way I see it, she's playing you.

146
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,437
Hey!

147
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,639
Why are you cleaning all day?

148
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,676
And look at what a slipshod job
you're doing!

149
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,011
Mop harder for crying out loud!

150
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:19,912
All right.

151
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,314
Hard.

152
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,483
Don't keep doing it in the same place.

153
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,752
Do it in places like here
and in corners like this.

154
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:28,621
-I already mopped it here.
-You need to be thorough.

155
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,056
Hold it.

156
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,924
Go ahead and mop in straight lines.

157
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,125
Straight.

158
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,462
Straight. Turn.

159
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,397
I'll do this area later.

160
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:39,498
Are you bored?

161
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,201
You're strong so... What?
Are you mocking your boss?

162
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,804
Just do what you're told to do.
Give that to me.

163
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,140
-Here. Do it quickly.
-All right.

164
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,276
Do it next to the corners...
nooks and crannies.

165
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,044
There's a lot of dust in places like this.

166
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,345
Turn it around once.

167
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:54,847
-Like this?
-Right, now straight.

168
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,215
Straight.

169
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,884
Where are you going? Not there!

170
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,786
Make another turn!

171
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,355
Mop again. Just once isn't enough.
It's dirty there.

172
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,623
Mop all the way to the end.

173
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,425
Why are you doing this?

174
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,561
-Straight! One more time!
-Like that!

175
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:09,995
-Straight!
-Good job.

176
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,764
Oh! What is this?

177
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,766
What is this?

178
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,768
Let's take a look inside!

179
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,406
They're shoes. Maybe a customer
left it there by accident?

180
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,844
These shoes look like they'll fit you.
Why don't you try them on?

181
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,913
Why would I try them on?
They're not mine! Jeez!

182
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,649
Baristas have to stand for a long time.

183
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:33,085
Your feet have to feel comfortable
for you not to feel tired.

184
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,255
Did you hide it there?

185
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,960
How did you know my size?

186
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,198
Your feet are about as wide as my hand.

187
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,538
You really moved me.

188
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,308
Thanks. But I'm feeling sad right now.

189
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,145
I haven't done anything for you.

190
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,718
There's something you can do for me.

191
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,222
Scratch my back?

192
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:14,994
Where? Here?

193
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,462
That's it! That feels good!

194
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:20,366
That feels so good!

195
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,968
You shouldn't just shower all the time.

196
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:26,305
You should have someone scrub you
at the public bath.

197
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:30,476
Promise me that you will scratch my back
for me even when I'm older.

198
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,878
They have backscratchers
for that kind of thing, you know.

199
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,617
But they say that if you buy women shoes,
they run away.

200
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,785
Are you all right with that?

201
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,556
Don't worry. I stuck a lucky charm
on the bottom of the shoes.

202
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,558
Really? Where?

203
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,528
"You are mine."

204
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,497
"Choi Han-gyeol."

205
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,370
He thinks of everything, doesn't he?

206
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:05,110
Don't work too hard over there,
and focus on broadening your horizons.

207
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,012
I can't just relax over there.

208
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,515
This is a rare opportunity,
and I plan to make the most of it.

209
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,050
So I have to work hard.

210
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,986
I bet you'll miss me so much
when you get there

211
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,221
that you'll come back right away.

212
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,157
I'm more worried about
the person who's saying that.

213
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:19,758
What about me?

214
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,529
I'm worried you'll miss me so much
that you'll come to Italy every week.

215
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,831
Wait. My battery's almost dead.

216
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,800
Hold on.

217
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,135
Hold on.

218
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,837
Hold on.

219
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,241
Okay.

220
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,776
There's something I'm curious about.

221
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,046
Isn't your ideal woman someone

222
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,718
who's sexy and feminine like Yoo-joo?

223
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,786
-I'm right, right?
-Yeah.

224
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,455
How did you know?

225
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,691
So, why did you fall for someone like me?

226
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,727
I'm completely the opposite of Yoo-joo.

227
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,429
You know that
I'm a very altruistic person.

228
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,199
And I figured if I didn't fall for you,
no one would.

229
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,068
Your voice turns husky
because of one little thing,

230
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,371
you're stubborn
so you never listen to anyone,

231
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,441
you drink a lot and you eat tons of food.

232
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,510
I've decided to sacrifice myself.

233
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,978
Same here.

234
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,180
You're not exactly my type either.

235
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,082
What?

236
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,418
Then who is your ideal guy?

237
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,288
Someone like my dad.

238
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,090
Someone like your dad?

239
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,193
Your dad seems quite different
from me from what I can tell.

240
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:34,700
He sounds like he was a kind,
gentle, and loving guy.

241
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,570
Yeah. He's completely different from you.

242
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,340
But there are some similarities.

243
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,509
Similarities? What?

244
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,810
Where?

245
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,445
Eyes.

246
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,547
Eyes?

247
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:55,321
When you smile, looking into my eyes,
your eyes look exactly like my dad's eyes.

248
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,792
Hey. My eyes are so handsome.

249
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,760
They're masculine and strong.

250
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,696
Such eyes are hard to find, you know.

251
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,667
Hey? Why aren't you answering?

252
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:10,836
Hello?

253
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,873
Are you sleeping?

254
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,742
Koh Eun-chan.

255
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,445
Really...

256
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,717
You have to hang up your phone
for me to hang up.

257
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,586
What are you doing, kiddo? Hey!

258
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,989
How can you really sleep?

259
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,860
How cute.

260
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,197
Are you really asleep? Calling Eun-chan.

261
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,898
Hang up the phone and sleep!

262
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,902
So cute. What do I do?

263
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,232
I'm going to die.

264
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,666
Hey.

265
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,001
Eun-chan.

266
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,003
Wake up.

267
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,828
Aren't you happy when I wake you up?

268
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,598
Koh Eun-chan, Koh Eun-sae!

269
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,167
Aren't you guys going to eat?

270
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,435
Your mom's calling you.

271
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,670
See you later.

272
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,039
Okay.

273
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,353
Go home early since you must have
a lot of things to pack and organize.

274
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,022
Don't disappoint your mom.

275
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,857
Go home early and be with her too.

276
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,193
Okay, Mr. Hong.

277
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:19,231
Make sure not to skip meals,
and I'll be back as soon as possible,

278
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,001
so take care of my mom
while I'm gone, okay?

279
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,772
Jeez! You don't have to say farewell
like this.

280
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,007
You should always
keep your farewells short.

281
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,413
Mister, you know I really like you,
don't you?

282
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,450
Stop it. Han-gyeol might get jealous.

283
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,621
There's a hole.

284
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,093
It feels good, right?

285
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,062
Eun-chan.

286
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,431
Do you have something to say?

287
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,943
What is this?

288
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,112
A present.

289
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,580
A goodbye present.

290
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,682
Present?

291
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,417
It's make-up.

292
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,719
I'm sure that you would be almost
as pretty as Eun-sae

293
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,821
if you make yourself up a little.

294
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,858
Thanks.

295
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,033
Eun-chan, you know that I really like you
and respect you, don't you?

296
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,970
Don't worry about Eun-sae
and your mom. I'll take care of them.

297
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,974
I'm glad that you'll be here with them.

298
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,010
Take care of them for me, Min-yeop.

299
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,346
Eun-chan!

300
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,819
Go for it!

301
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,874
What are you doing? It's awkward.

302
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,046
Take care of yourself,
and come back safely.

303
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:51,049
You will do well. I believe in you.

304
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,151
Thanks, Seon-gi.

305
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,588
Fighting!

306
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:57,956
Fighting!

307
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,667
Why are you coming out so early?

308
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,003
I'm not ready to go in yet.

309
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:18,143
Ha-rim,

310
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,813
I know that we've had our differences,

311
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,819
but you know I like you a lot, don't you?

312
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,666
Why are you crying?

313
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,502
Don't cry.

314
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:50,609
Bye!

315
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:06,024
My Chan, have a nice time
studying in Italy.

316
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,195
I don't know how I'll stay cheerful
after you leave.

317
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:15,500
Since you can sleep and eat well
wherever you go,

318
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,170
that doesn't worry me,

319
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,740
But there's just one thing that does,
you and men.

320
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,011
You should better not be won over
by some guy's flowery words

321
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,114
or killer smile.

322
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,251
I'll handle Han-gyeol over here,

323
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,120
so don't worry.

324
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:37,989
If only you weren't his girl,

325
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,492
I could've tried pursuing you.

326
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:46,465
-I'm going to miss you so much, my Chan!
-"I'm going to miss you so much."

327
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,470
PS, Don't forget.
Dreams really do come true!

328
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,339
"Dreams really do come true.

329
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,709
Dreams really do come true."

330
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,778
Go for it!

331
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,749
But I don't want to go.

332
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:10,655
I can't. I have to go to the studio later.

333
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,824
I thought you weren't going
to participate in the exhibit.

334
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,893
That doesn't mean I don't have work to do.

335
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,462
You're such a meanie, Han-sung.

336
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,297
I've cut back on my workload,

337
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,234
and I'm trying not to go out with friends
for the baby,

338
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,269
so why are you acting like this?

339
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,804
Is there something you want to eat?

340
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,874
What? No, I'm all right.

341
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:34,112
Then wait.
Your hubby is going to eat dinner.

342
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,451
Hey! Yoo-joo!

343
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,218
You should sleep a little more.

344
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,406
The winters over there aren't
as cold as the winters in Seoul.

345
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:36,541
Don't pack it too much making it heavy.

346
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,878
What? I shouldn't pack my winter clothes?

347
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
I'll visit you this winter,

348
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,516
and I'll bring you any clothes
you might need then.

349
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,351
You're coming in the winter?

350
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,223
Winter is so far off.

351
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,358
Shouldn't you take more?

352
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,761
You can't eat rice without fermented
soy paste and chili paste.

353
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,265
I'll have to pack some more kimchi.

354
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,000
Mom! Some pepper flakes too.

355
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:04,202
It's good if you sprinkle it over
some greasy food.

356
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,471
Why are you laughing?

357
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,006
If you go to the Korean market there,

358
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,141
there's bean paste, pepper paste,
and pepper flakes.

359
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,810
-You can just buy and eat it there.
-Really?

360
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,346
Mom! Don't pack the food.
They also sell it in Italy.

361
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,082
Shouldn't you pack these books?
Won't you need to study them?

362
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,317
Why did you bring those down?
I've already read them all.

363
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,386
Take them away. Put them back. Grab this.

364
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:24,823
Have you packed your emergency medicine?

365
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,858
Stomach pain medicine or painkillers.

366
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,527
It may not suit you,

367
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,929
so take them with you
in case of emergency.

368
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,832
Mom... Where's the stomach pain medicine?

369
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,834
-Hold on.
-Yeah.

370
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,869
I can't stop worrying about her.

371
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,239
Jeez, will you put down the phone
and concentrate on packing your bags?

372
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,908
-Eun-chan.
-Yes?

373
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,576
I'm not coming out
to the airport tomorrow.

374
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:45,810
I might not let you go if I do.

375
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,180
Okay.

376
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,016
I'll call you later.

377
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,683
When you go there,

378
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:29,421
don't eat anything
that you see over there.

379
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,457
And be careful of strangers.

380
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:38,964
Don't play along with them
because they seem nice.

381
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,665
Don't worry.

382
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,269
What else do we need to pack?

383
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,639
Where's the memo
where I wrote down all the things to pack?

384
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:49,407
I'm so forgetful.

385
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,578
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

386
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,851
Why do I feel so empty?

387
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,954
Without Eun-chan, there's no spirit.

388
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,025
The boss still hasn't come back
from a delivery?

389
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,861
I bet he's hiding somewhere sobbing.

390
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,331
You think we should have seen
Eun-chan off at the airport?

391
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,501
Why is the mood so dark here today?

392
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,537
What did you say?

393
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,075
By the way, where did Mr. Hong go?

394
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,883
I wonder if she's already in the air.

395
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,519
Darn it, I miss her.

396
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,326
I told Mom and Eun-sae
not to come out either.

397
00:28:15,493 --> 00:28:17,629
I felt like that my feet won't lift

398
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,698
if I see Mom and Eun-sae cry
if they came to the airport.

399
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,132
You did well.

400
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:24,536
You might get airsick,
so try to sleep on the plane.

401
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,772
And when you arrive, the boarding
house owner will probably be out there.

402
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,742
You have her number, don't you?

403
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,178
How many times do I have to check?

404
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,579
I'm not a kid, you know.

405
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,484
You'll be late for your flight.
Board your plane.

406
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,586
Call me when you arrive.

407
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,125
All right.

408
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,861
I'll hang up now.

409
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,630
Take care.

410
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,633
Bye. Take care.

411
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:57,736
Wait!

412
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,307
I love you.

413
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,218
I love you.

414
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:18,890
Choi Han-gyeol.

415
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:20,225
I love you.

416
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:22,694
I know, kiddo.

417
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,965
TWO YEARS LATER...

418
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,470
April 20, 2009.

419
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,906
To Han-gyeol. Here's a kiss!

420
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:44,876
September 2008.

421
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:49,180
I bring up your face and mine
in the autumn sky of Milan.

422
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,049
December 2007.

423
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,384
There are lots of dashing guys here.

424
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,786
There are a lot of guys here

425
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,454
-who have a crush on me.
-Good morning.

426
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:59,691
Still, you're the most handsome
of them all!

427
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,760
May 2008.

428
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,463
I miss you so much, Han-gyeol.

429
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,566
It's currently 10:40.

430
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,869
I've been sleeping in
because I don't have work.

431
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,971
-I'm sleeping late these days.
-I will eat well.

432
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:16,074
I get confused if I came here to study
or to play sometimes.

433
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,011
But thanks to you and grandma,
I'm learning a lot.

434
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,846
It's so interesting.

435
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,982
Thank you so much, Han-gyeol.

436
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:25,516
I love you so much.

437
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,188
I'll finish my studies
and speed back to you.

438
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:32,190
I miss you.

439
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:33,992
I really miss you.

440
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,261
I really miss you!

441
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,729
I love you.

442
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,597
Here's a kiss for you!

443
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:44,569
January 4, 2009.

444
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:48,039
I'm eating delicious hamburgers.
We should come here together later on.

445
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,175
It's so big that I think
that I'll be okay to share.

446
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,311
January 4, 2009.

447
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,548
As I long for Coffee Prince,
I chomp on hamburgers.

448
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,317
There's not much time left.

449
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:01,319
From the barista to the employees,

450
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,154
the first Coffee Princess hires only women

451
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,422
which will attract coffee lovers

452
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:07,125
with a new charm that is different
from Coffee Prince's charm.

453
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:11,429
Han-gyeol!

454
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,567
Yeah, good.

455
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,241
Just look at the main model!

456
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,610
She's so plain.
She looks like any other girl!

457
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,345
Why do they keep making me
take my clothes off?

458
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,147
It's not like I'm shooting for Playgirl.

459
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,550
Hey! This is how all models
get their start.

460
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:37,021
And plus, you have such
a unique profile, Min-yeop.

461
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,324
Back up model! Get ready!

462
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,525
Okay!

463
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,965
Don't forget, Min-yeop.

464
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,802
My dream is for you to walk the runways
of New York and Paris someday.

465
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,638
Angel, Do you think they'll shoot me
from the front someday?

466
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:56,841
Of course. It's amazing that you've come
this far in just a few months.

467
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:57,909
Just believe me.

468
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,144
Your pecs are looking great!

469
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,346
-Fighting!
-Fighting!

470
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,117
Move closer to him, Su-jin,

471
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,454
and put your left hand on his shoulder.

472
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,156
Hello. Here.

473
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,860
This is that guy's portfolio.

474
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:19,764
Good! Okay!

475
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,269
Have you purchased the plane tickets?

476
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,973
I haven't yet...

477
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,844
What? Another year?

478
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,345
What are you talking about?

479
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:36,014
It's awarded to the winner
of the competition,

480
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,281
and I don't want to waste it.

481
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,884
I honestly wanted to study one more year,

482
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,353
and they said that they would pay
for my schooling too.

483
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,856
And they say that we will go around
the world and do demonstrations.

484
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,858
I get greedy.

485
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,760
No! You absolutely cannot!

486
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,496
The contract you had with my grandma was

487
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,498
that you study for two years
and return to work, right?

488
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,268
We've already started construction
on the Coffee Princess

489
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,936
so we could open it
by the time you get here!

490
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,572
Then, should I give it up and go?

491
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,643
You don't like it, do you?

492
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,913
I won't do it if you don't like it.

493
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:10,615
I should get going.

494
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:12,283
I'll call you later.

495
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,952
Hey! You're healthy, right?

496
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,587
You aren't sick anywhere, right?

497
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,390
Of course not. You know me.
I'm as healthy as a horse.

498
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,826
I'll talk to you later, Han-gyeol.

499
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,561
All right.

500
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,603
The person's phone
is turned off right now...

501
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:38,409
Jeez! Why is she overreacting
when all I did was go out on one date!

502
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,811
Fine! You want to call it off?

503
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,914
It's over then! Finished!
What a petty girl!

504
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,816
MY BYEOL
WOULD YOU LIKE TO DELETE THIS NUMBER?

505
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,651
Jeez! Damn it!

506
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,523
Hold on. Why are the doors like this?

507
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,893
Myeong-su! Come over here
with the plans for the interior.

508
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,828
Okay.

509
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,630
Here you are.

510
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,067
What is the Coffee Princess' concept?

511
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:06,604
A lovely concept
that suits the princesses.

512
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,573
Exactly! Lovely!

513
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,976
Now tell me, exactly what about this place
is lovely?

514
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,911
Is this a boxing ring?

515
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:17,682
Should I call Fedor and have a match here?

516
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,785
Could you try to make it
to our strategy meetings?

517
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:22,854
I have to always tell you
what went on in them.

518
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,890
All a barista should do is make coffee,
not attend meetings.

519
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,125
Boss!

520
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:30,394
I haven't seen you around lately.

521
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:32,296
You should come by the shop more often.

522
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,968
Hwang Min Yeop,
is your modeling work going well?

523
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,137
Of course.

524
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,438
I even changed my name.

525
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,240
Hwang Min! My Eun-sae thought of it.

526
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,275
Hwang Min? That's stupid.

527
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,678
Whatever. Anyway, aren't you going
to send my sister-in-law home early?

528
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:49,046
Don't pass over 12 o'clock, got it?

529
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,215
You have no right to say that.

530
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,619
I know that you would keep Eun-chan
until the early morning

531
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,187
and even all night long sometimes!

532
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,622
When did I?

533
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,791
And unlike you, my intentions
in keeping her late were pure!

534
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,293
Hello Mr. Hong!

535
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,861
Hello.

536
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,732
My name is Ha Da-yeong,

537
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,934
and I'm here to learn about coffee
making from you, Mr. Hong.

538
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,135
Please take me as your student.

539
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,703
What is she talking about?

540
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,073
This is the Coffee Prince
and only men work here.

541
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,341
We don't hire female employees.

542
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:20,411
That's not true. Eun-chan worked here,
you know!

543
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,813
Hello, I'm Jin Ha-rim.

544
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,448
I'm 27 years old. And what about you?

545
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,551
Hello. I know you.

546
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,488
I came here often.
I'm Ha Da-yeong. I'm 24 years old.

547
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,723
I'm so popular!

548
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:36,894
A sharp nose, a slim chin, plump lips...

549
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:39,730
Wow, I think they're plumper
than Eun-chan's.

550
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,233
I think she's also my type.

551
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:44,435
What? Why?

552
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,217
I'm sorry. I'm late, aren't I?

553
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,821
You're very shameless.

554
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,426
Don't you know you'll never be forgiven
if you're late on a day like this?

555
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,594
My meeting ended really late.

556
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,230
Excuse me. Can I get a glass? Thanks.

557
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,031
You're empty-handed too.

558
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,566
You don't have a single flower?

559
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,201
Look at this.

560
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,805
And most people think
that you're a kind and gentle husband.

561
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,040
Not knowing that you won't bring
your wife a flower

562
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,408
on your wedding anniversary.

563
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,012
Why do you need flowers?
You're the flower.

564
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:30,181
Jeez, you're such a sweet talker!

565
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,483
Here's to our second wedding anniversary!

566
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,020
Jeez! You ought to be grateful.

567
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,990
I even stayed with you
this long considering

568
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,758
you're out working day and night
all the time.

569
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:50,835
-What is it?
-What do you mean, what is it?

570
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,504
I reserved a hotel suite.

571
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,574
I'll make you scream
with pleasure tonight.

572
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:02,013
Jeez! You have such a dirty mind!

573
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,414
What are you talking about?

574
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,616
I'm just going to give you a massage.

575
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,984
I'll give you a full-body massage.

576
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,153
A massage? That's it?

577
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:13,090
-Let's go.
-Now?

578
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,759
Hold on!

579
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,562
Eun-chan will have to go
to a job interview when she returns.

580
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:21,332
It'll be difficult to run a coffee shop
with women only.

581
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,567
There are lots of tasks
that require strength in a coffee shop.

582
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,369
I have to discuss it with her
when she comes back.

583
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:27,204
It won't be a problem with Eun-chan back.

584
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,407
She's as strong as an ox.

585
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,475
But she's probably not as strong
as she used to be

586
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,010
since she's older now.

587
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,647
Revise the things that I have marked
and checked wrong.

588
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,015
Revise?

589
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,986
How many times do I have to redesign it?

590
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,089
Jeez, I can't believe
how fussy you're being

591
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,159
just because your future wife
will be running the shop.

592
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,830
I thought she already went home,
but she's still here.

593
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,265
Is there that much work to do?

594
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,370
All the girls who come here
have great strength.

595
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:01,339
She's almost as strong as Eun-chan.

596
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,310
By the way, I heard that Eun-chan
was getting tons of job offers in Milan.

597
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,547
Seeing that she hasn't returned,
maybe she's having second thoughts?

598
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,983
Did Eun-chan betray him?

599
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:15,753
Stop talking such nonsense, you two!

600
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,989
But she did say that she wanted
to stay there an extra year.

601
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,925
What? So, she betrayed you!

602
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,294
I feel so sorry for you, Han-gyeol.

603
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,329
You haven't been getting any
for years now.

604
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,698
Another year of chastity and you
might as well become a priest.

605
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,201
What's there to worry about?
Just tell her to come back in.

606
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,136
Or just drag her over here yourself.

607
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,339
How can I drag a kid
who wants to study more?

608
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,909
You have to finish that by mid-September.

609
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,679
Why is Eun-chan so greedy?

610
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,514
She should just hurry up and come back.

611
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,150
My Angel does everything lightheartedly.

612
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:51,555
Han-gyeol! Why don't we all go out
for a drink since you're here?

613
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:52,656
I'm busy.

614
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,525
Let's go out for a drink!

615
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,931
Why can't we just eat
what we have at home?

616
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,466
Why do you have to cook?

617
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:05,569
Will you quit with your whining?

618
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,239
Single and lonely people like you and me

619
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:12,042
have to eat right to stay healthy.

620
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,013
If you're thinking about health,
then clean up your room first.

621
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,148
Would you look at that?

622
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,717
It's bigger than your head.

623
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:24,355
What's wrong, Mr. Hong?

624
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,058
You're looking good.

625
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,061
So is your husband.

626
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,963
So, you have just one son?

627
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,467
Yeah. He started school this year.

628
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,704
Are you still running the shop?

629
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,473
Yeah.

630
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,676
We changed the name to Coffee Prince.

631
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,512
You should drop by. It's doing well.

632
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:53,684
Okay. Are you still single?

633
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:55,319
It's good, I guess.

634
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,223
I left so you could be happy

635
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,559
and meet someone better than me.

636
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,196
But since you look well, it's a relief.

637
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,798
-You're lying.
-What?

638
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,534
I heard that you got married.

639
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,337
I think that you're living happily.

640
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,207
I live a very normal life
like everybody else.

641
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,776
Like every other couple, there are times

642
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,644
when my husband and I get along,

643
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,080
and there are times
when we don't get along.

644
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:24,915
That's good.

645
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,619
You have peach allergies.

646
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,589
Not that it's any of my business.

647
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,157
My husband loves peaches,

648
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,860
and it's all right if I handle them
with gloves.

649
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,164
Let's go quickly, Mr. Hong.

650
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,966
All the ice cream will melt.

651
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:43,434
Okay.

652
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:52,176
This time, why don't you leave me?
It'll only be fair.

653
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,880
Okay. I'll be the one
who will leave this time.

654
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,290
The exit's that way.

655
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:18,235
She says that she won't marry me until
she marries Eun-chan and Eun-sae off!

656
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,604
We'll never get married like this!

657
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,972
Leave.

658
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,908
Who's holding you back? Just leave now.

659
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,010
It's really noisy.

660
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,711
Why don't you just cut the bull
and marry him?

661
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,580
Just give yourself to him, body and soul.

662
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,417
I guess you might have already
given him your body.

663
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,919
What are you talking about?

664
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:37,755
How can you say things so bluntly?

665
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:42,493
I don't think you're in a good mood today.

666
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,528
I ran into my ex-girlfriend today.

667
00:42:44,662 --> 00:42:45,763
Who?

668
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:49,633
You mean that floozy
who took your money and ran away?

669
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:52,937
That woman named Mi-suk?

670
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,374
Yeah. And her kid looked exactly like me.

671
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:00,411
No way...

672
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,981
His eyes are twinkling,
and he looks exactly like me.

673
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,683
It's his habit.

674
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:09,386
He looked at my Eun-chan
and said that she looked like him.

675
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,622
How can you think my Eun-chan's
beautiful eyes look anything

676
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,090
like the beads that you have for eyes?

677
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:14,491
What are you talking about?

678
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,660
My eyes are absolutely beautiful.

679
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,830
Please stop. You have a tendency
to get too close to my Ji-hyang.

680
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:22,099
Didn't I tell you not
to say "my Ji-hyang"?

681
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,701
She's my Ji-hyang.
What else do I call her?

682
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,069
Just stop.

683
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:28,238
-We're done eating. Done!
-You guys had enough already.

684
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,340
Come here.

685
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,677
Come here. I thought your legs
would be swollen from standing

686
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:38,315
in the laboratory all day long,
but they're still as sleek as ever.

687
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:44,254
Are you still angry about me
going to the nightclub?

688
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:50,394
Men usually go party in places
like that when they get together.

689
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,597
Let's stop seeing each other.

690
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,767
Didn't I say that the effect
of those words went away?

691
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,136
Try something else.

692
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:07,578
You're asking to break up for real?

693
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:09,446
Should I do that?

694
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,914
All right.

695
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,751
Dating one girl for two years...

696
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,253
That leaves a permanent stain
on Jin Ha-rim's name in his lifetime.

697
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,256
All right. I'll leave this right here.

698
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,891
It's been fun.

699
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:22,026
Have a nice life!

700
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:23,994
Hey, Jin Ha-rim.

701
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,532
You know that the corners of your eyes sag

702
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,068
when you're pretending
to be all right with something?

703
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,871
That's what's happening right now.

704
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,341
There she goes, analyzing again.

705
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,444
The corners of my eyes are not sagging.
Take another look.

706
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,212
Look again.

707
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,281
You're tired because of your dad's work.

708
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,783
Why didn't you tell me?

709
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,084
How did you know that?

710
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,753
I know your dad's hospital.

711
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:51,955
I heard that it closed.

712
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,493
Jeez! Is that why you're being like this?

713
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,295
We're going to open up the hospital again.

714
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,731
Do you know what kind of person my dad is?

715
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,867
You should've asked me. It isn't a secret.

716
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:08,472
Anyways, let's get out of here

717
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,309
and get some drinks.

718
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:17,681
Jeez, you're always pretending
to be so cool!

719
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,650
I am cool.

720
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,720
Anyways, I'm sure everything
will turn out fine.

721
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,459
You're okay, right?

722
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:37,835
You know what?
I hate the lights on your campus.

723
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,738
Why do they keep it so bright at night?

724
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:45,776
Byeol, isn't there a place
a little more private on campus?

725
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:51,381
They say that no one's in the laboratory.

726
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:56,987
I'm sick of the laboratory.
Pack everything quickly.

727
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,659
Follow me. Run!

728
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:44,234
I'll get you a warm glass of milk
if you can't sleep.

729
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,641
I'm just a little tense
about the upcoming exhibit.

730
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,543
I just can't concentrate on my work.

731
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,213
Yoo-joo.

732
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,183
I couldn't ask for more.

733
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,954
You're mine and always by my side,

734
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,324
and we both have jobs that we love.

735
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,394
There's nothing more I could want.

736
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,399
Really?

737
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,436
Would it be greedy to wish for more?

738
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,840
Let's stop going to the hospital.

739
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:29,012
I don't want your body
to get weak because of that.

740
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,352
-Should we go on a trip tomorrow?
-Tomorrow?

741
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,922
You're busy, right?

742
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,024
Then forget it. I'll go by myself.

743
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,026
Jeez, you shouldn't go by yourself.

744
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,995
Let's go together after I'm done
with my project.

745
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:47,130
No. It's fine. I want to go alone.

746
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,166
Where are you going?

747
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,769
Come here.

748
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:53,971
Let's sleep.

749
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:54,972
You can't go.

750
00:47:55,906 --> 00:47:58,275
You can't go anywhere.

751
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,945
-I'm cold.
-Okay.

752
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,802
I am out right now,

753
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:35,772
-Please leave a message after the beep.
-Why isn't she getting the phone?

754
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,474
Thank you.

755
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,842
Hey! You stubborn girl!

756
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:44,414
Someday, I'll make you pay
for all the misery you've put me through.

757
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:49,453
Go ahead and study an extra year.

758
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:52,356
But only for a year and that's it!

759
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,325
Call me back when you get this message.

760
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,969
Koh Eun-chan! Come home quickly!

761
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,241
I miss you!

762
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:16,413
Come back soon!

763
00:50:19,216 --> 00:50:20,584
Are those the resumes for the baristas?

764
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,587
We decided to have an interview.
Do you want to go?

765
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:24,921
Nah. It's too much of a hassle.

766
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,658
-What the heck!
-I'm sorry.

767
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,093
Why are you here again?

768
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:31,294
I'm sorry.

769
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:32,462
What are you going to do?

770
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,331
I'm going to wait a couple more days

771
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,166
and see what happens.

772
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,071
I can't tolerate other people
touching my kitchen tools. Get out.

773
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,906
I just wanted to put them in order.

774
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,574
I'm sorry if I made you angry.

775
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,843
-Seon-gi!
-What is it now?

776
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,880
Can't you teach me how to make waffles?

777
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,416
How can waffles be this soft?

778
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,483
I'm not going to teach you.

779
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,352
Please teach me.

780
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,789
What the heck?
They're both speaking in Japanese.

781
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,857
You can speak Japanese?

782
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,626
I studied for a bit in Miyazaki.

783
00:51:04,094 --> 00:51:06,997
It feels nice to talk
with somebody in Japanese.

784
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,232
What are you two talking about?

785
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,001
You aren't talking about me, are you?

786
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,737
I said that you were nice. Are you happy?

787
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,605
Like I would really believe you!

788
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,283
I'm worried about running the cafÃ©
in line with the concept.

789
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:29,252
As well as the part
about having to be tied down for 2 years.

790
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,389
I'm thinking about running
my own coffee business.

791
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:35,125
Increasing your know-how working
at our shop might help you

792
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,394
when you run your own shop.

793
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:42,299
The pay is kind of less than
the place where I work now.

794
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,235
I think if you want me
to quit my job to come here,

795
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,971
I should get at least two times
what I'm being paid currently.

796
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,506
Two times?

797
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:52,275
All right.

798
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,612
The human resources department
will call you about the interview results.

799
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,647
Okay.

800
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,522
Excuse me! Sir?

801
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,158
Sir?

802
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,298
Are you done with the interview?

803
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:24,541
I'm thirsty because I waited so long.

804
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,714
I came for a job interview.

805
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,351
Hello, I'm Koh Eun-chan.

806
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:36,520
I came because I heard
you were looking for a barista.

807
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,122
I have a lot of ability.
Do you want to hire me?

808
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,494
Sure. Why not?

809
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,796
What about your resume...

810
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:49,599
And are you a man or a woman?
Can I see some ID?

811
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:50,734
ID?

812
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,503
ID? Of course. Hold on!

813
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,706
I left it at home.

814
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:58,341
But I assure you I'm a woman.

815
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,180
It sounded like that other applicant
was asking for double the pay.

816
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,582
But all you have to do is feed me.

817
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,751
Breakfast, lunch, dinner,
and a midnight snack.

818
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,619
Four meals are enough.

819
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:14,991
I'm good at cleaning, I'm strong,
and I make really great coffee.

820
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:19,429
I've even won
the World Barista Championship

821
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,964
and I'm a world class barista.

822
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:26,803
More than skill, we need someone
with a devoted work ethic.

823
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:32,709
I'm incredibly devoted.

824
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,346
And if you're really nice to me,
I'll even do you your laundry,

825
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,616
clean your place, cook,
and do the dishes for you.

826
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:43,954
You startled me.

827
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,389
When did you get here?

828
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,092
I missed you so much.

829
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:54,497
You smell great!

830
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,413
You haven't changed a bit!

831
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,928
Your eyes are in the same place.

832
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:26,930
Your nose is still pointed.

833
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,798
And your lips are really sexy.

834
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,835
My boyfriend looks really handsome.

835
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,739
How could you even think
about staying there another year?

836
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:39,342
I got dark circles under my eyes
because of you, you know that?

837
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:40,810
Here?

838
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,413
You were that disappointed?

839
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,051
Stop it! I'm hot right now!

840
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,420
Don't be like this!

841
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,057
I came back, didn't I?
If you keep this up,

842
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,659
I might just go back to Italy.

843
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,194
Are you trying to threaten me?

844
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,797
Even if you told me to leave now, I won't.

845
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,335
I'm going to stay by your side
forever and ever!

846
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,736
I won't leave you for even a minute.

847
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,176
Twenty-four hours?
Day and night? Every day?

848
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,881
Then we will have
to get married quickly, right?

849
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,851
We'll be busy preparing for the opening
of the Coffee Princess.

850
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,153
When are you doing job interviews?

851
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:26,056
Would the interior construction
be done by September?

852
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:29,893
I got an invitation
to a latte art demonstration this week.

853
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,294
I even got an interview.

854
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,332
The price
of Barista Koh Eun-chan will go up!

855
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,633
Don't change the subject!

856
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,535
I called your mom a couple of days ago.

857
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,637
I wonder if grandma's doing well.

858
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,341
Grandma! It's me, Koh Eun-chan!

859
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,876
I'm not deaf! Speak softly.

860
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,511
Hello, grandma!

861
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,416
When are you going to start working?

862
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,585
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

863
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,454
If you came in, you should start working.

864
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,122
Mom, you should let her rest a bit.

865
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,824
I was thinking about visiting you,
dad, and mom

866
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,525
before I started working.

867
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:04,194
I even brought presents for you.

868
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,662
-You're joking.
-I'm sure you'll like it.

869
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:08,164
Did I ever ask you to buy me presents?

870
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:10,200
Grandma, we'll visit you tomorrow.

871
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,901
Then I'll see you tomorrow, Grandma.

872
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,203
Goodbye!

873
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,209
She asked me to keep her return a secret.

874
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,277
But she's there with Han-gyeol.

875
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:23,413
Those two are giddy with happiness.

876
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,582
Her life expenses must have been tight.

877
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:29,386
But she called me multiple times
because she was picking your gift.

878
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:33,690
She's very thoughtful,
unlike the other girls these days.

879
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,526
When I saw her during a business trip,
she seemed very bright.

880
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:38,661
She's so affable.

881
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,464
You feel happy once you see her.

882
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,600
Just look at the two of you.

883
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:48,104
That girl put you under her spell
as she did with Han-gyeol!

884
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:53,009
How could you consider a girl like that
for your one and only son?

885
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,578
I don't think I could ask for anything
more in a daughter-in-law.

886
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:56,780
Jeez!

887
00:56:57,013 --> 00:57:00,850
Mom. I'll go make some delicious
curled mallow stew for dinner.

888
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,228
So, she brought me a present, did she?

889
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,307
What should I do?

890
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,309
What should I do?

891
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:28,678
What should I do?

892
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,151
Hey! My girlfriend's here!

893
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,520
My girlfriend's here!

894
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,655
Mr. Hong!

895
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:42,225
Look who is here!
Why didn't you call us ahead of time?

896
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,827
Have you been well?

897
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,028
My sweet Chan!

898
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,532
Oh my god! You look strange!

899
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,034
-What's wrong?
-You're a girl?

900
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,936
Come on. Stop.

901
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,071
Eun-chan!

902
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,140
-You look so pretty!
-Hey.

903
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,175
-Except you haven't lost any weight.
-Hey!

904
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,410
Eun-chan.

905
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,513
You look so pretty, Eun-chan!

906
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:04,714
-Thanks.
-Give me a hug too.

907
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,082
Eun-chan!

908
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,085
I want a hug too! You look so strange!

909
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,322
-Give her a tour of the shop!
-Okay!

910
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,023
Hey! Don't!

911
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,226
Hey! You'll hurt her!
You'll hurt my girlfriend!

912
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:17,794
Hey! Let's carry her around!

913
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:22,632
Stop! Put me down!

914
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,700
Mr. Hong!

915
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,597
Stop! Stop right there!

916
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,932
Come here!

917
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,818
YOU'RE HAPPY
BECAUSE YOU'VE MET A GOOD HUSBAND, RIGHT?

918
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:22,492
PERHAPS? BUT KISSES FOR YOU

919
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,135
What?

920
00:59:39,642 --> 00:59:41,110
Gross!

921
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,953
Please teach me.

922
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,288
You are really stubborn!

923
00:59:52,388 --> 00:59:53,790
I'll work really hard!

924
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,986
Could I get your cell phone number,
Ha-rim?

925
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,520
-Me first!
-Really?

926
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,055
-I'll give it to her first.
-Thanks!

927
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,725
You're so cute.
Do you want my home address too?

928
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:33,863
Hello? Oh, Byeol.

929
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,233
Some strange women were coming onto me,
but I stopped them in their tracks.

930
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,234
Don't worry.

931
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:54,617
I'm good, aren't I?

932
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,202
Oh, my god.

933
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:34,457
APOLOGIZE, YOU BASTARD!

934
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,434
-Goodbye, Coffee Prince!
-Goodbye, Coffee Prince!

935
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:29,539
THE COFFEE PRINCE IS CLOSED FOR TODAY

936
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,242
