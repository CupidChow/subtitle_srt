1
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:07,734
She arrived at the hospital.

2
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,503
She's all right. We'll go there
as soon as the ceremony is over.

3
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,474
I want to go to the hospital with you.

4
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,309
Don't worry about her too much, Mom.

5
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,148
Next, the bride and the groom will bow
to their relatives.

6
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,827
Can I have a glass of juice, Mom?

7
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,964
It's too late for juice.

8
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,742
Here's some milk instead.

9
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:01,988
I'll give you the deposit money
from this house, so get married.

10
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,758
What do you mean,
you'll give me our deposit money?

11
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,828
You'll need some money
in order to get married.

12
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,830
After you get married,

13
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,733
Eun-sae and I are going to live
in a cozy studio apartment.

14
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,437
I'm getting too old
to clean this large house.

15
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,673
I wouldn't live in such a large house
if they gave me one now.

16
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,008
Who says I'm getting married?

17
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,711
I told you, I'm not getting married
and that's final.

18
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,427
I'll stay here, so go home
and get some rest.

19
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,798
-Where's your dad?
-He's with your brothers.

20
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,604
I almost got a heart attack
when I saw your grandma collapse

21
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,373
in the restroom with a pale face.

22
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:59,946
I can't seem to prepare myself
for the eventual end.

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,149
Grandma promised to come to my wedding.

24
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,985
You know that she always keeps her word.

25
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,424
Maybe I should take my time
getting married?

26
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,092
I know you want to get married.

27
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,362
Eun-chan looked quite pretty today.

28
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,498
So what if she is pretty? I hate her.

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,401
Why do you hate her?
Did you two have a fight?

30
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,970
Why would I fight with her?
Nothing happened.

31
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,160
Yoo-joo.

32
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,798
My dear wife!

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,268
Honey!

34
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,637
Honey.

35
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,839
Honey.

36
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,209
Honey!

37
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,045
-Honey.
-Jeez! I'm right here!

38
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,384
Stop it. It's so strange
to be called honey all of a sudden.

39
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,322
I like poached eggs
better than egg omelets.

40
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,891
And I like laver that has been roasted.

41
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,660
These are roasted.

42
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,629
And I like my stews less seasoned.

43
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,864
I did that. And the rice is sticky
just as you wanted.

44
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,634
And I've even cooked kimchi stew,
your favorite.

45
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,603
Make sure to do the dishes
after you're done eating.

46
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,740
-Hey, aren't you going to eat with me?
-You know I don't eat breakfast.

47
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,576
Still, you want me to eat
all this food by myself?

48
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,614
I was invited to represent Asia
in a fundraising exhibit hosted by UNICEF.

49
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,050
-Today's our first meeting.
-Cool! Really?

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,119
-When's the exhibit?
-Mid-September.

51
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,621
We'll have our first meeting in Hong Kong
this weekend,

52
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,889
and after the exhibit starts,

53
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,724
I'll have to stay in Hong Kong
for about two weeks.

54
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,759
Why don't you come with me?

55
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,894
But the doctor said...

56
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,097
that you shouldn't fly so early
into the pregnancy.

57
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,300
We didn't put off our honeymoon
just because of my grandma.

58
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,035
It's also because of the baby. Remember?

59
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,503
I can take care of myself.

60
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,706
I'll call you later.

61
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,474
That looks delicious.
Enjoy your breakfast.

62
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,278
I'll see you later. Call me.

63
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,166
Why didn't you call me?

64
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,203
Didn't you get my text messages?

65
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:42,108
I texted you, like, five times asking you
to call when you had the time.

66
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,314
I even sent a final text saying
I missed you.

67
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,951
We need to talk.

68
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,304
I know I'm being too selfish.

69
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,442
So, what's your final answer?

70
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,381
I'm sorry,
but I can't marry you right now.

71
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,553
I thought a lot about why you would
want to put off the marriage with me

72
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,822
and if it's for economic reasons,
I'll help you.

73
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,358
I know
I've taken that problem too lightly.

74
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,760
It's not just because of the money.

75
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,895
I can do all of that on my own.

76
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,964
I just don't want to be a burden to you.

77
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,632
Jeez, how can you call yourself a burden?

78
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,834
Don't you remember
that you're the one who comforted me

79
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,336
when I was having a tough time?

80
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,538
Was I a burden to you when you were
by my side, comforting me?

81
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,440
-This is different from that.
-How is it different?

82
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,276
Because you gave me your heart
while I'm trying to give you my money?

83
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,148
I promised my dad.

84
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,749
I guess it wasn't exactly a promise,

85
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,218
but I want to take care of Eun-sae
and my mom on my own.

86
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,154
I want to achieve something on my own.

87
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:03,656
I relied on my dad when he was alive

88
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,892
and now that I have a boyfriend,
I'm relying on him.

89
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:10,730
I don't want to rely on others
without doing anything for myself.

90
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,198
I‘m not asking you to rely on me!

91
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,200
I'm saying I want us
to help each other out!

92
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,035
That's the same thing.

93
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,471
Why do you dislike getting help so much?

94
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,574
Then how about if I promise you
that I'll never give you one penny?

95
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,943
If I let you pay for Eun-sae's tuition
on your own

96
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,245
and support your family on your own,
will you marry me then?

97
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,816
Answer me!

98
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:33,286
Can't you just wait for me?
Couldn't you be more understanding of me?

99
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,289
Why do you have to always try to force me
to follow your decisions?

100
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,890
My decisions?

101
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,259
Didn't we decide together to get married?

102
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,661
Don't you want to marry me?

103
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,364
Hey, what's the ruckus?

104
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,800
I guess you don't.

105
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,605
Are you two planning to get married?

106
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,961
Is something going on between those two?

107
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:19,198
Han-gyeol seems to have proposed
to Eun-chan.

108
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,733
Jeez, he's so naïve.

109
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,468
I don't understand it.

110
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,036
Why is he in such a rush to get married?

111
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,639
They should get married
after they get to know each other more,

112
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:32,011
and they can communicate on a physical
and spiritual level...

113
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,547
Jeez, you think you know so much,
don't you?

114
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,650
Then why can't you understand
that those two love each other so much

115
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,386
that they want to live together
as soon as possible?

116
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,922
If they like each other so much,
they should just live together!

117
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,991
Not get married, for crying out loud!

118
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,727
Anyway, it seemed like Eun-chan
turned down Han-gyeol's marriage proposal.

119
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,796
Why would Eun-chan turn down
a good looking guy like Han-gyeol?

120
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,432
She should be thankful.
Is she an idiot or something?

121
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,669
An idiot? She's not an idiot, you are.

122
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,972
And why are you so interested
in Eun-chan's love life anyway?

123
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:02,475
It's fun to watch how
other people's love lives are going.

124
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,878
It's even more fun than watching a movie.

125
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,382
And that newspaper is there to be read,
not to be used as a weapon.

126
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,550
You little...

127
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,325
Goodness. Don't those two ever
get tired of fighting?

128
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,301
You don't love me enough
to marry me, do you?

129
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,870
It's all right. You can be frank with me.

130
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,139
Is your grandma very ill?

131
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,640
Is that why you're rushing the marriage?

132
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,577
I just want to live with you.

133
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,412
I want to eat with you,

134
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:41,747
talk with you all the time,
and sleep with you every night.

135
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,349
Is any other reason needed?

136
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,853
I'm not saying I won't marry you.
I just need you to wait for five years.

137
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,623
You're so selfish.

138
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,259
I gave up on my dreams because of you

139
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,961
and overcame family opposition,
but... Jeez!

140
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,330
Can't you just forget
about your pride for once?

141
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:58,531
How could you be like this?

142
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,867
Are you're not going to marry me even
if that means it's over between us?

143
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,469
Even if that means that
we have to break up?

144
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,239
Goddamnit.

145
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,946
Why aren't you asleep?

146
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,081
I got bit by a mosquito.

147
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,515
I think there's one in my mosquito net.

148
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,416
Me too.

149
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,653
What's with your sour expression?

150
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,488
Is it because of your boss?

151
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,156
Goodness,

152
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,459
why does that guy
only think about himself?

153
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,960
I really hate him.

154
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,163
Like you care if he breaks up with you.

155
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,400
Why are you getting so worked up?
Go in and sleep.

156
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,068
How can I sleep at a time like this?

157
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,004
How could your boss be like that?

158
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,306
He wanted to be with you
even when he thought you were a guy,

159
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,608
but now he wants to break up over nothing?

160
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,479
For Pete's sake!
Why is that guy so fickle?

161
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,614
He doesn't even care about our situation.

162
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,118
-Stop it, will you.
-How can I stop it?

163
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,920
He asked you to marry him
even though you aren't prepared at all.

164
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,555
As if his money could solve everything.

165
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,057
What a jerk.

166
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,863
It's obvious that if you marry him,
he'll treat you and our family like crap.

167
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,726
Hello. This is Choi Han-gyeol.

168
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,027
Hello. This is Koh Eun-sae.

169
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,396
Eun-chan's sister.

170
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,766
Eun-sae, Min-yeop's angel?

171
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,303
I need to talk to you. Can we meet?

172
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:46,939
-Right now?
-Not right now. It's late.

173
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:52,611
Then how about tomorrow evening?

174
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,280
Why don't you come to the coffee shop?

175
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:57,149
I can't because Eun-chan will be there.

176
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,752
You want to keep it a secret
from your sister?

177
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,488
Your sister won't be there
tomorrow evening

178
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,257
because she has a barista class,
so come to our shop.

179
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,492
Okay.

180
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:24,877
Two iced lattes.

181
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,879
Do you have a problem with me?

182
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,783
Why do you keep glaring at me?

183
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,885
Why don't you just tell me
what the problem is?

184
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,488
It's 'cause you've messed up everything,
Ha-rim!

185
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,990
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,726
You should have picked a better person
to coach you on your love life.

187
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,528
What do you mean?

188
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,331
Think about it. The boss has Eun-chan.

189
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,967
Mr. Hong has Mi-suk,
the woman who left him.

190
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,368
And I have Yuko.

191
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,104
But Ha-rim has no one.

192
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,873
How could you let someone coach you

193
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,508
on your love life
who's no better than you?

194
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:01,580
Hey, it's not true that I have no one!
The problem is, I have too many women.

195
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,952
-I want compensation.
-What do you think you're doing?

196
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,189
I lost my Eun-sae thanks to you,
so I want compensation for my loss!

197
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,129
That was actually fun! Try that again.

198
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,298
No-eul.

199
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,308
This can't be.

200
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,348
This can't be.

201
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,462
I think this is what's best for everyone.

202
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,531
Thanks for everything.

203
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,229
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

204
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,468
You're sweating.

205
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,680
This is why I told you to stop working.

206
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,850
But you didn't listen to me
and collapsed in a restroom.

207
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,386
You're driving me crazy, grandma.

208
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,821
How dare you say such a thing.

209
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,291
What's so wrong about me
working at my company?

210
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,195
It's never a good idea to hold the reins
of a company for too long.

211
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,798
Why are you here by yourself?

212
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:09,308
Where's that crazy girl
who usually tags along by your side?

213
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,709
I thought you didn't like her?

214
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,479
Bring her to me.

215
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,216
Your mom and Mr. Hong
seem to approve of her,

216
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,985
and I want to see
if she will really be all right for you.

217
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:21,520
Later.

218
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,490
We still have plenty of time for that.

219
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,558
Did you two fight?

220
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,599
Actually, I told you
that I was going to marry Eun-chan

221
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,404
because I was in such a hurry,
but I never discussed it with Eun-chan.

222
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,372
She's supporting her family

223
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,741
and she seems worried
about how her mom and sister

224
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,045
will get by after we get married.
I told you before, didn't I?

225
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,413
She's very independent

226
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,782
and she always tries to do everything
on her own.

227
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,218
I guess it's admirable.

228
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,789
Since it's not so great to have
a woman rely on her man too much.

229
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,925
She's as sly as a fox, that girl,
isn't she?

230
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,361
How can you say that, Grandma?

231
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,266
She must have an ulterior motive
in turning down your proposal

232
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:11,437
considering she spent so much energy
seducing you.

233
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,039
She must be angry because I opposed her.

234
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,743
She's acting like this in order to put you
and your family at odds.

235
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,080
She's not like that at all, Grandma.

236
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,484
Her family is having a hard time,
but she wants to support them by herself.

237
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,019
I told her I would help her out,

238
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,121
but she said that she didn't want
to depend on a guy.

239
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:32,124
She first lived relying on her dad
when he was alive,

240
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,728
but when her dad passed away,
she found that she couldn't do anything.

241
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,864
That's why she doesn't want to rely
on anyone else.

242
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,433
She wants to become a barista.

243
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,803
And not just any old barista
but a world-class barista.

244
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:50,376
Grandma, I really respect you.

245
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,611
What are you trying to say?

246
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,315
She's just a girl trying to survive
in this world.

247
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,853
So can't you just acknowledge her efforts

248
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:07,226
to survive in this world
without relying on anyone else?

249
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,562
Why do you have to twist
her intentions like that?

250
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:14,933
I should get going.

251
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:21,673
Why are you leaving?
Eat something before you leave, dear.

252
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,615
Why is Han-gyeol acting like that?

253
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:36,455
I don't think Han-gyeol's fallen in love
with a complete imbecile.

254
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,192
Set the food so I can eat it.

255
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,761
All that screaming has left me hungry.

256
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,897
I brought porridge, Mom.

257
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,533
I want rice! I won't be able
to regain my strength with porridge.

258
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:48,901
I better take care of things.

259
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,035
If I leave those two alone,

260
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,637
nothing will come out
of their relationship.

261
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,316
Hey!

262
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,719
Why are you acting so startled?
Why were you running? Are you late?

263
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,521
I just wanted to get
some extra studying done.

264
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,057
-Have you eaten?
-I ate some bread a while ago.

265
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,226
-I feel like udon. Let's get some udon.
-What? Wait.

266
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,198
Stop looking at me and eat.

267
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,833
I'm already finished.

268
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,704
Have you stopped being angry at me?

269
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,506
I don't know.

270
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,776
I wanted to visit your grandma,

271
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,215
but I didn't go because I thought
seeing me would only aggravate her.

272
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,054
I don't know why I had to fall in love
with a girl like you and suffer like this.

273
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,225
Hey. It almost sounds like
you regret meeting me.

274
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,962
Don't worry about my grandma.

275
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,564
She's just jealous of how close we are.

276
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:58,437
When I think of your grandma,
I think getting married quickly

277
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:02,207
is the right thing to do
and I feel like I'm being too selfish.

278
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,881
Let's go. You'll be late for your class
and I should be getting back to the shop.

279
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,382
Are you going to meet them?

280
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,585
-It depends on how you act.
-Don't meet those women!

281
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:17,489
Well, it's not like you're going
to be marrying me anytime soon.

282
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,264
Is your boss in?

283
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,633
I'm sorry, but we're closed.

284
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,134
Eun-sae.

285
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,039
Oh, the Wicked Witch of the East.

286
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,275
You're Eun-chan's sister, Eun-sae.

287
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,743
Where's your boss?

288
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,077
He should be upstairs.

289
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,784
Just look at her hairstyle.
It's straight out of the Joseon Dynasty.

290
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,221
-Shut up! Stop it.
-What do you see in her?

291
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,822
You're such an idiot.

292
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:05,437
I feel tense thinking
about what you might say to me.

293
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,374
Are you really going to dump my sister?

294
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,644
I wasn't going to say anything,

295
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,247
but I'm just so ticked off
that I can't hold it in anymore.

296
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,016
How could you?
I thought you were supposed to be

297
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,152
understanding of everything
if you loved somebody.

298
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,989
My mom wants to use the deposit
on our home for Eun-chan's wedding

299
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,557
and move into a place with monthly rent.

300
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,294
But how are we going to pay rent
when we barely make any money?

301
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,797
What are you talking about? Monthly rent?

302
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,534
Can you do me a favor and put off
the wedding for just one year?

303
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,471
I don't mind not going to college
since I'm not that fond of studying.

304
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,840
I'm going to get a job
as soon as I graduate from high school.

305
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,075
So please wait until then.

306
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:47,913
My sister is a really good person.
She would make the perfect wife.

307
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,682
She's strong, she's thrifty.

308
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,952
And even though she hasn't been
able to go to school

309
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,988
because she had to work,
she's really pretty smart.

310
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,325
Also, don't you like
my sister a lot, mister?

311
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,363
I have no plans to break up
with your sister at all.

312
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,365
Eun-chan has been so depressed lately

313
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,734
'cause you said that you would
break up with her.

314
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,104
I knew it.

315
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,408
You just said that to scare her,
didn't you? That idiot.

316
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,443
She didn't even know
that you were just joking.

317
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,712
She's so stupid.

318
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,981
Anyway, I heard you hate me.

319
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,685
-Says who?
-Says who? Everybody knows it.

320
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,323
That's not true. Even though I once
thought you were a jerk,

321
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,858
I wouldn't hate my own brother-in-law.

322
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,494
What? Brother-in-law?

323
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,396
I thought you were going to marry
my sister?

324
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:41,266
Yeah. I like being called
"brother-in-law."

325
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,268
Is Min-yeop giving you a hard time?

326
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,038
Make sure to tell me if Min-yeop
ever bothers you. I'll kick his butt.

327
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,041
Don't worry. I can handle him on my own.

328
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,777
Eun-sae.

329
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,248
I'm so sorry. I was wrong.

330
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,517
Please forgive me.

331
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,189
It's over between us,
so what can I possibly forgive you for?

332
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,593
Are you sure you don't want to be with me?

333
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,999
I like you even when you're mean to me
and I think you're cute

334
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:16,201
even when you're angry
and screaming at me.

335
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,772
I really like you a lot,
but if you don't want to be with me...

336
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:23,942
If you really don't,

337
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,311
then I'll leave you alone
and never call you again.

338
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,216
Tell me, are you sure
you don't want to be with me?

339
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,953
I'm sure.

340
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,057
Are you really sure?

341
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,992
Yeah.

342
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,632
My heart's broken,

343
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:50,202
but I understand.

344
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,504
Thanks for everything.

345
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,446
Have a nice life.

346
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,785
You bastard!

347
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:11,156
Why are you pretending to be so cool?

348
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,125
When were you ever this cool?

349
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,495
When did you ever give up
when I turned you down again and again?

350
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:19,731
It's just that there's nothing I can do

351
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,101
if you don't want to be with me.

352
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:25,537
You swore to love only me
but went out with another behind my back.

353
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:27,606
You stabbed me in the back
pretending to be naïve.

354
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,709
You're worse than the worst playboy
in the world!

355
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:34,946
Look at me.

356
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,115
Look at me!

357
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,521
Did you or did you not kiss that girl?

358
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,989
Of course I didn't kiss her.

359
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,825
I wouldn't kiss anyone but you.
I really didn't.

360
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,162
That girl did want to kiss me,
but I didn't kiss her.

361
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:54,166
It's the truth! Please believe me.

362
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,234
-Did you hug her then?
-I didn't do that either!

363
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,270
-You'd better not be lying to me!
-I'm not!

364
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,875
If you think you can love only me
from now on,

365
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,644
follow me or leave.

366
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:11,750
Eun-sae.

367
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,989
I'm following you right now.

368
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:29,067
I wanted you to know that
just in case you didn't.

369
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,544
Can I keep following you?

370
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:45,951
Put your hands on my shoulders.

371
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:54,826
-Hey! Let me down!
-Oh, my angel!

372
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:02,534
You're so heavy!

373
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,837
-I'll never cheat on you again, all right?
-You better not!

374
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,211
Don't do that! That's fine! Stop it!

375
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,615
Jeez, you can't even drink coffee anymore.

376
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,617
I feel so sorry for you, ma'am.

377
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,919
Then why are you laughing?

378
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,691
Is Eun-chan's family really that poor?

379
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:31,162
Why? Would you help her family out
if they were?

380
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,965
Is that what the girl wants?

381
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,836
She's at an age
when she wants to hang out with friends,

382
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,372
but she has been working hard
to support her family

383
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,474
without a word of complaint.

384
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,842
She works hard at everything.

385
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,646
She's a really good kid.

386
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:54,152
I heard that she wants
to become a barista. Is this true?

387
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,055
If she studies a little more,
she'll be a better barista than me.

388
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:01,960
If you ask me, she shouldn't get married.

389
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:05,230
She should go to Italy
and continue her studies.

390
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,466
What? Not get married?

391
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:12,037
You know I don't think very highly
of marriage.

392
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,271
I don't understand

393
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,473
why everyone thinks
that they have to get married.

394
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,376
People are so dependent.

395
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,714
It's much better to live life
to the fullest by yourself,

396
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,017
doing the things you want to do.

397
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:31,756
So that they can be dumped by some girl
after living with her, like you?

398
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,092
I don't regret that at all, ma'am.

399
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,695
Do you regret anything in your life?

400
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:41,700
I see that at least you've had the decency
to dress up before coming here.

401
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,602
This tie is imported!

402
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,503
Aren't most ties imported?

403
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,139
Where can I get a cup
of coffee around here?

404
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,078
The number you have dialed
is busy at the moment.

405
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:55,547
Please leave a message after the beep.

406
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,305
You're here?

407
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,909
What's going on?

408
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,245
This is my team for the upcoming exhibit

409
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,948
and since they weren't able to come
to the wedding,

410
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,449
they made a surprise visit to celebrate.

411
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,617
Have you been drinking?

412
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,321
You worked all night and drank alcohol?

413
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,825
I'm sorry. I was just finishing up here
and about to go home.

414
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:44,362
I'm used to your work coming ahead
of me by now,

415
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,665
but shouldn't our child
come ahead of your work?

416
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,433
Is that too much to ask?

417
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,070
Both are important to me.

418
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,571
Both are equally important to me

419
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,674
and I want to do equally well
as an artist and a mom.

420
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,876
Can't you be more understanding
and supportive?

421
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,277
How much more understanding can I be?

422
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,348
Do I have to stand by as you drink
and work all night long?

423
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,683
Is that how a husband should be?

424
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:22,000
What if I stuck to my decision
and put off the marriage,

425
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,103
but Han-gyeol's grandma
passed away during that time?

426
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:30,241
The boss would be so angry
and he would probably resent me, huh?

427
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,178
My head feels like it's going to burst.

428
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,915
What do you think, Seon-gi?
Do I seem selfish to you?

429
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,384
Yuko left me.

430
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:40,919
You mean the child's mom?

431
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,455
I asked her to let me stay by her side,

432
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:46,658
to let me see her, but she left.

433
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,993
She probably felt uneasy.

434
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,963
I thought I was helping her,
but it wasn't what she wanted.

435
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,698
I followed her here on my own

436
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:58,236
and I insisted on staying by her side
without any regard for her wishes.

437
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,207
I was being selfish.

438
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,609
So, what are you going to do now?

439
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,911
I'm going to wait for her,

440
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:09,447
even if it means I have
to continue being selfish.

441
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,249
Because I can't think of anything else.

442
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,992
Hello?

443
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:22,694
I need to meet with you.

444
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,596
Hello, ma'am.

445
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,366
I told you not to come to work again.

446
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,269
I'm here to settle my affairs
before I leave, you idiot!

447
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,939
You imbecile!

448
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,343
How could you fall so hard for a girl
that you let her boss you around?

449
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:45,550
That's not true, grandma.
She can't live a day without me!

450
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,865
What are you waiting for?
Come over here and sit down.

451
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,700
Hello, ma'am.

452
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,774
She says she'll marry you
after she's become a barista, you idiot.

453
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,544
This will be good for Eun-chan,

454
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,079
this will be good for me since I'll have
more time to accept Eun-chan

455
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,114
as your future wife.

456
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,650
This will benefit you since you only have
to wait five years instead of two.

457
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,586
This is good for everyone.
So, why are you so against this?

458
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,356
Only mean, petty men force their women

459
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:30,361
to give up their dreams
in order to be with them.

460
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:31,796
-Do you understand?
-But still, grandma,

461
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,999
why do you want to send her abroad
all of a sudden?

462
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,669
Why do you want to put her
in an employee study abroad program?

463
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,972
I sent Hong Gye-sik abroad to study.

464
00:30:41,372 --> 00:30:43,641
And half of my employees in
our R and D department are people

465
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:45,476
that I've sent abroad to study.

466
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,613
So, what will it be? Will you go or not?

467
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,916
I'm not an employee of Dongin Foods.

468
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,953
Isn't the employee study abroad program
for employees only?

469
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,957
Hey! You were screaming
about not accepting even a penny from me

470
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:02,060
and now you're considering
my grandma's offer to send you abroad?

471
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,262
She can't go abroad, Grandma.

472
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,631
She won't part with her mom and sister.

473
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,599
She hates Italian food,

474
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,701
she doesn't know Italian
and she doesn't know anyone there,

475
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,035
so why would she want to go abroad?

476
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,472
Answer me, Eun-chan!
Are you going to go or not?

477
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,375
Why are yelling at me?
I never said I would go.

478
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,511
Did you hear her? She said she won't go.

479
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,814
No, she didn't. She just said that
she didn't say she would go.

480
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:27,151
You're a third party in this matter,
so stay out of it.

481
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,289
I lost my parents at the age of twelve,

482
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,592
and I've worked all my life
to pull myself up by the bootstraps

483
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,628
and become what I am today.

484
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:38,963
That's why I understand your situation.

485
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,133
Your situation isn't likely to get better
anytime soon,

486
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,236
and your family can't live
their entire life relying on you.

487
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,405
So if she isn't planning

488
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:51,476
to keep you around forever,
she should find a way to support herself.

489
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:55,079
But my mom has never worked a day
in her life.

490
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:57,815
She needs to learn
how to survive on her own.

491
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:00,952
You'll be awarded a small monthly stipend
when you go abroad.

492
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:05,790
You can give that to your mom
and study, supporting yourself in Italy.

493
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,959
What are you two talking about?

494
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,796
Grandma! You're trying to separate us,
aren't you?

495
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,767
Would you two break up
if I tried to separate you?

496
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,303
Then, that's even better for me.

497
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:20,705
It's your choice.

498
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,941
If you come back after studying abroad

499
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,209
for two years
and you two are still in love,

500
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,078
I might approve of your relationship.

501
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,447
Don't be like this, Grandma!

502
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:30,782
You're not very healthy,
it would be better

503
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,784
if I could give you great-grandchildren...

504
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,786
Don't pretend this is because of me!

505
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,821
I know it's
because you don't think you can bear it.

506
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,023
Even the doctor said I was fine!

507
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,460
He said that my white blood cell count
couldn't be any better!

508
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,176
Hey! You said you couldn't marry me

509
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,844
because of your family's
financial situation,

510
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,346
but I guess you want to study abroad.

511
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,914
Think whatever you want.

512
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,284
Hey! Answer me!
Are you really going to go?

513
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,752
I'm not going, okay!

514
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,187
I'm in no position to study abroad.

515
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,289
Even if I decide to go,
it will be at my expense. Happy?

516
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,893
It's hard enough not seeing her
for even a day.

517
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,795
How could I wait for her for two years?

518
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,818
-Hi, mom.
-Hi, dear. Has everyone gone home?

519
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,321
Of course. It's pretty late right now.
What's that?

520
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,357
You said you would be staying here
until late tonight,

521
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,493
so I brought you something to eat.

522
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:51,662
Cool! Mom, this is something I made.
Try it.

523
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:55,566
This is so pretty! So you made this?

524
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,568
It says "I love you."

525
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,943
Be frank with me.
You want to go study abroad, don't you?

526
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,280
-Frankly?
-Yeah.

527
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,252
A little when the chairwoman
first brought it up.

528
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,287
A little or a lot?

529
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,824
A lot, to be frank with you.

530
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:21,926
But that was only for a moment

531
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,662
because I would have to be away
from you and Eun-sae if I went.

532
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,098
Is it because of me?

533
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,670
If it's because of me, you should go.

534
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,874
Frankly, I've never worked because you

535
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,446
never made it necessary for me to work,

536
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,881
but I can support myself.

537
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:45,983
You can support yourself?

538
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:47,985
How?

539
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:50,021
You may not know this,

540
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,491
but widows who raise their children
on their own develop inner strength.

541
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:57,728
If I had to support myself, I could.

542
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:05,036
So you should go if your boyfriend
is all right with it.

543
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,106
I'm not going.

544
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,374
And if I do decide to go,
it will be after you get married.

545
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,909
What are you talking about?

546
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:14,779
-To Mister Gu.
-What do you mean?

547
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,248
Mr. Gu is just a good neighbor
and nothing more to me.

548
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,050
Is that so? Then, why are you blushing?

549
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,552
-I'm not blushing!
-Right here!

550
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,588
How can you tease your own mom like that?

551
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,059
Didn't you say
that if a man asks you to marry him,

552
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,827
you should just pretend
to give in and marry him?

553
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,663
So, you should just marry Mr. Gu
if he proposes.

554
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,968
It's about time
that you lived your own life

555
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,971
and not worry about me and Eun-sae.

556
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,873
For once in my life,

557
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,244
I want to see you live your life freely,

558
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:49,714
doing what you want,
unhindered by considerations...

559
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:53,284
for me and your sister.

560
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,556
I'll get you some water.

561
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,008
What are your dreams, Eun-chan?

562
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:23,514
I think my dream is to live happily
with my mom and sister.

563
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,717
But now, I want to become a barista.

564
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:31,088
I finally have a dream
and I want to keep trying to the end.

565
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,210
CHOI HAN-SUNG

566
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,179
My feelings were hurt
because she drove me half mad

567
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,417
when I asked her to marry me
by saying that she didn't want my help.

568
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,753
But then, she considered it when grandma
offered to send her to study abroad.

569
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,456
Eun-chan's still young

570
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,858
and there are a lot of things
she wants to do.

571
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,696
I'm sure there are a lot of things she had
to give up in order to be with you.

572
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,331
I've given up a lot of things too!

573
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,967
I gave up going to New York and I even
overcame my parents' opposition!

574
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,904
I don't know why I'm being like this.

575
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:21,872
What did you really give up?

576
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:26,110
You gave up going to New York
because of Eun-chan?

577
00:37:26,944 --> 00:37:29,080
You didn't go because you like
running the coffee shop, right?

578
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,648
You shouldn't say that.

579
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,287
But I guess I'm in no position
to say this to you.

580
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,722
Why?

581
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:42,193
I drink all night long
and work all night long all the time,

582
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,496
but when Yoo-joo stayed out
all night working,

583
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,300
I got so angry that I almost told her
to quit her work.

584
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,902
I guess this is why women
don't want to get married.

585
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,905
Do you remember what you said to me
a long time ago?

586
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,609
That I shouldn't try to tame Yoo-joo?

587
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,610
Yeah.

588
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,179
But I think all men try
to tame their women.

589
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,549
The moment you think
that a woman is your woman,

590
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,752
you want her to live her life
according to your wishes.

591
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,554
Even if you've decided to be with a girl,

592
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,157
that doesn't give you the right
to control her life.

593
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,795
-I wish I could control Eun-chan's life.
-You too?

594
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,798
Same here.

595
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,836
But why is it so difficult to do?

596
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,907
Good morning, everyone.

597
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,075
-Hey.
-Hello, boss.

598
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,917
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

599
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,586
It's all dark. Are you sick?

600
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,255
She stayed up all night blending coffees.

601
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,692
She had like 200 cups of coffee.

602
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,428
That's why they say
that coffee is a lot like love.

603
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:54,865
Hey. Why did you stay up all night long?

604
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,470
You did this to show me, didn't you?

605
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,139
How could you stab me
in the back like this?

606
00:39:03,307 --> 00:39:04,709
What are you talking about?

607
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:07,044
I know you put on a show
because you want to go study abroad.

608
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,247
Why would I put on a show?

609
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,317
I was just studying how to blend coffees.

610
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,752
You're so petty.

611
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,788
Me, petty? You're as stubborn as a mule.

612
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,524
See? You are petty.

613
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,562
Just look at you. You look like a panda.
You're so stubborn.

614
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,299
I missed you.

615
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,703
I don't know if she's stupid or naïve,

616
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,173
but my face was like ten inches from hers
and closing in rapidly when she says,

617
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:39,944
"Let's just be friends, Ha-rim."

618
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,413
She said that she didn't want
to become involved with me

619
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,849
because I seem like a playboy!

620
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,350
I guess she doesn't like you.

621
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:52,056
Hey. How could you be so blind
as to what a fellow girl is thinking?

622
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,159
The problem isn't that
she doesn't like me,

623
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,761
it's that she likes me too much.

624
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,763
The way she looked up at me
with her big round eyes,

625
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:02,733
she seemed to be saying,
"Kiss me, Ha-rim!"

626
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,835
And at that moment,
my heart began to pound!

627
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,105
Hey. What are you doing, putting
your arm around my girl's shoulders?

628
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,876
Hey. Follow me.

629
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:18,349
I'm not going abroad. I don't want to.

630
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,551
As a matter of fact,

631
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,753
I was just about to call your grandma
to tell her my decision.

632
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:23,988
Why don't you want to?

633
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,490
There are a hundred different reasons
that I don't want to go.

634
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:32,296
But don't you really want to go
despite those hundred different reasons?

635
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:39,136
I don't want to send you away either.

636
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:43,974
I wouldn't want to work here
without you around,

637
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,077
and I don't even want to think
about not being able to see you.

638
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,282
Part of the reason
that I didn't go to New York

639
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,951
was because I didn't want
to be away from you.

640
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:56,053
So, why would I want you to go?

641
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:59,390
But I want you to broaden your horizons.

642
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:04,628
If you go, you'll be able to study
to your heart's content.

643
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,332
But I don't want to be apart from you.

644
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,501
I won't be able to see you if I go.

645
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,269
Why wouldn't you be able to see me?

646
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:13,838
It's not like you're going to the moon.

647
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:15,306
I'll visit you in Italy.

648
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:24,348
I don't want you to give up your dreams
because of me.

649
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:31,121
I want to support you
so you can develop and better yourself.

650
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:35,125
Do you really want me to go?

651
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:41,899
Look at me.

652
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,070
No. Why should I? You're leaving anyway.

653
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,040
You must really want me to go

654
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,376
since you don't even
want to look at my face.

655
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:57,181
I've realized that I can't be
the one responsible for your life.

656
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:01,519
But it's all right because I can
cheer you on from the sidelines.

657
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,891
Although we'll be apart
for the time being, later on,

658
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,160
when you make your first batch of kimchi,

659
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:12,863
when you hold our first child,

660
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:15,232
when you go to your first PTA meeting

661
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,270
and at our children's weddings...

662
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,578
It's a lot more difficult to propose
than I thought.

663
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,983
Hey, call your mom
and tell her I'm coming over.

664
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:34,952
What?

665
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:38,822
I should introduce myself to her formally
before you leave.

666
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:41,692
Just remember, I'll kill you
if you cheat on me over there.

667
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,508
I won't cheat on you.

668
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,085
Hey, Han-sung.

669
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,821
Hey. Where are you?
Are you still at your studio?

670
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,756
No. I'm home.

671
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,124
Are you done working?

672
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,060
Yeah. Will you be done soon?

673
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:53,297
It sounds somebody wants me
to come back home early.

674
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:55,165
It would be nice if you would.

675
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,235
This is my subtle way of nagging you.

676
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,371
Come out. Let's go out
for dinner together.

677
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,873
I've already prepared a delicious dinner,
so come home quickly.

678
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,841
Really?

679
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,943
So you've already prepared dinner?

680
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,513
Okay.

681
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,883
Your wish is my command.
I'll come home early tonight. Bye.

682
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:19,189
Honey, I'm home!

683
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:21,492
Hey!

684
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,929
-What's that?
-Why are you acting so surprised?

685
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:27,831
You didn't think I could
make kimchi, did you?

686
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:32,469
So, this is how it feels to be married.

687
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:36,206
-You're looking like a real wife today.
-Yes.

688
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,742
Hey! So if I have kimchi
on my hands, I'm a wife,

689
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,744
and if I have paint on my hands, I'm not?

690
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,147
Exactly. You would just be my girlfriend,
not my wife.

691
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,250
So is this all there is to eat?
Nothing else?

692
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,018
Of course not. I've already
cooked the rice.

693
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:50,087
Today's dinner will consist
of piping hot rice

694
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:51,188
and fresh radish kimchi.

695
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:52,189
Try it.

696
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,494
What do you think?

697
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,932
It's good, but it tastes a little strange,

698
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:05,002
as if it's missing an ingredient.

699
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,138
Actually, I think it's missing
a couple of ingredients.

700
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,747
You're right. But what?

701
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,351
At least it has a nice color to it. Right?

702
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,590
Of course, it does. An artist made it.

703
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,828
You're so great.

704
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,529
How did your grandma,

705
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,331
mom and dad all decide
to send Eun-chan abroad?

706
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:37,134
I guess it's all sunshine
and roses for you from now on.

707
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:38,569
Stop it, will you?

708
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,871
You've made the right decision.

709
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:45,642
I can't believe that not only will you
be furthering your studies,

710
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:47,978
but you'll be studying abroad!

711
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:54,251
I'm so grateful I don't know what to say.

712
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:56,086
It's nothing, ma'am.

713
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:04,128
Eun-chan's going to study abroad.
You're so lucky.

714
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:06,864
You're the best brother-in-law
in the whole wide world.

715
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,166
Thank you, sister-in-law.

716
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,270
Brother-in-law? Sister-in-law?
Are you guys playing around?

717
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:16,640
Why? Are you jealous because we're close?

718
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,912
So, when do you plan on getting married?

719
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:24,148
As soon as Eun-chan returns from...

720
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,455
Ma'am, I should have asked you this
a long time ago,

721
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,890
but it's better late than never.

722
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,424
I would like to ask your permission

723
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:38,362
to be your daughter's boyfriend
and potential future husband.

724
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:43,801
You really don't need to ask me
for my permission.

725
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,236
From what I hear, they didn't
need your permission

726
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:49,907
-to do everything that a couple does.
-We didn't do anything.

727
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,077
Do you need any spending money, Eun-sae?

728
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:55,979
Here's a little something for you.

729
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,282
So this is why it's so nice
to have a brother-in-law!

730
00:46:58,348 --> 00:46:59,583
What do you think you're doing?

731
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,152
I guess they really have done everything.

732
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:06,890
She's such a problem child.
She's completely different from Eun-chan.

733
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:14,264
You already seem at ease around my family.

734
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,436
-Drink up.
-Yes, ma'am.

735
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:28,312
Cool. So this is your room? It's so small.

736
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,180
It's not that small.

737
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,648
It's not like I play soccer in here.

738
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:32,816
Take a seat.

739
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,820
So, where do you usually sleep?

740
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,623
I sometimes sleep here
and sometimes I sleep over there.

741
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,065
Take a look at this.

742
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,434
I've set up the robots you gave me there.

743
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,537
This is the one you made for me
in the very beginning.

744
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,139
So you even have this one?

745
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,508
I fall asleep hugging it every night.

746
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,611
Really? How?

747
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,482
Like this.

748
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,620
Lucky robot.

749
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:16,593
By the way, when Italian men tell women
that they're pretty and that they're sexy,

750
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,196
they're usually just being polite,
so don't let it go to your head.

751
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,500
I already miss you.

752
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:27,304
How did I ever get like this?

753
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:34,378
-You have to call me every day, okay?
-Okay. Thanks.

754
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:08,612
What do you think you're doing
putting your hand up my shirt like that?

755
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,649
Why? Can't I?

756
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,787
That's not it.

757
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,022
My hand seemed to have slipped
from your shoulder.

758
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:20,157
Liar.

759
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,626
Why can't we do anything except kiss?

760
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,062
-My mom will hear us!
-Don't touch me!

761
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,632
You better not lay
a finger on me from now on.

762
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:30,701
Why are you acting so angry?

763
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,470
You're the one who tried to fondle me.

764
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:37,441
My hand just slipped, that's all.

765
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,452
I'm sorry I'm late.

766
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,988
Why did the chairwoman want to see you?

767
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:53,323
She doesn't want me to quit the company

768
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,359
after they've paid
for my schooling like you did,

769
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,595
so she made me sign a contract.

770
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:02,366
Make sure to learn all you can
and teach me when you come back.

771
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,736
My Chan!

772
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,904
I met Byeol yesterday.

773
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:09,973
I guess things are going well with her.

774
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,210
Byeol is so in love with me.

775
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,813
She said she would even believe me
if I told her that the moon was the sun.

776
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:21,451
Why, just yesterday,
I played a joke on her with my cell phone.

777
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:26,823
I told her that you could recharge
my cell phone

778
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,125
by holding it up to the sunlight.

779
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:31,828
That it would recharge from the energy

780
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,697
of the sun and she stood there

781
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:37,501
for an entire hour holding
my cell phone up to the sun.

782
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,436
Isn't she just adorable?

783
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:43,240
-Don't you think she's a little stupid?
-She's fun to be with.

784
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,345
Now, maybe I should give the regular
I was seeing a call?

785
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,981
I know. I'll call Min-ji today.

786
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,419
-You're here!
-Hey!

787
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:57,521
Oh, jeez.

788
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,023
Are you so busy
that you can't even talk to me?

789
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,859
I'm busy making the preparations
to send you abroad.

790
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,996
-You're sweating!
-Hey! Don't touch me!

791
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,266
Jeez, are you still angry at me
because of what happened in my room?

792
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:10,300
So petty.

793
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,670
Still? What happened in your room
really hurt my feelings.

794
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,907
You made me feel like some animal!
Don't you dare come near me.

795
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:19,276
-What if I do?
-I'm not kidding.

796
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,111
You're so cute.
Maybe, I should just jump onto you.

797
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:23,647
Hey! Take one more step
and I'll kiss you to death!

798
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,917
Kiss me? I heard that they kiss
as a greeting in Italy.

799
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,385
I'll practice kissing a lot

800
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,520
and greet everyone I see there
with a kiss.

801
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:32,756
Are you trying to tick me off on purpose?

802
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:33,890
How did you know?

803
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,267
This is Ha-rim.

804
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,571
I'm going to be getting off of work
pretty soon, so wait for me

805
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:52,676
in front of that convenience store
where we usually meet.

806
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,046
I don't think I can see you today, Ha-rim.

807
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,781
Really?

808
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,486
Come to think of it, I'm busy too.

809
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,187
Anyway, why? Is something wrong?

810
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,723
Not really.

811
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,026
I'm just out drinking
with a few friends from school.

812
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:13,797
What? Friends? Are there male friends too?

813
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,566
Yeah. Three of them.

814
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,468
-Hey! Where is that bar?
-What is she doing?

815
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:20,837
Hey! I think I'm near that bar.

816
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,206
It's the bar near your school, isn't it?

817
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,175
Ha-rim! My battery's draining.

818
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,844
-Hey! Hello? Byeol! Hello! Hey!
-I'll call you back later.

819
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:29,613
-Sorry.
-Byeol! Hey!

820
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,649
He's not a playboy. He's more like a kid.

821
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,918
But your battery's fine.

822
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,520
-No, it isn't.
-Hey.

823
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,356
Hey. Are you already seeing
someone else? Jeez!

824
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:45,495
Byeol! She hung up on me.
I can't believe this!

825
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,130
What's the matter?

826
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,967
It's the naïve girls
that really end up frustrating you!

827
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,435
I haven't even kissed her yet.

828
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,739
Hey. You better give Han-gyeol
some loving instead of making him suffer!

829
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,340
What did I do?

830
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,276
Hanging out with you as you smile
your naïve little smile

831
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,944
is probably torture for Han-gyeol.

832
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,914
He's probably completely anguished
about your leaving,

833
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,516
but all you've done is let him kiss you!

834
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:09,653
I can't believe how much
self-control Han-gyeol's exercising.

835
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,590
I wouldn't be surprised
if he falls ill later on!

836
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,459
I wanted to try
to get further with Byeol today,

837
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,061
but she's out drinking with her friends!

838
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,170
-Are you feeling all right?
-Hey!

839
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,307
Let me give you a massage.

840
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,242
-Don't come any closer!
-Come over here!

841
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:33,677
-Don't come near me!
-How is it torture if I touch you?

842
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,715
-You've hit a dead end!
-Don't come any closer!

843
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,219
Hey! I'm going to touch you now!

844
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,588
Don't come near me. You're dead meat!

845
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:47,524
I'm sorry! I won't touch you!

846
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,030
-No! Not my thighs!
-Wait up!

847
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:58,068
Have a drink, Ji-hyang.
I just poured that beer.

848
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:01,338
Thanks. I was in the mood
for a beer today.

849
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:05,342
Is it because Eun-chan's leaving?
Don't worry about it too much.

850
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:07,944
Don't worry about it too much.
You can use a videophone to talk

851
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:11,081
to her face to face,
and the two years will just fly by.

852
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:14,050
I'm just worried
because she's never lived away from home.

853
00:54:14,184 --> 00:54:16,353
You have to learn to stand on your own

854
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,021
and not rely on your children.

855
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,857
You can say that
because you don't have any children.

856
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,328
But you have me, Ji-hyang!

857
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:29,032
You can lean on me as much as you want.

858
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,502
This night

859
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,706
Which blossoms in longing

860
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:42,946
Is illuminated by the pink glow
Of the butcher shop

861
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,349
-You must be so happy, Mr. Gu.
-Can you tell, Mr. Hong?

862
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:49,753
You must be so happy, Ji-hyang

863
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:55,325
Love makes people happy

864
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:00,697
Is there anywhere you want to visit?

865
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,268
Of course, there is.

866
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,872
I've even made a list of places
where I want to go for dates.

867
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:13,576
The theme park, a baseball game,
a movie, the arcade...

868
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,845
Hey! They're all places
that are bustling with people.

869
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,681
-Isn't there any place that's quiet?
- Quiet?

870
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,449
Well, there's the N Seoul Tower,

871
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:22,519
63 Building, we could go on a ferry
down the Han River or to Cheonggyecheon.

872
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:25,989
Those are all tourist attractions
and they're not quiet.

873
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,526
Then you pick. The Palgakjeong?
Gyeongbok Palace? The Folk Village?

874
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,127
They're places that people your age like.

875
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,595
Hey, I'm not that old.

876
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,631
Then let's just go to the shop.

877
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,933
Okay. It was my mistake for trying
to take you out on a date.

878
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,868
Let's just return to the shop.

879
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:42,972
Is there anyone who would be
a good fit for the job?

880
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,642
Byeol would be perfect for the job.

881
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,345
Keep your love life out
of this coffee shop!

882
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,481
How about my angel?
She's really nice and really pretty.

883
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:52,816
We're back.

884
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,618
Weren't you two supposed
to go out on a date?

885
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,754
We decided to come back early.

886
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,224
They must have fought again.

887
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,160
Why do they keep fighting every other day?

888
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,663
Because they fell in love
through their fights.

889
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:08,631
Why are you all sitting there?

890
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,834
We're trying to figure out
who we should hire since Eun-chan

891
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,169
will be gone and you'll be busy
with the work on the franchise.

892
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:14,604
Do whatever you want, Mr. Hong.

893
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,909
Their relationship
is always so up and down.

894
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:25,715
As I leave

895
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:30,253
the Coffee Prince Shop.

896
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,171
I'll see you

897
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,543
in two years.

898
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:01,351
KOH EUN-CHAN

899
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:35,752
Are you sleeping?

900
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:36,986
MY HAN-GYEOL

901
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,158
No, I'm not.

902
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,401
What are you doing?

903
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:56,139
I miss you.

904
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,243
I miss you.

905
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,329
I hope to see you in my dreams!

906
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,606
Hey. My stomach's not feeling so good

907
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:32,709
and I think I'll go for a walk
around the block.

908
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,010
-You have a stomachache?
-Yeah.

909
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:35,712
-You? Who will believe you?
-Yeah.

910
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:40,717
Hey! Something smells fishy!

911
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,065
Boss!

912
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:32,969
Boss.

913
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,005
Boss.

914
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,778
Boss.

915
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,282
What are you doing?

916
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,084
I ran over here because I missed you.

917
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:50,887
What are you doing coming here
so late at night?

918
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,991
You shouldn't come to a single guy's home
at this hour!

919
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,794
Wait here. I'll go get my car keys.

920
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,696
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

921
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,934
Let's have a glass of wine.

922
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:07,804
Wine at this hour? Hey!

923
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:12,976
Don't go in there.

924
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,286
Why are you drinking so much wine?

925
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,754
Do you know what time it is right now?

926
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,956
I'm leaving as soon as I finish this.

927
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,524
Why are you trying so hard
to get rid of me

928
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:30,560
when I've only been here
for a short while?

929
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,363
A short while?
You've been here for an hour.

930
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,865
You were even timing
how long I've been here?

931
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,635
Fine. Just pour me one more glass.

932
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:40,103
For Pete's sake!

933
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:41,304
I'll leave after this one glass.

934
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,007
Promise you'll leave
after you finish this?

935
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:46,576
I won't stay even if you ask me to.

936
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:48,144
Just have a little more.

937
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:58,821
-Is this movie any good?
-I already saw those and they're no good.

938
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,057
Why are you yelling at me?

939
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:10,600
-Hey! That phone doesn't work!
-Hello?

940
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,169
-What do you think you're doing?
-This really doesn't work?

941
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:20,143
-Hey! Where are you going?
-This feels so cool!

942
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,815
-This feels so cool! This is nice!
-Hey! Stop it! You'll break my fridge!

943
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:30,153
A basketball.

944
01:01:31,554 --> 01:01:34,490
Don't! Don't bounce it!

945
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:37,393
Do you hate me being here with you?

946
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:39,395
I hate myself but not you.

947
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,198
Hey! Stop running around like that
for crying out loud!

948
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,703
Hey! You want to listen to some music?

949
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:48,438
No! I don't want to listen to any music!

950
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,681
What are you doing, reading at this hour?

951
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,349
What are you reading?

952
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:01,484
140. THE 5 CUSHION DRIVE

953
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,820
Why are you giving me
the silent treatment?

954
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,655
Do you still play with LEGOs nowadays?

955
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,691
Make me something nice
so I can take it to Milan with me.

956
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:12,028
Come on. It will take you no time
at all to make something.

957
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,731
Hey! Go back home right now!

958
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:16,966
Just one more minute.

959
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:18,901
Why are you being so annoying? Go away!

960
01:02:18,968 --> 01:02:20,269
Okay! Just give me one more minute!

961
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,004
Hey! Get up!

962
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,841
No! I won't go!

963
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,009
I won't go!

964
01:02:28,144 --> 01:02:31,414
I won't go!

965
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,182
Go home for Pete's sake!

966
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,919
Wait a minute! Give me one more minute!

967
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,024
Hey! My shoes are in there,

968
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,493
-Shoes.
-and I haven't finished my wine.

969
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:45,728
Shut up and leave me alone!

970
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,599
Open the door!
I'm not some beggar asking for money.

971
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,768
How could you slam your door
in your girlfriend's face?

972
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,304
Why is she bothering me like this?

973
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:57,874
Doesn't she even know
why I'm acting like this?

974
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,610
Hey! From now on, you're forbidden
from entering my home!

975
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:01,878
If you want to come here,

976
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:04,013
come here during the day
accompanied by someone like Ha-rim!

977
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,382
-I'm going to cheat on you!
-What?

978
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:10,219
There are a lot of handsome men in Italy.

979
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,822
I'm going to cheat on you
with someone who's taller,

980
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:15,091
more handsome, and smarter than you are!

981
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:18,494
I don't want to waste my life
being faithful to you!

982
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,397
Right now, I don't know
why I'm wasting my life on you.

983
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:25,434
Open the door!

984
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,405
Or I'm going to start showing you
how rebellious I can be! Open the door!

985
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:37,513
Hey! What do you think you are,
a teenager?

986
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:39,849
Wait here and I'll give you a ride home.

987
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:45,054
Hey! Don't you dare come in here!
Move your foot!

988
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:46,255
Jeez.

989
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,594
I'm warning you,
if you come into my apartment,

990
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,229
I'm not going to send you home tonight!

991
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:33,829
