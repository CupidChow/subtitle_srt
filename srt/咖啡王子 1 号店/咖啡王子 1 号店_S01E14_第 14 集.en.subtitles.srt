1
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,464
Eun-chan! Want to see something funny?

2
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,001
You're here again!
Here's a tomato waffle on the house.

3
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,870
-I don't want it.
-You don't want it?

4
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,505
Well, I also have this.

5
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,273
-I don't want anything.
-You don't like this either?

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,975
Then how about this?
You can have everything here.

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,877
You can have this, and this,
and even this.

8
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,445
I don't want it.

9
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:48,782
You're sweating.
I'll fan you. Fast or slow?

10
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,151
-I'll do whatever you want...
-Leave me alone!

11
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,453
-But you seem like you're so hot!
-I said, leave me alone!

12
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,264
How impolite.
Turning down such hospitality.

13
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,665
What's going on?

14
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,634
Ha-rim's been working
for days to seduce that lady,

15
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,369
but she won't give him the time of day.

16
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,972
You shouldn't think
that all women will fall for you.

17
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,109
-I like her. She has standards.
-Yeah.

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,746
I can't believe you said that just
because your love life is going well.

19
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:22,882
How far did you get with her?
Did you kiss her?

20
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,617
Or did you go even further...

21
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:32,192
Ha-rim! Eun-chan's listening!

22
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:33,760
Jeez!

23
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:41,000
Anyways, Ha-rim.
Mi-yeong is a little strange.

24
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,169
-She keeps asking me to buy her stuff.
-What did she ask you?

25
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:46,506
The day before yesterday,
sneakers and anklets,

26
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,042
and yesterday, a cell phone and a perfume.

27
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,579
My Eun-sae would buy me one present
for every three I bought for her,

28
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,814
but Mi-yeong just keeps on asking me
to buy her more.

29
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,217
That girl seems to think of you
as her sugar daddy.

30
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,451
I don't know.

31
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,787
All I know is that she tries
to bankrupt me every time I see her.

32
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,356
Hey! Mi-yeong? Who the heck is Mi-yeong?

33
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,592
I wouldn't believe Eun-sae
no matter how suspicious she was

34
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,760
that you were cheating on her.

35
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,296
So how could you cheat on Eun-sae?

36
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,764
Are you nuts, you bastard?

37
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,633
I was just trying
to teach Eun-sae a lesson

38
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,101
because she treated me so badly.

39
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,003
Do you know how mean she's been to me!

40
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,305
How could you cheat on her
even if it was to teach her a lesson?

41
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,908
I thought you were a good kid,
but you're just a playboy!

42
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,845
If you're going to see other women,
you better end it with Eun-sae.

43
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,114
How dare you cheat on her!

44
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,950
If you make Eun-sae cry,
I'm going to kill you--

45
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,352
Like you could beat me.

46
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,053
Don't you know how mean
Eun-sae has been to me?

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,922
How can you let your sister
off the hook so easily?

48
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:36,823
What?

49
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,259
Hey! Stop it, you two. We have customers.

50
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,228
So this is how you really are, isn't it?

51
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,531
Don't you dare come near my sister again.

52
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,933
I'll kill you if I see you
near my sister again.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,502
Eun-sae's not the only girl out there!
I won't ever go near her again!

54
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,603
Are you happy?

55
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,340
-Did I do good?
-Hey!

56
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,342
I think you've crossed the river
of no return.

57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,211
Are you all right?

58
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,647
What are you doing,
stabbing Min-yeop in the eyes like that?

59
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,815
And how could you corrupt
that naive dunce like that, Ha-rim?

60
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:04,751
Do something like that again
and I won't stand for it.

61
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:09,255
Just look at her stomp off like that.

62
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,424
No one would think you're a girl.

63
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,096
Ha-rim?

64
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,531
You fool!

65
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,333
SALES REPORT

66
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,043
What's the point of bringing me this?

67
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,145
Are you that proud of tripling the sales?

68
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,280
Did you think that
what you did would impress me?

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,417
Anyone with half a brain
could have done that.

70
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,321
I guess there's no pleasing you, Grandma.

71
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,923
Anyways, did you get to the airport
all right this morning?

72
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,559
The traffic was a little congested.

73
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,631
-Grandma!
-Let go of me!

74
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,699
I'm hot!

75
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,201
Stop fussing and stay still.

76
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,536
Huh? Let go of me!

77
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,575
I've always been a worry to you,
haven't I, Grandma?

78
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,680
It's normal for children
to cause their parents worry.

79
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,916
Your dad was even worse than you.

80
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,053
Anyways, have you seen your mom yet?

81
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:16,723
Not yet.

82
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,959
I don't think I could hold back
my tears if I see her now.

83
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,095
I'll see her later on.

84
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:33,973
Your dad's in his office right now.

85
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,578
He's in a conference
about starting a franchise,

86
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,879
and I don't think it's going well.

87
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,281
Why don't you drop in on him?

88
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,816
I don't want to intrude on his meeting.

89
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,818
I'll just hang out with you, Grandma.

90
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,188
What are you going to do now?

91
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:53,259
You've already tripled
the coffee shop's profits,

92
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,496
and you've probably been dying
to get back to America.

93
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,065
Why? Are you going to give me
another task like the Coffee Prince?

94
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,605
Maybe I shouldn't go to America, Grandma.

95
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,208
What? You must have really taken
to running the shop.

96
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:14,080
Are you really thinking about not going?

97
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:18,117
That made your face light up with a smile!

98
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,886
Do you really like me that much?

99
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,221
You mean little boy!

100
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,257
I guess you do.

101
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,036
I tried looking into it
because I've received a franchise offer.

102
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,773
But the market's saturated,
and the other franchises are too dominant.

103
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,575
We've conducted market research
on that ourselves.

104
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,278
Would you like to take a look
at the materials?

105
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,680
Me?

106
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,316
I don't think
I would understand it even if I did.

107
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:53,619
When do you plan to go to America?

108
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,624
I haven't decided yet.

109
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:02,428
The toy company in America offered me
a position, but I still haven't decided.

110
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,597
Opportunities don't come around too often.

111
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,268
Don't think about anything else.
Just think about what you really want.

112
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,039
Did you see your birth father off?

113
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,709
It would have been nice
if you told me a little earlier about him.

114
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,513
I was thinking about going night fishing
during the weekend.

115
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,782
Are you busy then?

116
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,051
Yeah. I'm a little busy then.

117
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,856
But we could go
some other time if you want.

118
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,663
This is the Kilimanjaro of Tanzania.

119
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,533
Four in sweetness, two in sourness,

120
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,734
one to two in bitterness

121
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,902
and three in full-bodied-ness.

122
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,871
I'm right! Right?

123
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,174
-You have to roast this lightly.
-Lightly? Okay!

124
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,976
-Kilimanjaro of Tanzania...
-How is she?

125
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,377
Is Eun-chan doing well in her studies?

126
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,514
Yeah. We keep getting calls
from the consulting company.

127
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,682
They said that you said
you should consider it.

128
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,584
Should we open a second Coffee Prince?

129
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,521
This shop is hard enough to run.
I don't think I could manage another one.

130
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,391
Let's go deliver beans, Eun-chan.

131
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:10,396
-Four in sourness, two in bitterness...
-What's she doing right now?

132
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,498
She's studying.

133
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,835
Hey! Aren't you going
to go make deliveries?

134
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,771
But I have to study.

135
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,840
Study on your own time. You have to work.

136
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,675
-Get ready to go out.
-She's studying!

137
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,444
Can't you make those deliveries
on your own?

138
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:30,416
This is the Tanzania Double-A Snowtop.

139
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,751
Say that again? Tanzania...

140
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:35,121
-Tanzania Double-A Snowtop.
-Tanzania Double-A Snowtop.

141
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,624
It tastes like tonic water
at the end of your tongue.

142
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,498
Let's go.

143
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,604
This is the Kilimanjaro of Tanzania.

144
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,808
And this is the Tanzania Double-A Snowtop.

145
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:57,944
Let's go.

146
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,446
But I have to study. Wait a minute!

147
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,948
Let's memorize this together. Hey!

148
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:09,055
CHOI HAN-SUNG

149
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,759
Sweeper!

150
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,762
Sweeper! How've you been doing, boy?

151
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,232
Hey! How about a duet?

152
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,805
You must come here all the time
for Terry to recognize you.

153
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,975
Hey! How many times have you
visited Han-sung's place?

154
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,345
About a hundred and twenty times.

155
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:35,081
Actually, I think it's more like
a hundred and thirty times.

156
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,083
What? For real?

157
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,851
-Yeah.
-“Yeah”?

158
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,420
This was part of my milk route.

159
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,755
Will you stop being jealous!

160
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,124
I'm not jealous.

161
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,128
Shut up, dog!

162
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,963
You're a male, aren't you?

163
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,798
Flirting with my Eun-chan like that!

164
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,008
Why do I always have to do these things?
Can't the men do them?

165
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,546
Just look at her.
She's already drooling over the meat.

166
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,849
You must really be in love with her.

167
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,951
You're grinning from ear to ear.

168
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,187
Yoo-joo, I'm so glad
that you're not my girl.

169
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,390
Anyways, where were you?

170
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,160
You should stop leaving
Han-sung like that.

171
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,462
-Even I'm growing sick of your antics.
-"Sick"?

172
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,966
-You've really changed a lot.
-I have, haven't I?

173
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,303
It's nice to see how happy you are.

174
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:31,904
Aren't you happy
that I'm leaving you alone?

175
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,239
A little. And a little sad too.

176
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,209
But frankly, you stopped having a crush
on me a long time ago.

177
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,312
You thought you had a crush on me,

178
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,781
but if you really did,

179
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,550
you would have tried to win my heart
even if I was Han-sung's or not.

180
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,386
But you never tried
to seriously win my heart.

181
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,889
Instead, you fell in love with Eun-chan

182
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,324
even though you thought she was a guy.

183
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,360
I thought about what I was to you
and I've realized that I was...

184
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,261
A habit?

185
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,463
Yeah. A meaningless habit.

186
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,833
A habit whose meaning disappeared
a long time ago in that sense,

187
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,201
you seemed really simple-minded,

188
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,537
like a scarecrow that's stuck to a post.

189
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,206
You're really slow in that way.

190
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,043
You really ought to thank Eun-chan,

191
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,846
since she breathed life
into that scarecrow.

192
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,249
You're a good person, Yoo-joo.

193
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,252
Frankly, I don't think
I'm a good person at all.

194
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,021
Even though I am on the pretty side.

195
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,626
You're so full of yourself sometimes.

196
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,995
I don't find you that pretty anymore.

197
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,631
Hey! Han-gyeol.
You better watch your mouth.

198
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,567
Put the knife down.

199
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,443
It puts me in a good mood
to see you smile, mister.

200
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,712
You seem happy, Eun-chan.

201
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,015
-Han-gyeol must be treating you well.
-Not at all.

202
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,484
He's always teasing me
and he never listens to what I say.

203
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,253
I don't think the fights will stop
until he goes to America.

204
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,655
Is Han-gyeol really going to America?

205
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,890
-When?
-I guess about 20 days.

206
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,226
Since he said he was only going
to work at the shop for 3 months.

207
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,828
Wow, it must be difficult
for Han-gyeol to leave.

208
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,264
He won't be able to leave
so easily with you here.

209
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,699
What if you start seeing someone else?

210
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,468
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking about seeing someone else.

211
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,303
Why don't we play some music?

212
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,439
-Okay. Choose something from over there.
-Okay.

213
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:15,975
Can you help me out with this?

214
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,911
-Can you get this?
-Oh, my!

215
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,014
-I'll take that.
-It's all right.

216
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,849
You two seem happy together.

217
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,351
Same with you.

218
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,554
Wait a minute.
What were you doing up here?

219
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,125
Let's live happily with no fighting.

220
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,695
-No fighting!
-No fighting!

221
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:52,745
Don't you feel sorry for me?

222
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,649
-No fighting!
-No fighting!

223
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,953
You guys look cute together.
They look cute.

224
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,588
So...

225
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,824
how did you find out?

226
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,058
Don't even ask.

227
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,993
You two were both in on it.

228
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,964
Don't you ever talk about how Eun-chan
conned me ever again! Ever!

229
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,599
Hey! I didn't con you.

230
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,803
Hey! It's better being conned
than being betrayed.

231
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,673
If you asked me to choose between
being conned and being betrayed,

232
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,541
I would pick being conned any day.

233
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,344
What do you think?

234
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,012
It's not like you didn't betray me.

235
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,348
Have you no conscience?

236
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,684
Do you want me to recount everything
from the very beginning?

237
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,286
There you go with that look again.
It's that self-righteous look

238
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,755
which says that “I'm the victim

239
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,492
who forgave you. I'm a good guy.”

240
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,195
Eun-chan, don't you just hate it
when Han-sung gives you that look?

241
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:49,435
That innocent puppy dog look
which makes you feel guilty?

242
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,271
I didn't know he had that look.

243
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,240
Hey! I wasn't going
to bring this up, but you--

244
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,075
What? You're going to talk
about DK again, aren't you?

245
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,343
Aren't you getting tired?

246
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,745
Stop being so petty.

247
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,415
Hey! You're the one who left just because
I developed feelings for someone else.

248
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,651
And why do you keep talking about DK?

249
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,319
Every day, it's DK this and DK that.

250
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,854
My blood boils whenever I hear his name

251
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,756
so don't ever talk about him
in front of me again.

252
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,491
-Does it hurt your pride?
-What?

253
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,426
You've got to be kidding me.

254
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:18,097
Do you call that joking around?
It's not funny.

255
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,765
You're shocking Eun-chan.

256
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,268
Don't worry about anything
and eat, Eun-chan.

257
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,436
Those two are just playing around.

258
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,639
And you'd better watch
how you act, Han-gyeol.

259
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,307
You'd better not hang around
Yoo-joo all the time

260
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,408
as if she were your girlfriend!

261
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,309
It ticks me off!

262
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,912
You'd better not hang out with
Eun-chan all the time either, Han-sung.

263
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,113
It ticks me off!

264
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,515
And Eun-chan, you'd better not call
Han-sung “mister” all the time.

265
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,750
It ticks me off!

266
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,389
-No fighting! Cheers!
-No fighting!

267
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,558
Oh, right!

268
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,927
-Your mom called today.
-My mom?

269
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,662
Yeah, your mom. Okay. Come closer.

270
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,598
She said she would come for a visit
in the near future.

271
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,834
Hey, why don't we just
visit her next week?

272
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:58,237
Okay. You got something on you.

273
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,240
What is it? What?

274
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,312
What's wrong? Let me see.
What is it? What's wrong?

275
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,219
Hey! Stop it!

276
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,655
Would you like another glass?

277
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,791
Don't give her so much to drink.

278
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,392
Why? She says she wants more.

279
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,462
Isn't she pretty?

280
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
She sure is.

281
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,585
So you really left your family and friends
and came all the way here

282
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,454
to a foreign country for a woman
who even has a kid?

283
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,222
Just because of a woman?

284
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,560
You're a lot more reckless than you look!

285
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,930
She worked at my dad's waffle place.

286
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,001
She worked so hard,
using her clumsy Japanese,

287
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:04,403
and I fell in love with her.

288
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,805
I finally confessed my love to her

289
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,174
after waiting for three years.

290
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,712
So, why did she return to Korea?

291
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,181
One snowy night,

292
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,450
I heard someone banging on my door,

293
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,486
so I went out to see who it was.

294
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,188
That woman's face

295
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,157
and body were covered with blood,

296
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,127
and she was crouching there, barefooted,

297
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:30,496
because her alcoholic husband beat her up.

298
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,667
She couldn't even cry and was shivering.

299
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,168
That made me blow a fuse.

300
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:42,341
At that moment, her husband came to me,
drunk out of his mind.

301
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:46,812
Wait! Did you run away to Korea
after doing something to that guy?

302
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:50,516
Did you stab him with a knife
or smash his head in with a rock?

303
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:54,653
He broke three of my ribs
and six of my teeth.

304
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,590
I've never been roughed up like that
in my entire life.

305
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,326
Didn't you hit him?

306
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,063
So, you just let him hit you?

307
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,166
Because I knew that he would hurt her
even more later on, if I hit him.

308
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,803
So, that woman came here
to run away from her husband,

309
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,938
and you came here in search of her?

310
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,240
So, during the three years you knew her,

311
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,942
you were only really with her
for two months.

312
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,044
And then you spent three years
chasing after her again?

313
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,448
You're another hopeless romantic,
aren't you?

314
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,618
But didn't you say that
that woman doesn't love you?

315
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,886
So, what are you going to do now?

316
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:30,756
Do you know how it is to be happy
just to be able to see someone?

317
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:38,397
Wow! I've never experienced
anything close to that in my life.

318
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,867
If a woman said, "Let's break up,"
I would break up with her,

319
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,636
and if a woman said, "Let's go out,"
I would go out with her.

320
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,972
You are so romantic.

321
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,307
I bet you're jealous of him.

322
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,342
Playboys are most jealous of lovers

323
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,911
who've been together for a long time.

324
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:54,313
Yeah, right.

325
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,218
You know, I hate anything
that has gone on for too long.

326
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,854
Anything that has
any hint of age whatsoever!

327
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,589
Don't you know that wine
gets better as it ages?

328
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:10,863
I thought that mister Han-sung
and Yoo-joo were fighting seriously.

329
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,132
And then they were laughing
like it was nothing.

330
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,801
I wonder if we'll be able
to stay together for nine years.

331
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,203
Why? Do you want to break up
after a year or two?

332
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,006
If that's what you want,
we should just break up right now.

333
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,575
That's exactly what I told Eun-sae.

334
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,379
Anyway, where does your grandma live?

335
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,748
Didn't you mention that
her place was near here?

336
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:30,983
Why do you ask?

337
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,653
Because we come by here so often
when we deliver beans,

338
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,755
and I just want to be aware of it

339
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,660
when we pass by your parents' place.

340
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,695
You want to visit my parents' place?

341
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,899
Why are you acting so surprised?

342
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,035
Is it really all right if I visit?

343
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,937
Why wouldn't it be?

344
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,573
Just think of it
as visiting a friend's house.

345
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,544
Actually, forget it.
It's too much of a hassle.

346
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,745
It's not too much of a hassle.

347
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,680
And I think it would be good
to make a visit.

348
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,015
When shall we visit?

349
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,984
-Let's not visit.
-Hey! Come on.

350
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,593
Hey! Come on!

351
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,141
What are you doing, Yoo-joo?

352
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,809
-Should I just leave?
-I'll be right out.

353
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:36,215
What were you thinking,
waiting until now to send that?

354
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,350
I asked you to send that a long time ago.

355
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,686
You're such a moron!

356
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,089
Forget it. I'll take care of it.
You should just quit

357
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,392
if you're going to be this irresponsible!
This isn't your first mistake, you know!

358
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,529
Just go to the studio, right now. Bye.

359
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,465
Who made you so angry?

360
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,502
What a jerk, making you angry like that!

361
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,337
Who is he? I'll go kick his butt!

362
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,574
What in the world
do you think you're doing?

363
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,909
Wasn't I exactly like Eun-chan?

364
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,810
What?

365
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,779
Are you jealous of her?

366
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,749
Yeah, kind of.

367
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,521
It must be so tiring for her to squabble
with Han-gyeol all the time.

368
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,055
She's so young.

369
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,025
I don't even remember
how I lived through my early twenties.

370
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,129
I'm relieved that I'm past that age.

371
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,499
Always waiting for the other person
to call first,

372
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,402
and getting angry and crying over
meaningless words.

373
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,337
Always wondering
whether that person loves you or not.

374
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,008
I'm still jealous of her.
She's so young and innocent.

375
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,644
Are you saying that
we're not young and innocent?

376
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,548
I've been feeling so giddy lately
like this is my first love.

377
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,916
I guess it's not like that for you.

378
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:49,521
I'll bring the car around,
so come out in a minute.

379
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,726
He was cheating on me, that baboon!

380
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,564
Hey, I'm sure he's really regretting it.

381
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,566
Anyways, don't meet him today.

382
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,534
I can't believe that he would do that.

383
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,070
How could he cheat on me?

384
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,640
You know how simple minded he is.

385
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,579
Tell Min-yeop that as of today,

386
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,614
he's out of my life for good.

387
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,416
Hey! You shouldn't break up
with him so fast.

388
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,117
Why don't you give it some time and...

389
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:23,488
Hey! You have such a temper!

390
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,658
Why is she so angry?

391
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,094
It's nothing, Mom.
Are you going somewhere?

392
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,762
-Yeah.
-Isn't that porridge?

393
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,599
Well, Mr. Gu has been sick,

394
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,902
and he hasn't even opened his shop
for the past few days, so I thought

395
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,204
that as an act of neighborly compassion...

396
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,074
-Neighborly compassion?
-Yes.

397
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,009
Don't just take the porridge.

398
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,277
Take some fruit as well.

399
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,012
-No. There's really no need.
-You really should.

400
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,915
I heard that Mr. Gu doesn't ever eat fruit
in order to save money.

401
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,416
Hold on. I'll go get the fruit.

402
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,921
CLOSED

403
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:59,291
Eat something. Why won't you eat?

404
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,360
The great Madame Sujata

405
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:07,232
gave Buddha milk through
which he reached nirvana.

406
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:13,138
And Jesus took wine and bread and--

407
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,742
Will you just shut up and eat?
Why do have to talk so much?

408
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:22,247
You talk too much for a man.
And why do you have to be such a miser?

409
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,616
You should eat when you're hungry,

410
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,251
and go to the hospital when you're sick!

411
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,788
All this money will do you no good
if you're dead!

412
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:36,528
Ji-hyang, I've given it a lot of thought
as I was sick and I've decided.

413
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:37,963
What?

414
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:43,268
I've decided to put my feelings
for you behind me.

415
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,971
I realized that it must
have been such torture for you

416
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:49,374
to have a chatty person like me

417
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,112
who pinches every penny go after you,
especially considering

418
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,716
that you don't like talkative men.

419
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,752
And I bothered you so much,

420
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,790
crying like an idiot,

421
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,026
begging you to go out with me.

422
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,863
I've realized what a buffoon

423
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,568
I must have looked like to you.

424
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,640
Ji-hyang, I apologize for everything
I've done until now.

425
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,544
You don't have to apologize.

426
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:32,050
It's a good thing that
you've put your feelings for me aside.

427
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,091
Slow down,
or you'll end up getting an upset stomach.

428
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,096
Besides,

429
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:48,867
I don't like men who don't talk much.

430
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,374
What are you saying?

431
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,275
As I said,

432
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,878
I hate men who don't talk.

433
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:05,517
I'll have to wash this.
This is all damp from the rainy season.

434
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,393
Like horses to Jeju Island,
Han-gyeol's going to New York.

435
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,662
Please look after him

436
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,365
and send him back to me
in mint condition. Okay?

437
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:21,533
High five!

438
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,769
Let's go, Eun-chan.

439
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,777
We only have Seocho-dong left, right?

440
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:32,711
Yeah.

441
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:34,880
You're so sweaty!
You're drenched in sweat!

442
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,016
You're right. Do you mind if we stop
by my place so I can wash up?

443
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,917
Yes.

444
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,419
-That's okay, right?
-Yeah.

445
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,922
-My grandma's place is near here.
-What?

446
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,291
Why are you so surprised?
I thought you wanted to visit?

447
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,493
It's only five minutes away
from here. Quick, get in the car.

448
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,033
But don't you think that
your grandma will be shocked?

449
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,435
She thinks I'm a guy.

450
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,038
It's all right.
You never told her you were a guy.

451
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,941
But still. If I knew we were going
to go there,

452
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,576
I would have at least changed my clothes.

453
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,512
Clothes? That's better than the t-shirt
and jeans you always wear.

454
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,714
For crying out loud!

455
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,318
Why do you have
to tease me all the time like that?

456
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,020
I hate you!

457
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,190
But I thought you loved me.

458
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,869
Hey! You're 20 minutes late.

459
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,771
Let's go.

460
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,506
I'm hungry. Let's eat something first.

461
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,975
I'm not hungry. Let's walk.

462
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,678
But I've already ordered.

463
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,614
Hey!

464
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,717
Are you sure you're not hungry?

465
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,420
I have to grab a quick bite
and head back to the studio.

466
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,058
Wow! Those are so adorable. Let's go in.

467
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:54,726
Why?

468
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,729
You go ahead. I'll be right in.
You go in first.

469
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:03,935
Hello? I'll be back in about 30 minutes.

470
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,381
I'll give the movie studio a call.

471
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:18,583
Yeah. Bye.

472
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,756
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY

473
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,265
We're going to have a baby.

474
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:46,778
Really?

475
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,547
He's sleeping.

476
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:54,152
Really!

477
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,711
Wow, ma'am! Isn't this a vacuum brewer?

478
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:20,946
Be careful or you'll break that.

479
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,547
Why don't you set that down

480
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,282
and take a seat?

481
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,354
How did you know that
that was a vacuum brewer?

482
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,222
Don't I know a lot about coffee, ma'am?

483
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,026
After Mr. Hong, I make the best coffee
at the Coffee Prince.

484
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:39,931
If you make the best coffee there,
the others must be pathetic.

485
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:43,168
But what else can you expect
from the idiots working there?

486
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,604
Ma'am! My coffee's really good.

487
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,274
I've been studying real hard
to prepare for the barista exam.

488
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,344
I know! Why don't I make
some coffee for you? Hold on.

489
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:54,913
Forget it. I don't drink coffee.

490
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:58,216
Ma'am, did you know that

491
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,852
if you drink coffee
with an egg yolk in it, it's nutritious

492
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,355
and it'll protect your stomach?

493
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,123
It's something I learned yesterday.

494
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,392
That coffee doesn't sound very good.

495
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,693
I would rather have a cup of tea.

496
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,595
Come on! You have to try it!

497
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:13,732
-Let me make some for you, huh?
-You're tickling me.

498
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,533
You have such slim wrists for a boy.

499
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,771
That looks so good on you.

500
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,409
I knew that would look perfect on you
the moment I set eyes on it.

501
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:27,012
You know I look good in anything.

502
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,116
I told Eun-chan to go wait in your room.
Go on in.

503
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,751
I'll bring this in after I'm done with it.

504
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,595
You didn't have to conduct
a memorial ritual for my birth mom.

505
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,632
That's the least I could do to thank her
for giving me such a great son.

506
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,570
I overheard aunt talking
during the memorial ritual.

507
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,740
Before, I'd bow before the altar
without much thought,

508
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,542
but afterwards, I couldn't bring myself

509
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:01,346
to bow because I felt
so guilty towards you.

510
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,586
So that's why you wouldn't bow.

511
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,256
You're such a good son.

512
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,497
You can bow from now on.
I'm all right with it.

513
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,735
I want to show your birth mom
what a great person you turned out to be.

514
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,282
He's so adorable! He hasn't changed a bit!

515
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,452
He looks so clever.

516
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:45,290
You look so adorable!

517
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,258
You little cutie!

518
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:51,162
What are you doing?
Why are you acting so surprised?

519
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,233
You must not have been
a very bright student when you were young.

520
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,968
I don't see any awards or trophies around.

521
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,204
Does it matter?

522
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:00,638
Come out and have some fruit.

523
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,775
Can I have this?

524
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,245
-Why do you want it?
-Just because.

525
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,582
It's not as good as the real you,
but it's cute.

526
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,320
You even have a little pot belly.
That's so cute!

527
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,394
Stop it!

528
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,367
You smell so good today.

529
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,678
It's so nice to see pictures of you
when you were young.

530
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,549
Let's get out of here.
Your grandma must be waiting for us.

531
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,920
You know, having my girlfriend in my room

532
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,556
with my parents and my grandma at home

533
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,191
is really exciting.

534
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,161
What do you mean?

535
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,929
You know full well what I mean.

536
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,330
Come over here.

537
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,568
Come on! Come over here!

538
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,071
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

539
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,874
Get away from me!

540
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,444
I love it being here with you alone.

541
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,513
Let's stay like this for an hour!

542
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,526
This is really exciting!

543
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,795
Don't worry. I won't eat you alive!

544
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,767
Why that little!

545
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,071
It's hot.

546
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,206
Why am I feeling so hot?

547
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,776
Are you crazy?

548
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,578
Why would I play cards with you again?

549
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:49,781
So I can have you trail me around
all day long again badgering me

550
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,718
to give you back the money I won from you?

551
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,754
But you were cheating along with the boss!

552
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,257
How dare you still insist
that I was cheating!

553
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:02,994
You've butchered this apple.

554
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,163
I knew you wouldn't
be very good at peeling apples.

555
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,232
You've wasted over half the apple!

556
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:11,236
No. Here. Eat this.

557
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,737
-I don’t want it.
-Have some!

558
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,372
-I said, no!
-For the love of God!

559
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,275
The way you're acting,
people might mistake you for lovers.

560
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,278
And of course, he isn't good at peeling,
he's a guy!

561
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,413
Don't worry about it.
I'll peel the apples.

562
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:25,283
I'm sure your future wife will love
the fact that you know how to peel apples.

563
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,951
She's actually a girl, Mom.

564
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,056
Why do you have to joke
around all the time?

565
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:35,526
And why do your jokes have to be so cruel?

566
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:39,497
How do you think it makes Eun-chan feel
when you call him a girl?

567
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,768
Ma'am, I really am a girl.

568
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,740
Oh, my! What in the world!

569
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,709
I thought you only hired men at the shop.

570
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:55,914
If you're a girl, you should have said
that from the beginning.

571
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,715
Not pretended to be a man.

572
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,884
How could you deceive me like that?

573
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,787
I didn't deceive you on purpose.

574
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,257
You must be so shocked. I'm sorry, ma'am.

575
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,993
Did you know about this
from the very beginning, Han-gyeol?

576
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,666
Of course. I hired her myself, you know.

577
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,470
Here you go.

578
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,947
Hey! Why are you eating the peel?
Don't eat that!

579
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,615
But I like the taste of peel.

580
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,284
-Spit it out right this moment!
-No! I like peel!

581
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,986
Spit it out!

582
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,357
You never listen to me
for crying out loud!

583
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,491
I didn't do anything wrong.

584
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,793
Here! Have some of this.

585
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,363
What in the world do you
two think you're doing?

586
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:49,300
Why are you acting so shocked,
Grandma? Relax!

587
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,836
I wasn't sure about her at first either,

588
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,107
but the more you get to know her,
the more adorable she is.

589
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,842
She's pretty, she has a great personality,

590
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,411
and she cries easily
even though she has a hot temper.

591
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,714
That's not true!
You're the one with the hot temper.

592
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,383
Are you two going out?

593
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,318
The way you look

594
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,355
at each other is strange.

595
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,757
Are you two involved?

596
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,962
Man, Grandma!
You catch onto things so quickly.

597
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,334
You're right.

598
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,636
We're seeing one another.

599
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,305
I'm in love with Eun-chan.

600
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:33,277
Are you out of your mind, you idiot!

601
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,779
How can you fall for someone

602
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,414
who I can't even tell is a woman or a man?

603
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,218
Are you blind?

604
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:43,921
How could you turn down
all the pretty girls we set you up

605
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:46,924
with and settle for a girl like her?

606
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,627
-Grandma!
-Tell me the truth.

607
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,964
When you first approached Han-gyeol,

608
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,068
you had it in your mind
to seduce him, didn't you?

609
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,803
Stop talking such nonsense, Grandma!

610
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,972
She didn't approach me for anything.

611
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,642
I'm in love with her,
so why do you have to cause such a scene?

612
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:08,312
Get that thing out of my sight!

613
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,114
How can you call her a thing?

614
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,184
You shouldn't call a person
a thing no matter how angry you are!

615
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,754
-You crossed the line calling her that!
-Cross the line, my butt!

616
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,756
How could you become involved

617
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,926
with a girl like that?

618
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,228
Pack your bags and go to America
if you're going to keep seeing her!

619
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,597
-I might not go to America.
-What?

620
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,668
I'll come back later. Let's go.

621
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,772
-Goodbye.
-Why you little!

622
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:38,042
You wouldn't listen to me no matter
how much I told you not to go to America,

623
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,679
and now you're not going to go
just because of a floozy?

624
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,615
Break up with her at once!

625
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:50,054
I hate my grandma!

626
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,657
Why is she being so impossible! Damn it!

627
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,562
It's my fault for looking the way I do.

628
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,533
-Damn it!
-Damn it!

629
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,208
-Damn it!
-Damn it!

630
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,946
What does she expect from a girl?

631
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:17,982
Long hair, a frilly blouse,

632
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:22,153
-a skirt, that kind of thing.
-I mean, women are all different.

633
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,489
What can you do about the way you look?

634
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,693
And I'm fine with the way you look.
So why is she so against you?

635
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,828
Damn! I feel crummy right now.

636
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,865
I feel crummy too.

637
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,100
I shouldn't have followed you home.

638
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,904
But you shouldn't have
acted so angry either.

639
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,205
It was nothing to get angry about.

640
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:43,641
You shouldn't have raised your voice
at your grandma like that.

641
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:47,111
Wouldn't you have raised your voice
if you were in my situation?

642
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,780
Could you be so calm
if someone called me a thing?

643
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,283
Would you be all smiles
if your mom called me a thing?

644
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,784
Would you?

645
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,686
You still shouldn't have
raised your voice like that.

646
00:35:55,753 --> 00:36:00,491
Moms and grandmas are like that,
because they want the best for their sons.

647
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,793
That's why so many mothers-in-law fight
with their daughters-in-law.

648
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,128
You don't know anything, do you?

649
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,898
Fine, Ms. Smarty Pants!

650
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,000
If you're so fine
with the way my grandma acted,

651
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,369
why do you feel so crummy?

652
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,405
Because the way she acted was so extreme.

653
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,509
Your mom wasn't like that, but your
grandma went completely overboard.

654
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:23,014
Maybe it's because she's a businesswoman,
but she was acting like a big meanie.

655
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,650
Still, you shouldn't call her
a big meanie.

656
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:27,919
And no matter how angry you were,

657
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,421
you shouldn't have told your grandma
that you might not go to America

658
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,623
when you obviously are going to go.

659
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,892
I didn't say that because I was angry.

660
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:36,294
I'm still thinking about it.

661
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:37,695
Considering what?

662
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,163
Whether I should go or not.

663
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,265
So, you still haven't decided?

664
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,502
Are you not sure
about going because of me?

665
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,939
Do I look like a person who gives up
his dreams because of a girl?

666
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,378
Then, why don't you carry me
on your back while you're considering it?

667
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,347
What?

668
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,950
I've carried you on my back so many times.

669
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:00,952
I carried you all the way home
and to the taekwondo gym.

670
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,487
And you were extra heavy,

671
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:05,489
because you were limp from the alcohol.

672
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,158
Oh, my back! It still hurts

673
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,293
because I sprained it carrying you.

674
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,028
And that's not all.

675
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:13,264
You constantly hit me on the head,
head locked me.

676
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:16,434
And I can't even remember
all the times you hurt me.

677
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,002
So, what do you want me
to do about it now?

678
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,672
Well, you could carry me on your back.

679
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,508
Why would I carry you?
I don't think so, you ditz.

680
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,477
Don't you ever call me ditz again!

681
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,512
You're the real ditz! You ditz!

682
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,781
You little twerp!

683
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:32,984
And I don't like
being called twerp either, you twerp!

684
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:35,419
You twerp! Hey!

685
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,391
Get on my back, twerp!

686
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:52,670
I'm only carrying you

687
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:54,505
since my grandma treated you like that.

688
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,475
I already feel better.

689
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,510
Then get off.

690
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:02,013
Wait! No! I don't feel completely better.

691
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:10,321
Anyways, do you think
your grandma will like me again

692
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,024
since she liked me at the beginning?

693
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,695
Come to think of it,
she liked me as a guy then,

694
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,265
not as the potential wife of his grandson.

695
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,273
Hey! I'm going to fall!

696
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:40,584
-Ouch, that hurts.
-Are you okay?

697
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,422
How much do you weigh?
Why are you so heavy?

698
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,090
I'm not that heavy!

699
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,695
This is no laughing matter, dear!

700
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:52,697
He smiles stupidly around her,

701
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,498
laughs at everything she says,

702
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:56,834
and his eyes light up,
like some crazy person

703
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,736
whenever he sees her.

704
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:02,273
How in the world could he fall
for a girl like that?

705
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:04,775
If you saw her, you wouldn't be able

706
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:08,412
to tell if she's a she or a he either.

707
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,783
And why did he say
that he's not going to New York?

708
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,519
What are we going to do
if he says he won't go to New York

709
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,289
because of that girl? Dear!

710
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,157
Be patient.

711
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,761
He's not the type of person
to make such a decision lightly.

712
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,797
Do you two not know anything
about Han-gyeol?

713
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,966
He's not the one to bring
any old girl home with him.

714
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,969
Even while he was growing up,

715
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,871
he never brought
a single friend home from school.

716
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:38,142
-Dial Han-gyeol's number for me.
-Yes, Mom.

717
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,983
How do you know that girl's not just
after your inheritance?

718
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:50,321
I could see that
she could be quite persuasive.

719
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,825
Grandma. She's only 24 and I doubt

720
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,528
that she's even thinking
about my inheritance.

721
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:59,897
Can't you give me
any credit at all, Grandma?

722
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,966
I can tell whether a girl is
after my money from a mile away,

723
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,734
and I assure you
that she's nothing like that.

724
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,269
Frankly, I wish she were a bit worldly.

725
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,271
You little imbecile!

726
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,373
How could you let a floozy

727
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,175
like that pull the wool over your eyes?

728
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,478
Mom, could you ask Han-gyeol if she's
the reason he isn't going to New York?

729
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,448
And what is this I hear
about you not going to New York?

730
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,150
Have you decided not to go

731
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,252
because of that girl Eun-chan?

732
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,953
When did I say that I wasn't going?

733
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,322
-I said I might not be going.
-That's the same thing.

734
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,224
Don't you play word games like that.

735
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,126
Okay! Fine! I'll go to New York.

736
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,262
That's what you want, isn't it, Grandma?

737
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:33,164
I'll go now. So don't worry about it
and get some sleep.

738
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,235
Hell!

739
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,642
Darn! I should have gone
there wearing this.

740
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,879
Grandma, mom, why don't you have some tea?

741
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,427
He's such a cutie!

742
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,796
He's brave,

743
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,899
he's strong,

744
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,135
he's healthy,

745
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,005
he's brave.

746
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,954
Mr. Choi, we've made the decision

747
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,056
to appoint you
as the head designer of Blockland.

748
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,451
What? It'll be fine
since you guys can video chat?

749
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:05,523
Wow! How can you be so cold-hearted?

750
00:42:06,123 --> 00:42:07,758
How can you get over
his leaving so easily?

751
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,827
Then what should I do, sob day and night?

752
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,297
Weren't you the one who told me
not to hold onto him?

753
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,201
So, why are you getting
on my case about this?

754
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,069
I'm just worried about you, that's all.

755
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,772
What are you going to do if Han-gyeol
cheats on you in New York?

756
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,909
New York is just full of gorgeous women.

757
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:28,412
All the women in New York
look like cover girls.

758
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,716
You know, they can work miracles
with pushup bras.

759
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:34,318
Why don't you try using one?

760
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,221
You look like you have no chest.

761
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,890
There's no difference
between your front and your backside.

762
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,593
And just look at your hair!

763
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,529
Do you use the same
barbershop as Mr. Hong?

764
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,033
And why don't you put some makeup on?

765
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,902
I guess you've been itching
for a beating, huh?

766
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,203
I'll give you what you want!

767
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,141
-Come on! What the heck!
-On guard! Hey! Make my day!

768
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,842
You're so strong! Hey! Let go of me!

769
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,111
That's no way for a girl to act!

770
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:05,082
-Ma'am! How are you doing?
-Hello.

771
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,384
Let's just leave, Mom.

772
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,986
We don't know how things will turn out,

773
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:11,589
and I think this will only
make the situation worse.

774
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,824
Plus, Han-gyeol
won't like it when he hears this.

775
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,593
Why are you so worried

776
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,061
about what your son will and won't like?

777
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,364
I need to talk to you.

778
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,306
We have a good chance of succeeding
with this franchise strategy.

779
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,141
I like your plans even better.

780
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,945
Father, I've been thinking
about remaining in Korea.

781
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,882
Frankly, I've found that I enjoy working
with people at the coffee shop

782
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,785
more than designing blocks on my own.

783
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:46,557
And that also seems like
what grandma and mom want.

784
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,459
It's time for me to be filial.

785
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,828
I heard that you brought
a girl home yesterday.

786
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,101
She's a great girl.

787
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,471
Is this an eye or a nose?

788
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,807
Come over here, Yoo-joo.

789
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:07,311
Hey, is this an arm or a leg?

790
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,246
Come over here and take a look.

791
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,950
How can you find the eyes, nose, and mouth
on a dot, half a centimeter in diameter?

792
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,853
If you open your mind,
you can see everything here.

793
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:19,590
Take a look. Can't you see the nose?

794
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:23,360
He has a handsome nose just like me,

795
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,131
and he has a wide forehead just like me.

796
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:31,068
He even has short arms
and legs just like me.

797
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:32,703
He's so cute!

798
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:36,040
Are you that happy?

799
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,842
Frankly, I'm not a hundred percent happy.

800
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,745
I'm grateful because the baby's a gift
from God.

801
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,048
But I also feel

802
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,317
the burden of responsibility.

803
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,119
It's a really strange feeling.

804
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:50,754
How about you?

805
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,691
It's amazing to think

806
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,527
that there's life growing inside me
and I'm also a little scared.

807
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,563
-You feel tense?
-Yeah.

808
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:04,368
But doesn't that mean that
you're happy about the baby too?

809
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,906
I agonized a lot over the baby.

810
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,276
It scared me

811
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:16,046
that I would have to be responsible
for giving birth to and raising a child.

812
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:22,453
So I thought about whether
I should just get rid of it.

813
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,223
But I just can't. I don't want to.

814
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,960
I should be more careful.

815
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:31,528
I'm sorry. You have to be careful.

816
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,098
-Do you want anything to drink?
-No.

817
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,668
Hey, Yoo-joo...

818
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,637
thank you for making me a dad.

819
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,574
Thank you, Han-sung.

820
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,577
Should we get married?

821
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:52,116
I guess we can raise
the kid out of wedlock.

822
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,957
But what do you plan to tell him
if the child asks you,

823
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:04,428
“Why do you and daddy live separately?"

824
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,631
What are you going to say when he asks,
“Why do I have to move from your place

825
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:10,534
to daddy's place every three days?”

826
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,139
What would you say to him, Han-sung?

827
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,940
I would have a definite answer for him.

828
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,977
I would tell him to go ask
his mom because I don't know.

829
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,347
Hey! How can you pass on
the responsibility to me?

830
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,016
Well, wouldn't it be the truth?

831
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,751
What?

832
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:30,220
I mean, it's not like
I would be lying to him.

833
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,456
So why couldn't I tell him that?

834
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,934
Darn. This doesn't look good.

835
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,603
Why does Han-gyeol's grandma
want to talk to Eun-chan?

836
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,105
Did Han-gyeol already...

837
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,339
Introduce Eun-chan to his family?

838
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:51,975
Why do parents have to butt into

839
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:53,844
their children's lives like that?

840
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,616
It looks like Eun-chan's about
to get a tongue lashing.

841
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,519
But why?

842
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:08,325
I guess such matters are beyond
a naive and innocent soul like yours.

843
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,727
I'll be direct with you.

844
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,630
How far have you two gone?

845
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,501
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

846
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,236
You stupid child!

847
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:21,939
Has Han-gyeol promised to marry you?

848
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,508
Marry me?

849
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,313
Is that why you're so worried?

850
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,782
Ma'am, Mom,
you don't have to worry at all.

851
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,451
I have no plans to marry anyone.

852
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,686
Is that so?

853
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,321
If you don't plan to marry him,

854
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:38,488
why are you seeing him?

855
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:40,390
We're just seeing each other.

856
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,893
It hasn't been long since
we started dating

857
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:45,896
and I'm only 24 right now.

858
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,532
I plan to marry when I'm about 30.

859
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,400
What? Thirty?

860
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,370
Are you trying to ruin Han-gyeol's life?

861
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,073
Do you have any idea
of how old Han-gyeol is?

862
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:01,178
It'll be 6 years until she's 30.
That would make Han-gyeol 35!

863
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,615
This is just awful!

864
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,417
-Mom, that's...
-Don't you dare call her mom!

865
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:10,220
Is it because of the money?

866
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,389
Did you seduce him in order

867
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,124
to bring your family out of poverty?

868
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,726
That's what you're thinking, right?

869
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,697
Han-gyeol is more softhearted
than he looks.

870
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,933
He probably took you in
because he felt sorry for you.

871
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,068
And now that he's grown attached to you,

872
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:28,005
he says he won't go to America anymore.

873
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:31,208
You should break up with him.

874
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,244
It'll be difficult for the both of you
if you let this drag on for too long.

875
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,813
How much will it take?

876
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:40,350
What are you trying to do, mom?

877
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:44,388
I like money,

878
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:48,091
but I'm not as foolish
as to marry someone for their money.

879
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,628
And although I care
for your grandson deeply,

880
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:55,098
we could break up if our feelings change.

881
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,234
You could break up?

882
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,604
Where in the world did
that imbecile find a thing like that?

883
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,005
Oh, my head!

884
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,309
-Are you all right, mom?
-Tell me,

885
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,577
are all kids nowadays like you?

886
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,013
Is it so easy for you to break up?

887
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,015
It's not easy to break up.

888
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,217
But when the boss goes to America,

889
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,719
we won't see each other for a long time,

890
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,056
and we won't know what will happen
during that time.

891
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,191
But right now,

892
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,460
I want to be with him
no matter what it takes.

893
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:30,167
You want me to break up
with your grandson, don't you?

894
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,236
But what can I do?
My feelings won't change.

895
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,605
That's why I can't break up with him.

896
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,374
At least, not right now.

897
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,675
Neither can I.

898
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,378
Go back to work.

899
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,213
She's not going anywhere!

900
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,681
I'm not done talking to her!

901
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,484
I should hear what you have
to say to Eun-chan.

902
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,153
So, don't make me have to hear it
from her and tell it to me directly.

903
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,289
What the heck!
How could you protect her like this!

904
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,391
This is a place of business, Grandma.

905
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:55,993
Please follow me upstairs.

906
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,669
What are they talking about in there?

907
00:50:06,636 --> 00:50:09,373
The boss's grandma told me to leave
because she didn't even want to see me.

908
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,809
She's just hurt because it feels like
she's losing her grandson to you.

909
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,911
She acted the same way
towards Han-gyeol's mom.

910
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:16,480
She didn't like Mrs. Choi either?

911
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:18,048
But she seems like such a nice person.

912
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,817
It's not like we're getting married
or anything,

913
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,052
but she told us to break up

914
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,520
and even offered me money.

915
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,856
I wonder how she would react
if we ever decided to get married.

916
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:27,090
She offered you money?

917
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,161
The old woman must be senile or something.

918
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,834
I'm not going to New York.

919
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,871
Why? Because of the girl?

920
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:44,274
-I can't say that's not true.
-I knew it! What did I tell you!

921
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,910
He wouldn't have
just brought any old girl home.

922
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,913
You idiot! How can you give up
on your dreams just because of a girl?

923
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,915
Does it make you feel better
to talk like that, Grandma?

924
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,151
Does it feel better to think
that your grandson is an imbecile

925
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:57,087
who'll make his decision on whether or not
going to America solely based on a girl?

926
00:50:57,154 --> 00:50:58,855
Start talking some sense, Grandma!

927
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,123
Don't you know me?

928
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,591
Do you think you, mom and dad

929
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,660
don't have anything to do with it?

930
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,862
Sure Eun-chan's part of the reason.

931
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,497
I'm madly in love with her

932
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,266
and I don't want to leave her.

933
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:13,437
But Eun-chan isn't the only reason.

934
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,806
Part of the reason I don't want to go
is because you're sick, Grandma.

935
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:18,075
And because mom doesn't want me to go.

936
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,544
Enough with your excuses.

937
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,979
Even though I'm sick, it's not like
I'm going to be dying any time soon.

938
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,382
And you never gave a thought
if your mom liked you going to America,

939
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,317
so why are you starting now?

940
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,453
Ah, really.

941
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,821
Now, you don't want me to stay?

942
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:34,024
I plan to learn the family business
from dad, but you don't want that either?

943
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,426
Fine. So you want me to go?

944
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,362
if that's what the two of you really want!

945
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,530
I'll go!

946
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,432
Should I go, Grandma? Should I go, Mom?

947
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,536
Stop with your games!

948
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,371
And still, Eun-chan is unacceptable.

949
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,374
There's nothing about her to like!
I don't like anything about her.

950
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,145
It doesn't matter who I date because
you wouldn't like anyone anyway.

951
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,115
I don't like her either.

952
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:02,853
Your future wife has
to run the entire household.

953
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:04,988
How can I leave it to a girl like that?

954
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,524
That's way into the future.

955
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:10,527
I really didn't have plans for marriage,
but now that you bring it up,

956
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:11,962
I feel like getting married right away.

957
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:13,396
Dear!

958
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:16,032
Don't you know how I am, Mom?

959
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:17,868
You know I won't listen to you.

960
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:20,003
You know I'll do something even more
if you try to stop me.

961
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,140
Wouldn't it be a better idea for you
to just leave me alone?

962
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,993
CHOI HAN-SUNG'S PRENATAL MUSIC
TO MY BABY, WITH LOVE

963
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:03,513
This is your mom speaking.

964
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,749
It's so difficult to get you on the phone.

965
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:07,584
I'm in Seoul right now.

966
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,521
Are you in or not?

967
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:27,103
Goodbye!

968
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,141
Goodbye!

969
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:54,965
I miss you. Could I see you
for just ten minutes?

970
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:59,502
I can't be tied down by my past loves.

971
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,905
DELETE THIS MESSAGE?
YES NO.

972
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:08,278
Wait! A true playboy always keeps
his past women hanging around.

973
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,014
Ha-rim's advice is so great.

974
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:18,488
I finally realized what a great catch
you were after we broke up.

975
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,659
I heard that you were seeing someone else.

976
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,328
-Are you jealous?
-Jealous?

977
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:31,668
-I was.
-You don't look too unhappy about it.

978
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:36,273
I was a little jealous at first,
but I'm all right now.

979
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,275
I've broken up with the girl.

980
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,844
She was becoming too dependent on me,

981
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,079
so I dumped her.

982
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:44,614
So that's what's happened.

983
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:47,384
I'm sure you'll find another girl

984
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:50,487
since you're such a great guy.

985
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,057
Yeah. Anyway, why did you want to see me?

986
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:56,793
I just missed you.

987
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,997
It’s been quite rough for me
during the time we’ve been apart.

988
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:04,134
That's why I thought I should see you

989
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,835
before I finally put you behind me.

990
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,706
It feels so much better to have seen you.

991
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,275
Thanks for taking the time
to meet me like this.

992
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:13,910
Goodbye.

993
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:21,117
Wait. Why don't you have a cup
of coffee before you go?

994
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:24,387
I'll pass. Next time.

995
00:55:25,955 --> 00:55:29,192
Have a nice life and take care.

996
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:41,338
I just wanted to say goodbye to you.

997
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,375
Okay. Goodbye.

998
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,585
Bye.

999
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:05,228
I knew it!
My kiss completely blew him away.

1000
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,872
I want something that's a little lively.

1001
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,008
I disagree. I think...

1002
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:21,077
Isn't she the quiet type?

1003
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,946
Then I think something like this
would be better.

1004
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,348
Something with nature in it
or something like this.

1005
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,650
Women receive energy
from working in the kitchen.

1006
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:29,285
This is perfect.

1007
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:31,888
So, you're a woman, too?

1008
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,023
Hey, you're teasing me, right?

1009
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,559
-Are the boss's wife and mom gone?
-Yeah.

1010
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,261
Take a look. I think this will be good.

1011
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,267
I'll be back in five.

1012
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,375
He has changed a lot.

1013
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:53,910
He has become more considerate of others.

1014
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,413
Is your grandma very angry?

1015
00:56:57,313 --> 00:57:00,116
She had so much to say!

1016
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,485
It's not like I would listen to her
no matter what she said to me.

1017
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,121
You're sulking, aren't you?

1018
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,823
How could I smile in this situation?

1019
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,260
I'm only human, you know,
and I feel crummy right now.

1020
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:12,128
What did she say to you?

1021
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:14,464
She said that she didn't like me.

1022
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,666
And what did you say to that?

1023
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,435
I told them not to worry.

1024
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,838
That we could end up breaking up
if our feelings changed.

1025
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,942
You sound like a person
who's dying to break up.

1026
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,544
Then what should I have said
in that situation?

1027
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,180
Should I have said that we won't break up
and that we're going to get married?

1028
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,182
I bet that would make your mom
and grandma faint.

1029
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:34,784
It was like a scene from a movie today.

1030
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,286
Why were they so mean to me?

1031
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,922
I'm just as good as the next person.

1032
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,157
And what makes you so special?

1033
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,028
I guess this could be the last scene.

1034
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,097
-Anyway, if you go to New York--
-I'm not going to New York.

1035
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,703
Really? Why not? Why aren't you going?

1036
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:57,507
Why not? Why are you asking me that?

1037
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,243
-Do you want me to go to New York?
-It's not that.

1038
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:04,481
I just think that you shouldn't stay
if it's because of me.

1039
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:06,783
You should go and take that job.

1040
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,885
So, you'll be disappointed if I don't go?

1041
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:09,986
Of course... not.

1042
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,956
I couldn't say I'd be disappointed.

1043
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,159
Are you really going
to stay here because of me?

1044
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,461
I'm not staying here because of you.

1045
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,230
I'm staying here because of me.

1046
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:21,998
Because I love you.

1047
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,268
I didn't want to spend my days sobbing
in New York because I miss you.

1048
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,836
That would be so embarrassing.

1049
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,738
It would be better to stay here.

1050
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,777
Are you really staying here because of me?

1051
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:36,713
-Yeah.
-Is it really because of me?

1052
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,916
Is it really because you love me? Really?

1053
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,587
Han-gyeol, I thought we should have
your going away party this weekend.

1054
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:46,956
But I'm not going to New York.

1055
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,558
What are you two doing?

1056
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:50,827
Go away.

1057
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:53,863
And miss out on this great show?

1058
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:55,632
Didn't you hear what she said?

1059
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,773
You lovebirds peck at each other
every chance you get!

1060
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,349
Stop! Stop!

1061
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:50,887
