1
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,570
Eun-chan.

2
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:40,507
Let me hug you once.

3
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:46,112
I can't do anything lately because of you

4
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,082
so let me hug you just once.
I think that'll make everything clear.

5
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:47,574
I knew it was nothing special.

6
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,810
Thanks! Let's go.

7
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,654
What was that feeling?

8
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,927
How's the man you went back to?

9
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,129
Not so good? A complete disaster?

10
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,465
I heard that you were holding an exhibit
in Queens.

11
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,600
Just admit you miss me.

12
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,435
Even better if you say you long for me.

13
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,105
When are you going to come?

14
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:54,908
I won't tell you
so you can long for me even more.

15
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,878
I was worried about how you were doing
since I came to Seoul.

16
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,881
But seeing how you're making jokes,
you must be fine.

17
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,384
Seriously, when will you be here?

18
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,102
Do you have something to say to me?

19
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,105
-No.
-Then, why do you keep glancing at me?

20
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,140
I did not.

21
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,008
Yes, you did. I saw you.

22
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,577
Hey, I did not glance at you!

23
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:40,920
Hey, tell Eun-chan to change
because we have to go somewhere.

24
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,388
Go where?

25
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,824
Boss. Where are you going?

26
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,495
No one shows me any respect.

27
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:51,864
Eun-chan!

28
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,603
Why did we come to a bookstore?

29
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,204
You're such a slave driver.

30
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,508
Why did you have to drag me along
to buy your books?

31
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,379
And you didn't talk to me for a full hour.

32
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,280
What am I?

33
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,317
Am I your slave?

34
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:12,986
The café is busy.

35
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,322
I would understand
if you had something to say to me,

36
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,657
but that's not even it.

37
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,159
You talk too much.

38
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,867
"Dongin Food's President's
Recipe for Success."

39
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,770
This will come in handy for us.
Let's buy one.

40
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,905
I don't think it'll be useful at all.

41
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,009
Oh, right! Your grandma
is the president, isn't she?

42
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,577
She's the chairwoman.

43
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,045
Then who's he?

44
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,347
-My dad.
-Your dad?

45
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,721
You don't look alike.

46
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,824
Your dad is a lot more handsome than you.

47
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,697
You come from such a prestigious family!

48
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,001
You should have just ordered them online.

49
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,970
You didn't even bring your car.

50
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,472
You should at least
buy me something to drink

51
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,774
for lugging all these books around.

52
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,211
Aren't I right?

53
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:18,051
It's hot, these books are heavy,
and they sell them all online.

54
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,586
Are you angry?

55
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,490
These books are for you.

56
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,359
What? For me?

57
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,361
I thought you wanted to become a barista?

58
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,529
Then you should study.

59
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,068
Wow! I'm so moved, boss.

60
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,670
All right!

61
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,440
This doesn't change the fact
that I hate you.

62
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,542
Why do you hate me?

63
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,610
What did I do that was so wrong?

64
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,915
Mister!

65
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:51,818
Hey.

66
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,822
I just arranged a song.

67
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:57,623
Would you listen to the original? Hold on.

68
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,524
Me?

69
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:00,760
Sure. Hold on.

70
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,836
I know this song.

71
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,137
Is this your song, mister?

72
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,507
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

73
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:19,712
-Are you with someone right now?
-Yeah, I'm out right now.

74
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,415
I guess this is a bad time
for you to talk.

75
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,517
No, it's okay. I can talk.

76
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,085
Who in the world is it?

77
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,488
Mr. Han-sung.

78
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,125
You don't have to worry about it.

79
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,260
This is the only free time I have.

80
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,595
You don't have free time?

81
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,530
All you've got is time.
You've got to be kidding me.

82
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,066
Play the song for me.

83
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,068
Okay. Then, listen again.

84
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,872
This is nice.

85
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,776
-Try listening to this, boss.
-No! Get that out of my face.

86
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,777
Forget it, then.

87
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,714
Are you with Han-gyeol right now?

88
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,416
Yeah.

89
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:02,789
Then let's talk later.
I'll call you later.

90
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,157
Okay.

91
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:07,894
Let's go!

92
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,096
Why did you make me wait
in this hot weather?

93
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,976
Aren't artists and musicians great?

94
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,679
How do they create something
out of nothing?

95
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:32,452
I feel like people in the arts
have a mysterious aura about them.

96
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,621
Aura? You've got to be kidding me!

97
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,158
They're just trying to make a living
like the rest of us.

98
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,028
How can you talk about money
when we were talking about the arts?

99
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,363
You have no class.

100
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,665
Seriously.

101
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,203
-Why you...
-Hey! Seriously.

102
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,871
Why you...

103
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,111
Can't you keep quiet?

104
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,951
-Stop pushing!
-Don't push!

105
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,790
-What the heck?
-Back up!

106
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:12,792
Back up!

107
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,335
Oh, no! It's broken.

108
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,606
Why are you keeping that
in your pocket? It's broken.

109
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,841
Oh no.

110
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,749
Bend your elbows and give the people
behind you some room.

111
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,788
I guess you're right.

112
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,472
SALES REPORT

113
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,810
But, he's a guy.

114
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,782
So why am I jealous of Han-sung?

115
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,619
What's the matter with me?

116
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,092
And why was he carrying the robot around
in his pocket?

117
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,805
I'm the employer and you're the employee.

118
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,140
And that's it.

119
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,377
Okay. You're a little adorable.

120
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,314
But that's really it. That's it!

121
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,384
I'm late
Is the boss here or not

122
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,620
I hope he isn't here

123
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,689
Is he here?

124
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,092
-That--
-The people here are so funny.

125
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,663
Look in your locker.
He says it's a one-month anniversary gift.

126
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,674
Where is it? What the...

127
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,077
No Seon-gi.

128
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,313
Jin Ha-rim.

129
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,516
Hwang Min-yeop.

130
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,187
Hong Gye-sik.

131
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,689
Why don't I have one?

132
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,131
I bet he's planning to give me mine later.

133
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,966
Boss!

134
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,369
Why didn't I get a tiny robot?

135
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,603
I already gave you one.

136
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,706
But still, I want another one.
It's a one month anniversary gift.

137
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,976
Mine is special, right?

138
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,145
Why should yours be special?

139
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,581
Like something with sentimental value,

140
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,717
or something that's rarer.

141
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,919
Or at least more expensive.

142
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,423
Yours is the smallest one. Okay?

143
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,324
Now, clean up.

144
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,863
Why is my heart racing when I'm annoyed?

145
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,700
Why did he give me mine first
and confuse me?

146
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,569
Why is he flip-flopping so much?
He's making me dizzy.

147
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,838
What is it? Is someone giving you
a hard time, Eun-chan?

148
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,240
Yeah.

149
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,209
There's someone who has been driving me
crazy as of late.

150
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:20,713
Once I start feeling better,
he slaps me across the face and runs off.

151
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,314
Don't hang out with jerks like that.

152
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,583
Who's doing that to you?

153
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,659
What the heck! What is it?

154
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:35,895
I heard you know.

155
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,530
-Know what?
-Eun-chan's secret!

156
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,732
That she's Eun-sae's sister.

157
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:42,735
How do you know that?

158
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,570
-Does Eun-chan know?
-Yes.

159
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,539
You don't have to worry.
My lips are sealed.

160
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,279
That troublemaker.

161
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,385
-Where's the boss?
-He went on a delivery.

162
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:02,521
Did you remind your mom
to make enough scallion pancakes?

163
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,589
I did.

164
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,725
Is something going on today? Hello.

165
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,961
-It's my dad's memorial.
-Your dad's memorial?

166
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,362
Welcome back, Han-gyeol.

167
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,065
We should all go over tonight
and have memorial food.

168
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,335
It's better to be with friends
on a sad day like that.

169
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,003
You're so nice.

170
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:19,605
Come with us, Han-gyeol.

171
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,942
And you too, Seon-gi.
Don't make any plans for tonight.

172
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,777
Let's all go and have dinner there.

173
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,215
Is he angry at me or something?

174
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,093
You can punch out early today.

175
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,929
Why?

176
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,099
Are you letting me go early
because of my dad's memorial?

177
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,804
Jeez, is it so difficult for you
to turn around and look me?

178
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,739
Do you like me?

179
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:59,879
Don't. You'll suffer
if you can't get over me.

180
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,351
You're so self-centered.

181
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,154
Do you take classes for that?
You're a real pro.

182
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,367
Can I have some?

183
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,205
Give me some too!

184
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,684
Is there anything you can't do?

185
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,820
Getting rid of you.

186
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,156
That's one thing
you'll never be able to do.

187
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:46,926
This is so delicious!

188
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,995
Stop eating everything.

189
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,497
Move.

190
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:53,833
Move aside.

191
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,169
You'll do it?

192
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,115
He's so dreamy!

193
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,053
Did you see that? He's so good!

194
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,088
Hey! You're splattering oil.

195
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,290
That's not how you flip pancakes.

196
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,729
Move over. Let me try it.

197
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,869
Excuse me.

198
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,108
-Hey, try that again!
-Could I get your cell phone number?

199
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,478
Try that again!

200
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,081
Hey, look!

201
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,686
That's awesome.

202
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:53,025
I can't believe you're waiting this late
just to get free food.

203
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,563
If you were childhood friends,
that was eons ago.

204
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:00,466
I wonder how long you'll stick with us.

205
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,602
Keep wondering.

206
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,405
Look here, Mr. Hong,

207
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,275
Ji-hyang and I are currently in love.

208
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,611
I've even proposed formally to her.

209
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,080
As two brooks converge into one river,

210
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,850
our souls have become one.

211
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,787
We are completely open with each other.

212
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,392
-You're open to each other?
-Yes!

213
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,828
Well, we've even kissed under a bridge.

214
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:30,996
What?

215
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,567
Ji-hyang even packed her things
to elope with me.

216
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,172
Will you two stop with the useless banter?

217
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,541
-Are you done?
-Yeah.

218
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,144
Have some of this.

219
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,045
You have a package!

220
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,648
How did he make all these?

221
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,517
It must have been so hard.

222
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,719
It must have taken so much work,

223
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,221
to put each piece together.

224
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,656
What's so difficult about that?

225
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,325
It probably took a few minutes.

226
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,961
-Let me give it a try.
-Hey! Don't touch that.

227
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:02,861
Don't!

228
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,932
-Hey!
-Jeez! What a cheap piece of junk.

229
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:15,240
"Be strong.
You've got arms and legs of steel.

230
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,675
My Invincible Runt!"

231
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,912
Does he have a crush on me?

232
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:21,847
Why is he so nice to me?

233
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,551
You're probably the only woman
on this planet to be happy

234
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,252
after hearing she has arms
and legs of steel.

235
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,689
And don't forget that your boss
thinks you're a guy.

236
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:32,891
You're confusing friendship with love.

237
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,729
This calls for some action.

238
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,576
-Hello?
-Boss!

239
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,745
I'm curious about something.

240
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,714
Why are you bothering me again?

241
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,282
What is it? What are you so curious about?

242
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,685
It's nothing important.

243
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,522
But what's the reason
you gave me such a big present?

244
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:06,825
I know it's lame to ask
about meanings and such,

245
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,294
but you've put so much effort

246
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,230
so I don't know if I should accept.

247
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,433
You can just accept them.

248
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,068
There's really no reason at all.

249
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,371
I just wanted to encourage you
to keep working hard.

250
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,141
Hey, did you call me at this hour
to ask that?

251
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,210
-There's no need to get annoyed. Fine---
-I'm hanging up!

252
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:35,554
Couldn't he just say it was
because he likes me?

253
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,394
Of course, I'm going to work hard.

254
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,529
When did I not?

255
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,098
He gives me a gift and gets mad.

256
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,402
He goes back and forth
being nice and mean. He's so fickle.

257
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,603
I can't figure him out.

258
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,406
You're more fickle than he is.

259
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,707
Me?

260
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,876
-When your boss gave you the watch.
-Yeah?

261
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,880
Didn't you call him a jerk
for giving it and taking it back?

262
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:03,882
Yeah.

263
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:06,785
And that night at the tent bar,
you got mad at him

264
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,755
for running in when he has
slow reflexes and getting you hurt.

265
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,459
Yeah.

266
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,428
And when he hugged you,
you called him a pervert for hugging you

267
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,465
when he clearly thought
that you were a guy, didn't you?

268
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,668
That was then.

269
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,070
I just like him a lot now.

270
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,574
Study!

271
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,681
Come here!

272
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,320
Hi there. Who are you?

273
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,555
What's your name?

274
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,425
Would you like some?

275
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,163
Fly.

276
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,565
Let's sleep.

277
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,076
I must be losing my mind.

278
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,612
Why in the world did I give him that?

279
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,083
I must be crazy!

280
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,741
-Are you awake?
-Yeah. Why?

281
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,209
I'm surprised.

282
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,611
You got up early today.

283
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,048
-Have you had breakfast?
-Why?

284
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,284
Just wondering.

285
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:50,122
Cause it's time to eat breakfast
and I was wondering...

286
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,992
I haven't had any breakfast either.

287
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,428
Have you eaten, or haven't you?

288
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,230
Boss?

289
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,601
Boss? Hello? Boss? Are you there? Hello...

290
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,904
I'm here. And I haven't eaten yet.

291
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,707
I'm in front of your building right now,
so I'll be right up.

292
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,842
But I'm jogging right now.

293
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:12,945
Jogging?

294
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,547
You jog? Where are you?

295
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:17,849
Why?

296
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,118
Near the pagoda?

297
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,921
That's the best trail to jog.

298
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,723
Don't come.

299
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:27,659
Why not?

300
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,830
-Okay then, come.
-Okay! I'm on my way!

301
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,500
All right, for the love of god!

302
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,206
I must be losing my mind.

303
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,042
Damn it!

304
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,060
Hey, Yoo-joo. It's me, Han-gyeol.

305
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,700
Just look at your sneakers!
They're full of holes!

306
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,835
Wait for me!

307
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,337
Han-gyeol!

308
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,475
-Hi, Yoo-joo!
-Hi, Eun-chan!

309
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,982
-Let me get that for you.
-Okay.

310
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,251
-What did you bring?
-What?

311
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,185
What did you bring?

312
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,859
Come here and try some of this, Eun-chan.

313
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,995
It's all right. I had a big breakfast.

314
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,000
When have you ever said no to food?

315
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:44,636
This is delicious. Try some.

316
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,043
Wait.

317
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,578
-What are you doing?
-Hey, stay still.

318
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,514
What's gotten into you?

319
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,085
-Getting food on your face like a kid!
-What a hypocrite.

320
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,422
Pretending to be so nice.

321
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,059
While you're always yelling at us
and calling us names.

322
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,898
Would you like some herbal tea, Eun-chan?

323
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,800
No. I have water.

324
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,569
What's that behind you?

325
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,173
It's nothing.

326
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,377
I brought some food leftover
from my dad's memorial.

327
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,679
Wow! I love memorial ritual food.

328
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,947
That sounds delicious!

329
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:30,882
Did you bring that for me?

330
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,919
You're a lot nicer than I thought.

331
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,588
What did I tell you?
Everyone adores me except for you.

332
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,390
I guess you're right.

333
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,858
Get over yourself.

334
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,594
I just didn't want to waste it
on the stray dogs.

335
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,267
Do you know how I hated him
when I first saw him?

336
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,203
I thought he was a total punk.

337
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,105
I didn't like you either.

338
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,107
I thought you were
an over-the-hill Casanova!

339
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,810
But I later found out that
he was supporting his family.

340
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,380
He works so hard.

341
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,148
There's this schedule at his home.

342
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,750
And it completely blew my mind.

343
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,718
He delivers milk, food,

344
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,487
teaches at a taekwondo gym,
peels chestnuts,

345
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:12,057
and even sews on doll eyes
all to support his family!

346
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,462
You shouldn't tease people
about how they make their living.

347
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,298
I'm not teasing you. I'm praising you.

348
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,201
But you should ask
the owner of the doll factory

349
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,403
to give you more money.

350
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,006
I mean, 50 won a doll is just too low,
even if it is menial labor.

351
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:31,076
Habit...

352
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,080
It's really bad.

353
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,719
Eun-chan, do you want to try?

354
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,322
Where did you get that bad habit
of bothering people like that?

355
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,159
Why don't you kick a bad habit like that?

356
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:49,828
Or can't you
because it's such an old habit?

357
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,364
Watch what you say!

358
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,233
You can't do anything,
and run a café your grandma gave you.

359
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,535
And yet you look down on others

360
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,004
and blow a fuse
when anyone does anything wrong.

361
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,441
-Life must be so easy for you.
-Not as easy as it is for you.

362
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,744
Always making people feel sorry for you
with those puppy dog eyes,

363
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,846
pretending to be so cute and weak.

364
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,314
Am I wrong?

365
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:14,419
I don't pretend to be anything.
I'm just a little positive, that's all.

366
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,821
You're just too positive.

367
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,690
Always smiling like an idiot even
when people are embarrassing you.

368
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,461
I've been giving signs for you to leave,
but you insist on being the third wheel.

369
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,597
You can't get more positive than that.

370
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:29,468
-For crying out loud.
-For crying out loud?

371
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,440
I'll have a gimbap and go.

372
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,746
Why did he take out the cucumber?

373
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,429
Goddamn it!

374
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:06,304
So all I want to know is
whether you gave her your number or not!

375
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,876
You're always ignoring me.

376
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,145
Anyways, don't you even think
about hitting on my Eun-sae.

377
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,082
Or I'll break your legs in half!

378
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:18,450
Watch what you say, you dunce.

379
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,151
What? Dunce?

380
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:21,319
Why you...

381
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,587
Hello. This is No Seon-gi.

382
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,656
I'm on my way.

383
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,559
Hey, where are you going?

384
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,875
Do you really not know where she lives?

385
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,076
I don't.

386
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,579
She just left this and disappeared.

387
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,483
I know it's not my place to say this,

388
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:57,389
but just think of the three years
with Hui-seon as a dream.

389
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,991
-They didn't mean anything to her.
-I have a job now.

390
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,896
Yuko told me that I should keep trying,

391
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,098
no matter how difficult life gets.

392
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,770
Even though you said
you would take care of Hui-seon's son,

393
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,939
that's not an easy task
for someone as young as yourself.

394
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:17,609
-So you should give up-
-I can take care of her.

395
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,881
Tell her that I'll just stay by her side.

396
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,217
And if she doesn't want even that,

397
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,320
just let me see her once in a while.

398
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,656
Please tell her that.

399
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,315
So, you've been searching
for that woman for three years!

400
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,318
I'm so moved, Seon-gi!

401
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,889
Let's be friends from now on.

402
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,626
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

403
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,694
I thought you were going to see Eun-sae.

404
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,531
I gave my youth
and all my passion to Eun-sae, too.

405
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,767
But you set aside her age
and the fact that she has a kid,

406
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:18,069
and devoted yourself to one woman--

407
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:21,106
Stop bothering me.

408
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,009
And I never consented
on being your friend.

409
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,349
He would be a great guy
if he didn't keep speaking in Japanese.

410
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,085
Wait up, Seon-gi! Wait!

411
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:36,955
That's not it, ma'am.

412
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,091
-So, you won't do it?
-It's not that I won't do it...

413
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,761
I don't need your explanations.
Just tell me if you'll do it or not.

414
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:45,997
I'll do it.

415
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,601
You can't even serve coffee properly.

416
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,838
What is it now?

417
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,609
She wants some whipped cream on her latte.
This is the fourth time today.

418
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,477
First, she wanted
a slice of lemon in her water,

419
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:01,579
and then, she wanted us
to bring her another cup.

420
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,716
I said there are no refills for lattes,
but she threw a fit.

421
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,018
Does she think this is her home
or something?

422
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,189
Eun-chan.

423
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,758
What's with your attitude?

424
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,262
You should do what the customer
tells you to do with a smile,

425
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,497
not with a scowl on your face.
What do you think you're doing?

426
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,101
Be careful. I have my eye on you.

427
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,203
Why don't you try serving them?

428
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:28,707
Come with me!

429
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:36,848
Was I so wrong to ask you
to treat customers nicely?

430
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,883
What's so difficult

431
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,886
about serving customers what they want
with a smile on your face?

432
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,088
That's easy to say.

433
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,223
But you've never had a customer
be mean to you.

434
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,991
It's hard being treated like that.

435
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:49,928
It's hard being ordered around
like that by nasty customers,

436
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,430
it's hard delivering milk,
it's hard delivering food,

437
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,899
and it's hard sewing eyes onto dolls!

438
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,668
Why are you talking about that?

439
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,536
I'm not proud of being poor, you know.

440
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,105
Talking about it so lightly...

441
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,374
When did I give you permission
to talk about me to another person?

442
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,977
How could you talk about me like that
without asking me first?

443
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:07,011
How about you?

444
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,114
What about bad habits?

445
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:13,551
I know you're stupid, but have you
no filter? How could you say that there?

446
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:14,652
What?

447
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,622
I'm arrogant when all I do
is run a café my grandma gave me?

448
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,024
You're the one who said I act
pathetic and cute.

449
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,728
I feel embarrassment too. But why
do I take it? In order to survive...

450
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,698
-I can't stand this anymore!
-What?

451
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:30,635
What? What can't you stand? Who? Me?
Tell me!

452
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,904
-I can't stand living like this anymore!
-Why, you brat!

453
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,140
Calm down.

454
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,741
-What's the matter with you?
-Let go of me!

455
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,944
I kept you around out of pity,
but you have no boundaries.

456
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,147
You kept me around out of pity?

457
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,415
Then don't keep me around! That solves it!

458
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,018
Don't you remember?
You're the one who begged me to hire you!

459
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,687
Is that how it is?
Then, I should just quit.

460
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,589
Do you think that scares me?
Then quit, you bastard!

461
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,091
What's the matter with you, Han-gyeol?

462
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,726
We don't need punks like you!

463
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,828
How could you
belittle my feelings like that?

464
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,697
I don't need you either!
You self-centered jerk!

465
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:00,865
I'm so sick of you!

466
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:02,634
Eun-chan!

467
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,369
-Where are you going?
-Eun-chan!

468
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,571
Don't you dare stop him, or you're dead!

469
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,042
Don't do this.

470
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,011
Han-gyeol only said those things
because he was angry.

471
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,412
Stay out of this, Ha-rim!

472
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,014
Where would you go?

473
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,882
-You can't find a better job--
-Get out!

474
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,684
-Get out!
-Eun-chan!

475
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,464
Eun-chan!

476
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,169
I'm leaving.

477
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,338
Where are you going?

478
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,243
I'm sorry, Mr. Hong. I'll call you later.

479
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,480
-Eun-chan!
-You shouldn't just leave like this!

480
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,649
Let's talk.

481
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,051
Later.

482
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:56,054
-Listen to me.
-Get back to work, Ha-rim!

483
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,026
-Eun-chan!
-Eun-chan!

484
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,678
This tastes great!

485
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:25,316
But why can't I get drunk?

486
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,052
How many have I had so far?

487
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,257
I was going to kidnap you
if you got drunk. You caught me.

488
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,893
What would you do with me?

489
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,830
Well, I am strong, so I would be good
for chopping firewood.

490
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,534
What is it?
Is Han-gyeol giving you a hard time?

491
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:45,937
No.

492
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,708
Why don't we go for a drive?

493
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,578
Okay.

494
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,364
This is so nice!

495
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,300
This is really helping me clear my head.

496
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:57,041
It's hot!

497
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,410
It's really good.

498
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,792
Do you have some more rice and kimchi?

499
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,728
This is so good.

500
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,909
Han-gyeol.

501
00:33:32,744 --> 00:33:34,078
Han-gyeol!

502
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:35,480
What is it now?

503
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,181
What are you going to do about Chan?

504
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,051
-You've got to do something.
-What for? He's the one who left.

505
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,452
You told him to.

506
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,656
He's just a little young and headstrong.

507
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:49,627
I don't need someone
who comes and goes as he pleases.

508
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,929
You were lenient with Min-yeop
when he didn't show up for days.

509
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,632
Why do you have to be so mean to Chan?

510
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,666
Stop it!

511
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,738
Hey, has Chan called yet?

512
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,841
I've sent over 20 text messages

513
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:06,444
but he hasn't replied to a single one.

514
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,747
I miss Chan so much.

515
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,183
I'm dying to see Chan!

516
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,739
When are we having lunch, Mom?

517
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,141
You just had breakfast.

518
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,578
All those coffee-related books
on the table,

519
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:42,780
what are you going to do with them?

520
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,248
Should I burn them all?

521
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,284
I'll take care of them.

522
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,488
Why don't you stop rolling around
and go back to the café?

523
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,058
I can't go back
when I'm the one who walked out.

524
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,462
-That's humiliating.
-It wouldn't be the first time.

525
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:00,264
You're always getting into fights
with your boss and making up again.

526
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,801
Why would you be humiliated?
Just go back like nothing happened.

527
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,440
"Big Jerk"?

528
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,544
-Isn't this your boss?
-Hey! That's my phone!

529
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,351
Eun-chan, you're sorry, right?

530
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:21,586
Come to work.

531
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,758
You're sorry, aren't you Eun-chan?
Come back to work.

532
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:34,565
Hey! You're sorry, aren't you?
Come back to work!

533
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:41,873
You're dead if you don't come!

534
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:43,975
I'm talking to you!

535
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,045
You're dead if you don't come!
Don't mess with me!

536
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,281
DILIGENT KID

537
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,096
What is it?

538
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:08,566
What is it? You're the one who called me!

539
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,636
What are you talking about?
You're the one who called me!

540
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,873
Your number is on the missed calls list
on my caller ID.

541
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:19,377
-Why don't you check the time?
-You're dead if you're wrong. Hold on.

542
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,149
-That was from three days ago!
-What?

543
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:26,384
That can't be!

544
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,419
Hold on!

545
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,391
-Do you have anything else to say?
-Sorry! My mistake!

546
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,726
Hello? Hey!

547
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,161
Hey!

548
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:39,063
Hey, that was from three days ago!

549
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,198
Did I say anything?

550
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,667
Seriously.

551
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,769
Why you...

552
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,140
Why I ought to just...

553
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:00,918
Hey, kiddo.

554
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,888
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

555
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,957
I'll play some music for you,

556
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,427
-so listen carefully to each instrument.
-Okay.

557
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:10,861
-You ready?
-Yeah.

558
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:11,762
Let's start!

559
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,408
-The drums!
-The drums!

560
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:31,682
What do you think?

561
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,020
-The weird thing is...
-Yeah?

562
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,823
It feels like the beating of my heart.

563
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,758
So your heart pounds like this.

564
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:46,297
Hold on.

565
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:54,272
Can you hear me? Concentrate.
Don't you hear another instrument?

566
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:58,075
I hear that!

567
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,143
-The keyboard!
-The keyboard!

568
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,115
What do you think of the keyboard?

569
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,550
Doesn't it seem like a jerk?
A self-centered jerk?

570
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,618
You're right.

571
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:12,423
Someone who's gaunt, irritable,
and who only eats vegetables.

572
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,859
You have to eat meat.

573
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,162
Now here's another instrument.

574
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,236
-Guitar.
-Okay, guitar!

575
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,515
-You know what?
-What?

576
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,117
I bet the guy who plays this is deaf.

577
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:42,119
-Why?
-This really hurts your ears.

578
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,759
The vocals!

579
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,094
-Vocals.
-Vocals.

580
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,038
Mister...

581
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,642
You know, the really strange
and fascinating thing is,

582
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,179
I've never listened to each instrument
separately like this before.

583
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,215
It's difficult to explain,

584
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,418
but it feels like the music is alive.

585
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:19,924
It makes my heart pound.
There's a thumping here.

586
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,293
And it tingles all over.

587
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,028
This is awesome.

588
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:33,798
The trumpets are sounding
to signal the start of war.

589
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,104
Open the castle gates!

590
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,139
Attack! Bombs away!

591
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,282
I'll fight you this time!

592
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,166
Attack Choi Han-gyeol. Bite him!

593
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,105
Attack Koh Eun-chan!

594
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,442
Help me, boss!

595
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,011
My hands are tied!

596
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:30,287
It's already two.

597
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,023
Your mom must be so worried about you.

598
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,327
I called her and told her I would be late
so she's probably already asleep.

599
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,499
I hope I didn't take too much time away
from your work.

600
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:43,767
It's all right.

601
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,240
Why don't you go back to the café?

602
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,442
You enjoyed making coffee.

603
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:53,878
Should I talk to Han-gyeol for you?

604
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,615
-He knows your situation and I'm sure--
-No.

605
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,386
Please don't talk
to other people about me.

606
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:09,260
It's offensive and infuriating.
And it makes me feel pathetic.

607
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,331
When my dad passed away
during middle school,

608
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,301
our family became poor.

609
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,238
I didn't get good grades
and didn't have any talents.

610
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,641
Everyone who knew, knew.

611
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:29,747
But please, can you not talk
about me to other people?

612
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,483
Just keep everything to yourself.

613
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:33,751
Okay?

614
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:36,687
Okay.

615
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,043
Ah, seriously!

616
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,145
Has Eun-chan completely forgotten
about me?

617
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:38,415
Please, Eun-chan. At least let me know
that you're alive.

618
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:41,318
If you don't, I'm just going to barge
into your house.

619
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,520
What's wrong with these punks?

620
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,689
-Eun-chan!
-Boss!

621
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:46,890
What is it?

622
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,492
When is Eun-chan coming in?

623
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,496
I need a taster for the new menu item,
so please tell him to come back soon.

624
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,498
Bring it here! I'll taste it!

625
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,004
What is it? Will you quit
if I don't bring Eun-chan back?

626
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,438
Then go ahead and quit!

627
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,275
You're such a loser.

628
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:15,719
Take a look.

629
00:44:15,786 --> 00:44:17,554
They'll come for an interview if you want.

630
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,556
Thanks.

631
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:22,059
With you helping me out like this,

632
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,361
it finally feels like
I'm doing something meaningful.

633
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,867
Han-sung has a new girlfriend.

634
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:30,768
Who?

635
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,903
The one from the exhibit?

636
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,173
I don't see Eun-chan around.

637
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,843
Oh, him? I fired him yesterday.

638
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:44,982
He was too emotional
and acted out of line, so I fired him,

639
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,153
but I kind of feel like we need him,

640
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,888
but at the same time, not really.

641
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,725
You want to date but you want to break up.

642
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,996
I understand that complicated feeling.

643
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,234
Anyway, if you don't need him,
you wouldn't be stressed about it.

644
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:08,138
Doesn't the fact that you are stressed
prove you need him?

645
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,776
Still, I fired him.
I just can't ask him to come back.

646
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,846
When I was in New York,

647
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:19,116
I had a big fight with my curator.

648
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,519
I was so angry that I was determined
never to see him again.

649
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,489
A month or so later,

650
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,192
he called me out of the blue.

651
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:30,394
He asked,

652
00:45:31,962 --> 00:45:33,964
"What time is better for you,
4 p.m. or 7 p.m.?"

653
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:39,603
So I asked, "For what?"
And he said, "For a play."

654
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:45,175
So I just replied, "I prefer 7 p.m."

655
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,988
I'm so sick of seeing you here.

656
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,358
Why are you back so late?

657
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,129
Pay attention to me when I talk to you.

658
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:06,563
Where were you?

659
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,332
Were you at an Internet café again?

660
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,871
How many times do I have to tell you
to come straight home from school?

661
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,839
You're going to end up punching a hole
through my head!

662
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:18,976
And what's keeping Mom?

663
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,978
How long does a perm take?

664
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,148
-Just look at the state of your bag.
-Don't touch that!

665
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,984
Wash up! You're filthy!

666
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,385
If you're that bored, do the laundry!

667
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,788
-I already did it.
-You're such a nag!

668
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,222
I wonder if it's dry.

669
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,327
The weather's so nice that the laundry
got dried in no time at all.

670
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,197
What are you doing
bringing the laundry in?

671
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,431
I told you that I would do it.

672
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,868
Go back to the café already.

673
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:48,472
I can't stand
your constant nagging anymore.

674
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:53,343
I mean, even my own mother-in-law
didn't nag me as much as you!

675
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,512
They're not fully dry yet.

676
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,447
What do you mean? They're dry!

677
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,116
Look at that. Do you call that a perm?

678
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,984
Stop it for crying out loud.

679
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:02,519
Your hair looks the same as before.

680
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,354
It's such a waste of money!

681
00:47:04,421 --> 00:47:05,823
I have such a headache!

682
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,525
Hello?

683
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,362
Let's eat!

684
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,064
What?

685
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,465
Jjajangmyeon or hangover soup?

686
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:16,834
What do you mean?

687
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:19,636
What do you want?
Jjajangmyeon or hangover soup?

688
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,105
Jjajangmyeon.

689
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:24,608
Come to the Chinese restaurant
from before.

690
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,344
Hello?

691
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,077
Who orders double sweet and sour pork?

692
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:03,647
Don't think you're off the hook
with a platter of sweet and sour pork.

693
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,653
You can't put whipped cream
on a caffé latte.

694
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:12,789
She should have ordered
a caffé mocha then.

695
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,292
A caffé mocha costs 500 won more.

696
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:17,160
Are you the owner of this café?

697
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,795
I said it was fine, so it's fine.

698
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:35,279
Why are you laughing?

699
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,015
Because you're so funny!

700
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,984
How many pieces of pork
can you fit in your mouth?

701
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,252
Pig.

702
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:47,357
Why do you keep laughing?

703
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,759
Then why did you laugh?

704
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:53,897
I laughed because you kept on laughing.

705
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,574
Here. This occasion calls for a drink.

706
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,376
Do you want to carry me home again?

707
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,311
Oh, right.

708
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,113
Then I'll drink it.

709
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,723
You're so funny!

710
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:37,607
Do you want to try some? Just a little.
It's good.

711
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,753
Run

712
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,421
Run

713
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,790
Run far away

714
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,750
Run

715
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:42,005
Hey!

716
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,075
Punch me.

717
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:46,810
Why?

718
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,313
Just one punch with everything you've got.

719
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,517
I don't punch just anybody.

720
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,686
It's not becoming of a taekwondo master.

721
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,322
Okay! Fine.

722
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,159
But just know this.

723
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,028
I never mocked you, not once.

724
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:12,002
Delivering milk, food, peeling chestnuts,
and sewing on doll eyes.

725
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:16,540
I mentioned it as a compliment,
not an insult.

726
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:20,777
I really think it's cool
the way you work so hard.

727
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:25,749
Because I don't think
I could ever live like that.

728
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,590
It sounds trite just saying it.

729
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,158
Just punch me.

730
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,727
It's all right.

731
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,597
I don't want to punch you
over something like that.

732
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:41,998
I'm not angry anymore.

733
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,600
No.

734
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:46,703
I don't think I could forgive myself
if you don't punch me.

735
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,205
Punch me!

736
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:53,610
But don't complain afterward.

737
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:56,046
Okay!

738
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,523
Are you all right?
I tried not to hit you too hard.

739
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:13,063
You have such a weak nose.

740
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,831
I can't believe that it bled.

741
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,805
I'm sorry for saying
that I kept you around

742
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,640
out of pity.

743
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,843
I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart.

744
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,845
We're even now.

745
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:31,014
I gave you a nosebleed.

746
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:34,951
You have such a strong punch
for such a small kid.

747
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,888
You should become my bodyguard.

748
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,158
I couldn't stand
seeing you even more than I do now.

749
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:42,926
Really?

750
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:47,164
You sure?

751
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:48,665
Yeah!

752
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,942
-That's how you do it!
-That's what I did.

753
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,048
Stop it!

754
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:09,486
I'm sorry. Enjoy your coffee.

755
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,190
I would like an Americano.

756
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,125
-Would you like it strong or mild?
-Mild.

757
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,126
Mild it is.

758
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,795
I thought she was asking for a straw!

759
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:22,532
Can't you tell the difference
between strong and straw?

760
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,670
She needs to enunciate better.

761
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,574
I can't work because I miss Chan so much!

762
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,409
I miss Chan so much!

763
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:35,779
-Brother.
-Eun-chan.

764
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:37,647
Brother.

765
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,883
-Oh, my Chan!
-Do you like me that much?

766
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,152
Eun-chan!

767
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,422
-My Chan!
-Okay.

768
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:47,624
I've missed these soft hands so much,
my Chan!

769
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:49,960
Couldn't you just text me
that you were all right?

770
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,494
You totally ignored me.

771
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,729
You're a real stalker!

772
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,399
-You're grossing me out.
-Have a nice day.

773
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:58,969
-Two cups of coffee, please.
-Okay.

774
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,406
Eun-chan, go in and wash the apples.

775
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,307
Okay!

776
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,344
Have a nice day! Thanks.

777
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,888
-Move out of my way.
-You move.

778
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:20,790
Move or these waffles
are going to get cold.

779
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:22,826
I'm the boss and I'm telling you
to move first.

780
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,494
But these waffles
are going to get cold. Move!

781
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:26,696
Stop it!

782
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,102
This is just too much, boss.

783
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,571
Why do you keep bothering Eun-chan?

784
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:39,476
I saw how you've been following him
and picking on him.

785
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,245
That's why he's uncomfortable
and tiptoes around you.

786
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:43,847
-I did not!
-Don't worry.

787
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:46,182
If you quit, we're all quitting with you.

788
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,385
Jeez, you knuckleheads!

789
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:53,623
I've already talked to Ha-rim about it,

790
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,625
and I plan to talk to Seon-gi
in the near future.

791
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,027
If you ever bother Eun-chan again...

792
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:58,962
You imbecile!

793
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,964
He's not bothering Eun-chan.
He's just playing around.

794
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,999
That's what people do
when they're in love.

795
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,567
Go.

796
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:06,603
Seriously.

797
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:10,140
Boss.

798
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,876
I know this great udon place.
Do you want to go?

799
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,178
I'll buy.

800
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,813
No.

801
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:20,750
This piece of junk won't start again!
I think it's broken.

802
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,819
Would you mind giving me a lift home?

803
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,322
Take a look. It won't start.

804
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,025
Stupid scooter.

805
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:33,029
Boss, if you don't like udon,

806
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,631
-how about--
-Just take a cab, Han-gyeol.

807
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,400
-Boss! I know of this great udon--
-Later.

808
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,144
-What's the matter with him?
-His grandma collapsed.

809
00:55:48,611 --> 00:55:49,446
What?

810
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:02,519
I couldn't reach you.

811
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,488
How's your grandma?

812
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:08,825
Come in.

813
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,713
Is your grandma very ill?

814
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,418
Stage four stomach cancer.

815
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,055
Is surgery an option?

816
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:44,093
She's too old
and the cancer has progressed too much.

817
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,797
Plus, she requested
that she will only receive chemo.

818
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:53,837
It must be difficult for you.

819
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:57,740
Why would it be?

820
00:57:58,708 --> 00:58:00,043
It's harder for her.

821
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,816
I'm so stupid.

822
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:11,654
My grandma, who spoiled me
so much since I was little,

823
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:14,824
suddenly called me back to Korea,

824
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:22,465
had me go out on blind dates,
and made me run Coffee Prince.

825
00:58:23,399 --> 00:58:24,534
I should have figured it out.

826
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,643
You should cry if you want to cry.

827
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,248
I'm all right.

828
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,084
You don't look all right to me.

829
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:48,191
I hate myself right now.

830
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,328
I'll be 30 soon,

831
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,331
but I'm still a burden on my grandma.

832
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,502
What have I done with my life?

833
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,009
I've never questioned
how I've lived my life before.

834
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:14,450
But today, I feel so selfish.

835
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:25,495
You should go. It's late.

836
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,001
Do you want me to cheer you up?

837
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,999
I would be satisfied
just being by his side.

838
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,136
Should I tell him that I'm a girl?

839
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:10,740
Pretending to be a guy just to stay
by the guy she likes.

840
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,076
Is that all you take me for?

841
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,912
He's driving me out of my mind!

842
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:19,716
Every time I see you, I feel like
I'm receiving a Christmas present.

843
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,018
Have you tried kissing, Ha-rim?

844
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:26,422
I've been looking back
on my life these days because of Eun-chan.

845
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,790
I like you, boss.

846
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:28,925
Love?

847
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,551
