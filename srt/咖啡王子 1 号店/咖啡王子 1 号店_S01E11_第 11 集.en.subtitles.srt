1
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,931
And I don't want you around me anymore.
Stay more than two meters away from me.

2
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,400
-Why can't I come near you?
-Move.

3
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,968
How could you play
with my feelings like that?

4
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,969
I thought you liked me!

5
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,304
-We even became blood brothers!
-I'll only be here for another month.

6
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,472
This will all be over in a month.

7
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,207
I'm going to bear it until then
so you bear it too.

8
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,675
You will be fine when you leave,
won't you?

9
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,977
You won't care about how I'll feel.

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,646
-Is Eun-chan a girl?
-It's top secret.

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,749
Do you know how much heartache
Han-gyeol went through so far?

12
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,650
I love you.

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,553
I don't care if you're a guy
or the devil himself.

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,688
It's just too difficult for me
to forget about you.

15
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,123
So let's take this all the way.

16
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,191
All the way.

17
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,473
Let it ring. Don't answer yet.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,543
One, two, hello!

19
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,777
Hi, it's me.

20
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,749
Did you get home all right?

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,751
Yeah.

22
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,224
What's up with the sigh?

23
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,064
Well, the thing is...

24
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,434
Did you get home all right?

25
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,804
Hello?

26
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:47,807
Hello?

27
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,477
Hello?

28
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:52,979
I miss you.

29
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,122
But we saw each other
only a little while ago.

30
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,324
I miss you too.

31
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,198
Can I ask you something?

32
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,469
Are we going to smile at each other,

33
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,975
not fight anymore,

34
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,277
and talk to each other from now on?

35
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,080
Yeah.

36
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:30,483
Good.

37
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,452
I'll talk to you later.

38
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,455
Let's stay like this
for a little while longer.

39
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,557
What?

40
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:40,860
Okay.

41
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,562
Just a little longer.

42
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,266
Are you asleep?

43
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,442
No, I can't stay on the phone.

44
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,710
My mom's calling me.

45
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,981
I'll see you tomorrow.

46
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:04,984
Okay. Good night.

47
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,928
I thought my heart was going to burst.

48
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,115
I should tell him now,

49
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:38,751
shouldn't I?

50
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,653
I should definitely tell him.

51
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:42,689
What do you think?

52
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,257
Yes!

53
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,361
That's right. Go ahead and tell him.

54
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,763
I'm so tense.

55
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,686
Mom.

56
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,194
I've fallen in love with someone.

57
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,566
Who?

58
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,769
My boss.

59
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,972
Does he know that you're a girl?

60
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,741
I'm going to tell him tomorrow.

61
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,715
You must be so worried.

62
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,450
Mom.

63
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,519
Yes, honey?

64
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,988
I'm so tense.

65
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,598
Hello, this is Choi Han-gyeol speaking.

66
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:36,502
Hello?

67
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,772
Hello?

68
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,144
My name is Lee Myeong-jae.

69
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,414
Lee Myeong-jae?

70
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,789
She must be out of her mind.

71
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,991
Hey! Are you really going to go like that?

72
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,399
You're going to cause an uproar today,
wearing that.

73
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,834
I'll see you later.

74
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,575
Eun-chan.

75
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,377
You'll be all right.

76
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,680
You can do it.

77
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,587
I'm so worried.

78
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,156
I'm in love with the boss,

79
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:33,059
and the boss is in love with me.

80
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,627
So what's the problem? It's all right.

81
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:37,630
It's all right!

82
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,300
Everything will be all right, Eun-chan!

83
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,510
Han-gyeol must be meeting
with Lee Myeong-jae right about now.

84
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,545
Yes.

85
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,881
I wonder what they will talk about.

86
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,685
You shouldn't be eating a popsicle
so early in the morning.

87
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:07,059
My dad told me that

88
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,364
I was very fond of you when I was young.

89
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,067
But frankly, I don't remember you at all.

90
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,003
Of course not.

91
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,639
That was such a long time ago.

92
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:25,244
I appreciate you coming out to meet me
like this instead of your dad.

93
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,313
It's nothing.

94
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,015
Your dad tells me that

95
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,018
you plan to pursue a career away
from his company?

96
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,222
He's worried that I'll become a toymaker.

97
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,059
I used to work as a LEGO designer.

98
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,930
My parents and grandma want me
to stop doing that work.

99
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,301
But it was the first job
that I stuck with,

100
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,436
and I've stubbornly insisted on
going back to it.

101
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,239
You're very stubborn,

102
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,741
like your mom.

103
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,645
My mom isn't stubborn at all.

104
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,285
She's always trying to mediate
between my stubborn dad and me.

105
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,929
Do you know my birth mother?

106
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,801
This country is falling to pieces.

107
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,471
You can't find any good news
in the papers.

108
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,075
The economy is struggling,
the politicians are corrupt.

109
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,276
What a mess!

110
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,812
Shut up!

111
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,949
Do you have to sing that garbage
so early in the morning?

112
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,218
It's not garbage, it's rap.

113
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,753
Ya don't dig it rap, ya' square!

114
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,755
Square? Did you just call me a square?

115
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,390
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,694
Eun-chan, your clothes!

117
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,366
You're here early, Mr. Hong.

118
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,901
I guess so.

119
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,274
Eun-chan.

120
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,644
I think you've made a mistake
when you dressed today.

121
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,946
-Where's the boss?
-What?

122
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,948
He hasn't come in yet.

123
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,618
Your clothes...

124
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,222
I guess she had small breasts
to begin with.

125
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,829
Hi, Ha-rim.

126
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,732
What the heck is this?

127
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,405
So you're going to reveal the truth
since even I know your secret now?

128
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,773
Are you making the first move?

129
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,845
Min-yeop, Mr. Hong, and Seong-gi
are really quick to spread the news.

130
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,782
Did they tell you to reveal the truth?

131
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,384
They are so clever.

132
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,987
I'm so sorry, Ha-rim.

133
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,656
I didn't plan on deceiving you
from the very beginning.

134
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,591
You didn't?

135
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,060
Then how could you
make such a fool out of me?

136
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:56,963
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,499
All I've got to say is I'm sorry.

138
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,102
You're sorry? After everything you did,
you're sorry?

139
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:07,273
Fine. Let's say that it doesn't matter
that you deceived me.

140
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,407
But how about Han-gyeol?

141
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,044
Do you know why he didn't show up
for work for all those days?

142
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,781
I guess you do.

143
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,251
Do you have any idea
of how you made him suffer?

144
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,688
I've never seen him suffer
like that much in my life!

145
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,591
How could you play
with his emotions like that?

146
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,361
And not only did you deceive him,

147
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,631
you conspired with others
to continue your deception.

148
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,300
Do you know how many people
you've hurt by your lies?

149
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,770
I would beat you up
but I can't even do that now!

150
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,007
Wait, Ha-rim!

151
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,309
Let go of me!

152
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,479
Does the boss know?

153
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,180
Did you tell him?

154
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,951
-Is that why he isn't here?
-Don't you dare cry.

155
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,821
Are you trying to prove
that you're a girl by crying?

156
00:10:57,923 --> 00:10:59,625
You scare me.

157
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,361
I can't believe
that I ever thought of you as a friend!

158
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:04,997
You're so horrible.

159
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,909
You should be getting to work.

160
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,547
Nobody has ever told me so much
about my birth mother.

161
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,783
I really appreciate it, Mr. Lee.

162
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:25,251
It's nothing.

163
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,753
Seeing you brought back memories
of the good old days.

164
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,854
Thank you.

165
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,723
I'll see you later.

166
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,376
This is a picture of your mom.

167
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,312
This is all I have to give you.

168
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,006
What are you doing?

169
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,609
I left your belongings
and your clothes in the closet.

170
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,844
I'm taking the almond-colored shirt.

171
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,780
I ruined mine in the washing machine.

172
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,081
I asked you what you're doing.

173
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,219
I'm leaving a little early
because of DK's schedule.

174
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,522
We're leaving next Sunday.

175
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,129
But I told you not to leave.

176
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:19,098
Let's not do this anymore.

177
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:22,701
I know how you feel
and you know how I feel.

178
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,171
Nothing's going to change that.

179
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,141
How do I feel?

180
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,044
Do you really know how I feel?

181
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,514
How can you act this way if you do?

182
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,983
I asked you to wait for me.

183
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,252
I admit that I wavered.

184
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,222
I told you I'll end things with Eun-chan.

185
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,859
-I asked you to wait.
-Wait?

186
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:48,427
For what?

187
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,931
For you to love me again?

188
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,600
What shall I do as I wait? Pray?

189
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,869
"Please let him love me again?

190
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,806
Please help him forget
about his love for Eun-chan?"

191
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:04,310
Do I have to wait for you
since Eun-chan is in love

192
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,279
with your cousin

193
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,215
and you'll have to return to me
one of these days?

194
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,252
Should I pray to God to give me
the patience until you love me again?

195
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,589
Is that it?

196
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,691
Yeah. Wait, even if that's what it takes.

197
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,560
You think that I should wait for you

198
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,763
because of my past sins, don't you?

199
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,333
You think that since I ran off
with another guy,

200
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,135
I should be more understanding of you
who is merely in love with another woman?

201
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,237
I know.

202
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,673
I don't have the right
to say these things to you.

203
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,076
That's why I have to leave you.

204
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,245
I don't want to be a burden to you.

205
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,680
Don't force yourself
to stop loving Eun-chan because of me.

206
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,549
Do what your heart leads you to do,

207
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,719
because that's what I did.

208
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,656
Don't go.

209
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,627
You know that you telling me not to go

210
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,062
won't make any difference.

211
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,664
Don't go.

212
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,266
You know me well, right?

213
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,134
I'm going.

214
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:03,736
For once,

215
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,639
can't you just pretend
to give into me and do as I say?

216
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,409
I'll come back for my things later on.

217
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,312
Just be honest
and say it's because of your work.

218
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,916
Don't use any more excuses.

219
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,951
It doesn't mean anything to you

220
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,619
whether I have feelings
for Eun-chan or not.

221
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,024
That's not the real reason you're leaving.

222
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,427
You're leaving because of your ambition.

223
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,530
Either that
or you've fallen for that bastard again.

224
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,198
Why?

225
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,567
Do you feel guilty
about betraying me twice?

226
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,470
Is Eun-chan the best excuse

227
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:41,573
you could come up with?

228
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,510
Yoo-joo!

229
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,378
Han Yoo-joo!

230
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,125
I'm here.

231
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,161
I'm sorry I'm late.

232
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,696
It's all right.

233
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,098
You're the boss, so it's all right.

234
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,272
I'm sorry I'm late.

235
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,140
Where's Eun-chan?

236
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,408
Upstairs.

237
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,558
What are you doing cleaning
the second floor all by yourself?

238
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,126
I'll give you a hand.

239
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,594
Jeez.

240
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,033
Why were you so late?

241
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,302
Something came up.

242
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,906
Did you sleep well last night?

243
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,942
Yeah.

244
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,877
Why are you so listless?

245
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,712
Did you have difficulty sleeping?

246
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,447
No.

247
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,017
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

248
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,488
Because I was so excited.

249
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,193
Let me see your face.

250
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,696
Stop staring at the floor and look at me.

251
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,664
Is cleaning more important to you than me?

252
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,734
How can you say that?

253
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,037
Are you feeling all right?

254
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,242
Yeah, I'm fine.

255
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:25,744
Good.

256
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,180
I have a headache.

257
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:31,984
I said, I have a headache.

258
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,721
Should I get you some aspirin?

259
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,590
Come here.

260
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:42,694
Let's sit for a minute.

261
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,268
This morning, I met a friend of my dad's.

262
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,639
He knew my birth mother.

263
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,010
You want to see my birth mother?

264
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,949
Isn't she pretty?

265
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,685
He says that she was really playful.

266
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,224
She was the homecoming queen in school
and the most popular girl on campus.

267
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,729
She must be where I get
my stunning looks from.

268
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,070
Jeez, I've got so much on my mind.

269
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,142
I wish I didn't have to work today.

270
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,178
Can you comfort me?

271
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,248
How?

272
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:43,789
Like this.

273
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,203
You have a fever.

274
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,611
Do you know what this feeling is?

275
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,617
I feel this aching
and heaviness in my heart

276
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,455
as if it were full of ice.

277
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,825
What could this feeling be?

278
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:24,863
Eun-chan.

279
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,200
Why did we both have to be men?

280
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,572
Maybe we should just elope
to America together.

281
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:37,442
I...

282
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:39,845
I have something to...

283
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,014
Why are there tears in your eyes?

284
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,453
I'm so happy.

285
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,557
It's so nice to have a lover.

286
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,296
I'm almost 30 years old.

287
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,333
What am I going to tell mom?

288
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:40,005
Are you all right?

289
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,675
I was going to beat the crap out of her

290
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,744
but I couldn't bring myself to hit a girl.

291
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,846
I should've known
a guy couldn't be so pretty.

292
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,782
She has made fools out of everyone here.

293
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,653
Don't be too angry about it, Han-gyeol.

294
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,856
They say that you should hate the crime
and not the criminal.

295
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,391
And plus, she has agonized over it too.

296
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,426
So just forget about it.

297
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,662
-What are you talking about?
-Don't you know?

298
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:05,998
-Know what?
-About Eun-chan!

299
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,202
Why do you keep on calling Eun-chan "she"

300
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,037
just because I told you
I'm in love with him?

301
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,574
Don't call him that
or he might beat you up.

302
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,076
-Hasn't Eun-chan told you yet?
-Told me what?

303
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,379
Why that conniving little...

304
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,547
She came into work
wearing girl clothes today.

305
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,650
So I asked her if she's a girl.

306
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,653
And she apologized to me,
her eyes brimming with tears.

307
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,855
I feel so stupid.

308
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,157
She looks exactly like a girl.

309
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,426
I must have been blind
not to have seen it before.

310
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,461
I ought to just dig my eyes out!

311
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,399
What in the world are you talking about?

312
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,234
Eun-chan is a girl.

313
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,138
Mr. Hong, Min-yeop, and Seon-gi were
all in on it.

314
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,873
You and I were the only people
left in the dark.

315
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,343
I mean, if you think about it,
there's no evidence that he's a man.

316
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,611
She doesn't carry around any ID.

317
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:54,079
Have you ever seen her ID, Han-gyeol?

318
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,482
And when we went to the orchard
and after we played basketball,

319
00:21:57,683 --> 00:22:01,019
we went to take the shower together
she insisted on showering alone!

320
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,654
I should have known then!

321
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,990
If you think about it,
there were a bunch of clues.

322
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,093
She doesn't even have any stubble
and she doesn't have any muscles.

323
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,262
Everything pointed to her being a girl.

324
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,596
Why didn't we figure it out earlier?

325
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,633
I'm a fool. I'm an idiot.

326
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:18,470
Eun-chan.

327
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,443
Han-gyeol.

328
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,280
Talk to her after you've calmed down.

329
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:34,086
Look at me.

330
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,458
Ha-rim claims that you're a girl.

331
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,526
Are you really a girl?

332
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,966
What the heck?

333
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,670
Are you really a girl?

334
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,241
Tell me, you bastard. Are you a girl?

335
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,244
I asked you if you were a girl!

336
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,941
Han-gyeol.

337
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,124
Boss!

338
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,196
Boss!

339
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,166
Boss!

340
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,734
Boss!

341
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,275
Boss!

342
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:19,858
Are you a girl or a guy?

343
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,560
You look just like a girl.

344
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,161
Have you served in the army?

345
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,697
-Your resident ID number?
-840805-2371292.

346
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,199
It's one three.

347
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,867
Guys' IDs start with a one.

348
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,337
Why don't you have facial hair?

349
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,840
It's because I don't eat much.

350
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,508
Prince? All guys?

351
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:38,410
Then how about me?

352
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,444
Say hi.

353
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,847
This is Han-sung's girlfriend.

354
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,219
What if I were a girl?

355
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,257
Could we be together if I were a girl?

356
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,228
Do you like me just as a brother?

357
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,096
What do you like about me so much?

358
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,865
Are we brothers now?

359
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,666
Will you love me more?

360
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,767
Then, was I your first kiss?

361
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,503
You said you wouldn't like it
if I were a girl!

362
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:06,204
I thought you were glad that I was a guy!

363
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,119
I hope Han-gyeol
doesn't get into an accident.

364
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,455
I feel so sorry for her.

365
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:25,223
Two special waffles.

366
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,127
Eun-chan looks so depressed right now.

367
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,862
I've never seen her so sad.

368
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,797
Can you stop referring
to Eun-chan as a girl?

369
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,433
Good job, Ha-rim.
You've really done it this time.

370
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,334
What?

371
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,370
What right do you have to get angry?

372
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,538
It's ridiculous.

373
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,773
Shut up, you baboon.

374
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,576
At least, he's not a blabbermouth.

375
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,346
Hello?

376
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,849
Who else knows?

377
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,552
Does everyone know except for me?

378
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:57,822
Aside from Mr. Hong,
Seon-gi, Ha-rim, and Min-yeop,

379
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,091
who else knows?

380
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:03,094
Does Han-sung know as well?

381
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,934
And Yoo-joo too?

382
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,902
Where are you?

383
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:13,371
Let's meet.

384
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:15,006
I need to talk to you.

385
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,041
Answer me, you bastard.

386
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,077
Does Han-sung know or not?

387
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,814
Answer me! Does Han-sung know or not?

388
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,386
He knows.

389
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,321
What are you doing here at this hour?

390
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:09,294
What's the matter?

391
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,263
Why didn't you tell me
that Eun-chan was a girl?

392
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,639
Let's have a glass of wine.

393
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,575
Do you think I'm playing with you?

394
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,310
When did you know?

395
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,746
Why didn't you tell me?

396
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,348
Don't you know
how I agonized because of her?

397
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,084
-Can you say that you didn't know?
-You never asked me.

398
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,055
I didn't have any reason to tell you
since you never brought it up.

399
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,894
You treated that jerk like a woman
from the beginning.

400
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,164
You kept inviting her to your studio
even though you knew he was a girl.

401
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:48,433
On the day of the concert
when Yoo-joo came to the shop,

402
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,367
you were out with her.

403
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:51,936
What the heck is going on?

404
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,039
Are you in love with her?

405
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,441
Were you going out
with her behind my back?

406
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,776
Why are you acting so angry?

407
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,578
Shouldn't you be pleased
that Eun-chan is a girl?

408
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:02,947
Eun-chan is also in love with you
so what's your problem?

409
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,717
So you knew about it all along?

410
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,187
You knew about what happened between us.

411
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,289
And you still didn't tell me?

412
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,126
Your new girlfriend Yoo-joo talked about.

413
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,129
It was Eun-chan, wasn't it?

414
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,733
The woman you brought to the gallery,

415
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,302
it was Eun-chan, wasn't it?

416
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,907
Is that why do hid the truth from me?

417
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,743
-It's because of Eun-chan's situation.
-What situation?

418
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,213
It wouldn't have been the end of the world
if I knew she was a girl!

419
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,449
Okay.

420
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,920
I'm sorry. I guess I acted thoughtlessly.

421
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,457
I just didn't want
to endanger Eun-chan's job

422
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,225
at the coffee shop.

423
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,996
And I thought it was all right

424
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,333
since you were in love with each other.

425
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,045
Tell me the truth.

426
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,781
I don't know what I'll do if you don't.

427
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,351
Who's the woman that Yoo-joo said
that you cheated on her with?

428
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,121
-Do you want me to ask Yoo-joo?
-That's my problem.

429
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,155
So stay out of it.

430
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,590
It's my problem too, so tell me!

431
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:20,024
Stop it.

432
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,460
I don't want to talk about this.

433
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:27,966
Fine, then don't talk about it.

434
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,007
Yoo-joo.

435
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,243
Han-sung won't tell me the truth
so you tell me.

436
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,646
Eun-chan's the woman that Han-sung
brought to the exhibit, wasn't she?

437
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,482
She was the woman
that Han-sung cheated on you with!

438
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,650
What do you think you're doing?

439
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,485
Fine.

440
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,821
I was in love with Eun-chan.

441
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,091
But she turned me down.

442
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,161
And I've gotten over her as well. Happy?

443
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,555
Hello, this is Han-gyeol.

444
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:26,324
I'm out right now
so please leave a message.

445
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,226
It's me.

446
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,696
You weren't answering
your cell phone so I...

447
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:34,866
Are you home?

448
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,838
Can you please answer the phone
if you're home?

449
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,108
I'm really sorry.

450
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,682
You didn't get into an accident, did you?

451
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,392
I have something to say to you.

452
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,795
-Move.
-I need to talk to you.

453
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,134
In the beginning,
I wasn't planning on deceiving you.

454
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:45,970
But I had no choice.

455
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,273
At first...

456
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:53,177
it was because of the money.

457
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,848
The taekwondo gym closed down,
and I didn't have anywhere to work.

458
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,685
Also, I really enjoyed working
at Coffee Prince.

459
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,422
I didn't tell you

460
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,491
because I thought you would fire me...

461
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,696
if I told you that I was a girl.

462
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,597
I'm so sorry.

463
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,867
I was going to tell you.

464
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,836
I wanted to tell you.

465
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,240
But I wanted to maintain
a good relationship with you

466
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,042
until you got to America.

467
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,310
I didn't tell you

468
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:28,413
because I thought you'd never want
to see me again if I did.

469
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,415
I'm sorry.

470
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,219
Tell me it isn't so.

471
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:39,891
Tell me it isn't so, please.

472
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:42,961
Eun-chan.

473
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,365
I won't get angry at you
so please tell me the truth.

474
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,568
You didn't deceive me, did you?

475
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,272
No matter what your reason is,

476
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,008
you wouldn't lie to me, right?

477
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,845
It's not for a day or two

478
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,147
but for months.

479
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,351
Tell me it isn't so, please.

480
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,188
Tell me that you're not a girl.

481
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,593
Tell me that you never deceived me.

482
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,530
Tell me that people who are in love
can't deceive each other

483
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,666
and that this is all
a misunderstanding, please!

484
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,570
I'm sorry.

485
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,807
I'm so sorry!

486
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,778
So you deceived me?

487
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:37,749
Is that it?

488
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:40,618
You...

489
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,122
You deceived me?

490
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,098
So you didn't say anything back to him?

491
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,733
You idiot!

492
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,202
But still,

493
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,338
how could he get so angry at you
without hearing you out?

494
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,740
That guy is so mean.

495
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,477
I didn't like the looks of him
from the very beginning.

496
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,045
He looks so ill-tempered.

497
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:51,716
Just forget about him!

498
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:54,152
I'll introduce you to a really nice guy.

499
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,488
Even if we never meet again,

500
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,925
even if he won't ever see me again,

501
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,163
I want to tell him

502
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,167
that I really love him.

503
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,470
Jeez! Just tell him then.

504
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,742
You're all grown up, Eun-chan.

505
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,644
Crying because of a guy like this.

506
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,747
-You're a woman now.
-Oh, dear.

507
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,017
What does crying because of a guy
have to do with growing up?

508
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,618
Go to your room!

509
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:44,435
-Two iced mochas, boss.
-Okay.

510
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,304
-Hello. Two people?
-Why aren't you here?

511
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,973
Do you think that running this coffee shop
is a joke, Han-gyeol?

512
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,308
Waffles for table eight.

513
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,310
-I'm completely busy too.
-Eun-chan!

514
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,111
I don't want to get involved
with you two anymore.

515
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,346
Fire her yourself if you want to.

516
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:58,282
The employee should be the one
being fired if they did something wrong,

517
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,884
so why are you, the owner, skipping work?

518
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,052
Come to work right now!

519
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:02,753
Eun-chan,

520
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,389
if Han-gyeol fires you, just leave.

521
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,400
Dr. Kim is coming here today

522
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,935
so please come home early, Mom.

523
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,137
Okay.

524
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,281
It's nice to see that you're drinking
the juice I made.

525
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:32,283
I have to keep healthy.

526
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,788
Mom.

527
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,359
I've been thinking about it.

528
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,930
I don't think that we should just let
Lee Myeong-jae leave like this.

529
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,569
I feel strange about having Han-gyeol
be acquainted with his birth father

530
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:53,671
without knowing

531
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,008
who he really is.

532
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,910
I don't think he can bring himself
to leave just yet.

533
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,079
He said he's leaving this week
but I haven't heard from him.

534
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,482
He must want to see Han-gyeol again.

535
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:07,285
Even though he didn't reveal
that he's the birth father,

536
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,354
he probably wants to see Han-gyeol
on a regular basis.

537
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,592
That's understandable in his situation.

538
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:20,631
But what we have to think about is
what's good for Han-gyeol.

539
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:27,171
It seems like just yesterday
when we first brought him here.

540
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,241
Thank you.

541
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,144
How could you come to work today?

542
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:36,247
-What would you like?
-A cup of coffee.

543
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,515
A coffee or an iced coffee?

544
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,985
Don't you know that only men are allowed
to work at this establishment?

545
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,057
I'll quit when he tells me to.

546
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,059
But until then,
I hope I can show my sincerity.

547
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:51,629
How can you be so shameless?

548
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,765
Do you just do whatever you want to do
regardless of how it affects others?

549
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,268
I just can't understand you.

550
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,569
Then don't understand her.

551
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,505
If you can't understand her, don't.
So what's your problem?

552
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,442
Go over there and clear that table.
I'll take care of things here.

553
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:05,676
Okay.

554
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,015
What in the world are you so angry about?

555
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,751
Isn't it a good thing she's a girl
since they are in love?

556
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:14,985
So what?

557
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,221
She deceived him
and he can't trust her anymore.

558
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,390
If trust is that important to you,

559
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,459
why do you keep going out
with so many different women?

560
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,131
Hey, when are you free? Let's have it out!

561
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,482
Boss, I...

562
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,184
I only deceived you
because of my love for Eun-sae.

563
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:48,753
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,989
Is your love the only love
that's important?

565
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,225
How could you stab me
in the back like that

566
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,659
pretending to be stupid and naïve?

567
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,269
I've set aside Eun-chan's wages.

568
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,805
But there's still six days to go
until payday.

569
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,140
Should I deduct it or not?

570
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,809
Since when have you ever discussed things
with me?

571
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,046
Do whatever you want.

572
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,049
That girl has been struggling to support
her family for so long.

573
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,353
She was 16 when her dad passed away.

574
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,555
And she has always been kind of a tomboy

575
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:25,990
because she had to work

576
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,758
throughout her life.

577
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,261
It's not like she was happy
about deceiving you.

578
00:40:32,396 --> 00:40:34,732
Fine! Forget it.
I guess it's not my problem.

579
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:38,102
Give Eun-chan her pay and let her go.

580
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,038
You're the one who hired her
so you fire her.

581
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:47,745
Are you sure you want to move with me?

582
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,415
The fact that you're moving to New York

583
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,552
even though you're not very interested
in the job

584
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,954
means that you're moving there
because of me, doesn't it?

585
00:40:57,021 --> 00:40:58,289
-Hello.
-Hello.

586
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,758
I'm running away.

587
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,561
What if he comes after you?

588
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,363
Since you're running away
and he'll come after you,

589
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,098
you guys are like a crook and a cop.

590
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,603
I've never seen a crook wanting
to be caught as much as you do.

591
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,615
You know each other, don't you?

592
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,686
I think this is our second meeting.
We met once in New York.

593
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:34,091
Actually, this is our third meeting.
We met twice in New York.

594
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,562
Have you eaten?
We just got back from dining out.

595
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,830
Would you like something?

596
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,732
Can I get a cup of coffee?

597
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,501
Sure.

598
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,045
I saw a movie
that you were working on in Japan.

599
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,147
We should work together.

600
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:00,851
I think it would be fun to stage
a performance involving music and art.

601
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:03,187
I see.

602
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,529
I'm out of coffee.

603
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:12,563
Have some tea instead.

604
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:17,468
Do you remember this tea, DK?

605
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,936
It's a lemon balm.

606
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,572
I bought this at that shop.

607
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,208
You know, the tea shop
behind your country house.

608
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,711
Don't you remember?

609
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,848
There's a small herb garden behind it.

610
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:34,051
Oh, the Joy Coffee Shop?

611
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:35,653
Yeah. That's it.

612
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,455
-Do you still like their walnut pie?
-Wait.

613
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:42,626
I'm sorry, but could you leave us alone
for a minute?

614
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:47,665
As a matter of fact,
I was just about to leave.

615
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,237
Hold on.

616
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,146
I'm sorry.

617
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,448
He's just a little angry at me right now.
That's all.

618
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,616
Please excuse his behavior.

619
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:10,287
You're in love with Han-sung
and he's in love with you

620
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,889
so what's the problem?

621
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,600
Do I have to answer that?

622
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:31,075
You know I still have feelings for you,
don't you?

623
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,845
If you know how I feel about you,

624
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,247
how could you use me
to make that guy jealous?

625
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,317
I'm sorry.

626
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,455
I don't even know
why I'm acting like this.

627
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,692
Tell me the truth. What's going on?

628
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,568
I just don't want Han-sung
seeing other women.

629
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:04,341
I don't know whether I should
compliment you for being honest

630
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:09,513
or get angry at you for using me.

631
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,084
I'm always hurting your feelings.

632
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,659
I don't like walnut pie anymore.

633
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:24,294
See you.

634
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,433
Aren't you going to call a cab?

635
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,569
I'm going to go for a walk.

636
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:33,737
Bye.

637
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,658
Why do I feel jealous seeing that guy?

638
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:57,528
Aren't I funny?

639
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,536
Is this really what you want?

640
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:08,205
Are you positive
that you'll be happy without me?

641
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:10,808
Are you sure you'll be happy with DK?

642
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,480
What is it that you really want?

643
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,518
We can't have everything we want.

644
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:26,023
Just as you can't have Eun-chan.

645
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,459
What are you talking about?
I never wanted to have Eun-chan.

646
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,994
Yoo-joo.

647
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,467
Let's stop with this nonsense.

648
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,403
Since I wasn't thinking right before,

649
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,105
I needed time to get over Eun-chan.

650
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:43,941
And I'm over her.

651
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,718
So you're finally over her?

652
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,523
You asked me for time
when I told you I would leave.

653
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,295
I thought that you would tell me

654
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:07,164
that you were over her

655
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,233
and ask me not to leave.

656
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,301
But instead, you asked me for some time.

657
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,507
I know that you hate lying,

658
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,511
but I was hoping that you would lie
to me at the time.

659
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:22,179
I hoped you would tell me
that she's nothing.

660
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,882
"I only want you, Han Yoo-joo."

661
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,817
That's what I hoped you would say.

662
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,052
-What are you trying to say?
-You're not over her.

663
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,654
You're not telling the truth.

664
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,190
You just said you know how I hate lying.

665
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,626
So why don't you believe me?

666
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,127
Look into my eyes and tell me.

667
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,397
Does Eun-chan really mean nothing to you?

668
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,604
It's too short for you
to have gotten over her already.

669
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:49,339
Maybe not for me, but for you.

670
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:56,513
I can change easily
and stop loving people easily,

671
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,414
but not you!

672
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,183
It takes you a lot of time
to fall in love,

673
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:01,218
and it takes you a lot of time
to fall out of love again.

674
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:03,954
You're different from me!

675
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,623
-That's why you scare me and anger me!
-Yoo-joo...

676
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:09,760
From the time I met you,

677
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:14,565
until Eun-chan came along,
I was the only woman you ever loved.

678
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:16,333
You turned down all the women
who approached you.

679
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,802
You wouldn't even drink a cup of coffee
with women other than me!

680
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,640
You were always by my side
when I needed you,

681
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:25,509
I could never do wrong in your eyes

682
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,211
and I was your one and only!

683
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,713
But now...

684
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,617
I guess you've made me expect
too many things from you.

685
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,189
-But nothing has changed.
-No! Everything has changed,

686
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:42,793
because I can't trust you anymore.

687
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:48,365
So...

688
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,734
you're just going to leave?

689
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,337
If you leave like this,

690
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,673
then it's over forever.

691
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,709
I hate this place! I hate everything here!

692
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:03,313
What am I supposed to do with a man
who's secretly in love with another woman?

693
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,448
So, you're leaving me again?

694
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,085
You never even gave me a chance.

695
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,021
You jumped to your own conclusions
and made your own decision!

696
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,056
What did I do that was so wrong, huh?

697
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:18,996
But then and now...

698
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,936
I guess it has always been easy for you
to leave me.

699
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:45,455
-I'm going home.
-Goodnight.

700
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,428
Are you going home, Han-gyeol?

701
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,362
Yeah.

702
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:06,610
I hate drinking beer
because you have to pee so constantly.

703
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,645
That's what happens with beer.

704
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:09,613
Why did you call me?

705
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,181
You know...

706
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,518
you can erase a bad poem
and write it again,

707
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,788
you can block the flow of water.

708
00:49:17,854 --> 00:49:21,124
You can even make an airplane go
back the way it came.

709
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,626
Do you mean airplanes can fly backward?

710
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:26,096
Haven't you seen those jets in air shows
that can fly backward?

711
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:30,334
Anyway, everything can be stopped,
fixed, and reversed.

712
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,670
Except for my heart which can't be
stopped, fixed, or reversed.

713
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,039
I'm going through such agony these days.

714
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:41,211
Is it just me, or is this neighborhood
full of hopeless romantics?

715
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,983
I'm so sick and tired of waiting
for Ji-hyang to return my love.

716
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:50,687
It would be better to wait
for the Rockies to crumble.

717
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,056
Didn't you like the woman you were set up
with this time around?

718
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,692
She did nothing for me.

719
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,894
Her face was pretty,
she had a lot of makeup on

720
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,531
and I could tell that she had
had a few dozen facelifts done.

721
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,335
My heart...

722
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,038
I just couldn't give her my heart.

723
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,515
Why did you have to come here

724
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,784
so late at night and bother me? Here.

725
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,285
Go and get some beer.

726
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,653
I don't have any beer.

727
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,922
Would it kill you to go
to the neighborhood supermarket

728
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:28,025
and buy me some beer?

729
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,059
Hey.

730
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,029
I heard that you were really
raking in the dough these days.

731
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:35,365
I heard that people come from miles around

732
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:37,667
just to drink coffee at your place.

733
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:41,104
That's the power of money.

734
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,175
It isn't the money.
It's because of the taste of my coffee.

735
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:50,280
Hey! It's because you spent money
renovating the shop as you did.

736
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,249
Your shop would still be empty

737
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,852
all the time if you had left it
the way it was.

738
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,221
Come to think of it, it's not just
because of my coffee.

739
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,691
The kids who work there
are really putting in an effort.

740
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:06,863
I never thought I would like them,
but I've grown fond of them.

741
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:11,401
Now I know you've grown old
if you've become fond of kids.

742
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:13,637
You should go out with Mr. Gu.

743
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:15,105
He's quite an all right guy.

744
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,741
I know that he's an all right guy.

745
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:22,312
That's why I hope that he meets
a nice woman and gets married.

746
00:51:22,379 --> 00:51:24,981
I heard that the woman he saw today
did not have any extra baggage.

747
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,685
He should just marry her
and live happily ever after.

748
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,287
Think again,

749
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,824
or you could regret it
for the rest of your life.

750
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,125
By the way,

751
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:40,130
how are things between Eun-chan
and her boss at the shop?

752
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:43,700
-Why?
-She has been acting so down lately.

753
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,702
She won't eat anything
and lies in bed all day long.

754
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,137
Don't worry about her.

755
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:49,773
Although it seems serious right now,

756
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,675
it's something
everybody has to go through.

757
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,144
It's all part of growing up.

758
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,646
Is her boss very angry?

759
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,748
Of course. Wouldn't you be angry?

760
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,687
I could really use some beer,

761
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:04,888
but you won't give me any.

762
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,556
I'm leaving.

763
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,492
You shouldn't drink too much.

764
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,060
You nag like a wife.

765
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:14,097
-When did you get here?
-In the afternoon.

766
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,167
You should have called me then
so I could come home early.

767
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,904
Wow, I haven't had spicy cold noodles
in such a while.

768
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,072
This looks delicious.

769
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,273
You should have some too, Mom.

770
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,242
You're not eating
that just to make me happy

771
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,177
even though you're not hungry, are you?

772
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,180
Jeez, Mom. I'm not stupid.

773
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,216
Why would I eat an entire bowl of noodles
if I weren't hungry?

774
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,451
You should eat with me, Mom.

775
00:52:34,518 --> 00:52:37,754
No. It will go straight to my belly
if I eat at this hour.

776
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,258
Then it's all right for me
to develop a potbelly?

777
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:42,792
Yeah.

778
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,137
Eat slowly.

779
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:57,174
I met Dad's friend today.

780
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,044
I heard from your dad.

781
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,085
Don't you want to see
what your birth mother looks like?

782
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:11,855
I've seen her picture.

783
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,193
Dad's friend gave it to me.

784
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:20,797
I see.

785
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,801
He seemed like quite a close friend.

786
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:29,172
Do you feel hurt?

787
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:32,209
Not really.

788
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,884
I feel sorry for your mom
who gave birth to such a great son

789
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:45,555
and passed away
without seeing you grow up.

790
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:51,661
I feel sorry and grateful to her.

791
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:56,333
Mom.

792
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:58,568
Yes?

793
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,438
I just felt like calling you.

794
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:10,680
Perhaps you're the only person
in the world who trusts me.

795
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,458
Who could it be at this hour?

796
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:29,899
Why, hello ma'am.

797
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,368
It's Mr. Hong.

798
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,505
What a great view!

799
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,943
Hey, sell this place to me
when I make a lot of money later on.

800
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:43,480
Okay.

801
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,685
You're a lot more naïve than you look.

802
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,323
Am I wrong?

803
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:58,094
You've got this cold, hard exterior

804
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,264
but you've completely lost your mind
over a girl.

805
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,067
It feels strange to call her a girl.

806
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,236
Maybe I should call her "that person."
I know.

807
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,138
How about "bastard?"

808
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,541
I think I'll just stick to "girl."

809
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,910
Is this fun for you?

810
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:15,979
A long time ago...

811
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:20,417
there was a woman I was in love with.

812
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:24,020
You mean, the woman
that you ran the coffee shop with?

813
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:26,022
Yeah.

814
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,725
She could really lie up a storm.

815
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:35,365
Everything that came out of her mouth
was a lie.

816
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,803
She would tell me she was going out
with friends

817
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,405
and go out drinking with another guy.

818
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,341
She would tell me
she was going home to her parents

819
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,142
and stay out all night dancing.

820
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,879
I gave her money for the hospital
when she said she was sick

821
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,681
and she would spend it
on jewelry and accessories.

822
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,652
It was like she was a pro at it.

823
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:57,654
Do you know what she told me
when she left me?

824
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:59,556
That she was going abroad to study!

825
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,627
She said that there was something
she had wanted to study

826
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,296
since she was a child.

827
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,231
So although it pained me greatly,
I gave her money

828
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:11,301
and let her leave to pursue her dreams
saying that I would wait for her.

829
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,269
Guess what? A year later,
I found out she got married

830
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:14,904
and living with some guy in Ulsan.

831
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,242
So, you really loved a woman like that?

832
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:23,613
I became neck-deep in debt because of her

833
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,416
and I lost all my friends.

834
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:29,919
What's funny?
It makes me angry just to hear your story.

835
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:32,789
Thinking of her always makes me laugh.

836
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:36,126
She must have loved me a lot.

837
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:38,027
Even though she went out drinking
with other guys,

838
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:40,397
loved to party,
spent money thoughtlessly...

839
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,232
I still loved her.

840
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:44,868
But she must have thought
I would leave her

841
00:56:44,934 --> 00:56:46,369
if I found out that she did those things.

842
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,505
She must have loved me a lot

843
00:56:49,806 --> 00:56:52,175
to lie like that in order to be with me.

844
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,813
I never got into a single fight with her
during the entire time we lived together.

845
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,516
-I bet you're lying.
-It's the truth.

846
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,950
It's because I had a foolproof way

847
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:04,587
of calming myself whenever I got angry.

848
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,624
I would ask myself, "So what?

849
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:09,926
So what if you're angry at her?

850
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,496
Can you really live without her?"

851
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:16,399
I asked myself that.

852
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,571
Then, my anger
would disappear just like that.

853
00:57:25,742 --> 00:57:27,110
Is that what you came here to tell me?

854
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:29,879
That if I'm not going to break up
with Eun-chan,

855
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,381
I might as well just let this go?

856
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,284
You're always like that, Mr. Hong.

857
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,224
Forget it then.

858
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,394
I need another drink.

859
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,307
The Koh Eun-chan robot is here
to save the day.

860
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,045
It's for you.

861
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:06,816
Whether you're a guy

862
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,486
or an alien,

863
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,067
I hate you.

864
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:27,170
I hate you.

865
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,041
I miss you.

866
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,980
I miss you.

867
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:43,753
I miss you.

868
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,561
I miss you.

869
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,069
Frankly, it was kind of fun to watch.

870
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,539
It was funny how you two tried
to hide your feelings for each other.

871
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,976
But if I were the boss,
I would be ticked off too.

872
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:09,078
I really understand
why he's acting that way.

873
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,820
So what do you call each other now?

874
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,889
"Sis" and "bro"?

875
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,426
I don't really care about
whether she's a "sis" or a "bro".

876
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:27,030
What? You don't care?

877
00:59:27,864 --> 00:59:30,500
You don't care that the people around you
are going through such heartache?

878
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,836
How can you be so callous, Seon-gi?

879
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,181
Everyone seems to be on your side.

880
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,151
That must make you so happy.

881
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,353
I'm sorry.

882
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:52,755
I was thoughtless.

883
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,458
I should have told you
from the very beginning.

884
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,628
I didn't think that things
would turn out this way.

885
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,263
I don't want to hear it.
I want you to leave.

886
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,698
Can you listen to what I have to say?

887
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,337
Was it fun for you?

888
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:11,441
A crazy guy asked you
to act as his gay lover.

889
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:15,411
And you got a load of money
for going along with it.

890
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:17,747
He found you a job,

891
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,616
and said that he loves you
even though you're a guy.

892
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:22,685
That's how it must have been.

893
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,822
I must have looked like such a pushover.

894
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,758
Ms. Koh Eun-chan.

895
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,427
So, just when were you planning
to tell me?

896
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:34,797
Until now, you had more than
enough time to tell me.

897
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,836
Didn't you know my feelings

898
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,072
when I asked you to be my blood brother?

899
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,709
Didn't you know
that I constantly glanced your way?

900
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:49,712
Didn't you know how much
I agonized over us at the beach?

901
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:53,316
Didn't you know why I didn't come
into the shop for days on end?

902
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,121
Tell me.

903
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,456
Did you really not know?

904
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,561
I just couldn't bring myself to tell you.

905
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:11,000
I didn't know what I would do
if you got mad at me

906
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,936
and I thought I would never
see you again if I told you the truth.

907
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:17,540
I'm so sorry. I'm so very sorry.

908
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,642
All you thought of was yourself.

909
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,012
You didn't care how much I was suffering.

910
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:27,884
When I said I loved you
even though you were a guy.

911
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:30,820
When I said
that we should take this all the way.

912
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:33,790
You could have at least told me.

913
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:38,961
-Was it fun for you?
-It wasn't fun!

914
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,430
It wasn't fun at all!

915
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,766
I didn't tell you
because I loved you too much.

916
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,669
I just wanted to keep things
the way they were

917
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:49,038
since you were going to go to America
in a month.

918
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,474
That's why I didn't tell you.

919
01:01:56,612 --> 01:01:59,048
And to think that I was thinking
of eloping with you to America.

920
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:03,586
But you were already thinking
about how to send me off.

921
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,524
What was I to you?

922
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:19,402
You said that
you wouldn't like me as a girl.

923
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,772
You said that you were glad
that I was a guy.

924
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,741
What was I to do?
I couldn't go a day without--

925
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,696
It was better
when I thought you were a guy.

926
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:51,968
What's left between us?

927
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:55,071
Was there ever any trust between us?

928
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,979
I was willing to throw away my entire life
in order to have you.

929
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:09,719
But all you did was try to keep yourself
from getting hurt.

930
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,255
You never gave me a second thought.

931
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,769
Why don't you try asking yourself

932
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:02,305
if you can really live without Eun-chan?

933
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,708
The reason that Eun-chan
finally got around to tell you

934
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,476
is because she trusted you.

935
01:04:07,944 --> 01:04:11,414
I feel angry at Han-sung for falling
for Eun-chan and I hate Eun-chan as well.

936
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,915
Don't go, Yoo-joo.

937
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:14,817
If you hurt Han-sung again.

938
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,285
I don't think I could forgive you.

939
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:19,889
I regret not telling him earlier.

940
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:22,658
I wish I hadn't fallen in love with him
in the first place.

941
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,061
Eun-chan.

942
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:27,630
I'm so glad that you're a girl.

943
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,002
