1
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:19,734
Choyeop!

2
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,914
They're untied again?

3
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,804
How have you been?

4
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,257
I've been good, you?

5
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:46,890
Good as always.

6
00:00:47,843 --> 00:00:49,945
Wanna get something cold to drink?

7
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:51,585
Sounds good.

8
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,171
What do you feel like drinking?

9
00:00:57,835 --> 00:01:02,585
(Summer Grass)

10
00:01:12,898 --> 00:01:14,851
It's fine, just sit down.

11
00:01:15,218 --> 00:01:17,890
You never know who sat here.

12
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,164
You're something.

13
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,804
What happened to your knees?

14
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,359
Oh, this?

15
00:01:26,148 --> 00:01:28,609
I don't know, I can't remember.

16
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:30,828
You should be careful.

17
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:38,789
Hey Kangii, I actually wanted to ask you...

18
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:41,679
Sorry, hold on.

19
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,914
I was texting Doa earlier.

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,562
Forgot to reply to her.

21
00:01:47,632 --> 00:01:48,570
Doa?

22
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,468
Yeah, just a sec.

23
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:01,328
You wanted to ask me something?

24
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,320
Oh, um, what do you think of Doa?

25
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:06,742
Doa?

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,648
I don't know, why are you asking?

27
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,500
I don't know, you two seem good together.

28
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,101
Really? Me and Doa?

29
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:19,823
I guess I do want to get to know her a bit.

30
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:23,093
But I think she thinks of me as a friend.

31
00:02:24,164 --> 00:02:25,851
Doa seemed to like you too.

32
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:27,976
Really?

33
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,242
How do you know?

34
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,625
I can just tell.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,562
The way she looks at you...

36
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:36,828
Yeah?

37
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:41,789
Should I try a bit harder then?

38
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:50,445
By the way, Doa's really interested in you.

39
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:52,984
She wants to get closer to you.

40
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:54,765
To me?
Yeah.

41
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,444
She says she happens to be around here.

42
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:01,640
Should I tell her to join us?

43
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,109
Sure.

44
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,476
Choyeop!

45
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,230
We haven't seen each other in so long.

46
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:40,820
I really missed you.

47
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,281
It's been long.

48
00:03:43,006 --> 00:03:43,859
You came.

49
00:03:43,884 --> 00:03:45,679
Hey, Mr. Kangii.

50
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:50,796
What took you so long?

51
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:51,898
You said you were nearby.

52
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:55,031
Oh, I was actually home.

53
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:56,976
What?

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,937
It's hard to see Choyeop around, you know.

55
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:02,265
I thought you might change your mind
if I told you I was going to take a while.

56
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,805
So I rushed here.

57
00:04:05,008 --> 00:04:07,202
Hey Choyeop, your shoelaces are loose.

58
00:04:08,617 --> 00:04:10,492
Her shoelaces always untie themselves.

59
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:13,232
That's because she ties them too tight.

60
00:04:13,257 --> 00:04:14,898
Come on, seriously?

61
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:16,093
Seriously.
Who says?

62
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,070
I say!

63
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,250
What's that?

64
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:23,914
I packed some fruits to eat.

65
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:27,367
How'd you know we were craving fruits?

66
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,906
Great minds think alike?

67
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,734
It's a perfect day for fruits.

68
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,969
Doa really has amazing instincts.

69
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,274
Yes, I do.

70
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,915
Choyeop, you like apples, right?

71
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:39,196
How did you know?

72
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:41,544
I saw you eating them
when we were working on that project.

73
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,231
Hey, your hands!

74
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,966
What about your hands?

75
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:53,575
It's okay, I don't mind.

76
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,325
Oh, you...

77
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,333
Oh, you yourself.

78
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:00,239
These are good.

79
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:08,755
Look, she's dazing off again.

80
00:05:10,856 --> 00:05:12,700
She's gone to a different space.

81
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,544
She's so funny.

82
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:21,739
It's so cute.

83
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,075
I'm gonna quickly go wash my hands.

84
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:26,800
Want me to go with you?

85
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,458
Oh, let him go by himself.

86
00:05:28,804 --> 00:05:30,294
Yeah, I'll be quick.

87
00:05:58,661 --> 00:05:59,536
Why?

88
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:03,059
Your eyes are really pretty.

89
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:04,848
Me?

90
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:07,270
I can't help looking at them.

91
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:09,864
Your eyes are bigger.

92
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:12,145
I like your kind of eyes better.

93
00:06:17,997 --> 00:06:20,754
Want to try a strawberry?
It's really sweet.

94
00:06:22,489 --> 00:06:23,544
It's okay.

95
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,153
Oh come on, try it.

96
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,317
It's really delicious.

97
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:28,575
It's okay, really.

98
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:33,351
Can I take a bite of your apple?

99
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:36,809
Okay.

100
00:06:45,997 --> 00:06:47,356
It's really good.

101
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:56,731
You can have the rest.

102
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:59,325
Why? Is it because I ate it?

103
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,270
No, it's not that.

104
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,510
I'm just finished with it.

105
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:05,981
When is he coming back?

106
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,255
How did you meet Kangii?

107
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:18,145
It was a long time ago.

108
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,825
Almost ten years?

109
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,325
How did you two become friends?

110
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,114
I don't know.

111
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:31,364
We just clicked from the beginning.

112
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,676
It happened naturally.

113
00:07:36,731 --> 00:07:38,731
I thought you two were a couple at first

114
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,723
because you were so close.

115
00:07:44,856 --> 00:07:47,302
You don't usually make
a lot of friends. Do you?

116
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:50,403
You're right, I don't have friends.

117
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:52,434
What do you do when you're alone?

118
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,552
Nothing special.

119
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:57,286
I'm usually lying down.

120
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,200
That's really interesting.

121
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,747
What's so interesting about that?

122
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:15,888
How do you feel about Kangii?

123
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,450
He's here.

124
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,567
Wow, what's that?

125
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,989
I bought it at the store over there.

126
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:40,716
Thought it'd be nice to sit on the grass.

127
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:42,028
Very nice.

128
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:44,075
You have amazing instincts, Mr. Kangii.

129
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,989
Right?

130
00:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,161
It's so nice here.

131
00:08:56,122 --> 00:08:57,247
You guys should come too.

132
00:08:58,245 --> 00:09:00,098
The sky is so blue today.

133
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,114
Doa, what are you doing there?
Come here.

134
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:28,958
Should I?

135
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:49,355
Wow, it looks really pretty from here.

136
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,381
Doesn't it?

137
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,364
Yeah...

138
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:55,161
Do you see that cloud over there?

139
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:59,395
Doesn't that look like a deer?

140
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:01,317
It looks like a cloud.

141
00:10:02,774 --> 00:10:04,958
Come on, look again.

142
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:07,192
Choyeop, you should lie down too.

143
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:08,817
It looks really different from here.

144
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,591
I should get going.

145
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:39,708
It does look like a deer.

146
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,067
Right?

147
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:43,724
I told you it looks like a deer.
