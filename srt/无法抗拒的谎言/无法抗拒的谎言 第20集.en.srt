I'm the chairman's special assistant, Li Tingjiang.

The eye drops.

106
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,050
I went to several malls

107

to find this brand for you.

108
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,370
I usually use these when I work late.

109

You've been so tired lately.

110

Come on.

111
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,480
I'll give you some drops.

112
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,400
Don't move.

113
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,510

116
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,320

No.

121

122

127
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,840
Actually, you don't need to do anything for me.

128
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,700

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,370
And

137
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,020
bring Su Qing with you.

138
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,240
Okay.

139
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,050
Any other arrangements?

140
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,020
As for what happened before,

141
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,250
I'll take it as a joke.

142
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Since Su Qing is willing to help you,

143
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,360
you should cooperate with her

144
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,610
and finish the resort project together.

145
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,160
As for Jiang Lai,

146
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,440
I advise you

147
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,490
to break up with her as soon as possible.

148
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,210
After all, you two seem to be
from different worlds.

149
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,920
I'll work well with Su Qing.

150
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,450
Because she is indeed

151
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,850
an excellent architect.

152
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,480
As for my love affair,

153
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,890
you don't have to worry about it.

154
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,210
Do you really think you can be with her forever?

155
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,540
If you weren't my son

156
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,660
and you couldn't help her get the farm,

157
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,030
do you think she could be with you?

158
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,930
Could she fall in love with you?

159
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:48,730
There's no if.

160
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,250
If you hadn't fallen in love with my mom,

161
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,770
you couldn't set up

164
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,530
I'm doing this for your own good.

165
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,480
You have to know the trade-offs.

166
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,520
Okay.

167
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,830
I want to see how far you can go with her.

168
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay.

169
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,680
If there's nothing else I can do, I'll leave.

170
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,480
You go on.

171

172
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,750
He's not like me at all.

173
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,070
I was too sleepy just now.

174
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:56,460
I fell asleep.

175
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,790
Why aren't you back yet?

176
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,050
I'm going to have dinner with my dad tonight.

177
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,650
Remember to eat by yourself.

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,930
Aren't you coming back for dinner?

179
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,340
When will you come back?

180
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,380
Zhou Yu.

181
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,400
Let's go.

182
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,740
I might go back late.

183
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:13,580
Take a rest if you're tired.

184
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:15,970
Okay.

185
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,560
Don't work too hard.

186
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:18,650
Okay.

187
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,200
Bye.

188
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,240
He should be here soon.

189
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,810
I don't have a watch.

190
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,360
Chairman.

191
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,050
Please come in.

192
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,560
Okay.

193
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,120
Here.

194
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,560
Dad!

195
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,570
Qing.

196
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,570
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

197
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,140
I wanted to give you a big surprise.

198
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,580
Uncle Su.

199
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,170
Yu has grown up.

200
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,060
You're indeed a young talent.

201
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,800
Not at all.

202
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,260
-Thank you.
-You're good.

203
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,410
Let's not stand here.

204
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,900
Take a seat.

205
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,400
Have a seat.

206
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,520
Come on.

207
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,050
Let's go.

208
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,880
Thank you.

209
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,170
Come on.

210
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,710
Su.

211
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,240
Come on.

212
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,640
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

213
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,890
I'm so relieved

214
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,570
that your son is in charge.

215
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,650
-Uncle Su.
-Come on, Yu.

216
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,500
Here's to you.

217
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,360
Come on.

218
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,480
Yu

219
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,640
is not as good as Qing.

220
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
The resort plan is designed by Qing.

221
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,140
It's a perfect blend

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,070
of humanity and architectural aesthetics.

223
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,070
Qing's plan

224
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,970
is extraordinary.

225
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,880
Qing.

226
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,140
Drink a toast to Uncle Zhou.

227
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,210
Uncle Zhou.

228
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,010
Here's to you.

229
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,610
Girls should drink less.

230
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,000
Yu.

231
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,290
Drink it for Qing.

232
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,930
Come on.

233
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,730
Yu.

234
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,390
You're a good drinker.

235
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,310
Su.

236
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,670
Look at them.

237
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,690
They look great together.

238
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,890
Yu

239
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,700
is really handsome.

240
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,550
Qing

241
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,980
is outstanding.

242
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,130
Do you know that?

243
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,850
Qing's plan

244
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,930
is very good.

245
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,580
Do you want to see it?

246
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,440
It'll definitely be impressive.

247
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,330
I'm really looking forward to it.

248
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,060
Come on.

249
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,520
Come on.

250
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,250
Let's drink.

251
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,750
Jiang Lai.

252
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,100
Chairman needs

253
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,330
a design plan for the resort.

254
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,280
I'll send you the location.

255
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,810
Hurry up and bring it there.

256
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Now?

257
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,170
Yes.

258
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,410
I'll be right there.

259
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,200
Yu.

260
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,460
Have another drink with Uncle Su.

261
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:14,980
Okay.

262
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,510
-Yu.
-Uncle Su.

263
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,320
Here's to you.

264
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:17,840
Come on.

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,770
Cheers.

266
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,450
Don't let him drink so much.

267
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,340
He can't drink as much as you do.

268
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,210
Dad.

269
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,570
You're not married yet
and you're worried about him?

270
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,050
Are you okay?

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,930
Girls have to get married
when they become adults.

272
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,410
Thank you.

273
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,980
We'll be a family sooner or later.

274
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,580
Yes.

275
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,850
Su.

276
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,270
I think

277
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,000
it's time to put the marriage

278
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,600
on the agenda.

279
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,520
Why are you here to deliver this?

280
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,350
Assistant Zhao asked me to give it to Chairman.

281
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,630
Give it to me.

282
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,140
I'll take it in for you.

283
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,680
Thank you.

284
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you want me to tell Zhou Yu?

285
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,040
No.

286
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
I'm leaving.

287
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,010
Sorry.

288
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,400
Thank you.

289
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,770
Are you really okay?

290
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,860
Yes.

291
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm leaving.

292
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
Why do you have time
to invite me for skewers today?

293
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,460
Don't you have to go on a date with Zhou Yu?

294
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,440
You were fined so much
for stealing the phone for me.

295
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,680
I have to make it up to you.

296
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,140
Come on.

297
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,840
Cheers.

298
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,400
Something's wrong with you.

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
There must be something.

300
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,450
Stop talking nonsense and eat.

301
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,760
I know you well.

302
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,010
Tell me.

303
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,210
What happened between you and Zhou Yu?

304
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Is it so obvious?

305
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,000
Maybe Zhou Yu and I

306
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,880
are not suitable for each other.

307
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,340
Why do you say that?

308
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,530
Be careful.

309
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,640
This way.

310
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,320
This way. Straighten up.

311
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,480
Watch the steps.

312
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,720
Lie down here.

313
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,410
Okay.

314
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,380
So,

315
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,660
Zhou Yu and I are from two different worlds.

316
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,910
Alright, stop drinking.

317
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,580
-You're drunk.
-Give it to me.

318
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,920
I shouldn't have let you get involved in this.

319
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,040
You drank too much.

320
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,180
Let me send you home.

321
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,480
No.

322
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,830
I won't go back.

323
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,390
I want to call Zhou Yu

324
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,220
and ask him if he loves me.

325
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,340
Where is Zhou Yu?

326
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,800
[Zhou Yu]

327
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,470
Jiang Lai?

328
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,170
Miss Su, why are you here?

329
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,410
Zhou Yu was drunk yesterday.

330
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,600
I sent him home.

331
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,740
I was afraid something would happen to him.

332
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,670
So I stayed here to take care of him.

333
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,100
Don't worry. I slept on the sofa.

334
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,790
Nothing happened between us.

335
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,390
That's not what I meant.

336
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,550
It's getting late.

337
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,750
See you in the office.

338
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,320
Are you just back or are you going out?

339
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,840
I had dinner with Qi Wei last night. It was too late.

340
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,240
So I went back to the farm.

341
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,040
I was drunk last night.

342
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,860
I can't remember anything.

343
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,280
Did Chen Jun send me home?

344
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,140
Maybe.

345
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,650
You don't know

346
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,810
that I had dinner
with Su Qing's father yesterday.

347
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,550
I accidentally drank too much.

348
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,350
Did the talk go well?

349
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,450
Yes.

350
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,350
He kept letting me drink.

351
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,300
I didn't remember anything in the end.

352
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,230
I drank too much.

353
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,680
Great job.

354
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,410
You cooked that?

355
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,860
By the way, let's visit grandpa
together tomorrow.

356

Do you want to have some?

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,360

[Jiang Lai]

359

Mingde, you didn't go to the group today?

360
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,560
Are you going out?

361
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,350
No, I'm just packing my closet.

362
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,960
It's a nice day today.

363
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,070
You can wash Chengzhen's clothes too.

364
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,280
Okay.

365
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,740
I'll go and call the maid.

366
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,350
I forgot to tell you.

367
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,450
I gave her a day off.

368
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,620
You should also

369
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,820
do the laundry for our son, right?

370
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:01,610
It's better to wash them by hand.

371
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,100
Of course.

372
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,940
I'll pack up

373
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,510
and change my clothes.

374
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,330

Thank you, Special Assistant Li.

380

You've bought so many.

381
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,100
Share them with others.

382
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,790
Okay.

383

What's this? It's still hot.

384

It's...

385
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,890
You kept coughing,

386
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,760

I don't want Zhou Yu to know
I was there yesterday.

391
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,280
Shouldn't Chengzhen's clothes

392

be disinfected?

393
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,350
Okay. I'll disinfect them later.

No need.

I have an appointment
with Su and some friends tonight.

Sun Wei asked you
to help her plan the car accident?

What car accident?

452
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,980
Of course it was a car accident

453
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,420
that killed Zhang Ran, the grandson

454
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,160
of Zhang Guodong, the chairman

455

of Zhou Group and Zhang Group.

456
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,420
She wanted to kill Zhang Ran?

457
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,920
But Zhou Yu should be the biggest threat to her.

458
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,170
Because the real mastermind behind the accident

459
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,800
was Zhou Mingde.

460
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,300
Zhou Mingde heard that Zhang Guodong

461
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,220
had made a private will
to give the group to Zhang Ran.

462
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,080
He wanted to kill Zhang Ran secretly

463
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,610
before Zhang Ran came back.

464
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,780
That was funny.

465
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,300
Zang Ran

466
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,830
wasn't the only one in the car.

467

Don't worry. I'm here.

469
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,940
Did I scare you?

470
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:23,909
I'm fine.

471
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,550
What nightmare did you have?

472
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:27,750
Why are you sweating?

473
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,760
Nothing. I'm going to meet a client.

474
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,449
Then I'll pick you up to see the grandpa.

475
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,489
You don't have to pick me up.

476
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,179
It's troublesome to go back and forth.

477
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,510
See you at the hospital.

478
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:50,760
Okay.

Is Jiang Lai in the office?

482
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,770
She asked for leave.

483
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,760
She asked for leave with Mr. Zhou.

484
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,830
Special Assistant Li, you're leaving?

485
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,060
No, I have to go downstairs.

488
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,490
I have something to tell you.

Zhou Yu is not here, right?

490
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,060
Let's talk at the group.

491
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,120
I need to go out now.

492
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,100
Be careful of Zhou Yu.

493
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,730
What do you mean?

494
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,130
Zhou Yu's purpose
of returning to China is not that simple.

495
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:57,910
He most likely

496
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,440
returned to China

497
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,270
to avenge his cousin, Zhang Ran.

498
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,790
Zhang Ran?
