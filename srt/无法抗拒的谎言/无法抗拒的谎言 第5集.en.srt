No.

It seemed that you saved me.

I know he is the artist who we

158

But his productivity is unstable,

that our project will be completed smoothly.

Make it look like you're in a relationship.

175
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,720
What do you mean by ride better?

176
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,180
What does being in a relationship look like?

177
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,240
No.

178
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,330
This doesn't work.

179
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:31,780
Doesn't work?

180
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,250
Don't move. Don't move.

181
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,300
Be still. Be still.

182
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,230
Don't move.

183
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,940
Very good.

184
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,400
One more.

185
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,250
Don't move. Be still.

186
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,140
Don't move.

187
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,790
That's right.

188
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,790
Don't look at me.

189
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,630
Continue.

190
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,800
Continue to do what?

191
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:26,990
Your hand.

192
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,420
Little friend.

193
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,710
I'm not done yet.

194
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,940
You need to wait.

195
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,370
Keep playing.

196
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:52,970
Don't worry.

197
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,750
Take your time.

198
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,920
Mom! Mom!

199
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,400
Why did you scare that kid?

200
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,110
I...

201
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,670
Did I?

202
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,880
Sit, please.

203
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,190
No.

204
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,710
Sit.

205
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,020
Mr. Jiang is watching.

206
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,920
Just swing.

207
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,010
Swing.

208
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,510
Swing.

209
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,450
You've never played on a swing before?

210
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,460
What are you doing?

211
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,290
I'm helping you.

212
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,810
Okay. Su Qing.

213
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:57,400
Su Qing, I'm good.

214
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:57,840
Here.

215
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,920
Stop it, Su Qing.

216
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,510
Su Qing.

217
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,970
You're flying.

218
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,190
-Su Qing, please stop.
-Higher.

219
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,710
Okay.

220
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,480
Relax. Just relax.

221
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,070
Relax.

222
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,350
No.

223
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,390
You should relax.

224
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:10,880
Wait a second.

225
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,320
This...

226
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,130
Let's go.

227
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,460
Stop. Stop.

228
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,080
Su Qing.

229
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,710
Higher.

230
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,040
You should really stop.

231
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,000
Where is Mr. Jiang?

232
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,640
Mr. Jiang.

233
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,560
Mr. Jiang.

234
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,610
Call him.

235
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,190
Mr. Jiang,

236
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,420
where are you?

237
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:48,670
Okay.

238
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,280
Okay. Bye.

239
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,310
Talk to you later.

240
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,250
What's up?

241
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,090
He said he found the inspiration.

242
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:54,940
That's great!

243
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,530
Oh Yeah!

244
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,400
What?

245
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,020
What happened?

246
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,230
You've been keeping your cat here?

247
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,580
I examined it.

248
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,920
It's just feline ringworm.

249
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,720
It's quite common for kittens.

250
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,350
You poor little thing.

251
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,080
Mr. Zhou,

252
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,440
I've contacted

253
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,770
all the applicants for adopting your cat.

254
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,340
They all said

255
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,760
that your requirements

256
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,500
are too high.

257
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,290
One of them even said…

258
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,360
What?

259
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,480
One of them said why didn't you
buy a school district house for your cat?

260
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:54,890
Okay.

261
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,960
Got it.

262
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,250
If I use his cat as an excuse,

263
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,810
it would be more convenient for me
to go to his apartment and look for the contract.

264
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,330
Actually, finding a adopter

265
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,320
doesn't guarantee your cat a good life.

266
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,000
Many people pretend to be adopters these days.

267
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,690
They would abuse cats after adopting them.

268
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,950
Very twisted and dark.

269
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,620
Look.

270
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,000
Your cat likes you so much.

271
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,140
She wants to go home with you.

272
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,870
Would you want her to be abused?

273
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,810
I can finally go to his apartment.

274
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,120
What?

275
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,770
Aren't you going home?

276
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,450
Mr. Zhou,

277
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,970
your mood has changed a little too fast.

278
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,570
Goodbye.

279
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,560
Zhou Yu.

280
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,900
You just wait.

281
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,270
Sooner or later, you will invite me in.

282
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,810
This is push and pull.

283
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,310
A push

284
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,170
and a pull.

285
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:28,740
Okay.

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
I've received Jiang Fan's action plan.

287
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
Let's get to work.

288
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,560
Okay.

289
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,220
What's wrong?

290
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,300
Are you hungry?

291
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,510
Let me see.

292
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,120
You didn't eat your food.

293
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,210
Why do you look so gloomy?

294
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,030
Are you sick?

295
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,240
Let me see.

296
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,760
What is this?

297
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,080
Don't move.

298
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,360
The pet hospital should be closed now.

299
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,370
Su Qing,

300
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,810
Mimi has grown a bunch of pimples.

301
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,540
And she barely eats.

302
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,180
I'm sending you a picture.

303
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,130
I can't see clearly from the picture.

304
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,200
It would be easier if I just see her in person.

305
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,760
Okay.

306
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,190
Hi.

307
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,660
What's wrong with Mimi?

308
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,740
She has a bunch of pimples on her.

309
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,160
And she doesn't eat or drink.

310
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,250
Should I take off my shoes?

311
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,860
It's fine.

312
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,580
Mimi.

313
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,660
Is it the feline ringworm?

314
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,090
No.

315
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,180
The feline ringworm has a sheet-like shape.

316
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,200
But this is bead shaped.

317
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,890
Take a look.

318
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,710
[Snapdragon Farm rental agreement]

319
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,350
So the contract is here.

320
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,840
Is the cat food still that one from the pet shop?

321
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,320
Yes.

322
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,340
They told me to change it gradually.

323
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,900
Do you know how to do it?

324
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,430
Half and half?

325
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,060
Get me a piece of paper. I'll write it down for you.

326
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,020
Paper...

327
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,360
You can write it on here.

328
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
I'll get you a pen.

329
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,170
Here.

330
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,240
Come here.

331
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,140
Let's see.

332
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,160
Does it hurt?

333
00:19:59,070 --> 00:19:59,790
Let me see.

334
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,360
Here.

335
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,520
On her belly.

336
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,350
Here.

337
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,020
And here.

338
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,140
These are all...

339
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,470
This...

340
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:05,980
This?

341
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,430
Are you sure?

342
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,120
Yes, I am.

343
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:09,820
There are several of those.

344
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,340
On the upper side.

345
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,400
And the lower side.

346
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,880
Why are you smiling?

347
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,880
Well…

348
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,940
This is the cat's organ.

349
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,680
The one

350
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,170
they'll use to feed their kittens in the future.

351
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,650
Er…

352
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,340
A kitten already has that?

353
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,480
Alright.

354
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,370
It's getting late.

355
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,100
You should go home and go to bed.

356
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,320
You...

357
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,200
You're not going to get me

358
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,180
a cup of coffee or something?

359
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,370
Now?

360
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,090
It is getting late.

361
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,570
Go home and have some sleep.

362
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,090
I'll call a cab for you.

363
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,820
Hurry up.

364
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,210
Bye, Mimi.

365
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,560
How can I get inside of Zhou Yu's apartment?

366
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,740
Good morning.

367
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,050
Good morning, Shan.

368
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,550
Good morning, Miss Su.

369
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,600
Good morning, everyone.

370
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,430
You look so happy.

371
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,470
Tingting, what made you this happy?

372
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,180
The May 20th event was not only a trending topic,

373
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,980
but our sales volume doubled last year's.

374
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,170
There must be a big bonus.

375
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,170
No kidding.

376
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,210
Are we going to have a celebratory party?

377
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,520
We haven't had a dinner party for a long time.

378
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,510
Mr. Zhou…

379
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,460
Let me handle it.

380
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,570
I'll go.

381
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,890
It's promising.

382
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,060
Come in.

383
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,710
What's the matter?

384
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,730
I just miss you, alright?

385
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
I heard the May 20th event was a success.

386
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,810
It’s better than we expected.

387
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,210
You've made a crucial contribution.

388
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,930
Is there a reward for me?

389
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,400
Alright.

390
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,860
What do you want?

391
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,830
Not just me.

392
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,670
It's for us.

393
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,930
We're family now.

394
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,810
And everyone

395
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,120
has worked overtime for this project for so long.

396
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,740
Shouldn't you do something to thank us?

397
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,680
Such as planning

398
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,840
an event

399
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,510
or a team building activity.

400
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,170
Something like that.

401
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,770
It would boost our morale.

402
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,670
Okay.

403
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,260
I'll let Chen Jun to arrange it.

404
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,950
There's no need to trouble him for things like this.

405
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,800
Leave it to me.

406
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,780
Are you ready?

407
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,390
Yiyi.

408
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,990
I'll start looking for you now.

409
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,580
Found you.

410
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,630
Yu,

411
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,870
you're bleeding.

412
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,470
[Yu, what are you doing? You haven't talked to me since we added each other.]

413
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,130
[Zhou Yu]

414
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,890
Give me Yu's home address.

415
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,870
Miss Chen,

416
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,030
I don't think that's a good idea.

417
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,550
Are we still going to talk about the pop-up shop tomorrow?

418
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,070
Okay.

419
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,980
Don't worry.

420
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,930
I'm just going to drive Yu to work.

421
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,890
No need to worry.

422
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,100
And don't address me so seriously.

423
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,210
Just call me Yiyi.

424
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,960
Yiyi,

425
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,520
it's time for your scene.

426
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,240
Yiyi.

427
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,910
You picked this place?

428
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,030
Yes.

429
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,320
The atmosphere here is best

430
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,200
for our colleagues to get closer.

431
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,950
You don't like it here?

432
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,190
No, I like it here.

433
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,120
It's nice.

434
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,990
I come here often myself.

435
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,040
If I get you drunk today,

436
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,100
I can get the contract effortlessly.

437
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,260
Don't move.

438
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,130
It's not done yet.

439
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,620
No rush.

440
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,500
It's done.

441
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,880
Great.

442
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,560
Let's eat.

443
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,520
Dig in.

444
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,240
Here.

445
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,870
Try my cooking.

446
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,210
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

447
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:01,820
Mr. Zhou.

448
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:27,970
Here.

449
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Cheers.

450
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,110
Cheers.

451
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,750
Here.

452
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,940
Here.

453
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:34,840
Drink it up.

454
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,800
Rock, paper, scissors.

455
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,030
Why are you so quiet?

456
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,630
No.

457
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,290
No.

458
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,740
We love talking.

459
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,310
We are very talkative.

460
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,080
Yes, we are.

461
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,690
That's good.

462
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,920
Everyone,

463
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:58,870
today

464
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,600
we're having our department's first dinner party.

465
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,240
How about

466
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,050
we drink something special?

467
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,020
How about that?

468
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,280
Here.

469
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
You first.

470
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,190
Cheers.

471
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,800
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

472
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,680
Bottoms up!

473
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,520
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

474
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,200
You can hold your liquor.

475
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:33,910
Cool!

476
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,790
I suggest everyone proposes a toast to Mr. Zhou.

477
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,990
I agree.

478
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,960
I'll go first.

479
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,490
Good idea.

480
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,170
Mr. Zhou.

481
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:41,860
Mr. Zhou.

482
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,960
Cheers.

483
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,510
Here.

484
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,930
This one.

485
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:49,240
Yes.

486
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,490
Drink the special blend.

487
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,390
Cheers.

488
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,340
Great.

489
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,380
Mr. Zhou, we have more.

490
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,120
I'll drink with you.

491
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,840
Come on.

492
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,870
Why do I feel that Miss Su is getting Mr. Zhou drunk?

493
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,900
You don't understand.

494
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,180
This is love.

495
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,080
Gosh.

496
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,190
This love is so intense.

497
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,840
This is my bedroom.

498
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,350
Get out.

499
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,110
No.

500
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,720
Where do you live?

501
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,450
I'll take you home.

502
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,180
Take my card.

503
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,550
I'm sleeping here tonight.

504
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,310
Go. Go.

505
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,870
Get out.

506
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,930
I'm sleeping here.

507
00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,830
Hurry up.

508
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,360
Let me send you home.

509
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,120
No.

510
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,080
Stop meowing.

511
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,160
Let me sleep.

512
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,050
Where did the cat come from?

513
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,310
Where am I?

514
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,600
Where are my clothes?
