[Episode 3]

4
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,570
This is

5
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,460
the most popular lipstick color.

6
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,800
What are you doing?

7
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,010
Your lipstick is applied outside.

8
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,070
What should I do?

9
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,940
So handsome.

10
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,090
Don't think about nonsense
at the critical moment.

11
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,860
Jiang Lai,

12
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,680
if you get caught, youâ€™re dead.

13
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,480
Wait.

14
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,860
I've got a sudden stomach ache.

15
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,320
Mr. Zhou, eat it yourself.

16
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,860
Calm down, Jiang Lai.

17
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,910
You're experienced enough.

18
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,220
Don't be fooled by men.

19
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,950
Where can Zhou Yu

20
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,490
put the card?

21
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,710
Buddha, Jesus and Chinese Immortals.

22
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,409
I'm here to sincerely hope that

23
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,600
you can take this plague away from us.

24
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,820
If this continues,

25
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,480
I won't find the card

26
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,080
and my heart is going to stop.

27
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,170
What did he eat?

28
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,600
This is the breakfast I made for you.

29
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,600
It seems that
the expired ham really can't be eaten.

30
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,880
Porridge?

31
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,410
Zhou Yu has got some conscience.

32
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,920
He didn't have it with him.

33
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,980
And I couldn't find it in the office.

34
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,380
Where did he put the card?

35
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,650
How could he come back so soon?

36
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,540
I don't want to be with him.

37
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,930
Where are you going?

38
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:28,710
I'm full.

39
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,810
I'm taking out the trash.

40
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,810
You can do it here.

41
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,790
I'm so full.

42
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,720
I need to take a walk after the meal.

43
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,390
Mr. Zhou.

44
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,950
We've found the pregnant woman.

45
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,210
Do you want to meet her?

46
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,080
Call the legal department.

47
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,950
Ask them to file a lawsuit.

48
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,270
Is it the pregnant woman from the cafe?

49
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:48,909
Miss Su.

50
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,790
Don't worry.

51
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,870
Mr. Zhou

52
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,190
has always been a man of integrity

53
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,620
and virtue.

54
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,170
He is definitely not that kind of scumbag.

55
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,300
We'll make sure that a woman

56
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,550
who makes irresponsible remarks like that

57
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,670
in the video will pay for it.

58
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,990
Assistant Chen is so reliable.

59
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,470
But I think

60
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,550
we should get to know more

61
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,410
before making a decision, right?

62
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,510
I mean...

63
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,840
Is there any misunderstanding?

64
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,240
What misunderstanding?

65
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,330
That person was there to slander me.

66
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,150
No.

67
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,370
She...

68
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,490
I...

69
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,230
I mean you shouldn't make wild guesses.

70
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,610
It'll be worse if something goes wrong.

71
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
We can't be sure who sent her now.

72
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,470
But according to the CCTV,

73
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,470
that woman framed

74
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,590
the staff of another department.

75
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,180
What did she do?

76
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,010
The punishment for scumbags.

77
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
But she punished a wrong person.

78
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,190
He was Zhang Ming
from the advertising department.

79
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,150
Jiang Lai

80
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,710
was a scumbag tester

81
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,320
hired by his girlfriend.

82
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,080
I've been exposed.

83
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,850
Give me her phone number.

84
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,490
Okay.

85
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,360
My stomach hurts again.

86
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,610
Are you Miss Jiang?

87
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,020
I'm the person you framed at the cafe that day.

88
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,550
I need your cooperation.

89
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,040
Can we meet tomorrow?

90
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,910
Meet...

91
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,670
Meet...

92
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,750
At 3 p.m. tomorrow.

93
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,890
The address will be sent to your phone.

94
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,470
Jiang Lai.

95
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,299
You really shot yourself in the foot.

96
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,820
I'll do what I've always done.

97
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,550
Miss Jiang?

98
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,980
We are here to clear up the misunderstanding.

99
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,120
Isn't it better to be honest?

100
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,980
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,990
I had the flu two days ago and I'm still sick.

102
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm afraid I'll infect you.

103
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,030
It's okay.

104
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,130
Our distance is safe.

105
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,370
Actually, I have terrible allergies.

106
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,660
I'll be frank.

107
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,590
This incident

108
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,630
has greatly affected me.

109
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,010
So,

110
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,670
who sent you here?

111
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,460
No one sent me here.

112
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,170
He believed it?

113
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,280
In that case,

114
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,710
please contact my lawyer, Miss Jiang.

115
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,310
You two

116
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,780
can discuss the details.

117
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,280
No. No.

118
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,320
I really mistook you for someone else.

119
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,470
Let me explain.

120
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,150
As for the charge for loss of working time

121
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,310
and mental damage,

122
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,040
you will

123
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,220
get a breakdown later.

124
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,080
It was Miss Zhu.

125
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,710
She was the girlfriend of Zhang Ming,
the advertising director of your group.

126
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,790
Zhang Ming cheated on her during her pregnancy.

127
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,200
So Miss Zhu came to me

128
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,860
to take revenge on Zhang Ming.

129
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,500
I have the chat record.

130
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,470
Look.

131
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,670
In that case,

132
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,980
just take a video and apologize publicly.

133
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,470
If it can remove

134
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,780
the negative impact on my reputation,

135
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,410
I can consider not to hold you accountable.

136
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,090
Isn't it too exaggerated to record a video in public?

137
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,240
You know our line of work is shady.

138
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,540
-My lawyer number is 13...
-Okay.

139
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,130
I will take a video

140
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,120
to restore Mr. Zhou's reputation.

141
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,610
How do you know my surname is Zhou?

142
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,250
When I apologized last time,

143
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,730
I looked into it

144
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,770
and thought about
how to apologize to you in person.

145
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,550
Let's add each other on WeChat.

146
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,910
If there's anything else,

147
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,570
it will be easy to get in touch.

148
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

149
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,370
Put on your mask.

150
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,710
Do you think

151
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,940
we can be infected by her?

152
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,740
I'm standing farther than you.

153
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,070
I finally escaped.

154
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,250
I have to be careful in the future.

155
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,960
Did she see me just now?

156
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,120
I don't think so.

157
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,790
Because Miss Su didn't wait for us.

158
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,510
This way.

159
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,640
There's a proposal from the Design Department

160
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,770
for you to look over.

161
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,780
Miss Su.

162
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,960
Tingting.

163
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,990
Do you want some coffee?

164
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:29,940
Mr. Zhou.

165
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,260
Did you offend her?

166
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,930
Finally off work.

167
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,930
I escaped.

168
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,980
Su Qing.

169
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,610
Mr. Zhou.

170
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,560
Happy off work.

171
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,560
I'm leaving.

172
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,530
Did you avoid me today?

173
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,760
No.

174
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,920
I'm off work.

175
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,460
Then why did you run?

176
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,150
Yes, I did avoid you.

177
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,960
I read online

178
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,840
that a woman has to learn to keep her distance

179
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,800
in order to grasp a man's heart.

180
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,150
I think I was too clingy to you.

181
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,900
You didn't care about me at all.

182
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,000
So I've decided to keep my distance

183
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,200
from you from today.

184
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,780
I see.

185
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,350
Is it because of the fake pregnant woman?

186
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,080
What do you mean?

187
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,190
He knows that?

188
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,430
I'm doomed.

189
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,120
It was just a misunderstanding.

190
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,370
If you don't believe me,

191
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,360
I'll ask her to explain it to you.

192
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,620
No need.

193
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,050
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

194
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,910
Powered off?

195
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,010
I can't trust a female swindler.

196
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,760
I can't get in touch with her so soon.

197
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,620
We have to take legal procedures.

198
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,590
Maybe her phone ran out of battery?

199
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,880
That's not the reason.

200
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,140
Stop.

201
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,900
Look at me.

202
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,150
After these days,

203
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,950
I have fully understood

204
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,990
you're a trustworthy man.

205
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,290
You're definitely not a scumbag.

206
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,440
Since you said you have nothing to do with her,

207
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,560
I trust you.

208
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,840
You don't need any evidence.

209
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,070
What happened?

210
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,440
Why is Su Qing sometimes hot
and sometimes cold to me?

211
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,970
This phone card

212
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,550
can't be left in my phone.

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,320
Do you know what a horrible day I've had?

214
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,630
He texted me again.

215
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,060
Can I cancel this WeChat account?

216
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,540
What did Mr. Zhou say?

217
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,630
Hello, Miss Jiang.

218
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,130
Sorry to bother you.

219
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,580
Though we've agreed to release
an apology video,

220
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,670
in order to give my fiancee
a complete explanation,

221
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,320
I hope you can explain it to her face to face.

222
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,810
You can decide the time and place.

223
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,140
Tell me when you decide.

224
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,040
Is he crazy?

225
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,620
How can I appear

226
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,780
in the same time and space with Su Qing?

227
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,650
It seems that Zhou Yu cares about you a lot.

228
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,280
Don't be sarcastic.

229
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,680
Help me find a way.

230
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,890
Can you pretend to be sick and refuse him?

231
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,230
I'm sure he'll say he'll wait until I'm better

232
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,290
or directly bring Su Qing to visit me.

233
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,270
I'll go on your behalf.

234
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,870
He'll say I'm not sincere enough

235
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,010
and then sue me.

236
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,220
Or just directly

237
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,520
tell him the truth?

238
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,600
Do you want me to die?

239
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,920
Good idea.

240
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,370
Once and for all.

241
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,359
Put an end to a scourge forever.

242
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,480
[Jiang Lai]

243
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,589
[Jiang Laiâ€™s Grave]

244
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,110
Jiang Lai had congenital heart disease.

245
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,630
She had no parents since childhood.

246
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,220
She worked as a scumbag tester
to earn some money

247
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,820
to save up medical expenses.

248
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,170
But she died

249
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,070
before she could save enough money.

250
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,000
My condolences.

251
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,130
All right.

252
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,270
That's enough.

253
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,760
Did you see it?

254
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,000
The pregnant woman posted an apology video.

255
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,640
What?

256
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,610
I didn't know such big news.

257
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,920
She posted it this morning.

258
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
It's still fresh.

259
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,350
I wanted justice

260
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,490
for the girl who was betrayed

261
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,600
by a scumbag.

262
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,700
That's why I came up with the idea
of pretending to be pregnant.

263
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,940
But I was anxious

264
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,900
and accidentally hurt

265
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,550
Mr. Zhou who had nothing to do with this.

266
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,880
For this,

267
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,320
I sincerely apologize.

268
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,600
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,750
All scumbags deserve to die.

270
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,080
Pretend to be pregnant?

271
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,500
That's a ruthless move.

272
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,440
So it was a misunderstanding.

273
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,790
We can't see the scene of
the marriage of powerful families

274
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,450
versus the shotgun marriage.

275
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,080
My working hours are even more boring.

276
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,600
The matter of the pregnant woman
is finally settled.

277
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,120
What are you doing here during working hours?

278
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,340
I need some fresh air.

279
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,480
It seems that you're in a good mood

280
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,100
since the misunderstanding was cleared up.

281
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,660
Of course.

282
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,590
It's not good to be misunderstood.

283
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,950
I don't want you to be misunderstood.

284
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,870
You care about my feelings, don't you?

285
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,760
You are my fiancÃ©.

286
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,360
Of course I care about you.

287
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,680
Chairman Zhou asked me to take you

288
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,010
to have dinner tonight.

289
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,950
Tonight?

290
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,330
With your dad?

291
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,550
Oh no.

292
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,110
My clothes are dirty.

293
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,230
It's not appropriate to meet elders.

294
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,290
Maybe another day.

295
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,370
-I'd rather not go to the dinner.
-Hello, General Manager.

296
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,110
Try this on.

297
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
This way, please.

298
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,710
It's too frivolous.

299
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,940
Too rigid.

300
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,370
Change.

301
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,890
What do you think?

302
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,190
This one will work.

303
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,850
Lift your hair.

304
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,350
I can do it myself.

[Moon Shadow]

306
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,430
Okay. Okay.

Mr. Wu.

308
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,190
This is a matter of tens of millions.

309
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:43,790
Thank you.

310
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,620
What is this?

311
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,210
This bowl is too big if it's for tea.

312
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,960
Okay.

313
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,440
Madam.

314
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,200
This is

315
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,550
for washing your hands.

316
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,350
I'm always like this.

317
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,440
It tastes good.

318
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,790
I was in Germany.

319
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,160
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

320
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,620
I've never had such elaborate Chinese food.

321

Cheers.

322
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,830
Let's welcome Qing.

Qing just came back.

324
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,200
You're still not used to it, right?

325
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,200
Let Yu

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,550
take you out more often.

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,630
Yu just came back.

328
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,170
He doesn't know his way around here.

329
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,360
How about I show you around

330
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,440
this weekend?

331
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,070
It seems that Zhou Yu is not on good terms
with his stepmother.

332
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,580
If I help him...

333
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:07,580
No need.

334
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,590
I'm going out with Yu this weekend.

335
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,970
Okay.

336
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,010
By the way, Uncle Zhou.

337
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,540
Is the Lingxi Village  nearby

338
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,690
with a nice view?

339
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,050
Are you going to open a resort over there?

340
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,630
Qing.

341
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,680
You're well-informed.

342
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,240
You heard it from your dad, right?

343
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,720
Yes.

344
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,040
Is your dad interested in this resort project?

345
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,410
So they want Suâ€™s Group to invest.

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,360
No wonder they are so nice to me.

347
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,870
He must be interested.

348
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,660
But I heard that this project is not Yu's.

349
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,820
We'll be a family.

350
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,120
If you like it,

351
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,490
I'll take it as a wedding gift for you.

352
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,780
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

353
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,040
Can I see

354
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,070
the documents and the contract now?

355
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,830
It's about work.

356
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,010
You don't have to rush.

357
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,230
You two should take more time

358
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,040
to cultivate your relationship.

359
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,500
Come on.

360
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,600
Have some more.

361
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,530
Come on.

362
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,430
Okay.

363
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:25,980
How's your dad's health

364
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,940
these days?

365
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,860
Is he still suffering from it?

366
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,070
What?

367
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,000
It's okay.

368
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,860
It'll be more serious when the season changes.

369
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:41,930
No.

370
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,110
Doesn't your dad have vertigo?

371
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:44,850
Why...

372
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,790
Does vertigo change seasonally?

373
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,710
All right.

374
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,290
I remember

375
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,380
that I sent some ginseng to your dad.

376
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,420
He told me he got much better.

377
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:56,860
Yes.

378
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,820
He's better.

379
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,990
Thank you for the ginseng, Uncle Zhou.

380
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,840
And he got

381
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:02,830
a secret remedy from his Arabian friend.

382
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,660
After he took it,

383
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,230
his vertigo was cured.

384
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,490
But he loves running in winter.

385
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,040
So,

386
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,810
he has knee osteoarthritis.

387
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,890
His legs ache when the seasons change.

388
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,090
It's so troublesome.

389
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,510
When you are old,

390
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,110
you'll get some diseases.

391
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,020
Look.

392
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,400
While we're all here,

393
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,670
call your dad.

394
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,230
Great.

395
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,210
We can tell him

396
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,840
that everything is settled.

397
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,640
No need.

398
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,920
I've already informed him that I'm safe.

399
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,780
I'll call him again.

400
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,070
It should be late now.

401
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,980
And there's a time difference.

402
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,110
He should be asleep.

403
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,450
It's 11 a.m. in Berlin.

404
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,340
Uncle Su should be awake.

405
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,170
Really?

406
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,410
I still have jet lag.

407
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,480
I forgot that.

408
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,300
Look at you.

409
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,450
Oh no.

410
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,270
Su.

411
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,350
How is your health these days?

412
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,590
I'm fine.

413
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,950
I even drink a little every day.

414
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,720
Well.

415
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,710
Qing is here too.

416
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,850
Do you want to talk to her?

417
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,650
Wait a minute.

418
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,300
Here you are.

419
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,450
Say something to your dad.

420
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,490
Well.

421
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,810
Turn on the speaker.

422
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,800
That's right.

423
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,950
We'll be in-laws.

424
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:29,820
Here.

425
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:33,410
Dad.

426
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,610
Qing.

427
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,230
You said you were going to have dinner
with Uncle Zhou.

428
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,230
Have you met?

429
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:40,660
Yes.

430
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,880
We're having dinner.

431
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,200
How is it?

432
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,870
Is it fun in China?

433
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,470
Yes.

434
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,640
But Zhou Yu is very busy.

435
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,120
When I went to find him,

436
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,940
the receptionist stopped me

437
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,270
and refused to let me in.

438
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,680
You have to be considerate.

439
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,750
Really?

440
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,230
Uncle Zhou.

441
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,030
You don't know

442
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,780
that your group is very strict.

443
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,560
Although I'm Zhou Yu's secretary now,

444
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,170
I can't get in many places.

445
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,580
Take my card.

446
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,620
From now on,

447
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,730
in Zhou's Group,

448
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,360
you can go wherever you want.

449
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,580
You can walk anywhere.

450
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,690
There won't be any problem.

451
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,950
Thank you, Uncle Zhou.

452
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,600
Dad, don't worry.

453
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,940
Uncle Zhou and his family are very good to me.

454
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,690
-Okay.
-Come on.

455
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,490
-Thatâ€™s good.
-Iâ€™ll talk to him.

456
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,360
Su.

457
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,410
When Zhou Yu

458
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
met Qing,

459
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,710
he really liked her.

460
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,690
He is waiting for you

461
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,550
to get their marriage settled.

462
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,370
Okay.

463
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,840
Wait till I finish my work.

464
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,250
Let the two young people
spend more time together first.

465
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,740
Okay.

466
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,200
Don't worry.

467
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,040
We will take good care of Qing.

468
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,720
Sorry.

469
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,430
Excuse me.

470
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,510
You have a visitor.

471
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,590
Who is it?

472
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:54,900
Special Assistant Li just sent me a message.

473
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,630
He wanted to give me a document.

474
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,470
Come in.

475
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,380
Special Assistant Li?

476
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,550
Li Tingjiang?

477
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,830
It's really him.

478
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,040
Mr. Sun.

479
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,700
Mr. Zhou.

480
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm sorry

481
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,040
for disturbing you.

482
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,760
This is the last version of our tender.

483
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,190
You need to sign it.

484
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,590
Okay.

485
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,350
By the way,

486
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,010
Tingjiang.

487
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,400
You haven't seen Yu and Qing, have you?

488
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
What are you looking for?

489
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,130
Qing?

490
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,540
I've lost my earrings.

491
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,820
I'm looking for them.

492
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,280
Forget it if you can't find them.

493
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,610
Ask Yu to buy new ones for you at the mall.

494
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,870
Buy whatever you like.

495
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,460
Everyone.

496
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,930
There's an emergency here.

497
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,330
Let's evacuate quickly.

498
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,360
What's going on?

499
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,080
This way.

500
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,820
Su Qing?

501
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,110
Su Qing?

502
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,350
What's going on?

503
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,120
An accident happened at dinner.

504
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,380
There's a lot of smoke.

505
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,840
What happened?

506
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,410
Qing.

507
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,420
Are you okay?

508
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,700
Why are you alone?

509
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,550
Where is Yu?

510
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Didn't he come out with you just now?

511
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,850
He didn't see you.

512
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,050
So he went back again.

513
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,400
Hello.

514
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,250
Have you seen a girl at this height

515
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,190
wearing black?

516
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,430
No.

517
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,200
Zhou Yu.

518
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,090
Where have you been?

519
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,020
Go.

520
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,360
