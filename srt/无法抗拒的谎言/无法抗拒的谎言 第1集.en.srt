[Episode 1]

4
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,270
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,530
I shouldn't have come here looking for you.

6
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,220
But our baby is due next month.

7
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,510
You've got the wrong person.

8
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,910
How could you pretend not to know me?

9
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,630
You're so cruel to me!

10
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,510
I'm a Scumbag Tester.

11
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,550
My job is to help girls

12
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,570
who have deeply fallen for men's lies

13
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,780
out of their misery.

14
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,060
To be a Scumbag Tester,

15
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,090
the first rule is to not buy anything men say,

16
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,670
and the second is to have excellent acting skills.

17
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,840
Let's go.

18
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,360
Many of my clients have asked me the same question,

19
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,040
"Have you encountered a man who was wronged during your testing?"

20
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,600
Unfortunately,

21
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,880
I've never seen one.

22
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,640
It's not that there aren't good men in the world.

23
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,960
It's just that when my clients come to me,

24
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,390
their relationships

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,730
have been shattered

26
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
due to lies.

27
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,550
And I

28
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,680
just help them

29
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,760
see the truth.

30
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,360
You nailed that fake pregnant woman.

31
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,690
Just a bad day for the man you've mistaken.

32
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,710
It's all because of your stupid photos.

33
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,060
But that shows your adaptability.

34
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,430
It's time.

35
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,030
Let's eat.

36
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,270
By the way,

37
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,040
Aunt told me

38
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,150
that they're going to build a resort next to our farm.

39
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,510
Once the resort is completed,

40
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,400
there will be more tourists visiting.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,030
I want to save some money

42
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,280
and renovate the farm.

43
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,630
Then our business will naturally get better.

44
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,920
You've lived at the farm since my uncle ran away.

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,980
Haven't you spent enough time there?

46
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,670
Besides,

47
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,150
didn't Auntie Yuqin not want you to go back to the village?

48
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,590
Living in the city is great.

49
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,390
If I do go back,

50
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,650
do you think she will kick me out?

51
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,490
And the farm is not doing well.

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,120
It's gonna close any minute.

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,530
How can I feel at ease when she's alone at the farm?

54
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,200
Right.

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,790
Running a farm is much better than being a Scumbag Tester.

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,000
If you keep doing this,

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,399
you'll give up on men.

58
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,950
And when you get old,

59
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,480
you'll have to raise chickens and pigs alone.

60
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,300
What?

61
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,890
I have to eat more.

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,180
I'll have to raise chickens and pigs alone when I get older.

63
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,550
Hello, Aunt.

64
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,070
What’s wrong?

65
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,600
Lai.

66
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,600
Something bad happened!

67
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,000
A group of people came to Lingxi Village to demolish our farm.

68
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
Did you hear?

69
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,990
Mr. Zhou Jr., who has been abroad, is coming back.

70
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,670
Isn't he at the Africa branch?

71
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,290
Why is he back all of a sudden?

72
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,490
Is it because of that resort project?

73
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,590
He came back just as the project was about to start?

74

[Dream City]

75
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,780
But isn't Vice President Sun in charge of the project?

76
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,480
Well, not anymore.

77
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,600
Mr. Zhou Jr.

78
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,270
has revived the African branch in just three years.

79
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,800
Vice President Sun has finally met her rival.

80
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,180
Looks like the drama between the stepmother and the eldest stepson

81
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,180
is about to begin.

82
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Zhou's Group is going to change.

83
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,770
Come in.

84
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:43,670
Chairman.

85
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,270
The General Manager is here.

86
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,400
You're back.

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,190
Let me see you.

88
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,950
I can't even recognize you

89
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,080
after so many years.

90
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,940
He's grown up. He looks more like you now.

91
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,790
No.

92
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
He looks like his mother.

93
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,790
Since you're back,

94
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,790
we are all family.

95
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,620
Let bygones be bygones.

96
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,000
Come on.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,530
Sit.

98
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,960
Go make him a cup of tea.

99
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,270
Although you went abroad when you were little,

100
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,470
your dad thought about you all the time.

101
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,290
Here, have some tea.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,850
All these years,

103
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,590
you've had a hard time in Africa.

104
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,520
But you did well.

105
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,170
Since you're back,

106
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,100
you should learn from Auntie Wei.

107
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,820
You flatter me.

108
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,130
Yu did so well in Africa.

109
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,430
I should be the one

110
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,960
learning from him.

111
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,010
Then you learn from each other.

112
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,540
Auntie Wei and I have talked

113
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,940
and decided to let you run the Dream City Department Store.

114
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,730
I'll do my best.

115
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,830
Good.

116
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,720
Here.

117
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,590
-Lai.
-Aunt.

118
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,240
Wh-Wh-What is it all about?

119
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,990
I thought you two were from Zhou's Group.

120
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,040
Some of their men were there this morning.

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,920
I heard

122
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,390
that the group is planning to

123
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,590
develop a new resort in Lingxi Village.

124
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,560
Lingxi is Mom's hometown.

125
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,430
I want that project.

126
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,000
Yu,

127
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,810
you just came back.

128
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,130
There are a lot of businesses

129
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,930
with which you are not familiar.

130
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,550
The Dream Resort project

131
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,420
is the key project for our group for the next decade.

132
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,710
In that case,

133
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,250
why don't we make a bet?

134
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,540
What bet?

135
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,159
If I can increase the turnover

136
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,510
of Dream City Department Store by 30%

137
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,750
within three months,

138
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,670
this project

139
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,830
is mine.

140
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,510
What if you can't?

141
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,860
I'll resign

142
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,890
and leave Zhou’s Group for good.

143
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,450
You are indeed my son.

144
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,270
You have guts.

145
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,670
What do you think?

146
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,850
Since Yu is so determined,

147
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,980
I'll bet with you this time.

148
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,580
You're still young.

149
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,060
It's good for you to have a dream.

150
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,660
But if you can't do it,

151
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,260
don't make it hard for yourself.

152
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,100
Okay.

153
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,530
Since it's a bet,

154
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,299
what’s your wager?

155
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,960
What about

156
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,100
the position of Vice President?

157
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,420
What do you think?

158
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:50,950
Okay.

159
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,610
I'm in.

160
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,800
Aunt,

161
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,590
what happened to the farm?

162
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,080
Your damned father

163
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,070
has leased the farm to Zhou's Group for 20 years

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,690
and said to tear down this place to build a resort.

165
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,320
I can't reach your dad.

166
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,100
They came to pick a fight this morning.

167
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,070
A group of them.

168
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,610
I drove them away.

169
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,980
Aunt, you can't keep going on like this.

170
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,560
The farm is under my dad's name.

171
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,360
He leased it to Zhou's Group,

172
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,620
so they have the right.

346
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,660
and she is a sexy goddess.

347
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,260
Could it be...

348
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:32,720
that you really have an ulterior motive

349
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,330
for her?

350
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,330
Please explain it to us.

351
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,360
Can you explain it?

352
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,320
Please tell us.

353
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,750
Mr. Zhou, please tell us.

354
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,990
Right, is it like this?

355
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,190
They have nothing to do with each other.

356
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,740
It was all a show she put on.

357
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,340
I'll only listen to you,

358
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,680
okay?

359
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,860
Stay away from me,

360
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,250
okay?

361
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,740
What?

362
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,570
Are you nervous?

363
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,010
No, not really.

364
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,540
If I make your face or body

365
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,550
crooked,

366
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,150
I won't be able to bear the consequences.

367
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,030
Don't come begging me!

368
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,569
No.

369
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,540
Is that true?

370
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,839
That's not true.

371
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,550
The video has been edited.

372
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,720
Whether it's edited or not,

373
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,450
I can send you the original video later to verify.

374
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,160
Miss Qin,

375
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:20,920
please tell us.

376
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,040
Did you seduce the heir of Zhou's Group

377
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,270
to marry into a rich family?

378
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,369
-Is that so?
-Please tell us.

379
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,270
Is that true?

380
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,720
Did you stage all of this?

381
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,690
I'm drunk.

382
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,140
My head hurts!

383
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,700
Is this your first time doing this?

384
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,010
I feel dizzy!

385
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,020
Miss Qin!

386
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,700
Miss Qin.

387
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,570
You haven't answered my question yet.

388
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,030
Miss Qin!

389
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,630
Miss Qin!

390
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,030
What's going on?

391
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,200
How could Qin Shuang do this?

392
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:36,980
Is that true?

393
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,170
This is big news.

394
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,350
Who is that girl?

395
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,600
Hello.

396
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,770
Do you have time for an interview?

397
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,360
Miss,

398
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,000
could you please introduce yourself?

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,160
I am...

400
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,850
I'm Zhou Yu's girlfriend.

401
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,960
How long have you been dating?

402
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,950
Could you introduce her to us?

403
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,770
How long have you been dating?

404
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,850
Have you set a wedding date?

405
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,590
Mr. Zhou, is this an official announcement of your relationship?

406
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,710
Dear media friends,

407
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,150
there are some misunderstandings.

408
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,750
Actually, this lady and I...

409
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,590
Room card?

410
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,260
How come?

411
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,050
I'll only listen to

412
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,220
you,

413
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,880
okay?

414
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,360
Stay away from me,

415
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,680
okay?

416
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,370
Miss Su.

417
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,810
Miss Su?

418
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,220
Su Qing,

419
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,260
23 years old.

420
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,060
Zhou Yu's fiancée.

421
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,970
The Su family and the Zhou family arranged the marriage a long time ago.

422
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,560
[Su Qing; Marriage; Zhou Yu]

423
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,680
However, there's been no news of Zhou Yu

424
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,090
since he left for America.

425
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,090
So they have never met.

426
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,810
It's the first time we met,

427
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,350
Zhou Yu.

428
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,310
A glass of water,

429
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,950
thank you.

430
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,880
Miss Su really makes this place your home.

431
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,150
I've been busy all day,

432
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,130
and I haven't had a sip of water.

433
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm thirsty.

434
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,000
-What?
-Thank you.

435
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,950
Busy thinking of a way to make a grand entrance all day?

436
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,500
Yeah.

437
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,430
After all,

438
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,150
it's my debut.

439
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,740
Out of hundreds of ways to make our relationship public,

440
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,060
you chose the one

441
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,410
that leaves me with no way back.

442
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,420
You're something.

443
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,880
How is it?

444
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,340
Did I impress you?

445
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,280
Yes, indeed.

446
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,340
What?

447
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,050
You don’t like it?

448
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,100
I saw that Qin Shuang came on to you.

449
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,560
If the forward girls are not your type,

450
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,340
I can do other types.

451
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,310
Dependent girlfriend type.

452
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,330
The good wife type

453
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,160
or the cute one?

454
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,730
I'm fine with any type.

455
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,450
As long as you name it,

456
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,420
there is no other type I can't play.

457
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,030
Miss Su, do you have a crush on me?

458
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,800
But as far as I know,

459
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,140
when you came back two years ago,

460
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,770
you cried and made a scene

461
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,070
to break off our engagement.

462
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,330
Have you forgotten?

463
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,440
Su Qing has been living in Germany.

464
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,200
She's never been back to China.

465
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,000
There is no information about her online.

466
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,220
A mysterious fiancée.

467
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,010
If you fail at night,

468
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,490
you can approach Zhou Yu by assuming Su Qing's identity

469
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,950
to obtain the access card.

470
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,350
Remember to be quick.

471
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,030
Who do you take me for?

472
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,260
I wasn't even back in the country two years ago.

473
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,780
However,

474
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,680
I did disagree at first.

475
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,950
We don't need others to decide whom we can marry now.

476
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,750
So tacky.

477
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,860
But after seeing your photos,

478
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,910
I think I can give it a go.

479
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,790
To be honest,

480
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,050
you're much more handsome than in the photo.

481
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,920
I like you.

482
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,300
Thank you.

483
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,330
But I don't like you.

484
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,610
Why?

485
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,880
Because you're not my type.

486
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,430
What don't you like about me?

487
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,420
Eyes.

488
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,630
Nose.

489
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,260
Mouth.

490
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,250
I hate them all.

491
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,590
Mr. Zhou is so picky.

492
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,620
Fine.

493
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,130
Take care.

494
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,230
I won't see you out.

495
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,600
Deal with the news about tonight.

496
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,830
Since you're not interested in me,

497
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,720
it won't do us any good

498
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,760
if this kind of gossip gets out.

499
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,570
Don't worry.

500
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,390
I will.

501
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:48,960
Mr. Zhou.

502
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,990
This is Su Qing's information.

503
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,440
This is

504
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,920
her social media account.

505
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,900
I've created a social media account impersonating Su Qing

506
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,100
and used your photos.

507
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,640
You think

508
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,940
there is something wrong with her?

509
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,190
Take care of the gossip tonight.

510
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,200
I don't want to see her again in the future.

511
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,240
Okay.

512
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,020
How is it?

513
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,540
I didn't get it.

514
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,590
He doesn't take the card with him.

515
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,280
Do you think

516
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,250
I'm pretty?

517
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,590
Yes.

518
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,290
Right?

519
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,410
I think so too.

520
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,950
Is there something wrong with Zhou Yu's eyes?

521
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,350
What were you looking at?

522
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,390
Nothing.

523
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,180
Let me see.

524
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,490
Nothing there to see.

525
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,280
Let me see.

526
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,360
How did this photo get out?

527
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,200
Then my identity...

528
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,880
Don't worry.

529
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,940
Zhou's Group has informed the media.

530
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,680
The photo didn't get out.

531
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,610
No one will know it was you.

532
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,250
Then how did you get the photo?

533
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,660
Didn't we have a

534
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,650
client who is an entertainment reporter?

535
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,480
She saw it in her work gossip group,

536
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,880
so she forwarded it to me.

537
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,240
Why are you looking at me?

538
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
Didn't I always

539
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,870
kiss rabbits

540
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,430
and horses

541
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,910
on the farm?

542
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,030
I'll pretend I just kissed a goose.

543
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,870
It's dirty,

544
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,760
but it's fine.

545
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,840
But

546
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,260
since we didn't get the card,

547
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,470
what should we do now?

548
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,390
Maybe he doesn't bring the card with him

549
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,190
because he isn't at the company?

550
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,170
I'm Zhou Yu's girlfriend.

551
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,630
How come?

552
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,100
Deal with the news about tonight.

553
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,140
Since Mr. Zhou is not interested in me,

554
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,360
it won't do us any good

555
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,650
if the gossip gets out.

556
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,460
Su Qing.

557
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,700
Hello, General Manager.

558
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,510
He has a fiancée but is still fooling around.

559
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,370
Who would have thought that he was such a man?

560
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,330
You never know.

561
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,840
He even wanted a casting couch.

562
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
His private life is a mess.

563
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,440
Hello, General Manager.

564
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,240
See?

565
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,950
He knocked her up,

566
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,170
but he won't admit it.

567
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,260
You think...

568
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,240
What?

569
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,790
What are you doing?

570
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,480
Nothing.

571
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,730
What are you looking at?

572
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,070
Let me see.

573
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,950
You don't know?

574
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,110
Don't you know that?

575
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,640
Tell me.

576
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,320
Mr. Zhou, you...

577
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,280
already know?

578
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,470
No.

579
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,850
But I can tell.

580
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:07,760
I'm sorry.

581
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,090
I shouldn't have come here looking for you.

582
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,880
But our baby...

583
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,830
-I guess the whole group
-is due next month.

584
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,880
has seen this video.

585
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,480
You've got the wrong person.

586
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,510
How could you pretend not to know me?

587
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,040
You are so cruel to me.

588
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,800
What did they say?

589
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,930
Everyone is saying

590
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,410
that you're four-timing.

591
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,400
You're a womanizer,

592
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,440
a playboy CEO.

593
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,210
Four-timing?

594
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,820
Qin Shuang.

595
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:33,690
Miss Su.

596
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,470
Chen Yiyi.

597
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,150
And this what's-her-name pregnant woman.

598
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,920
And that's not the most serious problem.

599
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,360
Because of your messed-up personal life

600
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,090
and immoral relationships...

601
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,230
Immoral  relationships?

602
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,730
It means you want a casting couch

603
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,570
and have an illegitimate child who is about to be born.

604
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,730
Now the directors are very unhappy with you.

605
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:03,480
They all think you're not qualified to run Dream City.

606
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,320
This morning,

607
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,680
Chairman Zhou also snapped at the office.

608
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,600
Your child...

609
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,530
What child?

610
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,650
I don't even know that woman.

611
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,610
And she's not really pregnant.

612
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,510
Then you must have been set up.

613
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,750
A woman pretending to be pregnant.

614
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,590
Actress.

615
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,420
Miss Su.

616
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,700
It's all too much of a coincidence.

617
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,090
From now on,

618
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,020
don't let any woman near me.

619
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,120
Especially the four women you just mentioned.

620
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,670
Okay.

621
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,630
Wait.

622
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,700
Go find that fake pregnant woman.

623
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,880
I want to see

624
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,620
who was behind this.
