in the next few years.

176
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,690
Don't worry about

177
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,020
the resort project now.

178
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,020
I have another plan for it.

179
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
What plan?

180
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,540
Do I need to

181
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
report to you about what I do?

182
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,440
That's not what I mean.

183
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,260
It's just that this bet...

184
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,490
Don't you know

185
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,940
what you've done?

186
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,600
Think about yourself now.

187
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,960
Alright.

188
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,630
Get out.

189
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,390
Chairman,

190
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,760
the colleagues from the HR department came to ask

191
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,820
for my opinion on General Manager Zhou's resignation.

192
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,960
How did you reply?

193
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,430
I told him to halt this process

194
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,400
because of the complicated papers and procedures.

195
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,350
By the way,

196
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,170
there's a Snapdragon Farm in the resort project.

197
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,540
Go investigate it.

198
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,640
Okay.

199
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,620
Mr. Zhou has resigned.

200
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,030
Why is he still here?

201
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,170
Mr. Zhou is the chairman's son.

202
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,720
How could he really resign?

203
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,960
I hope Mr. Zhou can come back.

204
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,680
With Mr. Zhou's ability, it's such a pity

205
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,630
to see him go.

206
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,140
Chen Jun!

207
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,670
Feeling bored with nothing better to do, right?

208
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,640
There's a package downstairs.

209
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,500
Go get it for me.

210
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:32,590
Thank you.

211
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,700
Didn't you say it was only one delivery?

212
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,260
Thank you.

213
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,620
Just leave them here.

214
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,760
Copy these documents

215
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,130
and send them out for me.

216
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,220
Wait, come back.

217
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,960
Take these away.

218
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,660
[Mr. Zhou, what are you doing?]

219
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,950
[Mr. Zhou, I'm always waiting for your call]

220
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,450
Chen Jun, have you seen Zhou Yu?

221
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,630
No.

222
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,560
It's early in the morning, and he's not home.

223
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,020
I don't know where he went.

224
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,680
Maybe he's busy.

225
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,850
What else could he be busy with now?

226
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,800
I think something is off with him.

227
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,400
He even made me breakfast early in the morning,

228
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,110
and the juice with strawberries and dragon fruit with seeds had the seeds picked out.

229
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,280
What's even more unbelievable

230
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,610
is that he even cleaned Mimi's litter box.

231
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,400
I think

232
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,500
that Mr. Zhou is not that fragile.

233
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,250
Before, we had a project in Africa that lost a lot.

234
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,650
He just strolled down

235
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,380
to a cannibal tribe by himself.

236
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,660
I mean,

237
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,010
actually, you don't have to worry too much.

238
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,650
He went to a cannibal tribe for a losing-money project?

239
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,510
Now he's unemployed, isn't he...

240
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,540
No!

241
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,790
Zhou Yu!

242
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:07,680
Where have you been?

243
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,810
I've been looking everywhere for you.

244
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,319
My phone is muted,

245
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,380
so I didn't notice.

246
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,849
-Are you alright?
-It’s late.

247
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:19,980
I'm going to bed now.

248
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,990
This won't do.

249
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,810
I have to find a way.

250
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,940
You didn't miss anything.

251
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,260
Your future is still waiting for you.

252
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,630
You may encounter obstacles in life.

253
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,300
As long as you can stand on your feet,

254
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,830
you can overcome anything.

255
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,360
What are you doing?

256
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,730
People are sleeping.

257
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,880
Do what you want!

258
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,720
You're up.

259
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,150
Good.

260
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,290
Let's go downstairs and run some laps since you're up.

261
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,080
Catch them.

262
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,410
Go run if you want to.

263
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,110
Go jump if you want to.

264
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,130
You didn't miss anything.

265
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,600
Your future is still waiting for you.

266
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,760
You may encounter obstacles in life.

267
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,800
But as long as you can stand on your feet,

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,330
you can overcome anything.

269
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,730
You didn't miss anything.

270
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,900
Your future is still waiting for you.

271
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,290
How is it?

272
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,590
Isn't the weather nice outside?

273
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,270
Isn't the air fresh?

274
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,970
You have to trust the power of nature.

275
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,200
Don't be sad.

276
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,220
Life is full of ups and downs,

277
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,400
and so are emotions.

278
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,530
They are all normal.

279
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,290
What are you doing?

280
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,440
Disappointment's just a part of life.

281
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,930
The key is how you face it.

282
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,700
I'm facing it well.

283
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,960
I know you haven't wanted to go out

284
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,930
or see people recently.

285
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,000
But at this moment, you have to face it bravely

286
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,840
and overcome the obstacles.

287
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,700
Are you encouraging me?

288
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,930
The simpler it is,

289
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,920
the easier it is to be happy.

290
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,700
For example,

291
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,520
exercise.

292
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,450
Exercise

293
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,830
can boost dopamine and serotonin,

294
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,060
hormones that can make the brain happy.

295
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,980
You go to all this trouble

296
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,930
just to make me happy?

297
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,560
Is my happiness that important to you?

298
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,010
For now.

299
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,950
Be my girlfriend, then.

300
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,080
I'd be happy if you were my girlfriend.

301
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,120
Your heart is racing.

302
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,200
No, I just...

303
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:09,960
I just exercised.

304
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,350
It's because of the running.

305
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,230
Let's run.

306
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,320
What the hell is Chen Jun up to?

307
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:47,930
Why didn't he know to talk to me

308
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,560
if I didn't talk to him?

309
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,170
A proper amount of dessert can make people produce dopamine

310
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,500
and thus make them feel happy.

311
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,020
Perfect.

312
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,200
Zhou Yu!

313
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,480
What are you doing?

314
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,590
Why are you standing so high?

315
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
High?

316
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm checking the light on the smoke alarm.

317
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,620
It's not flashing.

318
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,980
Look.

319
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,030
The cake I made for the first time.

320
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,260
It must be delicious.

321
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,290
Eat it yourself.

322
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,580
I need to go out later.

323
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,650
What is he doing?

324
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,190
He's been sitting there for two hours.

325
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,890
Isn't he thirsty or hungry?

326
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,060
Mr. Zhou.

327
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,080
I've finally seen you again.

328
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,210
I miss you so much.

329
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,150
If you hadn't called me to investigate,

330
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,790
I would have thought you had given up.

331
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,740
You have no idea that the company...

332
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,800
Where's the stuff?

333
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,280
Mr. Zhou.

334
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,160
The person who refunded the order, leading to a reversed turnover,

335
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,530
is the owner of a spa.

336
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,510
Look into it

337
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,370
and see who in the company

338
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,100
has been to that spa these days.

339
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,910
Okay.

340
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,250
I'm on it.

341
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,150
Remember to keep it a secret.

342
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,840
This spa operates on a membership system.

343
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,720
Only one person in the company has the membership,

344
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,680
and that is Vice President Sun.

345
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,560
Got it.

You can go back now.

347
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,680
I'll contact you if I need anything.

348
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,280
By the way,

349
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,060
buy yourself a new helmet.

350
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,280
This one doesn't suit you.

351
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:48,810
Okay.

352
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,420

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,520
Why are you here?

356
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,910
I'll take you to a place.

357
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,830
Where?

358
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,670
Just go.

362
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,860
This is where you said you'd take me?

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,530
You'll see after you go in.

Come on.

Welcome to my secret base.

370
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:32,940
I come here whenever I'm in a bad mood.

371
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,110
When I was young, my family was in debt.

372
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,680
Many people often came to my home to collect debts,

373
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,010
but my dad wasn't there.

374
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,020
Later, my aunt took me to the farm.

375
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,590
This string of wind chimes is the only gift my dad ever gave me.

376
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,640
During that time, I used to come here often

377
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,840
when I was in a bad mood

378
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,450
to gaze at the stars

379
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,530
and the moon

380
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,090
and listen to the wind chimes ringing.

381
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,890
Then I'd feel better gradually.

382
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,270
I know you have been in a bad mood recently.

383
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,590
But don't worry.

384
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,400
I'll always be there for you.

385
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,380
I see you care about me.

No.

I'm just worried about my farm.

388
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:32,320
Before I get the farm,

389
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,490
you'd better pull yourself together.

390
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,960
How do you know I'm not?

391
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,880
Charge me.

392
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,770
Rat!

393
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,680
Why is there a rat?

394
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,810
Isn't this your secret base?

395
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,350
Were there no rats when you were little?

396
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,020
You're strangling me.

397
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,130
Then you hold me,

398
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,880
so I can loosen my arms a little.

399
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:19,970
Like this?

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,780
Is this okay?

401
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,050
It's okay.

402
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,180
In fact, rats are more afraid of you.

403

I know

404
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,810
my next request may be too much.

Isn't he from Zhou's Group?

Why are you with him?

412

Aunt, it's a long story.

413
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,640
Long story?

414
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,170
Keep your distance from him.

415
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,060
How's the car?

416
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,110
The car broke down.

417
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,400
I can tell.

418
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,850
May I stay at the farm today?

419
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,560
No way!

Is it because I'm short on money?

Am I, Jiang Yuqin, short of money?

426
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,280
I just discriminate between love and hate.

427
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,040
Aunt, he's no longer a member of Zhou's Group.

428
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
He resigned.

429
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,540
I resigned.

430
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,550
He got sacked?

431
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,350
Aunt, look how pitiful he is.

432
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,610
He has nowhere to stay at this late hour.

433
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,200
He said he could keep the farm for us.

434
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,980
Let's make it clear.

435

Mr. Zhou asked me to stop you before.

499
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,430
Now you don't like Mr. Zhou anymore.

500
00:32:58,090 --> 00:32:59,690
Then this job of mine is done.

We don't need to contact each other anymore.

On our farm,

there is an unwritten rule:

"No work, no food."

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,610
So, you must work with me

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,500
They don't eat what strangers feed them.

519
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,739
Come and eat!

520
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,440
My piggies!

521
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,690
♫Running in the field with wind chimes ringing♫

522
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,620
♫Snapdragon flowers dancing against the breeze♫

523
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,830
♫The sunshine lights up ahead♫

524
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,900
♫Plant the seeds of our love in the soil♫

525
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,100
♫Let's go on our splendid journey now♫

526
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,510
♫Let's enjoy the blooming season together♫

527
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,929
♫Open our hearts and let each other in♫

528
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,350
♫Don't lie to me again♫

529
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,330
♫Facing the wind, leave behind all the doubts♫

530
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,060
♫Let's look out for our harbour together♫

531
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,060
Hongbao!

532
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,440
Come here.

533
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,070
Hongbao.

534
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,410
♫When you're with me, I can never feel lost♫

535
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,810
Come here.

536
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,260
♫My eyes are locked on yours♫

537
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,840
You must be tired.

538
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,790
♫The way you look♫

539
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,410
♫The starlight♫

540
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,080
How is it, Hongbao?

541
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,350
♫And the sweetness from the field♫

542
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,560
Have you finished your patrolling today?

543
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,590
♫I'm not going to step back♫

544
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,610
♫I'm walking to you♫

545
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,030
Go to sleep.

546
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,450
♫I want to stop the time♫

547
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,370
♫It's raining♫

548
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,480
This is much more tiring than working in the office.

549
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,450
♫The flowers are blooming♫

550
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
Looks like

551
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,210
♫Look up♫

552
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,570
I can't have lunch today.

553
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,840
♫Let's look at the starry night♫

554
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,620
♫With the truth only, I'm walking to you♫

555
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,600
You know how exhausting it is to work on a farm, right?

556
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,310
♫I'll tell you about my past♫

557
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,690
♫The beautiful woods♫

558
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,070
♫Will witness my vow♫

559
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,310
♫I'm standing on the land of my hometown♫

560
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Look at that tree.

561
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,860
Did you see the carvings on it?

562
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:40,920
When I was young,

563
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,690
I carved marks on it

564
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:42,880
to compare my height with it.

565
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,450
But I found that I grew shorter and shorter.

566
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,090
Later, I found out

567
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,250
that trees grow too.

568
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,900
And I cried for it.

569
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,530
Why are you laughing?

570
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,910
Do you know why this farm is called Snapdragon Farm?

571
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,760
Why?

572
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,840
When I was young, my classmates bullied me

573
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,100
and even took my money.

574
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,130
Once,

575
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,790
I hid in a flower shop

576
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,040
and saw a pot of snapdragons on sale.

577
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,210
I was like, "This flower is so beautiful."

578
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,280
The flower shop lady was a kind person.

579
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,050
She pitied me,

580
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,510
so she gave me that flower.

581
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,810
I think I'm kinda like that snapdragon.

582
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,440
We were all children that no one wanted.

583
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,760
Later, my aunt took me to the farm,

584
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,710
and I planted the flower here.

585
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,890
So this is called the Snapdragon Farm.

586
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,680
Aunt said this would be our home from now on.

587
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:37,940
Look.

588
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,390
Look how good these plants are now.

589
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:47,060
Don't worry.

590
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,340
I'll get your Snapdragon Farm back.

591
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,090
I don't want the girl I like

592
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,520
to be without a home.

593
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,250
Is everything ready?

594
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,930
It's time to fight back.
