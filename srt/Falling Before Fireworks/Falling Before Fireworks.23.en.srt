But I finally got used to it.

192
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,330
I just raised those kids behind the mountain.

193
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,460
And I want to go to there

194
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,500
to pick plums with you next year.

198
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,620
The probability of not moving out

199
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,170
is less than one percent, right?

200
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,160
It's like winning a lottery.

Leave the luggages in our warehouse.

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,060
I've talked to my family.

They emptied the warehouse last night.

227

We can move there anytime.

Okay.

232
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,510
I'm going to pick up the mover.

There will be a hotel.

239
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,040
But Mr. He plans to set the location at the back of the mountain.

240
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Are there mines behind the mountain?

241
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,640
Or did your mother come to his dream yesterday?

242
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,740
You two reacted

243
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,690
exactly the same.

244
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,859
Mr. He wants me and my brother

245
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,990
to build a hotel like the Jing Garden for him.

246
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,450
As for the Jing Garden,

247
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,250
it will be a free scenic spot for the hotel residents.

248
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,740
He watched the trial video

249
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,360
and met those old craftsmen.

250
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,260
All these remind him the time

251
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,550
when he was selling pork in the countryside.

252
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,030
There was an old mentor

253
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,760
who sharpened the knife for him for free.

254
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,640
He's full of energy and

255
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,180
insisted on repaying the kindness he received.

256
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,710
So we don't have to move out.

257
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,340
And we have to turn Jing Garden

258
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,890
into an international intangible cultural heritage.

259
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,490
So he was just scaring us last night.

let me give you a piece of advice.

280

A strong woman with a weak man can't last long.

281
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,610
That's nonsense when a man says he'll wait for you.

If you really want to protect this marriage,

283

don't go to Beicheng.

284

It's more important to have a baby early.

00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:33,230
[Wishing all of us can have our own fireworks on the days of our  lives]

558
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:30,740
♫but soon vanished in the blink of an eye♫

559
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:36,730
♫When the star appeared♫

560
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:39,920
[Wishing all of us can have our own fireworks on the days of our  lives]

561
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:42,270
♫Do you know I started to miss you again♫

562
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,500
[The end]
