00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
I didn't tell her anything.

5
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,370
Seeing is believing, but hearing could be misleading.

6
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,430
Do you think if she sees you like this,

7
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,100
she will still love you?

8
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,160
What is this?

What are these?

10
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,610
Could your art have the due share of

11
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,670
aesthetic value on par with the Academy of Art?

12
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,730
Brother Chen is at rock bottom

13
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,420
being abandoned by his family, wife, and friends.

14
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,930
He needs warm colors to heal.

15
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,900
Why aren't they back yet?

16
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,250
Did they find out about this?

17
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,940
I really think our birthday gift

18

is too much.

19
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,600

Fight your fear by facing it head-on.

The scene where Jing Chen was betrayed by his family and friends

23
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,710
gives me a thrill.

24
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,380
I should have installed a CCTV

25
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,790
to live stream the devastating betrayal.

26
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,120

Screw the systematic therapy to beat sensitivity.

38

If he can't heal from his trauma, so be it.

39
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,460
He might not maneuver his hands willfully for wooden works,

40
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,260
and could still use those hands.

41
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,270
Are you...

How could you

45
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,180
believe the slappy acting of Chi Zhongyu?

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,320
When did he distinguish the front nasals from the back nasals?

47
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,310
Do you really think he can distinguish Chen from Cheng?

48
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,660
What all the fuss about breaking a toy in your childhood?

49
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,130
It's not like you killed someone or committed an arsenal.

You don't need to beat yourself up.

51
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,920

Speaking of that,

did you watch my acting in the afternoon?

his expression, reaction,

106
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,050
I went to the hotel only because I couldn't accept it.

107
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,380
I wanted to confirm

whether he was willing to give up his dreams for his wife.

109
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,830
After all, when you were dating me,

110
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,910
dreams and careers were your priorities.

losing to a woman

115
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,820
is much more acceptable

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,500
parts of that sound weird.

No part sounds right.

Don't talk to me.

The other day,

127
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:48,930
I felt unworthy and ashamed about my past.

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,510
I just needed to get it out of my system.

129
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,800
But I do mean it

130
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,409

131
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,890

It's Brother Chen's birthday.

152
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,100
But only three of us come to his party. Isn't it a little pathetic?

153
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,100
It's four people.

Now what kind of present

162
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,790
should we give to Brother Chen?

163
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,290
I swear

that we only became complices

He has no worldly desire.

170
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,860
He's so detached that he could be immortal.

171
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,390
I've known him for so long.

172
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,410
I've never found him unsatisfied

173
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,660
or heard him talk about what he wanted.

174
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,670
He is deprived of a sense of security

175
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,530
and the accompany of his family.

176
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,440
His worst fear

177
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,260
is being abandoned

178
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,910
because his past mistakes were exposed.

179
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,200
The more he cares,

180
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,150
the more afraid he is about being exposed.

181
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,220
What happened back then?

182
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,780
After my dad passed away,

183
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,380
my mother remarried with me.

184
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,900
When I left Nancheng,

185
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,580
my grandpa adopted Jing Chen.

186
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,850
I came back a few years later.

187
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,350
I found his name was Jing Chen.

188
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,870
I thought

189
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,340
that grandpa missed me so much

190
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,930
that he got a replica of me.

191
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,210
I don't hate him at all.

192
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,870
I've always wanted a younger brother.

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,680
But boys in puberty

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,270
are kind of pretentious.

195
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,700
They like to make themselves noticed by bullying others.

196
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,960
in the way of bullying.

197
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,100
Until the winter solstice that year,

198
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,620
I finally realized

199
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,900
that my self-involvement was putting him over the edge.

200
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,050
So you never blamed him.

201
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,550
You left

202
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,970
to give this family

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,580
and grandpa to him.

204
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,070
Moreover,

205
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,110
he also gave up his name to Jing Chen.

206
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,430
The former Jing Cheng became the current Jing Musheng.

207
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,490
I'm not that selfless.

208
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,000
I did it for myself.

209
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,330
I always think that grandpa's too conservative.

210
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,790
He insists that crafts should be protected and confined.

211
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,660
I was young and passionate.

212
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,910
I thought we should spread the art of the mortise and tenon joint.

213
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,640
Jing Chen destroyed the model,

214
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,330
giving me an excuse to avoid responsibility.

215
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,200
The least expected is

216
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,530
that he beats himself up so hard.

217
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,030
What?

218
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,640
I know what birthday present we should give him.

219
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,860
I have an idea too.

220
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,430
Desensitization therapy.

221
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,460
We force him

222
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,880
to face his worst fear head-on

223
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,980
and to rebuild himself afterward.

224
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,810
We should stage on a scene based on his worst history

225
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,920
to help him rip off the band-aid.

226
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,640
At the moment when he thought he was abandoned by his family...

227
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
by wife and friends,

228
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,280
we come back to him

229
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,630
as a surprise.

230
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,500
Are you two devils?

231
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,080
It's his birthday.

232
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,700
You don't have to be that brutal to him.

233
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,900
He deserves better than

234
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,060
a fake scene of family abandonment.

235
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm afraid that would break him.

236
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,470
You're being soft-hearted.

237
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,300
The outcome is what matters.

238
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,390
Who is it?

239
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,900
Yes.

240
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,730
It's

241
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,460
him.

242
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,240
I see.

243
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,950
Don't be angry.

244
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,040
Your brother did it for your own good.

245
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,110
We've tried to talk him out of this.

246
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,180
He insisted on the family abandonment scene.

247
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,980
He told us not to be soft-hearted

248
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,870
and wanted the scene to culminate with Siqing divorcing you.

249
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,290
You've crossed the line.

250
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,430
Divorce?

251
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,090
No.

252
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,910
What are you complaining about?

253
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,710
Don't make a scene.

254
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,950
We're doing this

255
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,960
because neither of you

256
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,370
talk properly.

257
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,370
Here,

258
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,360
the Art of Talking is for you.

259
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,120
You should read it thoroughly.

260
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:42,940
Haven't you grown out of your annoying affection for cats and dogs?

261
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,650
Don't move.

262
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,290
How dare you!

263
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:49,940
Don't move.

264
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,010
You're protective of the things you have the least.

265
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,040
Get rid of them.

266
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,420
Otherwise, I will...

267
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,670
You'll make them disappear as you did to me when I was young.

268
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,020
Do you think

269
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,860
I did something

270
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,150
with those stray cats and dogs?

271
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,820
I'm not sociopathic.

272
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,770
Someone in the village was bitten by a dog.

273
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,000
They complained.

274
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,170
The city administration came here and

275
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,180
took away all the cats and dogs.

276
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,290
Brother Chen.

277
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,990
I don't think he would do such a perverted thing.

278
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,900
He seems to be afraid of dogs.

279
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,850
I'll kick you to death.

280
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,150
We're out of the potato.

281
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,320
Let's peel more.

282
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,250
I'll go

283
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,710
in case they say I bully you again.

284
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,230
Why did you want to study sculpture?

285
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,460
I was very happy

286
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,950
when you left.

287
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,950
I don't think I did anything wrong.

288
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,220
I believe that as long as I make better sculptures than you,

289
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,740
grandpa won't blame me.

290
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,730
But when I picked up the chisel again,

291
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,460
I found myself struggling.

292
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,140
I always want to replace you and

293
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,600
to prove myself to grandpa

294
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,580
I care too much about the result.

295
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,370
Naturally,

296
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,550
during the whole senior semester

297
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,030
I was devoured by a sense of failure

298
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,070
and anxiety.

299
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,880
My last mistake.

300
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,470
I ended up with this.

301
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,590
The worse part is

302
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,340
that I can't handle a chisel anymore after the wound heals.

303
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,200
I was afraid of looking at grandpa.

304
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,860
I was afraid to see the disappointment and resentment on his face.

305
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,150
So I ran away.

306
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,710
I chose the sculpture major

307
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,740
to steer clear of

308
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,890
traditional craftsmanship.

309
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,580
Before grandpa passed away,

310
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,140
he gave me a phone call.

311
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,720
He wanted me to come back

312
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,190
for you.

313
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,250
He's the one I'm most worried about.

314
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,760
If my time comes,

315
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,470
you should be his family for me.

316
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,350
Don't let him feel unwanted

317
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,859
or abandoned.

318
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,140
Don't worry, grandpa.

319
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,050
I will.

320
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,890
That's good.

321
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,290
Every morning

322
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,530
I open my eyes,

323
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,450
I hope you two can go home together

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,819
and spend the winter solstice with me.

325
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,480
I can't make it for the winter solstice.

326
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,000
I booked a ticket for the Spring Festival.

327
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,770
Old man, just hangs in there

328
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,200
and thinks about

329
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,090
how we can celebrate the Spring Festival together.

330
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,910
He always regretted

331
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,120
that he didn't take good care of you as a family.

332
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,120
Me too.

333
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,200
Cut the onions too.

334
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,940
Brother.

335
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,670
I saw you at the internet bar the other day.

336
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,100
You intimidated those punks who picked on me.

337
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,690
You tell them:

338
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,920
Come at me if you dare and

339
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,470
leave my brother alone.

340
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,060
Are you deaf?

341
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,990
I told them to leave my shoes alone.

376

This scroll was painted by an ancestor

377
