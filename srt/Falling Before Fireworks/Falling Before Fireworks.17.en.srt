00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,540
My name is Jing Cheng.

380
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,590
His name is Jing Chen.

381
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,550
My grandpa adopted him.

382
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Because of him,

383
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,600
I couldn't go home for over ten years.

384
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,870
Tell me.

385
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,480
What's our relationship?

386
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,510
Then just now...

387
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,440
I have a weakness.

388
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,310
I'm protective of fair ladies.

389
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,670
Mr. Xiao has some grudges towards

390
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,560
my bumpkin brother.

391
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,680
Why don't we

392
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,070
hatch a plan?

393
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,670
Phip has

394
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,140
100 years of history.

395
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,000
It's a company that offers high-end products.

396
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,080
Last year, the group established

397
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,280
an international craftsmanship foundation.

398
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,260
It will provide funding and cooperation

399
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,850
for craftsmen.

400
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,630
Chinese elements

401
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,590
has become more popular overseas.

402
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,760
And we value

403
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,060
China's market.

404
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,280
We want to work with excellent craftsmen in China.

405
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,510
Young Hanfu designers like you

406
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,710
is our first choice.

407
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,160
In our country, there is an idiom meaning

408
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,050
we should make choices based on our status.

409
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,380
Your company is good,

410
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,610
but it's not our first choice.

411
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,570
Working with big brands

412
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,980
often results in exploitation of

413
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,640
trivial people like us.

414
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,270
Last year, we signed a cooperation agreement

415
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,940
with two veteran artists in Nancheng.

416
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,360
The most orders we receive

417
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,490
on our website are Qipao and porcelein

418
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,950
crafted by them.

419
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,750
We have never interfered

420
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,110
with any of their crafting process.

421
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,970
We definitely will not force them

422
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,500
to streamline their production for profit.

423
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,710
As for this,

424
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,440
you should verify it as soon as possible.

425
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,500
I believe there won't be

426
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,720
better and bigger platforms than us.

427
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,000
Okay.

428
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,730
I'll give you an answer in a week.

429
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,680
Of course.

430
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,170
Looking forward to new members

431
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,350
joining our family.

432
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,340
Thank you.

433
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,950
Mr. Jing.

434
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,050
I'll wait for your news.

435
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,720
Okay.

436
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,100
See you.

437
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,900
Ex-girlfriend.

438
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,530
Hello.

439
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,800
Who are you?

440
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,670
Let me introduce myself.

441
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,950
My former name is Jing Cheng,

442
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,040
the character for the Chinese tamarisk.

443
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,260
I'm also the older brother of the one you called for

444
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:06,860
all night.

445
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,950
But I thought the name was bad luck,

446
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,990
so I changed it.

447
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,140
My name is now

448
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,580
Jing Musheng.

449
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,930
[Promote Sports] [Better Health]

450
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,590
Brother Chen.

451
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,800
I'm done.

452
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,550
You go ahead.

453
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,940
The structure is broken and the pillar is crooked.

454
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,510
If there's a problem with the tenon,

455
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,910
it should be related to the recent typhoon.

456
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,820
And

457
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,030
the material we used before is pine wood.

458
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,260
It contains grease

459
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,020
so it attracts insects easily.

460
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,820
Okay, I'll check it out tomorrow.

461
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,470
Who is it?

462
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,650
From the Cultural Relics Protection Unit.

463
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,780
The Yanfu Temple may need renovation.

464
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,320
I'll check it out tomorrow.

465
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,660
But your hand...

466
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,830
It's not necessarily serious enough

467
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,230
to arrange a huge construction for repair.

468
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,330
The last time we operated on such a huge scale

469
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,540
was 20 years ago.

470
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,220
Let me go with you.

471
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,510
Are there many worshippers there?

472
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,840
I happen to have bad luck lately.

473
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,240
I can pray for luck there.

474
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,700
It's not open.

475
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,550
That is the oldest architecture in Jiangnan

476
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,410
made with mortises and tenons.

477
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,390
In the past, grandpa was

478
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,940
in charge of its maintenance.

479
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,780
Even I...

480
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,230
Over there.

481
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,430
Why is he everywhere?

482
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,310
Isn’t he the one who’s a freeloader?

483
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,690
Long time no see.

484
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,680
What did you say?

485
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,650
Who's the freeloader?

486
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:09,580
A mistake.

487
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,310
Let's go.

488
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,870
Alright.

489
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:15,080
Why are you so angry?

490
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,920
Let's play.

491
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,630
Brother Chen,

492
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,900
you know each other?

493
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,390
Just because you called me brother,

494
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,690
I'll let you get the ball first.

495
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,010
Who called you?

496
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,180
I was talking to...

497
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,000
It's the same.

498
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,730
His brother is also my brother.

499
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,520
Is that right, Chen?

500
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,120
Brother Chen,

501
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,240
are you close?

502
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,540
Yes.

503
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,670
Chen,

504
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,220
you didn't tell him

505
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,640
about our relationship?

506
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,530
Or do you need me to do it for you?

507
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,610
Two more people.

508
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,910
Three on three.

509
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,570
Foul!

510
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,650
Are you playing basketball or fighting?

511
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,000
Don't worry.

512
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,030
Let's see if his hands are crippled.

513
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,120
Bye.

514
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:50,840
Bye.

515
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,090
I thought your hand was really crippled.

516
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,900
But that's strange.

517
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,770
Since your hands are still intact,

518
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,090
why can't you craft mortises and tenons?

519
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,300
Or...

520
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,480
because of back then?

521
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,530
Back then?

522
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,810
Do you think anyone will believe you?

523
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,930
We'll have to try.

524
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,450
Bro,

525
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,750
to be honest,

526
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,970
you're a good player.

527
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,850
But your standard of making friends is not good.

528
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,440
You mean Mr. Xiao?

529
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,780
I also think he is a bad player with a worse personality.

530
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,830
But I have no choice.

531
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,630
I'm just a construction worker.

532
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:48,990
I really am.

533
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,030
Right?

534
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,100
I thought you were in cahoots.

535
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,080
Bro,

536
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,480
let's add each other on WeChat.

537
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,460
Let's play together next time.

538
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,060
Sure.

539
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:58,730
Here.

540
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,010
I'll scan your QR code.

541
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,640
My name is Chi Zhongyu.

542
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,660
Just call me Yu.

543
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,430
I'll send you my name on WeChat.

544
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:05,950
Okay.

545
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,350
Excuse me.

546
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,030
I need to reply a message.

547
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,740
Yun Pian.

548
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,720
What's the matter?

549
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,190
I was playing basketball with my friend.

550
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,600
What? Yun Pian?

551
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,070
You know her too?

552
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,780
Is it the Yun Pian that designs Hanfu?

553
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,560
Yes.

554
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,450
You know each other too?

555
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,110
More than that.

556
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,330
She is my senior

557
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,950
and also Chen's neighbor.

558
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,360
We've known each other for more than ten years.

559
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,820
What a coincidence, Chen.

560
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,710
How about this?

561
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,670
Let's have dinner together these days.

562
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,390
My treat.

563
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,960
I have work to do.

564
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,920
Let's meet again next time.

565
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,700
Sure.

566
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,050
Bye.

567
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,770
Do you want to vent your anger?

568
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,250
What do you mean?

569
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,170
There were many people in the court just now.

570
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,850
I couldn't teach him a lesson.

571
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,760
We can go somewhere else.

572
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,250
But I'll have to ask you to get your brother

573
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,810
to the construction site.

574
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
We can find someone to hold him down.

575
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,330
Do you think we should cripple his hands

576
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,270
or...

577
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,010
Welcome to officially join our Phip family.

578
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,160
Thank you.

579
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,240
By the way,

580
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,710
I have a friend who has

581
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,060
an intangible cultural heritage exhibition.

582
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,300
He exhibits oil paper umbrellas, wood carving, palace lamps

583
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,380
and handmade backpacks there.

584
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,060
There are other sorts of crafts too.

585
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,030
I think

586
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,450
there should be someone suitable for Phip.

587
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,410
Please introduce

588
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,930
your awesome friend to me.

589
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,640
Chinese style will be our brand style

590
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,320
in the coming year

591
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,090
and we're looking for suitable craftsmen.

592
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:41,800
Well,

593
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,490
I'll call you soon.

594
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,370
Looking forward to our cooperation.

595
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,130
Bye.

596
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,830
Yun Pian.

597
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,970
What's the matter?

598
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,290
I was playing basketball with my friend.

599
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,880
You're kidnapped?

600
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,750
Alright.

601
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,810
Just die then.

602
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,220
What do you think about the proposal last time?

603
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:19,830
Don't you

604
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,790
want to take revenge on him?

605
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,730
What are you going to do?
