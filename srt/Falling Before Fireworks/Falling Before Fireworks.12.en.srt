What's wrong? Did you have a fight?

378
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:03,660
No.

379
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,650
Give it to your master.

380
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,160
No quarrel?

381
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,400
Then it's a cold war.

382
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,400
Let me deal with it.

383
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,320
Master Teng.

384
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,750
Come in.

385
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,170
Feel free to sit or look around.

386
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,290
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,990
This one is not for sale.

388
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,510
Hello, Master Teng.

389
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,930
I'm the husband of Siqing, the client manager of NCB,

390
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,600
Jing Chen.

391
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,460
I’m here to ask about your specific requirements for the design.

392
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,360
Hello.

393
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,310
Sorry.

394
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,850
Come, sit down.

396
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,990
Where is the lunch box from your husband?

397
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,870
Your honeymoon period is over so soon.

398
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,590
Of course not.

399
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,540
I already heated up the food.

[Nancheng Commercial Bank]

401
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,780
Master.

402
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,770
I haven't tried Chen's cooking for a long time.

403
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,010
Let me have a bite.

404
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,910
Sure.

405
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,110
Let's eat on the rooftop.

406
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,060
Okay.

407
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,360
She's staying next door?

408
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,190
This is too...

409
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,310
So you and Chen

410
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,060
quarreled because of this?

411
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,560
I wish he was willing to fight with me.

412
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,550
But I'm not qualified to affect his emotions.

413
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,130
No.

414
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,290
Master.

415
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,830
Don't get me wrong. This has nothing to do with you.

416
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,820
I've known Chen for so long

417
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,340
but never seen him lose his temper.

418
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,170
Really.

419
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,250
He has been like that since he was a kid.

420
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
Grandpa Jing taught him that.

421
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,200
He must have control of his emotions.

422
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,000
If he hadn't lost control of his emotions before,

423
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,220
how did he get the scar on his hand?

424
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,470
You knew?

425
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,240
We are husband and wife.

426
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,840
He shouldn't have kept it from me.

427
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,770
Don't blame him.

428
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,720
He didn't mean to hide it from you.

429
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,030
Men

430
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,120
don't like losing face.

431
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,220
This type of stuff

432
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,400
is not something glorious after all.

433
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,060
What about Yun Pian?

434
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,850
When did she know?

435
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,540
She was the first one to know.

436
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,850
At that time,

437
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,310
Chen was very dispirited.

438
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,510
He didn't care if his hand

439
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,370
could be crippled.

440
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,100
Later I realized

441
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,150
that physical pain

442
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,340
was nothing to Chen.

443
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:49,090
What really bothered him

444
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,780
was the barrier in his heart.

445
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,260
That means

446
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,340
he got

447
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,850
post-traumatic stress disorder from it, right?

448
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,110
They have such a close relationship.
