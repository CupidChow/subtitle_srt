Is it because your grandpa wanted you to do it?

93

Or is it because  you really like mortise and tenon joint

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,090
Yun Pian.

193
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,450
Playing board games?

194
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm with my best friend now.

195
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,550
Let me ask her.

196
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,260
Sure.

197
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,060
Sure.

198
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,920
Okay, we'll be right there.

199
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,260
Okay.

200
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,170
Let's go.

201
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,720
I have two more.

202
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,200
Five.

203
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,260
You lost.

204
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,270
Pick one.

205
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,890
Here.

206
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,720
Chen,

207
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,070
isn't this too dramatic?

208
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,220
Your wife is hanging out

209
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,790
with your first love.

210
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,380
And even happily

211
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,550
hanging out with boys together.

212
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,660
Chen,

213
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,550
do you know what this means?

214
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,330
It means you're doomed.

215
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,390
Is this man a colleague of your bank?

216
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,740
Of course not.

217
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,280
No.

218
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,300
That's not the point.

219
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,360
Yu.

220
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,310
What?

221
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,060
Do you want me to be a cannon fodder?

222
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,390
I'm not going.

223
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,610
I can't deal with neither senior nor mentor.

224
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,750
Let me ask Yun Pian.

225
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,780
This is the address of this shop.

226
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,070
She's so cool and charming.

227
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,020
If you could master one move,

228
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,260
you wouldn't be

229
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,620
playing Platonic love with your husband.

230
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,880
Well,

231
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,270
I haven't found the right time.

232
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,940
Chances

233
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,010
are created by people.

234
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,930
Tonight is the best time

235
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,890
to checkout what you have learned.

236
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,070
Did you enjoy the movie?

237
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,960
I can't stand it.

238
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,340
Siqing,

239
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,800
what's so good about marriage?

240
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,060
It's the bound.

241
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,360
I grew up alone.

242
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,740
What I envy is not being remembered,

243
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,920
but to have someone I can remember.

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,470
Just like

245
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,560
you know someone is waiting for you at home.

246
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,720
No matter how late you work and how tired you are,

247
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,980
there is someone you want to have dinner together.

248
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,960
So it's just a bound?

249
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,510
What about love?

250
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,120
You and your husband...

251
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,210
He and you...

252
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,240
Do you love each other?

253
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,060
She can't answer this question.

254
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,850
She and her man are in a flash marriage and divorce.

255
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,970
They got married first then fell in love.

256
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,570
They are just started to fall in love now

257
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,510
while they are in a cooling-off period for divorce.

258
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,100
Love is different from marriage.

259
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,430
The probability of being in love and be together

260
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,460
is like a lottery.

261
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,240
Cheers!

262
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,220
Chen.

263
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,710
Chen.

264
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,510
Chen.

265
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,300
Don't be angry.

266
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,490
I've checked that

267
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,900
this is just a board game store.

268
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
There's no explicit materials.

269
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,730
They are just playing

270
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,270
games like truth or dare,

271
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,770
kabe-don,

272
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,620
biscuits bite game,

273
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,190
and the circle of love.

274
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,850
You're obviously angry.

275
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,510
What's so hard to admit?

276
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,640
How can you be so mean at such a young age?

277
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,840
Don't lose your temper again.

278
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,750
Are you not convinced?

279
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,750
Go.

280
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,020
Hammer these nails into the wood.

281
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,580
When will you stop being angry?

282
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,800
When will you stop?

283
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,700
Don't be angry.

284
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,560
Take out all the nails

285
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,390
that you just hammered.

286
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,040
It's only temporary to be angry.

287
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,480
But when you lose your temper,

288
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
what you said and did

289
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,380
are like these nails.

290
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,040
It will be stuck in the heart.

291
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,920
It hurts others and yourself.

292
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,740
Even if this nail

293
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,790
is pulled out,

294
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,480
it still left marks.

295
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,980
It will never be erased.

296
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,850
What if we don't remove it?

297
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,710
We, people who build a structural house with mortise and tenon joints,

298
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,550
don't want to use nails unless necessary.

299
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,330
Because even if you don't pull it out,

300
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,330
sooner or later,

301
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,320
as time goes by, it will loosen

302
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,360
and cause the house, bang,

303
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,640
dismantled.

304
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,710
Chen,

305
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,900
if you can't control your emotions,

306
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,960
you can come here and hammer some nails.

307
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,870
Then think about the consequences.

308
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,510
Yu.

309
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,320
I haven't been angry for over ten years.

310
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,070
The consequences of not able to control emotions...

311
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:56,990
I tried

312
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,710
and I couldn't bear it.

313
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,150
I don't agree with Grandpa Jing.

314
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,869
It's impossible for a human to be emotionless.

315
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,800
It's possible.

316
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,250
That's how I used to be.

317
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,280
Can you always be like this?

318
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,099
Chen,

319
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,819
were you jealous just now?

320
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,400
Am I right?

321
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,830
You're still up?

322
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,610
We went to see a movie at first.

323
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,100
Later,

324
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,350
because that friend was dumped,

325
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,620
we went to a board game shop.

326
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,280
Well...

327
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,790
Yes.

328
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,100
Do you feel better?

329
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,030
Much better.

330
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,660
That's all?

331
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,980
Did you have fun?

332
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

333
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,210
That's good. Remember to drink some loquat water.

334
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Do you like this kind of table games?

335
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:22,980
Don't worry.

336
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,440
I know I am a married woman.

337
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,940
However,

338
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,820
our 30 days cooling-off period for divorce

339
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,890
is over.

340
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,550
Siqing,

341
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,970
don't try to provoke me.

342
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,850
I'm afraid I can't control my emotions.

343
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,830
Siqing,

344
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,290
I also have the desire to possess as a man.

345
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,410
It's even darker

346
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,960
than you think.

347
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,220
Don't look at me like that.

348
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,510
Or what?

349
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,030
Are you scared?

350
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,530
I'm sorry.

351
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,210
I warned you.

352
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,760
Don’t look at me like that.

353
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,160
Jing Chen,

354
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,970
can you

355
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,930
put on golden thread glasses

356
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,620
and repeat what you just said?

357
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,750
I can't reject people that have

358
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,310
low-pitched voice,

359
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,590
a faint smile on the face

360
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,550
with gentle scum type of golden thread glasses.

361
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,960
Oh my god.

362
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,550
This is so sexy.

363
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,350
Golden thread glasses. Golden thread glasses.

364
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,510
[Golden thread glasses]

365
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,680
Chen, I'm here for dinner.

366
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,770
You are not short-sighted. Why are you wearing glasses?

367
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,030
To prevent blue light.

368
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,180
What about you?

369
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,480
Your glasses are so tacky.

370
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,530
Why are you here again?

371
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,790
I'm worried about you.

372
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,070
Did my mentor quarrel with you for senior

373
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,000
last night?

374
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,270
She didn't mention it.

375
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,000
I forgot too.

376
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,820
How can you forget such an important thing?

377
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,830
What did you do last night?

378
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,680
Chen,

379
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,270
did you finally lose control of

380
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:33,810
your inner beast?

381
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,860
I can't reject people that have

382
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,560
low-pitched voice,

383
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,840
a faint smile on the face

384
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,620
with gentle scum type of golden thread glasses.

385
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,280
Tell me. What?

386
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,170
What are you doing?

387
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,530
What are you doing?

388
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,710
What are you doing?

389
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,040
It's annoying.

390
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,330
Your husband is a beast.

391
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,610
Come here!

392
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,650
Chen,

393
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,810
take care of yourself.

394
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,790
President.

395
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,790
Okay, I'll be right back.

00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,460
[Jingyu Hall]

397
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,890
Yun Pian, you...

398
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,310
Senior.

399
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,660
About the studio you asked me to find...

400
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,220
I didn't find a suitable one here.

401
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,890
Let's go somewhere else.

402
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,290
Senior.
