00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,090
It's fluffy and innocent.

Look at it.

380
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,340
Try it.

381
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,910
Well,

382
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,070
I give it a try?

383
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,120
Touch it!

384
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,260

385
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,750

I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at him.

387
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,130
Look at him.

388
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,190
The procedure is done.

389
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,180
Just wait for the trial the day after tomorrow.

390
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,420
I've asked them to expedite my property ownership certificate.

391
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,950
Ask that agent

392
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,760
if there is anyone who wants to see my house.

393
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,360
Is there anyone who wants to see the house now?

394
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,910
Now there are two interested clients.

395
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,260
I'll send them a video

396
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,290
and confirm the time.

397

Manager Si, don't worry.

398
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,520
Your house's location is good,

399
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,830
and it has a good view.

400
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,050
I promise I'll sell it for you in a month.

401
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,040
Okay, thank you.

402

This house is not for sale.

This is...

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:38,150
This is the landlord's husband.

407
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,230
Since he said he wouldn't sell it, we won't sell it.

408
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,340
I'll call you later.

409
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,270
Okay.

410
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,380
This house is not for sale.

411
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,780
So are you going to

412
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,440
sell the Jing Garden?

413
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,720
I can build another Jing Garden,

414
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,500
but I can't build this house.

This is a safe zone she has imagined countless times.

416
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,480
It's a sense of security that even I can't give.

418
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,750
You're a girl.

419
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,630
You'd understand better what this house means to her.

420
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,490
Fine.

421

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,500
What's wrong?

423
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,730
You two are really amazing.

424
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,440
You make me

425
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,210

What are you talking about?

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,690
He is indeed the man I once liked.

just for Grandpa?

Everyone is saying that the garden is well repaired.

434
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,350
Someone even recognizes

435
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,300
that it was built with the craft of the mortise and tenon joint.

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,490
I thought you liked this place.

439
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,340
So I prepared a surprise for you.

This is what you want to do, right?

444

Light them up

445
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,230
and let more people pay attention to them.

So pretentious.

Happy birthday.

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,680
Thank you.

We can fill them up slowly.

460
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,930
This is just a house.

461
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,070
Only a house with a family

462
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,690
can be called home.

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,800
you would sell the Jing Garden for me.

will belong to someone else in two days anyway.

Let your brother's stepfather

480
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,790
use it as fertilizer.

558
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,750
on those who buy Ms. Chen Yunxiang's plaited straw bags.

563
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,460

explaining the misunderstanding.

[Justice for the People]

572
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,450
Do you think

573
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,980
we can win?

574
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,310
Yes.

575
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,210
One percent chance.

576
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,930
Doesn't that mean we are going to lose for sure?

577
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,890
I find that

578
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,520
you're always pessimistic.

579
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,620
The winning rate for the first prize

580
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,840
in the double-color ball lottery is 1 in every 17 million.

581
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,650
The probability is hundreds of thousands of times lower than ours.

582
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,310
Still, there are people who won the first prize.

583
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:06,940
Okay.

584
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,190
I'll be optimistic this time.

585
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,180
If Jing Chen

586
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,260
seizes this one percent chance,

587
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,600
you and I can have a go.

[Xi Jinping]

590
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,240
Those bastards are so despicable.

591
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,370
They put the blame on the advertisers.

592
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,680
I see that most of the photos online

593
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,420
are Internet celebrities and purchasing agents.

594
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,620
They should be attracted by discounts.

595
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,520
Even if they don't change their marketing strategy,

596
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,870
we also have no way to prosecute them

597
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,710
for their small actions abroad.

598
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,090

599
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,920
But they may ask us to return the payment for goods.

600
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,310
Thank you, Attorney Chen.

601
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,920
I can return the money,

602
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,940

[Xi Jinping]

608
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,560
I'd like to start by reiterating a point to the defense here.

609
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,160
As an international brand,

610
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,750
respecting China and Chinese culture

611
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,820
is the premise for Phip to enter China's market.

612
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:24,750
It's the bottom line, not the upper limit.

613
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,190
Phip keeps slapping their own face.

614
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,010
In the name of cultural differences,

615
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,890
they posted insulting advertisements on public platforms.

616
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,040
Whether it's because of ignorance

617
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,520
or arrogance,

618
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,120
or whether it's intentional or subjective malice,

619
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,070
it's enough to prove that Phip is trying to gain benefits,

621
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,590
so they put a smile on their faces

622
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,300
and stab us in the back.

00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,780

624
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:55,640

629

All this time,

631
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,550
Phip has had high regard for

632

as an anti-Chinese racial brand.

652
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,910

653
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,360
that I would lose this case for sure

654

and even lose quietly.

655
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:09,190

[Plaintiff]

657
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,190
to show them our standpoint

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,270
that Chinese manufacturing

659

and Chinese traditional craftsmanship

660
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,460
will no longer remain silent.

661
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,400
My mandator, Ms. Chen Yunxiang, said

662
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,580
there is no right that

663
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,830
our own girls

664
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,100

can wear the bag she plaited.

666
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,820
We should show the world

Chinese craftsmen

668
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,360
and their hearts.

669

[Plaintiff]

670
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,560
These are some craftsmen's profiles I collected

671
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,340
for the exhibition this year.

672
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,420
Some of them are over 80.

673
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,330
They've been learning their crafts since they were 15.

674
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,010
To this day,

675
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,040
they are still accompanied by their crafts every day.

676
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,700
Mr. Lu from the Xijiao Village.

677
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,250
To make an umbrella, it will go through nearly 100 processes.

678
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,120
He can guarantee that it won't damage over using 3,000 uses.

679
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,490
Immerse in water for one hour without melting.

680
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:11,550
The five-level wind won't deform it.

681
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,360
The selling price is 22 yuan.

682
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,090
Nowhere near the price of luxury goods.

683
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,280
Some are in their prime.

684
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,630
They suffer in a workshop of two square meters

685
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,380
letting life grind them to the breaking point

686
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,430
but never bowing to mechanization.

687
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,040
In the old streets and alleys you don't know,

688
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,260
in the countryside,

689
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,160
our craftsmen

690
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,640
have guarded their crafts for generations.

691
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,840
They're just used to silence,

692
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,800
but they never disappeared.

693
00:36:52,390 --> 00:37:01,300

694
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,750
In this best

695
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,500
and fastest era,

696
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,410
in order not to be discriminated against,

697
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,380
we must create

698
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,690
our own national brand.

699
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,340
Maybe

700
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,030
it's a long journey.

701
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,870
Maybe

702
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,800
the dawn is coming.

703
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,590
But I believe in the future

704
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,340
after you see the world,

705
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,680
you will understand more about the beauty of China.
