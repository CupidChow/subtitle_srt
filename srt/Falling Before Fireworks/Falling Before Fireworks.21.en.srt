will pay the price

562
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,770
and pay a huge amount of compensation.

563
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,560
In the end,

564
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,270
no matter how long the history of your country

565
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,180
or how rich your culture is,

566
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,670
there is still no local brand approved by the people.

567
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,400
Or even internationally renowned luxury products.

568
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,030
Of course,

569
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,940
as long as we cooperate well,

570
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,730
you won't lose a penny.

We are very willing to follow your customs.

574
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,890
Follow our customs.

575
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,920
Then let's do it according to our customs.

576
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,230
Picking up the bowl to eat meat first.

577
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,730
Putting down your chopsticks to curse.

578
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,930
Who taught you these bad habits?

let alone apologize.

584

If the netizens find out one day,

585
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,180
we'll be the ones to blame.

586
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,170
We don't have their expensive PR staff.

587
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,970
We'll be the scapegoat.

588
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,240
The netizens will only think of you as a traitor.

589
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,070
It's frustrating.

590
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,060
So,

591
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,030
we only have one choice left.

592
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,480
Take them head on?

593
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,100
But for now,

594
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,300
these promotional posters

595
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,800
are not enough evidence of their breach of contract.

596
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,980
We have a low chance of winning.

597
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,700
We may need to pay millions in compensation.

598
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,160
They must have calculated this.

599
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,620
That's why they're arrogant.

600
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,610
They thought we wouldn't dare.

601
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,260
Yun Pian, do you dare?

602
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,650
Of course.

603
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,470
I'm much richer than you.

604
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,740
If you dare to take on this case,

605
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,330
why wouldn't I?

606
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,050
Siqing,

607
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,820
you worked all night again last night?

608
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,770
Yes.

609
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,440
I'm going back to Nancheng this weekend.

610
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,610
To collect my house.

611
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,950
You have a car, a house,

612
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,270
a husband and a career.

613
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:25,420
You're much too perfect to belong in this world.

614
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,000
Morning, Mr. Jing.

615
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,320
I had to inform your wife

616
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,790
about every little thing before.

617
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,450
Now that something actually happened,

618
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,200
why are you not saying anything?

619
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,510
I don't want to make her angry.

620
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,100
Or are you afraid that once she knows

621
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,380
you're going to pay tens of millions of liquidated damages,

622
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,590
she'll come back to divorce you for property?

623
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,080
What are you doing?

624
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,600
Get them away.

625
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,120
Can you mind what you say?

626
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,490
Do you still want money?

627
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,410
Hurry up.

628
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,820
I've discussed it with the lawyer.

629
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,390
Even if there's a penalty,

630
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,900
it won't be that exaggerated.

631
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:28,830
I'm raising money

632
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,480
not because I'm afraid of losing the lawsuit,

633
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,460
but to reassure the craftsmen.

634
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,130
I want to hire an agent for their lawsuit.

635
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,230
That's not a small amount.

636
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,360
Besides,

637
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,940
do you think those old people

638
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,460
will terminate the contract for you

639
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,440
just because you are shouldering the damages?

640
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,430
Naive.

641
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,180
We have to try.

642
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,600
We can't let them

643
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,980
take the blame for the brand.

644
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,560
Forget it.

645
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,640
I'll take you to meet someone tomorrow.

646
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,310
Let's see if he has any other solution.

647
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,260
Brother.

648
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,380
Thank you.

649
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,270
Don't be so emotional.

650
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,340
We're brothers with a clear boundary.

651
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,910
If you can't win the lawsuit,

652
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,990
I won't give you a penny.

653
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,600
My stepfather

654
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,030
has a little fetish.

655
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,610
He's afraid that others don't know he's rich.

656
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,310
When my mom married him,

657
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,660
he was a butcher.

658
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,900
After my mom passed away,

659
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,270
it was like he dug up a treasure pot.

660
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,580
He made a fortune

661
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,010
by selling land.

662
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,520
How did he treat you

663
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,070
the past few years?

664
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,860
I want his money.

665
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,940
I don't need his father's love.

666
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,510
All these years, we didn't interfere with each other's affairs.

667
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,250
Those days

668
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,300
were so wonderful.

669
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,110
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

670
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,850
He's not a good guy.

671
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,830
If he didn't take advantage of you

672
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,290
for the sake of my mom

673
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,910
then we're really lucky.

692
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,100
stop pretending in front of me.

693

694
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,389
already perused my brother's contract, right?

695
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,260
How can we win that lawsuit?

696
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,230
This lawsuit...

697
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,820
I have no idea.

698
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,560
You're going to lose.

699
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,760
There's no chance of winning.

700
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,940
But it doesn't matter.

701
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,790
It's just losing a lawsuit.

702
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,620
Pay him some money.

703
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,219
Just pay him.

704
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,840
Some money?

705
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,520
Are you going to pay for it?

706
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,000
I will.

707
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,199

708

711
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,190
what can I do for you?

712
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,270
You're so smart.

713
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,890
I like people like you.

714
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,820
No wonder I fell in love with

715
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,080
the garden you designed.

716
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,860
