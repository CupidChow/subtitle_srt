00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,890
And Jian Yue lives nearby.

567
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,720
It's faster for her to come over.

568
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,380
I promise that

569
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,800
next time when I'm in trouble,

570
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,840
I'll call you immediately.

571
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,420
Okay.

572
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,630
Are you still mad at me?

573
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,250
I'm really not.

574
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,930
And I'll never be mad at you.

575
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,410
Enough!

576
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,900
It's too tiring.

577
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,800
One more round.

578
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,340
One more round.

579
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,510
No.

580
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,660
I'm too tired.

581
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,150
Chen.

582
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,720
I apply to change the game.

583
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,000
It's too tiring.

584
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,640
Chen.

585
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,630
How about we go back and knock nails?

586
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,660
It sounds creepy,

587
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,350
but I think it's much easier than this.

588
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,590
If you still don't feel better,

589
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,930
we can dig a hole for Xiao Fei tonight.

590
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,430
Chen.

591
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,570
Are you angry

592
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,420
that my mentor was wronged and she didn't tell you?

593
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,750
I'm mad at myself!

594
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,900
I know why she didn't tell me.

595
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,340
It's just that I've never really faced it.

596
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,300
Yu.

597
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,750
I have the ability

598
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,130
to stop her from working so hard.

599
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,210
You do.

600
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,700
But you don't like it.

601
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,360
Besides,

602
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,840
I don't think she needs you to do that.

603
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,900
You want to change yourself

604
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,510
because you want to make yourself feel at ease

605
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,140
so that my mentor won't blame you later.

606
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,100
I don't know if I should say you're selfish

607
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,140
or getting timid.

608
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,750
Come.

609
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:15,659
[Yanfu Temple]

610
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,159
Chen.

611
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,960
You like the wood?

612
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,940
Do you want to be my grandson?

613
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,510
I'll buy you wontons every day.

614
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,920
Good.

615
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,949
Good.

616
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,699
When you were young,

617
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,860
they all treated you nicely.

618
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,130
When you have the ability in the future,

619
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,710
you have to help them.

620
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,060
Although I'm not well educated,

621
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,430
I won't let you young people

622
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,150
look down on me.

623
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,860
Tell me.

624
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,230
If all people of my generation

625
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,070
just give up like me,

626
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,140
how can you continue?

627
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,700
In the words of your well-educated people,

628
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:13,710
you

629
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,010
have ignited my hope for life again.

630
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,810
Thank you.

631
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,890
I'm sorry.

632
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:30,850
Professor.

633
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,870
Jing Chen, I just finished class.

634
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,030
I saw your message.

635
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,170
Are you really going to the interview?

636
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,270
Then tomorrow,

637
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,500
I'll arrange a dinner together.

638
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,320
If you don't want to,

639
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,470
don't force yourself.

640
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,170
Don't make things difficult for yourself because you're afraid of me.

641
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,940
No.

642
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,080
I was just thinking

643
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,120
that I never made the right choice

644
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,270
in the past.

645
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,680
I'm almost 30,

646
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,870
but I have achieved nothing.

647
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,550
In the end, I made you

648
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,150
suffer and worry about me.

649
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,930
Look at you.

650
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,350
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

651
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,100
Professor.

652
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,780
Tomorrow.

653
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,840
I want to give it a try.

654
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,610
Why are you here?

655
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,110
I visited Grandpa's old friend a few days ago.

656
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,460
Uncle Xu from the Cultural Relics Protection Unit.

657
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,020
I just chatted with him,

658
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,540
and he took me here.

659
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,760
Look at you.

660
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,370
You know you can't do it.

661
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,400
Why are you acting tough?

662
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,760
How about I help you?

663
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,470
Your condition.

664
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,450
Change your name or your surname

665
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,530
and move out of Jing Garden.

666
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,250
You failed to throw me out ten years ago.

667
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,740
Why do you think I'll listen to you now?

668
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,890
Of course it's because of your call just now.

669
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,260
You're going to change your profession.

670
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,880
Why do you still take my family name?

671
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,360
A person

672
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,790
who has no blood ties with us

673
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,730
and failed to guard Grandpa's skills

674
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,980
doesn't deserve it.

675
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,700
I wonder if Grandpa would regret

676
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,460
adopting you if he knew what you've done.

677
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,410
I should have asked you to meet at the company,

678
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,160
but I had an appointment with a client.

679
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,700
I thought you could meet the client with me

680
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:06,690
since you live nearby.

681
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,480
You're one of us from now on.

682
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,060
Come.

683
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,600
Sit down and talk.

684
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,010
Thank you, Mr. Shao.

685
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,540
You're welcome. Come.

686
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,780
Your teacher and I

687
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,020
have been friends for decades.

688
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,960
Mr. Li.

689
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:22,710
Shao.

690
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,210
I finally get to meet you.

691
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,830
This is...

692
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,710
This is my friend, Jing Musheng.

693
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,160
You can call him Mr. Jing.

694
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,220
He is just tagging along.

695
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,390
Mr. Shao, do you mind?

696
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,220
What a coincidence.

697
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,610
I also brought a new friend,

698
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,370
Jing Chen.

699
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,410
Our new CCO.

700
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,070
He graduated from the Department of Sculpture at the CAA.

701
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,490
Many foreign teams are eager to have him.

702
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,980
It took me a lot of effort

703
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:43,950
to poach him here.

704
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,860
Your company has a project.

705
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,360
I'm going to let him take charge of it.

706
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,260
He's quite handsome.

707
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,010
Mr. Li, have a seat.

708
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,640
As your senior in the business,

709
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,690
let me teach you a lesson.
