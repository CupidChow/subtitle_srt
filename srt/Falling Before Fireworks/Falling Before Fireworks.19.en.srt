You kept reminding me

376
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,410
I'm just a substitute without a name.

377
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,910
I don't even have the right to like.

378
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,580
What should I do?

379
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,090
I just want a home.

380
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,150
I used to have a grandpa's home.

381
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,420
Now I have Siqing's home.

382
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,640
Why do you always push me?

383
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,020
Because you owe me.

384
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:40,970
Fine.

385
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,530
I'll pay you back now.

386
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,580
I couldn't let go of the past

387
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,120
because I was afraid of losing them.

388
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,060
But now,

389
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,210
what else do I have?

390
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,780
You're crazy.

391
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,210
You want to drive me crazy, don't you?

392
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,600
You know I care about her the most.

393
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,020
I didn't tell her anything.

394
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,230
Nothing can be compared to what you see with your own eyes.

395
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,360
Have a guess. If she sees you like this,

396
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,990
will she still want you?
