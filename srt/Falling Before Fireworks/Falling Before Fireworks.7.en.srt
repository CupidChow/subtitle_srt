If her client were younger,

566
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,330
she would be a troublemaker after work.

567
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,940
Fine.

568
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,990
I admit

569
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,680
that it was my fault that she got hurt yesterday.

570
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,550
I shouldn't have mocked her afterwards.

571
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,020
So,

572
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,560
she didn't tell me the whole story.

573
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,510
It's my first time doing this.

574
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,650
I'm unfamiliar with it.

576
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,780
seriously,

577
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,770
things won't work out for you two.

578
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,140
I don't understand.

579
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,480
Except she is younger than the senior,

580
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,840
what do you see in her?

581
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,160
Why are you marrying her?

But,

590
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,760
why did you choose such a work?

591
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,170
Jing Chen,

592
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,940
are you giving up on sculpturing?

593
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,800
You used to repel traditional craftsmanship

594
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,310
more than anyone else.

595
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,880
How come you suddenly changed as we're close to graduation?

596
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,650
Do you hate going aboard with us that much?

597
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,480
It has nothing to do with you.

598
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,680
Yeah.

599
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,590
Of course, your choice has nothing to do with me.

600
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,630
But you have to plan for your future.

612
