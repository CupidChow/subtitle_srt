209
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,640

218

She said if she drank a glass of wine, I would buy

219
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,810
one million yuan's worth of finance products from her bank.

220
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:15,030
I thought

221
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,910
she is a girl, and it's a tough job.

222
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,300

224
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,790

That's why I can't make things more difficult for you.

230
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,800
She drank red wine,

231
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,920
so I'll drink liquor

232
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,620

Screw your year-end bonus!

00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,730
I drank during my period

376

379
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,430
I don't care! I quit!

Sir, go to the Jing Garden.
