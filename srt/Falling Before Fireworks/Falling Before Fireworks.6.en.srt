But there's a problem with the car.

200
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,550
It'll take about an hour.

201
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,000

202
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,860

He has no manners at all.

This is the person you are going to marry?

207
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,170

208

or property disputes,

209
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,190
get a divorce right away.

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,100
I'd rather you get a divorce

You are right.

221

But you're always like this.

222
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,500
At the college entrance examination, you denied the major I wanted.

223
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,340
When I graduated, you intervened in my career path.

224

227
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,420

229
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,190
to the talent market.

230
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,340
Now it's my marriage.

231
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,020
Do you think you have

232
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,100
fulfilled your parental responsibilities

233
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,300
by making your presence known

234
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,220
in every major choice of my life?

235
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,550
But is it really necessary?

236
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,130
After you divorced,

237
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,960
you never remembered

238
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,080
my birthday correctly, not once.

239
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,280
No.

240
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,960
There was once.

241
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,650
When I graduated from university,

242
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,150
after I reminded you again and again,

243
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,630
you finally remembered.

244
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,720
But when I rushed home from Nancheng,

245
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,050
both of you had more important things to do.

246
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,130
So you had to stand me up.

247
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm not saying this

248
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,100
to blame you.

249
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,320
Actually, you've never treated me badly.

250
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,120
You just keep telling me

251
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,120
I should be sensible

252
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,750
and should work hard.

253
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,850
I'm used to it.

254
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,260
Mom,

255
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,590
I know it's not easy for you to make money.

256
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,270
Dad,

257
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,660
you have a new family.

258
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,660
It's inevitably you will show favoritism to them.

259
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,250
I just wish that

260
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,830
if you can't give me more,

261
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,550
then don't give me anything.

262
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,280
Besides,

263
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,700
I don't need it at my age anymore.

264
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,390
Let's go.

265
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,180
Uncle, auntie, I'm Jing Chen.

266
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,750
Sorry for being late.

267
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,040
This is the marriage certificate my grandfather wrote

268
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,840
and betrothal gifts for Siqing.

269
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,200
My grandpa likes her very much.

270
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
I'll do my best to take care of Siqing.

271
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't worry.

272
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,130
He's so thoughtful.

273
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,250

274

We'll visit him another day.

Your mother and I came back on the same flight.

283
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,270
I didn't expect the customs at Nancheng

284
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,640

Her mother is on shift

289
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,650
so I came back to keep her company.

00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,400
and let him live in the little earth hut

383
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,680
next to the temple.

384
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,300
The villagers usually give him food

385
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,000
to do good.

386
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,430
Boss.

387
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,400
Eat.

388
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,820
Give him a bowl of wonton.

389
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,780
Okay.

390
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,250
Child.

391
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,290
You're also called Cheng.

392
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,300
What a coincidence.

393
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,910
Do you want onions in the wonton?

394
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
Boss,

395
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,120
don't put onions in the wonton.

396
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,350
Put shrimp skin.

397
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,920
You don't like wontons?

398
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,920
I do.

399
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,600
So I can't finish them at once.

400
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,800
Boss.

401
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,690
Give me another bowl of wonton.

402
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,520
Look at you.

403
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,450
Isn't he...

404
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,550
You're here.

405
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,030
Dear relatives and friends,

406
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,340
dear filial children

407
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,790
and descendants.

408
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,350
The clouds are low.

409
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,830
The grass and trees are sorrowful.

410
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,690
The skies are crying.

411
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,740
The earth is sighing.

412
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,250
Today,

413
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,820
it is with great sadness that we

414
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,370
send off the old man, Jing Kangshan.

415
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,780
Mr. Jing was 89 years old.

416
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,320
We are deeply saddened by

417
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,250
the tragic death of Mr. Jing.

418
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,520
Mr. Jing was easy-going and gentle.

419
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,950
His death

420
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,970
is the misfortune of the Jing family and friends.

421
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:42,240
We are distraught,

422
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,700
grief-stricken.

423
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,060
We are heartbroken

424
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,880
and gutted.

425
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,580
It is with great sadness and grief that

426
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,800
we mourn the loss of Jing Kangshan.

427
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,830
Grandson Jing Cheng, kowtow to bid farewell.

428
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,780
Jing Chen, he's calling you.

429
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,530
Is he also called Jing Chen?

430
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
It's me who's also called Jing Chen.

431
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,190
Old man.

432
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,490
I'm back.

433
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,040
Sorry.

434
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,260
I've broken the promise again.

435
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,790
Sorry.

436
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,660
He's three years older than me.

Chen.

440
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,160
It means treasure.

441
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,260
Let's go.

442
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,310
It's our turn.

443
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,650
I can tell

444
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,650
who is the biological grandson immediately.

445
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,110
It seems that it's not like

446
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,170
the biological grandson didn't want to come back.

447
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,470
I guess these years,

448
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,950
his place was taken so he couldn't come back.

449
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,650
It's been more than ten years.

450
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,810
Yes.

451
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,490
Poor thing.

452
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,190
Look at his biological great-grandson.

453
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,920
They didn't even see each other for one last time.

454
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,860
We saw both of them

455
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,070
grow up with our own eyes.

456
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,430
They are both filial.

457
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,820
We mixed up the two of them.

458
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,110
We thought

459
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,080
the child Uncle Jing brought back

460
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,980
was his biological grandson, Jing Cheng.

461
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,780
The inheritance

462
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,670
and this garden.

463
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,450
Who will Uncle Jing leave it to?

464
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,800
Who knows?

465
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,840
Although the older one has blood ties,

466
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,700
this garden

467
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,960
was built by the younger one.

468
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,980

Why didn't you inform me?

472
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,490
I didn't have time.

473
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,240
Before Grandpa left,

474
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,600
he gave me a call.

475
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,000
He asked me to come back as soon as possible.

476
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,360
From now on, it will be just us two brothers.

477
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,650
As your older brother,

478
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,200
I will take good care of you.

479
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,570
Do you know what Grandpa said before he died?

480
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,850
He said

481
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,500
Cheng is back.

482
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,490
Which Cheng is he talking about?

483
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
What do you think?

484
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,570
I'm not you.

485
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,510
Who cares about that?

486
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,680
The garden is well built.

487
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,540
It's almost identical to where

488
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,090
the three of us used to live.

489
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,550
Didn't you feel guilty

490
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,880
when you were working on this garden?

491
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,980

someone like you

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,510
clearly wouldn't.

494
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,260
Chen is lucky to marry you.

495
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,740
Go back.

496
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,870
Keep him company.

497

No matter what you want to ask,

498
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,170
don't ask him now.

499
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,850

What is longevity money?

It's a red envelope that you gift in return.
