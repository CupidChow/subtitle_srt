00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:15,020
When did she know?

6
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,810
She was the first one to know.

7
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,010
At that time,

8
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,410
Chen was very dispirited.

9
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,310
He didn't care

10
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,100
whether his hand would be crippled.

11
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,320
Later, I realized

12
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,260
that physical pain

13
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:26,550
meant nothing to Chen.

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,330
What really made him feel bad

15
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,810
is the weight on his heart.

16
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,380
So he had

17
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,400

youth is the most sentimental.

21
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,509
Otherwise, he wouldn't have given up going abroad

22
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,479

This is the pain in his heart.

Don't mention it in front of him again.

27
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,390
It's all in the past.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,740
Can he really let it be passed?

29

Let me tell you.

34
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,530
The biggest difference between works by humans and machines

35
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,040
is the expression

36
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,610

378
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,100
Huh?

379
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,710
What do you mean you can't?

380
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,500
Didn’t we agree on this?

381
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,040
And my husband helped you draw the design.

382
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,820
There is something wrong

383
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,280
with the design drawing.

384
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,010
What's wrong?

385
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,410
The client wanted to order more.

386
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,020
But I can't carve them

387
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,320
all by myself.

388
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,370
So,

389
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,960
I can only use the machine.

390
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,170
Jing Chen disagrees?

391
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,670
No. No.

392
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,250
It has nothing to do with him.

393
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,530
It's my fault.

394
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
What happened?

395
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,630
It's okay.

396
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,770
I can solve this.

397
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,720
I'll solve it.

398
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,970
I'll call you later.

399
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,190
He has a deep scar on his wrist.

400
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,410
You've never seen it before, right?

401
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,880
Why are you back now?

402
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,030
Why didn't you let Teng Liqun use your draft?

403
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,120
He told me he wanted a hand-carving wood design.

404
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,910
The design drawing I drew...

405
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,020
Is there any difference between hand carving and machine carving?

406
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,020
It's all for money.

407
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,750
Why do you care so much about it?

408
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,180
There's a difference.

409
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:40,820
Traditional craftsmanship...

410
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,460
Jing Chen.

411
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,300
I don't have time,

412
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,330
and I'm not in the mood to listen to it.

413
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,640
I don’t understand the persistence of artists like you.

414
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,950
If you don't give the draft to him,

415
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,060
he can't take the order,

416
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,800
and he can't repay the loan.

417
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,170
This loan was my mistake.

418
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,090
It's different from Zhao Feng's.

419
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,820
If I can't get the money back,

420
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,680
do you know what will happen to me?

421
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,740
I know.

422
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,950
I'm begging you this time.

423
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,660
For my sake.

424
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,940
You give the design...

425
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,150
That's right.

426
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,610
You know it.

427
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,640
You just don't want to do this for me.

428
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,970
It's not that.

429
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,070
You don't have to force yourself.

430
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,410
We know it better than anyone.

431
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,090
Although we want to

432
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,760
make this marriage work,

433
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,870
we started this relationship without thinking it through.

434
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,800
we don’t even know each other well.

435
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,200
So I always understand you.

436
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,760
You would rather grieve alone

437
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,850
when Grandpa died,

438
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,310
than show me your emotions

439
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,400
or tell me about your past.

440
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,660
As for me,

441
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,510
I can only get information about you

442
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,310
from Chen Lianzhi, Chi Zhongyu,

443
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,390
and even Yun Pian.

444
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,140
I used to think it didn't matter.

445
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
It's just that...

446
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,860
Never mind.

447
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,030
What do you mean, never mind?

448
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,450
We'll talk about it later.

449
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm going back to the bank now.

450
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,380
President.

451
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,000
[Jingyu Hall]

452
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:07,010
You made this?

453
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,320
Keeping your head down is not good for your shoulders and neck.

454
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,440
I used to think

455
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,700
you only had some feelings

456
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,200
for Jing Chen.

457
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,790
But looking at you now,

458
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,540
I think you really like him.

459
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,660
That's why

460
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,050
you care so much about their past.

461
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:28,810
I really, really, really like him.

462
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,920
There are many photo frames left.

463
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,680
We can fill them up slowly.

464
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,640
So what else can we do?

465
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,750
Just keep giving him much love and care.

466
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:54,010
If he doesn't want to talk, I'll pretend I don't know.

467
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,350
I'll buy him a scar gel later.

468
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,390
But if it can't be removed,

469
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,430
we can find another way

470
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,430
to mark this scar.

471
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,050
Let's go.

472
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,680
Why did I vent my anger on him?

473
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,360
Are you crazy?

474
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,710
Don't you want this hand anymore?

475
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,860
Or do you plan to

476
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,420
let Grandpa Jing see you ruin yourself again?

477
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,430
[Crafts and Hearts]

478
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,930
It's you, right?

479
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,820
You guessed it.

480
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,870
Are you angry?

481
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,790
I admit that I was the one who ordered furniture

482
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,390
and increased the orders at the last minute from Teng Liqun.

483
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,850
But that's all.

484
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,770
Teng Liqun gave up hand carving

485
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,490
and chose the machine,

486
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,900
which is his compromise to reality

487
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,270
and money.

488
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,550
Siqing blames you for not giving him the design

489
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,250
because she values her career more.

490
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,760
She doesn't understand your persistence toward traditional craftsmanship.

491
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,020
Don't be so condescending

492
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,220
and humiliate

493
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,460
the persistence of a traditional craftsman.

494
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,120
Teng Liqun did nothing wrong.

495
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,100
He has the right to choose the path.

496
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,930
Since he didn't do anything wrong,

497
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,660
why don't you

498
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,950
give him the design drawing?

499
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,010
And you can help Siqing by doing this.

500
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,740
Why do you all think

501
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,180
I don't want to give the design to him?

502
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,780
The machine can't give its products the sense of dimension

503
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,380
and the charm of characters.

504
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,200
This is the design for machine carving.

505
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,080
I never thought of rejecting Teng Liqun.

506
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,740
Master Teng,

507
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,150
please don't blame your choice

508
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,720
on my wife.

509
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:20,830
She can't take on such a big responsibility.

510
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,110
Besides,

511
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,440
the draft was for handmade wood carving.

512
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,360
It's not suitable for machines.

513
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,940
I'll draw another one for you.

514
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,480
Why?

515
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,440
Tell me.

00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,010
People like me...

517
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,180
Both Siqing and I think

518
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,970
you are a great craftsman.

519
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,360
The hardest part of

520
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,230
craftsmanship is

521
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,610
to protect the crafts.

522
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:46,040
Especially

523
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,830
in such a restless environment,

524
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,360
you can hold on untill now.

525
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,910
Others are not qualified to comment on you.

526
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,170
I'm just a deserter. I'm even more unqualified.

527
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,460
As for the design drawing,

528
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,420
it's the least I can do

529
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,090
for a craftsman.

530
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,580
Of course,

531
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,440
I won't deny

532
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,570
that there is a part of my selfishness

533
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,720
for my wife.

534
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,510
In the past,

535
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,750
you would never change the design.

536
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,310
You broke your principles this time

537
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,590
because you wanted to help Teng Liqun,

538
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,210
not because of Siqing.

539
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,870
I can understand it this way, right?

540
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,120
In front of her,

541
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,240
I have no principles.

542
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,380
Why?

543
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:35,280
Where does she deserve for you to do so?

[Jing Garden]

545
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,650
When did she know?

546
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,420
She was the first to know.

547
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,660
At that time,

548
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,060
Chen was very dispirited.

549
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,220
He didn't care

550
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,710
whether he would be crippled.

551
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,060
Later I realized

552
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,960
that physical pain

553
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,240
meant nothing to Chen.

554
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,990
What really made him feel bad

555
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,450
is the weight on his heart.

556
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,410
So he had

557
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,400
post-traumatic stress disorder, right?

558
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,290
They were really close.

youth is the most sentimental.

561
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,740
Otherwise, he wouldn't have given up going abroad

562
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,730
and gone back to the countryside as soon as he graduated

563
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,060
and for such a long time.

564
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,550
You married her

565
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,380
because she bought your auction work.

566
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,540
If I were the one

567
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,390
who bought your work,

568
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,290
would you...

569
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,000
No.

570
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,130
Neither would you.

571
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,170
Yun Pian.

572
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,960
You should use your competitiveness somewhere else

573
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,050
instead of my marriage with Siqing.

574
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,290
If the design is fine,

575
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,070
remember to pay Teng Liqun as promised.

576
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,570
[Siqing]

577
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,150
[Temporary business trip for a few days. Be back on Monday morning, and we should get the divorce procedure done that day too.]
