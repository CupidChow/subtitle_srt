190
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,550
There are only aircraft lights in the city.

191
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,090
Call me when you go jogging tomorrow.

192
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,140
I can do some exercise too.

193
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,070
Okay.

194
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,120
Then let's put the auditing aside.

195
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,920
I'll wait for you at home.

196
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,490
Going for a walk?

197
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,660
You two almost got divorced.

198
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,530
Why are you still so careless?

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,180
You think nothing of me

200
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
as your rival.

201
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,120
He doesn't even care about you.

202
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,630
Why would I put on a show for you?

203
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,790
The more he ignores me,

204
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,330
the more I feel an itch.

205
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,140
Are you...

206
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,180
a bit cheap?

207
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,450
But I have no choice.

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,710
How about

209
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,490
trying to scold me more until I am awake?

210
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,550
Or we can go to the board game shop.

211
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,040
If I have something fun to do,

212
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,840
I might have a new target.

213
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,070
The board game shop has been temporarily closed.

214
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,790
Let's recharge our energy

215
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,550
and have a healthy date.

216
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,560
I don't know who reported it.

217
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,370
Yu said

218
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,660
Jing Chen has been crazy and forcing you to quit your phone.

219
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,280
What do you mean by force?

220
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,980
I agreed on my own.

221
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,020
Only lonely people

224
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,510
is something you've experienced with me.

225

Falling in love end up without a marriage

226
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,940
is behaving like a hooligan.

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,940
Marriage

228
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,570
is the grave of love.

229
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,440
Although love is gone,

230
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,200
at least I have a grave to visit.

231
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,520
Burning joss paper

232
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,720
will pollute the environment.

233
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,170
You're just sour grapes.

234
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,510
Then why are you staying next door?

235
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,510
To witness you digging your graves.

236
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,890
I don't want to marry Jing Chen.

Have you never taken good care of yourself

241
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,280
since you married Jing Chen?

242
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,410
You've never been clubbing with your sisters, have you?

243
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,880
I didn't like to go clubbing before.

244
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,140
What about traveling?

245
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
I don't have time.

It's all for Jing Chen, right?

Marriage

250
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,010
comes with perks.

251
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,800
Like you said before,

252
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:23,660
you found the sense of concern in it.

253
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,760
But you can have this vague and insubstantial feeling

254
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,010

256

The cost is low.

257
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,870
It can also provide you enough emotional value.

258
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,060
Most importantly,

259
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,580
it doesn't cheat on you.

260
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,600

those two lttle red books are useful?

267

Without those two little red books,

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,730
When I was young,

273
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,090
What I hated the most is the marriage certificate

274
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,340
that bond I,

275
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,290

00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,250
my dad

277
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,230
all together.

278
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,260
My mom and I both knew that my dad was having an affair.

279
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,310
They even came to us.

280
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,070
My mom still thought she was the winner

281
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,290
because of that marriage certificate.

282
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,980
Every time when I tried to persuade my mom to get a divorce,

283
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,480
she would scold me being brutal and cold-blooded.

284
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,550
She said that not getting a divorce was

285

for my own good.

286
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,290
When I was in 12th grade,

287
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,480
one day when we were not home,

288
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,760
she turned on the gas herself.

289
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
She must have made up her mind

290
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,870
to kill herself.

291
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,730
She wanted to make my dad regret for the rest of his life.

Right?

One month after her death,

my dad

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,640
brought a new marriage certificate home.

297

He even brought back the new wife and son.

in a few years,

309

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,530
to fool me?

376
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,440
No way.

377
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,270
Yu has been worried

378
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,750
since last time when we had a fight.

379
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,820
For this reason,

380
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,920
he even wrote

381
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,720
a romantic essay

382
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,320
about

383
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:42,980
how to please girls.

384
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,120
He made such a big mistake.

385
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,060
I'm afraid he feels very guilty now.

386
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,500
As his mentor,

387
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,190
you should give him a chance

388
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,650
to make up for his mistake.

389
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,440
When the weather gets better,

390
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,390
why don't we ask Yun Pian and Yu

391
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,690
to have a barbecue party together.

392
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,740
That's not good.

393
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,410
♫Hey you, can I recommend, mend♫

394
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,810
♫That you tell all your friends, friends♫

395
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,210

♫Will it ever end?♫

403

♫Always chatting on the phone♫

404
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,340
♫When I call, you were never home♫

405

♫Too busy cruising on those streets♫

♫Checking others on the bus♫

408
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,710

♫It's you and me and the weekend♫

417
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,090
What did you just say?

418
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,450
You asked me to...

419
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,900
You asked me to confess my love to the senior?

420
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,580
No.

421
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,530
I'm not going.

422
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm not like you, a married man,

423
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,590
I've never had my first love.

424
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,920
How can I confess to her?

425
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,240
Besides,

426
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,390
what if...

427
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,200
what if she falls in love with me?

428
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
What should I do then?

429
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,530
Should I reject her cruelly

430
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,530
or do I have to accept it out of guilt?

431
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,040
You think too much.

432
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,920
This won't happen.

433
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,830
If you keep showing up around her for a week,

434
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,730
I guess Yun Pian will move out because she can't stand you.

435
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,560
Was it my mentor's idea?

436
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,760
No.

437
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,550
It's me.

438
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,510
Impossible.

439
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,270
A cheap idea like this

440
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,730
must comes from my mentor.

441
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,960
Chen.

442
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,640
Is she messing with you again?

443
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,580
Listen.

444
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,140
You can't always spoil her.

445
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,150
Men have to stand up for themselves.

446
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,060
I have no stance on this.

447
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,140
With wrist cutting and suicide,

448
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,390
this is not a good time.

449
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,490
Okay. Fine.

450
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,040
I'll go.

451
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,840
I am actually good at

452
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,400
confessing my love.

453
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,100
After all, I still have that essay.

454
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,760
We can't waste it.

455
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,360
Right?

456
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,500
Why did you ask me to join you?

457
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:36,320
You, Jing Chen and Chi Zhongyu are classmates,

458
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,580
and we are neighbors.

459
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,800
We can't stay away from each other forever.

460
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,730
Do you want some?

461
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,140
I only drink tea like Jing Chen.

462
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,360
I don't drink coffee.

463
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,620
How can you bear that?

464
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,240
Honey.

465
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,180
Do you want some coffee?

466
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,120
Yes.

467
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,600
It's sickening to hear it.

468
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,640
Do you act like this with your wife at home?

469
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,800
It's the first time.

470
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,260
Otherwise, it will be too much for me to take.

471
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,770
It's scary.

472
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,030
Yes.

473
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,330
Not scary.

474
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,500
Watch and learn.

475
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,220
Senior,

476
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,630
do you want some loquats?

477
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,840
Yes.

478
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,050
Where did you buy this loquats? It's so sour.

479
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,850
Senior.

480
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,510
Actually...

481
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,530
Talk nicely.

482
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,600
Be normal.

483
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,860
Here.

484
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,650
Are you ready?

485
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,710
Yes.

486
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:43,830
Awsome.

487
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,210
This is life.

488
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,640
Time flies.

489
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,370
Summer is coming.

490
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,550
We can eat crayfish.

491
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,330
Yes.

492
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,970
Chen.

493
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,790
arrange schedule to have crayfish together.

494
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,110
How about this weekend?

495
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,070
No.

496
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,250
I have a CPA exam.

497
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,860
Let's wait for the beginning of summer.

498
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,760
No problem.

499
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,130
I'm not picky about any spices.

500
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,620
So is your fat.

501
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,270
I'm not asking for much.

502
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,860
As long as it's not over 100.

503
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,530
Weight less than 100 kg.

504
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,940
Is this the aesthetic judgement from the last century?

505
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,140
Senior,

506
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,930
I want to talk to you about something.

507
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,480
About what?

508
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,440
Dating?

509
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,630
That's right.

510
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,580
Dating.

511
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,370
Are you out of your mind today?

512
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,480
I don't think so.

513
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,690
My mind is

514
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,850
full.

515
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,120
It's full of you.

516
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,040
Are you trying to say

517
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,400
you've always liked me?

518
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,140
No.

519
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,130
Love is between two people.

520
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,580
I've always had a crush on you.

521
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,640
I've spent my whole youth with you.

522
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,190
Senior, I asked my mentor

523
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,100
to set up today's party for me.

524
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,440
I just want you to know

525
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,730
the moon doesn't hold you,

526
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,630
time destroys you.

527
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,240
And I...

528
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,090
And I...

529
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,290
I love you always.

530
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,870
Yu.

531
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,950
This is not funny at all.

532
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,310
I'm not joking.

533
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,450
Otherwise, I won't be

534
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,280
looking for a plastic surgery hospital,

535
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,480
just because I want to give you my heart.

536
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,740
I have to go back to the city.

537
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,080
Let me give you a ride.

538
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
No need. Siqing can give me a ride.

539
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,290
I'll wait for you in the car.

540
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,050
Senior, listen to me.

541
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,300
Listen to me.

542
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,020
Don't follow me.

543
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,060
I really love you.

544
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,410
Wait for me. Let's have a talk.

545
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,210
Who wants to talk to you? Go away!

546
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,900
Sister, give me your disciple's WeChat.

547
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,010
Is lifting someone out of poverty a trend for dating nowadays?

548
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,930
What do you like about that idiot?

549
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,640
Don't you think he's cute?

550
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,700
He's adorkable.

551
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,770
Wake up.

552
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:07,810
Didn't you see

553
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,850
he was so passionate about Yun Pian?

554
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,660
Forget about your unrequited love,

555
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,720
and sad drama play.

556
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:17,290
[Jing Chen]

557
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Thank you, brother-in-law.

558
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,150
It won't take more than seven days.

559
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,140
So that's why you asked me to set up a party?

560
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,570
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

561
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,170
