568
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,570
Maybe it can still be worn.

569
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,370
No hurry.

[Xili Guodong]

573
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,680
Siqing,

574
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,480
how did she seduce you?

575
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,950
What do you think of her figure?

576
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,440
Both of you are divorced.

577
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,590
Do you mind if I pursue her

578
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,170
for a few days?

579
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,860
Let me tell you.

580
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,160
That kind of woman should be divorced.

581
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,290
She only married an honest man like you

582
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,750
because she already had enough fun outside.

583
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,670
Where are we?

584
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,160
No signal.

585
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,190
That's right.

586
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,250
What's wrong?

587
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,090
The car broke down?

588
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,950
Are you cold?

589
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,550
Of course.

590
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,180
Of course it's cold.

591
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,850
It must be below zero on the mountain.

592
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,920
Really?

593
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,110
It's colder than the night you made her wait outside.

594
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,760
Are you crazy?

595
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,510
Brother! Brother!

596
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,350
You don't have to do this for a woman.

597
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,100
I can give you money.

598
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,260
Don't do anything illegal.

599
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,650
I'm also a man of status.

600
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,820
If my assistant can't reach me tomorrow,

601
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,800
he will call the police.

602
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,310
He will!
