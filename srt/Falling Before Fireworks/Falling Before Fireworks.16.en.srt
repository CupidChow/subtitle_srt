00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:28,640
♫You appeared♫

373
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,390
You knew it.

374
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,450
Since when did you know it?

375
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,390
♫but soon vanished in the blink of an eye♫

376
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,740
On New Year's Eve,

377
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,190
I saw Winter Solstice in your office.

378
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:44,370
[Winter Solstice]

379
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,700
That's why you agree to marry me.

380
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,870
I thought our marriage

381
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,290
is nothing but a trade.

382
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,860
Turns out

383
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,240
it involves two trades.

384
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,950
♫The brief encounter is still fresh in my mind♫

385
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
I'm indebted to you.

386
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,310
I can only give myself to you to pay my debt.

387
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,450
I didn't tell you

388
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:09,710
♫When I'm in a trance♫

389
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,140
because I thought you forgot.

390
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,610
I have a good memory,

391
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,120
unlike someone

392
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,900
who picked plums with his first love

393
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:15,500
♫I seem to see you in the crowd♫

394
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,180
at the back mountain.

395
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,900
Plums are mature.

396
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:25,060
♫You appeared♫

397
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,000
Do you mean?

398
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,760
♫but soon vanished in the blink of an eye♫

399
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,120
♫When the star appeared♫

400
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,660
♫Do you know I started to miss you again♫

401
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:50,510
[Siqing]

402
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:54,080
♫How many lovers can only look at each other from afar?♫

403
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,430
♫Something has changed in the dark♫

404
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,530
[When plums rip and spring fades,]

405
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,260
[my love for you grows deeper.]

406
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:11,980
♫The moonlight is like a spring breeze♫

407
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,930
[When plums rip and spring fades,]

408
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,600
[my love for you grows deeper.]
