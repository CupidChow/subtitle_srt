Are these dollars real?

374
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,700
Of course.

375
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,210
Counterfeit in front of a group of art students?

376
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,260
I'm sorry.

377
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,040
Please send the flowers back.

378
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,840
If you return it now,

379
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,860
tomorrow you'll receive

380
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,300
a bouquet of 999 flowers made of dollars.

381
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,060
Mr. Jing,

382
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,890
I really admire your talent.

383
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,010
My house is full of your works.

384
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,300
Please accept

385
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,970
this little gift from your fan.

386
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,700
He still got it.

387
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,440
Stop it.

388
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,920
I'll sign for it now.

389
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,440
Remember to keep it well for me.

390
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,750
We have to return the dollars.

391
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,540
999.

392
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,970
That's hundreds of thousands of dollars.

393
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,490
Use dollars to make a gift.

394
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,460
How could he need a job from someone?

395
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,700
Who knows if he puts on a show himself

396
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,630
to keep up his appearance?

397
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,890
There are

398
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,660
999 hundred-dollar bills.

399
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,540
Why don't you put on a show with dollars too?

400
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,320
I think Prodigy's fan runs a bank.

401
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,620
No. She's my wife.

402
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
The customer manager of the Chengxi sub-branch

403
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,270
of the Nancheng Commercial Bank.

404
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,870
You can find her if you need.

405
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,720
Senior Jing Chen.

406
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,380
Senior Jing Chen.

407
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,850
A senior sister asked me to give you a flower.

408
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,840
She's really...

409
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,760
There's a big surprise in the art hall.

410
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,670
Handsome guys are really different from ordinary people.

411
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,700
Chen, you are right.

412
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,300
Your wife loves you so much.

413
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,150
It's a waste

414
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,940
to throw my pork to the dog.

415
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,000
Senior.

416
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,140
Here.

417
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,290
Senior.

418
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,400
Senior.

419
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,890
Senior, this is for you.

420
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,330
Senior, this is from me.

421
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:34,970
Mine.

422
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,730
And mine.

423
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,320
Thank you.

424
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,740
When did you get here?

425
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,960
Are you afraid that your dollars...
