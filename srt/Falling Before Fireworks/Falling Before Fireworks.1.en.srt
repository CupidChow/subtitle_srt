195
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,720

I couldn't reach your husband

205
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,550

When you signed the contract,

215

Two, it can't be auctioned.

235
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,650
Since the house can't offset the loan,

236
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,310
we'll consider the lantern factory's equipments.

237
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,110
Even at the depreciated value after two years, it's enough for the interest.

Mr. Jing,

391
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,300
it's my fault that I blew away your gold powder.

You'll only use it to scare Ms. Chen
