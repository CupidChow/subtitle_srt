=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,152
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,387
She's just like a child.

4
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:43,347
When wronged, she thinks of revenge.

5
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:45,588
But she didn't intend to kill him.

6
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:48,088
She went to hide at home when hurt.

7
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:49,667
Without all these demons in the yard,

8
00:01:50,987 --> 00:01:52,648
perhaps she couldn't
have broken even a brick

9
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:53,787
before hiding herself away.

10
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,188
Such a demon

11
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:57,436
deserved a beating.

12
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,387
If she didn't come out, I'd kill her

13
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:02,428
to avoid further issues.

14
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:10,107
Master Shen does everything by force.

15
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:33,827
Stop crying. It's no use.

16
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:37,187
Just go. I do pity you.

17
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,787
Jinyue Mansion is not a place for you.

18
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:41,848
I will tell Gu Chengjin

19
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:43,356
that I killed you.

20
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:45,067
He can't do anything to me.

21
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:49,488
No. I can't believe

22
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:51,427
that someone who's been so good to me

23
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:54,547
sees me as a mere ingredient.

24
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:56,267
When he saw me,

25
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:59,267
he saw the hope of her revival.

26
00:02:59,907 --> 00:03:02,348
I am just a substitute.

27
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,267
No, less than a substitute.

28
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:11,668
It seems he really sees you
as merely an ingredient.

29
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:16,748
Miss He, you see,

30
00:03:17,627 --> 00:03:19,907
even a chicken would
do anything to survive.

31
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,288
For a clever demon like you,

32
00:03:23,288 --> 00:03:24,928
if you don't want to be killed,

33
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,368
why not run away?

34
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:29,148
Why would you mention chickens now?

35
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,347
It's just an analogy.

36
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:38,427
I want to see him one more time.

37
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:41,787
Even though I am nothing for him,

38
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,868
from the first time I saw this world,

39
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:54,067
(he's been the most important
person in my life.)

40
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:09,228
(I desperately learned
to speak and transform,)

41
00:04:09,827 --> 00:04:10,948
(and learned the rules)

42
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:15,028
(to be with him.)

43
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:18,620
Gu.

44
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:20,988
I

45
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:23,548
like you.

46
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,788
Do you like me?

47
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:33,884
Do you?

48
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:39,516
I do.

49
00:04:57,987 --> 00:05:00,588
What's there to be so happy about?

50
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,196
Seeing you makes me happy.

51
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:21,868
Miss, what I'm about to say
may not be pleasant,

52
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,908
but you have to listen.

53
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:28,387
From the moment Gu Chengjin took you in,

54
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:30,556
he did it to kill you.

55
00:05:31,507 --> 00:05:34,387
That is your only value to him.

56
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,788
So no matter what you have done,

57
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:40,667
how much you've sacrificed,

58
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:43,667
he remains indifferent.

59
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:45,628
Do you understand?

60
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,908
For your own good, it's better to leave.

61
00:05:56,748 --> 00:05:58,468
Be a good demon.

62
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:02,868
There are many places
worth seeing in this world.

63
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:06,028
They are better than you can imagine.

64
00:06:19,028 --> 00:06:20,316
You are free-spirited.

65
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,068
But I...

66
00:06:25,908 --> 00:06:27,028
I still want to see

67
00:06:29,028 --> 00:06:30,748
what kind of lady

68
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,868
is worth so much effort from him.

69
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:38,868
I want to know how I'm inferior to her.

70
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:45,028
I want to see him once more.

71
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:55,452
Just go.

72
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,667
You need to be completely heartbroken.

73
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:03,628
Okay, I'll take you down.

74
00:07:03,628 --> 00:07:05,667
Hide in the passage and don't come out.

75
00:07:06,547 --> 00:07:08,707
I will tell Gu Chengjin
that you are dead.

76
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:11,707
You can look at that lady as you wish.

77
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:28,748
I have killed He.

78
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:31,507
The demons in the yard
are back to normal.

79
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,387
I'm taking you out now.

80
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,588
Why should I go out?

81
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:38,868
If Shi can't wake up,

82
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:44,188
what does it matter
whether I live or die?

83
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:47,827
I have asked for too much in my life.

84
00:07:48,628 --> 00:07:50,667
Power and wealth.

85
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:55,748
Shi is just a lady to me.

86
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:58,908
After so years,

87
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:01,188
I thought no feelings existed,

88
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:04,387
but they have long since
rooted inside me.

89
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:10,827
For three years, I've dreamed
every day of her waking up,

90
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,387
only to be disappointed.

91
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:19,868
I placed all my hopes on He.

92
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:22,876
But now,

93
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:26,364
she is dead too.

94
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:33,827
It's all in vain.

95
00:08:36,468 --> 00:08:39,507
You go. I'm not going anywhere.

96
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,428
I will stay here with her.

97
00:10:07,788 --> 00:10:10,908
Gu Chengjin, I hate you.

98
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:01,267
Shi.

99
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,124
You're finally awake.

100
00:12:13,827 --> 00:12:14,940
You're finally awake.

101
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:20,588
Chengjin.

102
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,108
I'll take you out now.

103
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:39,387
The exit is blocked. Please help us.

104
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:44,188
I was negligent. How could
someone who fosters demons

105
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:46,348
not notice the aura of their own demons?

106
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:49,627
What a performance.

107
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:52,788
He has seen through you long ago.

108
00:12:54,468 --> 00:12:55,588
I still want to see

109
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,348
what kind of lady

110
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,468
is worth so much effort from him.

111
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:04,988
I want to see him once more.

112
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:09,707
But she foolishly complied
with your wishes.

113
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:17,668
I knew she could see through me.

114
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:19,676
That's true.

115
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:22,468
She is your demon.

116
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:26,908
How could you not know
what she is thinking?

117
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:30,908
Second young master,

118
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,307
I hope you won't regret it

119
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,827
for letting her down.

120
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:47,036
I'll take you out.

121
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:49,276
Sickly fella.

122
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:53,212
Sickly fella.

123
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,028
Yes.

124
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:00,827
Wait here for me.
I'll take you out in a moment.

125
00:14:32,307 --> 00:14:33,564
Thank…

126
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,908
Are you okay?

127
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:02,228
Why take it out on that?

128
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,668
I asked you to bring her back.

129
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:09,248
Just take it out on me.

130
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:12,468
If I were her, I would kill him

131
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:14,428
to avenge my affections.

132
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:18,307
Dying for him isn't worth it.

133
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:22,668
Many things are not about worth,

134
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:25,187
but will.

135
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:27,428
It's her will,

136
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:31,368
so no one has the right to judge her.

137
00:16:31,368 --> 00:16:33,468
He has no idea what he has killed.

138
00:16:33,468 --> 00:16:34,908
How could he possibly not know?

139
00:16:37,348 --> 00:16:39,228
What does it matter?

140
00:16:40,548 --> 00:16:42,428
To him,

141
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:45,348
Miss He's affections
don't matter at all.

142
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:50,908
Men who have complex relationships
are the most despicable.

143
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:54,588
When I fall for a man,

144
00:16:55,228 --> 00:16:57,707
I wouldn't allow him
to be involved with anyone else.

145
00:16:58,507 --> 00:16:59,788
When I want something, I want it all,

146
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,067
not one bit less.

147
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,560
If he dares to scheme against me,

148
00:17:04,988 --> 00:17:06,396
I will kill him.

149
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,060
What a resolve.

150
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:14,172
Of course.

151
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:22,708
I've said that I've
taken a liking to you,

152
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:29,627
but I won't be with you.

153
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:37,068
So you are still a free man.

154
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,420
You…

155
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:54,620
You…

156
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:01,387
These blood bubbles are
formed from resentment.

157
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,227
They are toxic and
can rot bones and flesh.

158
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,068
You are already frail,

159
00:18:08,347 --> 00:18:09,387
and you held on for so long?

160
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:16,720
(He doesn't want to hold me back.)

161
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,948
Vomiting blood now?

162
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:24,948
You want me dead?

163
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:27,987
I wanted to endure.

164
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,467
But I couldn't.

165
00:18:32,148 --> 00:18:33,267
I had no choice.

166
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,788
When you were miserable back then,

167
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,708
I never despised you.

168
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,068
Why are you so harsh?

169
00:18:46,227 --> 00:18:49,708
You are just acting tough. Just shut up.

170
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,347
This can only temporarily
alleviate your pain.

171
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,867
I don't know medicine.

172
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:42,908
No ordinary physicians
can treat you either.

173
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:47,308
So I must leave Qingsheng City

174
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,587
to seek the wilderness
in the mountains that can heal people.

175
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:53,347
It might take some time.

176
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:57,987
Be patient, and don't go anywhere.

177
00:20:01,948 --> 00:20:03,356
Where could I go?

178
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:07,627
I couldn't move even if I wanted to.

179
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:13,668
(I've asked Mofang
to buy me another half a day,)

180
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,304
(but faced with the elite
of the Immortal Realm,)

181
00:20:16,828 --> 00:20:18,608
(I don't know how much time I have.)

182
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:21,227
(I can't stay any longer.)

183
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,267
(It'll harm Xingyun
if the pursuers come.)

184
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:48,788
Maybe I won't come back.

185
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,587
Now we part ways.

186
00:21:17,467 --> 00:21:18,652
Take care of yourself.

187
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,788
Thank you for your care.

188
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:48,347
You whisper your thanks.

189
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:52,227
How reluctant you must be.

190
00:21:57,428 --> 00:22:01,507
(You didn't look at me
in the eye at last.)

191
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:27,507
(Chirong, Immortal Realm)
Mofang.

192
00:22:27,507 --> 00:22:29,668
Why are you also in the lower realm?

193
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:32,548
Did you two come down
to find Her Lordship?

194
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:34,227
Yes, why?

195
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,507
Are you going to lead the way for us?

196
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:38,828
Indeed. Please follow me.

197
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:40,572
Don't go with him.

198
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:42,227
He is Her Lordship's confidant.

199
00:22:42,704 --> 00:22:44,464
(Qingyan, Immortal Realm)
He's making a fool of you

200
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,928
to try to help Her Lordship.

201
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:47,292
Shut up, I know.

202
00:22:48,507 --> 00:22:50,227
Is it fun, Mofang?

203
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:53,107
Well, I will be honest then.

204
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:55,987
I am here to assist Her Lordship.

205
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:59,908
You'll be punished by Her Holiness
once we're back in the Immortal Realm.

206
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:02,828
Enough talk.

207
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:05,227
Does he look afraid of being punished?

208
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,068
What should we do?

209
00:23:09,308 --> 00:23:10,428
Excuse me, Mofang.

210
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,888
- Who is this?
- Who is she?

211
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:19,587
I am ShenLi,
Lord Bicang of the Immortal Realm.

212
00:24:20,708 --> 00:24:24,428
- ShenLi?
- I didn't come to look for trouble,

213
00:24:25,587 --> 00:24:28,348
but to seek a local deity
skilled in treatment

214
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:29,788
to save someone for me.

215
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:32,088
May I ask

216
00:24:32,088 --> 00:24:33,747
who it is you wish to save?

217
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:35,428
In Jinyue Mansion,

218
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,908
a man in blue lies in the pavilion
of the Lotus Garden.

219
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:42,548
He is named Xingyun.

220
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:43,987
He was born with frail health,

221
00:24:43,987 --> 00:24:46,668
and was injured by a demon,
so his life is hanging by a thread.

222
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:47,668
Who can heal him?

223
00:24:51,227 --> 00:24:53,548
Hulu, why don't you go
with Her Lordship?

224
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:55,747
- I…
- Just go.

225
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,948
May I ask Your Lordship to lead the way?

226
00:24:59,948 --> 00:25:02,627
I will not go. You find him on your own.

227
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:06,187
- But…
- Okay.

228
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:07,308
Judging from my description,

229
00:25:08,627 --> 00:25:10,096
how long will it take to heal him?

230
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:13,107
With my skills,

231
00:25:13,627 --> 00:25:15,048
even if he is weak and injured,

232
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:17,347
treating a mortal

233
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:19,308
will take only an hour.

234
00:25:19,908 --> 00:25:21,107
- Right.
- Good.

235
00:25:26,507 --> 00:25:28,708
If you don't return in an hour,

236
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,188
it will not be the earth that I pierce.

237
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,467
- Wait.
- Well...

238
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,507
Starting from now.

239
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:37,948
Go quickly.

240
00:25:37,948 --> 00:25:40,308
- Hurry up.
- I will.

241
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:41,564
Hurry up.

242
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:49,708
So many people have come.

243
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:52,788
Her Holiness is determined
to take me back.

244
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:24,188
Here, I don't know if she's alive.

245
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:26,748
Wait here.

246
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:27,828
I'll come in a moment.

247
00:26:28,948 --> 00:26:30,012
Man in blue.

248
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:34,948
Man in blue. That's him.

249
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:39,804
Man in blue.

250
00:26:40,908 --> 00:26:41,948
Man in blue.

251
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,107
I've come to save you.

252
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:48,267
Come on, wake up.

253
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:52,587
Wake up, I've come to save you.

254
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:55,484
It's a lady.

255
00:26:58,148 --> 00:26:59,948
It's over. She's dead.

256
00:27:00,948 --> 00:27:03,227
She won't let us off now.

257
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,747
- What should I do?
- Sir.

258
00:27:06,347 --> 00:27:07,948
- What do I tell her?
- Sir.

259
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:15,107
Man in blue!

260
00:27:16,188 --> 00:27:17,372
This is a lady.

261
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:19,948
A man.

262
00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:23,948
Man in blue, I've come to save you.

263
00:27:23,948 --> 00:27:25,908
- You are a local deity?
- Yes.

264
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:29,627
- Come.
- ShenLi isn't coming back?

265
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:31,996
Don't talk anymore.

266
00:27:33,267 --> 00:27:34,287
That's cruel.

267
00:27:34,287 --> 00:27:35,668
Stop talking.

268
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:40,507
I only have an hour.

269
00:27:51,987 --> 00:27:53,828
Who is this person that's so important?

270
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:05,347
Who are you two?

271
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:09,148
My younger brother Qingyan,
and I am Chirong.

272
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,788
The Two Fiends of the Immortal Realm.

273
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:15,507
You know us? Come here.

274
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,107
You must go back anyway.

275
00:28:26,627 --> 00:28:28,028
So you might as well tell me

276
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:29,648
where Her Lordship is now.

277
00:28:29,648 --> 00:28:30,828
Her Lordship.

278
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,428
You don't know?

279
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:41,867
The one who wants to save you
is Lord Bicang of Immortal Realm.

280
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:43,507
Lord Bicang.

281
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,948
She is Lord Bicang.

282
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:58,068
Local deity, go back and tell her

283
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:02,068
that the man she wants to save
has been captured by us.

284
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:06,387
If she doesn't come back,
we'll kill him.

285
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:10,788
- But…
- She doesn't like being threatened.

286
00:29:11,428 --> 00:29:14,068
What do you know?
We should get her here first.

287
00:29:15,267 --> 00:29:16,828
She is so fast.
Do you want to chase her?

288
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:21,667
Off you go.

289
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:24,028
But I have to save…

290
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,107
It's fine. Go quickly.

291
00:29:27,107 --> 00:29:28,987
Alright.

292
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:36,828
At such a critical moment,

293
00:29:38,627 --> 00:29:40,308
Her Lordship has asked
someone to save you.

294
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:44,548
Who are you? Why does she value you?

295
00:29:45,828 --> 00:29:46,987
I'd like to ask you.

296
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:53,028
The Lord of Immortal Realm is a lady?

297
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:07,648
Your Lordship, please don't kill me.

298
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:09,020
Don't kill me.

299
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:11,900
He is dead?

300
00:30:12,867 --> 00:30:14,148
Not dead.

301
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:19,148
But soon.

302
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:22,428
Tell me everything now.

303
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:26,668
He was captured by the two generals
of Immortal Realm, Qingyan and Chirong.

304
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:29,487
They've asked you to go there.

305
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:30,668
If you don't,

306
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:32,428
they will kill the man in blue.

307
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:42,548
I have taken his pulse.

308
00:30:43,747 --> 00:30:44,948
He's in critical condition.

309
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:46,908
If no one saves him,

310
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:47,987
he won't survive.

311
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:08,092
She's gone.

312
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,548
- Are you alright?
- Hulu, are you hurt?

313
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:13,308
- Are you injured?
- I'm fine.

314
00:31:14,828 --> 00:31:16,747
- I'm okay.
- What's this?

315
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:21,267
Who wrote "go"
on your clothes with blood?

316
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:23,428
What does it mean?

317
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:24,788
(Go)

318
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:28,188
It must be that man in blue
who wrote it.

319
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:30,908
But,

320
00:31:30,908 --> 00:31:33,628
Lord Bicang didn't see it.

321
00:31:33,628 --> 00:31:34,987
- What do we do?
- What now?

322
00:31:35,747 --> 00:31:37,340
Exactly.

323
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:53,908
You seem a rather calm mortal.

324
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:55,788
Don't you worry about yourself?

325
00:31:58,227 --> 00:32:01,587
You're about to die.

326
00:32:02,347 --> 00:32:03,772
Does worrying

327
00:32:06,627 --> 00:32:08,227
make me live longer?

328
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:14,748
If so, I can worry for a bit.

329
00:32:14,748 --> 00:32:16,467
No wonder you caught
Her Lordship's attention.

330
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:18,268
Interesting man.

331
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:21,507
Come have a chat with him too.

332
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,828
A man Miss Shen fancies. That's rare.

333
00:32:26,068 --> 00:32:27,227
No.

334
00:32:27,227 --> 00:32:30,267
If you tease him,
be careful of being retaliated.

335
00:32:31,028 --> 00:32:34,028
That's true,
I don't want to provoke her.

336
00:32:53,668 --> 00:32:55,507
Her Holiness's orders.

337
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,627
If Lord Bicang, ShenLi,
still refuses to return to the palace,

338
00:32:58,908 --> 00:33:00,828
she'll be crippled

339
00:33:01,908 --> 00:33:03,388
and taken to the wedding ceremony.

340
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:05,107
But I'm softhearted

341
00:33:05,668 --> 00:33:06,788
and can't harm an acquaintance.

342
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:08,476
So,

343
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:14,107
if Your Lordship does not obey,
I will kill him.

344
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:45,188
Who dares to do so before me?

345
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:54,467
- Still alive?
- Yes.

346
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,227
I'm about to die.

347
00:33:57,227 --> 00:34:02,828
With me here, you won't die.

348
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:07,267
Your actions have caused
much trouble for Her Holiness.

349
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:11,428
Her Holiness is furious.
Now surrounded by pursuers,

350
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:13,988
you might be able to save yourself,

351
00:34:14,627 --> 00:34:16,168
but not him.

352
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:18,748
Judge the situation wisely,
Your Lordship.

353
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:20,668
Do not resist.

354
00:35:07,668 --> 00:35:09,447
Your Lordship, forbidden arts
will harm your spirit.

355
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:11,428
The wedding is imminent,
so do not harm yourself.

356
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:16,307
You'd take me to the wedding ceremony
even if you have to cripple me?

357
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:20,067
What does a little damage
to the spirit matter?

358
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,300
Let's go.

359
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:29,276
Don't make trouble.

360
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:51,268
To strike against your own kind,

361
00:36:52,307 --> 00:36:53,508
what audacity.

362
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,107
- Her Holiness, calm down.
- Her Holiness, calm down.

363
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:04,708
ShenLi, why go to such lengths for me?

364
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:05,884
Keep quiet.

365
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:09,148
I said I would keep you alive.

366
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:11,948
Life and death are destined.

367
00:37:12,748 --> 00:37:13,980
ShenLi!

368
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:20,587
Do you recognize your mistake?

369
00:37:21,387 --> 00:37:22,492
I don't.

370
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,787
Refusing to marry whom I don't love.

371
00:37:32,587 --> 00:37:34,088
What's wrong with that?

372
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,472
Refusing to be forced into marriage.

373
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:37,708
What's wrong with that?

374
00:37:37,808 --> 00:37:40,167
Not wanting the Immortal Realm
to be controlled by the Divine Realm.

375
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:42,027
What's wrong with that?

376
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:54,768
For over a thousand years,
we have submitted to the Divine Realm.

377
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,988
Those in the Divine Realm
idle away their days.

378
00:37:58,268 --> 00:37:59,748
While they live carefree,

379
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:03,468
we reside in the temporal rifts
close to the Xutian Abyss,

380
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:06,248
a barren land

381
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:07,268
plagued by miasma.

382
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:10,388
Our people lead
unimaginably tough lives.

383
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:11,668
As nobles of the royal family,

384
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:13,748
we have to guard the Chimei
in Xutian Abyss

385
00:38:13,748 --> 00:38:15,387
for those useless ones
in the Divine Realm.

386
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:18,067
I disdain the Divine Realm.

387
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:20,587
What's wrong with refusing to marry?

388
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:22,972
You are not wrong.

389
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:27,827
But your actions have defied
the king's command.

390
00:38:30,076 --> 00:38:31,107
Take her away.

391
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:32,627
- Yes.
- Yes.

392
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,364
I know how to walk.

393
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:44,908
So beautiful.

394
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:58,396
ShenLi.

395
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:03,268
It seems you want
to take advantage of me, right?

396
00:39:07,307 --> 00:39:08,867
Assume it that way then.
