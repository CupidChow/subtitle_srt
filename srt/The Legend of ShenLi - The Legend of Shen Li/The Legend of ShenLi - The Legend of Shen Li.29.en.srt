1
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,120
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:49,872
Impossible.

4
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,536
This is impossible.

5
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,131
Blocking my Water Halting Spell
so easily?

6
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,464
Water Halting Spell.

7
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,371
Did you refer to this technique?

8
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,210
This isn't for
petty individuals like you.

9
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,630
Go back and tell Fu Sheng,

10
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,531
I will certainly pay a visit soon.

11
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,971
Yes, Lord Xingzhi.

12
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,891
Stop, come back.

13
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,451
Take him away.

14
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,251
I've been on the battlefield for years,

15
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,310
yet I have never heard that a title

16
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,850
could frighten an opponent like this.

17
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:52,570
Your title is indeed impressive.

18
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,770
But what use is it?

19
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,811
When you needed me,

20
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,171
I couldn't arrive in time,

21
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,091
or you wouldn't be so severely injured.

22
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,331
(Since I was injured,)

23
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,050
(Xingzhi seems somewhat different.)

24
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:24,511
(Previously, he'd probably never)

25
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:26,971
(utter such words.)

26
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,211
Did you know it was me all along?

27
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,850
Didn't you know that I know?

28
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:44,272
You've learned to be mischievous.

29
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:46,690
Not as mischievous as you.

30
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,210
Now Fu Sheng's lackeys have found us,

31
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,736
I cannot continue

32
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:10,000
this act anymore.

33
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,611
You let that man go.

34
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:20,570
He will certainly head towards Fu Sheng.

35
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,090
I was taken away by Mofang in a daze

36
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,470
and couldn't remember the direction.

37
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,970
That person would lead us to Fu Sheng.

38
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm not going.

39
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,000
Why not?

40
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:36,331
You are injured now.

41
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,970
I won't leave you alone

42
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,570
to face any danger.

43
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,891
My body has mostly recovered.

44
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,130
Only my powers have not been restored.

45
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,651
I can't stay
in the Mortal Realm forever.

46
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,530
Your Excellency,

47
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:04,970
take me back to the Immortal Realm.

48
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:07,696
I won't.

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,496
And why is that?

50
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,352
I don't want to.

51
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,370
If Your Lordship has the ability,

52
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,976
go back by yourself.

53
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,991
How should I go back by myself now?

54
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,110
I can't even locate the entrance,

55
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,171
let alone shuttle
through the rift on a cloud.

56
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:29,931
You're hindering me.

57
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:33,104
You see it?

58
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:45,840
Taking me back to the Immortal Realm

59
00:05:47,331 --> 00:05:49,171
is the best solution to my situation.

60
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:52,016
First,

61
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:53,931
the Divine Realm and Immortal Realm

62
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:56,651
are to unite against the common enemy,

63
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,731
but they hold grudges
against each other.

64
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:01,130
With the state I'm in,

65
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,810
I won't be able to solve any issues,

66
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,530
but if I marry Lord Furong,

67
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,731
it will certainly boost
their confidence.

68
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,328
Second,

69
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:10,511
in the Immortal Realm,

70
00:06:10,511 --> 00:06:12,431
I might find a way to regain my power

71
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,611
and restore my five senses.

72
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,211
It's better than wasting away here.

73
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:19,632
First,

74
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:24,130
the marriage arrangement you two
has been canceled.

75
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:28,011
What? Cancelled?

76
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,971
It's known throughout the three realms

77
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:31,931
that Lord Bicang has died in battle.

78
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,250
Why should

79
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:36,410
the Heavenly Lord's grandson
marry a dead person?

80
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,896
So it's canceled.

81
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,771
It's been approved by the Heavenly Lord
and Her Holiness.

82
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:44,592
Second,

83
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,480
I know

84
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:48,272
how to heal you.

85
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,970
Why didn't you say so earlier?

86
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,011
I was planning

87
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,410
to tell you when you get better.

88
00:06:57,488 --> 00:06:58,544
Besides,

89
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:00,731
I am also waiting for news.

90
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:01,840
What news?

91
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,568
Well...

92
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,611
I feel like it's about time for me
to make an appearance.

93
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:16,944
Sorry to interrupt.

94
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,736
Why are you here again?

95
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,610
I came here long ago.

96
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,491
I've just been eavesdropping
for a while.

97
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:26,550
Did you find it?

98
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,371
Yes, but not the medicine.

99
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:29,451
I found news about them.

100
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,531
Where are they?

101
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,671
The Snow Mountain to the north.

102
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:33,931
Ms. Jin's Snow Mountain Market.

103
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:35,824
Ms. Jin?

104
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,370
Past the North Sea

105
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,331
and an ice plain,

106
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:45,011
you will see a snow mountain,

107
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,731
where a demon resides.

108
00:07:47,491 --> 00:07:48,560
That would be Ms. Jin.

109
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,690
She has countless rare treasures

110
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,360
available for trade.

111
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,891
Her possessions might exceed

112
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,250
that of the Divine Realm.

113
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,011
She definitely has
the medicine to heal you.

114
00:08:04,336 --> 00:08:05,410
I should've thought of this earlier.

115
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:10,672
In that case,

116
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:15,011
perhaps I can find a suitable spear.

117
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:17,011
Your spear has already been...

118
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:21,104
What about my spear?

119
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,970
I've already mended your spear.

120
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:29,151
I was planning

121
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:31,250
to give it to you
once you've fully recovered.

122
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,411
You've mended my broken spear?

123
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:39,970
His Excellency's skill in lying

124
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,011
is truly remarkable.

125
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:43,730
(I am the Lord of the Immortal Realm.)

126
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,531
(Logically, my belongings after I died)

127
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,331
(should be kept by the Immortal Realm.)

128
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:51,931
(How did Xingzhi get my broken spear?)

129
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,331
(And he even mended it.)

130
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,830
(My spear is constantly
exposed to miasma)

131
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,071
(and has killed countless people.)

132
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,130
(Its murderous aura)

133
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,651
(should repel)

134
00:09:05,651 --> 00:09:06,810
(Xingzhi's divine aura.)

135
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,331
(If Xingzhi mended this spear,)

136
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,011
(it would have greatly harmed him.)

137
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:13,411
(That aside,)

138
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:17,050
(how would Her Holiness
give away my belongings?)

139
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,810
I brought these as a small token.

140
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,512
Look at the quality.

141
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,791
When the marriage was cancelled,

142
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,291
you must be ecstatic.

143
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,770
How... how could I?

144
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,331
I'm not that heartless.

145
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:39,152
In a couple of days,

146
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:41,040
I will take you northward.

147
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,291
Give it to me, thank you.

148
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,930
Are you injured?

149
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:55,490
How could I be injured?

150
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:52,720
Young Master.

151
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,211
Master.

152
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:05,011
Heiyuan was frozen by Lord Xingzhi.

153
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:17,271
Xingzhi is together with ShenLi?

154
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,851
Yes, Master.

155
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:22,091
Please save Heiyuan.

156
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,571
It could be useful

157
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:27,930
that he was frozen by Xingzhi.

158
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,011
The Third Prince of the North Sea
has escaped. What should we do?

159
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,291
It's no use keeping him.

160
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:36,291
Guard his belongings

161
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,451
and the other two items well.

162
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,490
Gather all the puppets.

163
00:11:45,011 --> 00:11:46,690
We'll leave for the Snow Mountain

164
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,050
and seize the golden elixir.

165
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:58,960
(The Snow Mountain)

166
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:03,011
- Are these tarts cold already?
- Yes.

167
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,870
Fang, have you had any? Take this.

168
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,370
I'm done, are you still waiting here?

169
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,536
- No, let's go.
- We are going back.

170
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,291
- Leaving already?
- Wait for us.

171
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:11,370
Take care of yourselves
in this heavy snow.

172
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,432
Geez.

173
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:14,851
Take your things.

174
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:15,888
Let's go.

175
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:16,930
I'm leaving too.

176
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,170
- You too?
- Come on.

177
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:28,784
Are you cold?

178
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:29,808
No.

179
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,851
You should wear this.

180
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:35,451
The temperature is just right for me.

181
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,451
Those who do business on this mountain

182
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:42,810
all have some level of cultivation.

183
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:44,890
There are demons vying for domination

184
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,170
and experts from cultivator sects.

185
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,170
Their physical strength is much greater
than the mortals.

186
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,411
Yet, none of them is that bold.

187
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,771
The cold here is different.

188
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,690
The snow is piercing
with a kind of magical force.

189
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,291
Even a magical barrier cannot block it.

190
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:03,291
How much longer will this snow fall?

191
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:04,951
Can we ascend the mountain

192
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,971
if it doesn't stop?

193
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,331
I know a small path where we can go up.

194
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,608
Follow me.

195
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:25,791
Who is this Snow Mountain
Golden Serpent?

196
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,151
It seems quite arrogant.

197
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,370
I've never heard of it before.

198
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:30,651
That only indicates

199
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,531
that you don't like these treasures.

200
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,411
This Golden Serpent

201
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:38,071
has lived longer than me.

202
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,152
So old?

203
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:41,810
It's an ancient demon.

204
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:48,031
(Did I)

205
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:50,370
(blurt out something
I shouldn't have said?)

206
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:53,648
I mean,

207
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,710
people your age

208
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,050
don't look as...

209
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:00,690
(That doesn't sound right either.)

210
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:03,851
(I'm good at making threats
and attacking.)

211
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,891
(But comforting people)

212
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:07,891
(is beyond my ability.)

213
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:12,496
I mean,

214
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:15,408
no one could tell your age

215
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:17,851
if you don't say it.

216
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,490
I'm sorry, I misspoke.

217
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,671
(Beating around the bush
to comfort someone)

218
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,851
(is not my thing at all.)

219
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,610
Do you mind that I'm older than you?

220
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,370
I don't, not at all.

221
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,930
But actually,

222
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,171
it has nothing to do with me.

223
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,650
You don't have to care about my opinion.

224
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,170
I do care.

225
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,810
Anyone in the three realms
can call me old,

226
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,936
except for you.

227
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,130
Please don't say such things,
Your Excellency.

228
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,730
The journey is hard and long,
and you've barely healed,

229
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,736
let me carry you.

230
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,768
No need.

231
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:20,971
I can walk on my own.

232
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,152
Then let me hold your hand.

233
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,251
(This Xingzhi before me)

234
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:43,211
(is probably not the same
as the previous one.)

235
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:45,891
(How can I draw the line)

236
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,891
(with him now?)

237
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,330
What is written here?

238
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:17,250
One day, with a sword in hand,

239
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,571
I will slay all the dogs of
the Extranatural Heaven.

240
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,011
And rob all the ancient gods

241
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,011
to fill my demon market.

242
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,730
Are you trying to scare me?

243
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,090
I read it word by word.

244
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,232
Why would I lie to you?

245
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:40,330
Then you have offended this demon.

246
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:41,970
I haven't.

247
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,491
Then why this serpent demon...

248
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,891
What brought Your Excellency here?

249
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:59,912
(Ms. Jin)

250
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:09,136
Is it male or female?

251
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,171
What does it matter?

252
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,771
I, Ms. Jin, give my regards.

253
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,370
Dressed as a man,

254
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:31,250
yet she refers to herself as Ms.

255
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,291
The lady you brought is quite vigilant.

256
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,970
Before Ms. Jin,

257
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,931
one must be vigilant.

258
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,771
Your Excellency is so naughty.

259
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,130
How can you speak of me this way?

260
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,850
Is there nothing wrong with her?

261
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,730
What do you think is wrong with her?

262
00:19:03,171 --> 00:19:04,208
Could she possibly use

263
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,891
spells of seduction?

264
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,450
Rest assured, she cannot seduce me.

265
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,370
Even if she knows those spells,

266
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:21,931
she would not

267
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:23,970
use them to me.

268
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,711
What is Your Excellency saying?

269
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:27,571
I don't understand a single word.

270
00:19:28,691 --> 00:19:30,350
Do not stand out there.

271
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,970
Let's go inside and chat.

272
00:19:41,552 --> 00:19:42,651
Where does this door lead?

273
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:45,011
It leads to any place.

274
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:49,648
Let's go.

275
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:40,528
Come have a seat.

276
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:55,856
Miss,

277
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,011
will you join me for a game of chess?

278
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,711
I'm not skilled in chess.

279
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:02,864
So I must decline.

280
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:06,571
Alright, Your Excellency will play then.

281
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,891
(Why is he hesitating?)

282
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,610
(It seems he needs my assistance.)

283
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,728
One doesn't visit me without a reason.

284
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:17,291
Out with it.

285
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,511
What could it be
that Your Excellency cannot resolve

286
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,656
and must seek my help?

287
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:22,928
I would like to ask you

288
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,816
to cure her.

289
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,051
This pretty girl is ill?

290
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,031
Her aura is weak.

291
00:21:36,031 --> 00:21:38,891
She must have suffered
a serious injury recently.

292
00:21:39,411 --> 00:21:41,370
But the injury has already healed.

293
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,850
There should be no problems.

294
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,490
What do you want me to treat?

295
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:49,130
Her powers have not yet recovered,

296
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,490
and her five senses
disappear occasionally.

297
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:55,051
This is indeed strange.

298
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,051
Miss.

299
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:58,330
Let me take your pulse.

300
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:09,531
How did you get so severely injured?

301
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:14,448
Why is it so hot?

302
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,496
Is it very hot?

303
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,531
(Xingzhi has touched me
a lot these days.)

304
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,691
(He's always kept a straight face.)

305
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,651
(I didn't know it's still scalding.)

306
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:27,792
(So he...)

307
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,111
It's alright.

308
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,411
Let me blow on it for you.

309
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,691
Thank you, it doesn't hurt anymore.

310
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,530
Long time no see.

311
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,130
Your Excellency has become
even more useless.

312
00:22:55,811 --> 00:22:57,251
Can't even protect a girl.

313
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,370
She's so severely injured,

314
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,210
and you don't even seem to feel sorry.

315
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,011
How heartless.

316
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,651
Sister,

317
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,370
you must be unhappy with him.

318
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,090
Why not dump him?

319
00:23:10,771 --> 00:23:12,051
I'll introduce someone else to you.

320
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:15,851
As a fellow woman,

321
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:17,171
I understand you better.

322
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,350
(This Golden Serpent)

323
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,171
(enjoys toying with others.)

324
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,370
This young lady is originally a Phoenix.

325
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:32,411
As far as I can tell,

326
00:23:33,051 --> 00:23:35,760
you should have experienced
a rebirth not long ago.

327
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:37,431
Logically speaking,

328
00:23:37,431 --> 00:23:40,531
both your body and spiritual powers
should have significantly improved.

329
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:42,951
However,

330
00:23:42,951 --> 00:23:46,210
there seems to be an object filled
with spiritual power inside your body.

331
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,011
During your rebirth,

332
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:51,210
the calamitous fire fused this object,

333
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,130
merging it into your bloodstream.

334
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,831
It conflicted with your spiritual power,

335
00:23:56,831 --> 00:23:57,931
leading to a reverse blood flow

336
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,090
and the temporary loss of your power.

337
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:04,391
Afterward, you've been losing blood
and your spiritual power weakened

338
00:24:04,391 --> 00:24:06,330
to the point where you
occasionally lose five senses.

339
00:24:06,931 --> 00:24:07,931
If this continues for long,

340
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,771
things will get worse.

341
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:13,291
Perhaps you might indeed
become an invalid.

342
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,090
But don't worry.

343
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:33,051
The Blood Seven can help you recover
and regain your five senses.

344
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,651
The Five-color Flame Lotus

345
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:37,011
promotes blood circulation
and unblocks the blood vessels,

346
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:40,151
also helps the fusion of
the two forces within your body.

347
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:42,970
Only then have you truly
completed the rebirth.

348
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,576
You're right.

349
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,310
Your Excellency is at the right place.

350
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,490
These two medicines are hard to find,

351
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,671
but coincidentally,

352
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:54,531
I have them.

353
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:01,290
If Ms. Jin is willing to help,

354
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,171
I will surely repay with all my might.

355
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,771
No need for such trouble.

356
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:09,712
Miss,

357
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,531
let me introduce someone else to you.

358
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,730
Stop, she doesn't want it.

359
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,011
What then?

360
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,171
Your Excellency came to me

361
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,051
asking for such precious medicines

362
00:25:26,051 --> 00:25:27,811
without offering any reward?

363
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,030
The stars of the Extranatural Heaven

364
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,370
are particularly bright recently.

365
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,850
If Ms. Jin heals ShenLi,

366
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,011
I could pick stars for you.

367
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,491
Thousands of years ago,

368
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:45,691
I begged you without success

369
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:47,610
for the stars of
the Extranatural Heaven.

370
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,370
Now you agreed so readily.

371
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,531
It was my mistake
to blame Your Excellency.

372
00:25:58,171 --> 00:26:00,571
You do value this young lady.

373
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,411
Why didn't you show it earlier?

374
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,210
Otherwise, I wouldn't dare

375
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,090
to act as a matchmaker for her.

376
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,651
(It should be prohibited)

377
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,171
(to pick those stars at will.)

378
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,171
(Will you be in trouble
if you pick them?)

379
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,330
Alright, I'll treat this young lady.

380
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,230
Once the treatment starts,

381
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,231
it must continue
for nine consecutive days.

382
00:26:28,231 --> 00:26:29,310
Should it be interrupted,

383
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,370
not only will previous
efforts be wasted,

384
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:33,051
she may very well lose her life.

385
00:26:34,352 --> 00:26:35,472
Thank you, Ms.

386
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:37,424
No worries.

387
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:39,391
It's getting late.

388
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,330
You must be tired from all the climbing.

389
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,711
Go have a good sleep for today.

390
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:45,350
We can talk about it tomorrow.

391
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,416
Come back.

392
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,291
What now?

393
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,144
One more day here,

394
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:53,232
ShenLi

395
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,280
will suffer one more day.

396
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,051
As far as I know,

397
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,330
the treatment using the Blood Seven

398
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,008
is rather simple.

399
00:27:01,691 --> 00:27:02,736
Today,

400
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,330
restore her five senses.

401
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:09,328
Alright.

402
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,571
It is rare to see
Your Excellency so anxious.

403
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,490
Thanks to you, Miss.

404
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:17,616
Let's go.

405
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,250
Miss, calm your mind
and close your eyes.

406
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:32,016
Regulate your breath.

407
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:10,891
Are you senses clearer now?

408
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:18,544
It's done?

409
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,531
Try it.

410
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:25,040
Feel it.

411
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,024
I can feel.

412
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:41,296
Sandalwood.

413
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,376
I can smell.

414
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:52,688
It's somewhat bitter.

415
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:54,640
I can taste too.

416
00:28:57,968 --> 00:28:59,024
Xingzhi.

417
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,531
My five senses have been restored.

418
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,136
This medicine works wonders.

419
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,071
Ms. Jin's medical skills

420
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,571
are truly eye-opening.

421
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:11,811
Thanks.

422
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,031
Now I've used the Blood Seven

423
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,370
and restored her five senses.

424
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:18,096
I'm going to rest.

425
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,850
Is it talking?

426
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,888
What did it say?

427
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,488
Dear guests,

428
00:29:46,171 --> 00:29:48,850
I will lead you two to your rooms.

429
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,291
This place is not open
to the public during the day.

430
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,691
These treasures are all for sale.

431
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,771
However,

432
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:13,330
if you like it, Miss,

433
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:15,831
I can make one less deal

434
00:30:15,831 --> 00:30:17,051
and give it to you.

435
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,311
But,

436
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:21,530
if you will take a single gentleman

437
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,216
from my mountain,

438
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:24,271
that would be great.

439
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:25,651
Stop speaking nonsense.

440
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:27,631
I was merely joking.

441
00:30:27,631 --> 00:30:28,891
Your Excellency is jealous?

442
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,691
How petty.

443
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,848
Miss, let's go.

444
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:37,936
Your Excellency,

445
00:30:38,811 --> 00:30:41,520
I will treat the young lady in there.

446
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,544
You cannot enter.

447
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,851
You will guard the entrance

448
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:46,210
and be sure not to let outsiders in.

449
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,450
I can guard it inside as well.

450
00:30:48,976 --> 00:30:50,000
That won't do.

451
00:30:50,691 --> 00:30:53,691
The young lady will need to undress.

452
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,171
Undress?

453
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,224
Yes.

454
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,130
I've told you.

455
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:07,811
Her loss of power is
due to the incomplete rebirth.

456
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,730
The Five-color Flame Lotus

457
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,850
is to help her complete it.

458
00:31:12,411 --> 00:31:13,811
By then,

459
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:15,931
the flames on her will
burn everything around her.

460
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:19,330
It's possible that even
her own body can't bear it.

461
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:22,751
I have the coolness of a serpent

462
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,871
and my scales are all enchanted.

463
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:26,571
With my assistance,

464
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,391
her burning heat can
be somewhat suppressed

465
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:30,571
to keep her cool.

466
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:32,850
I cooperate so diligently,

467
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,171
yet you look at me with distrust.

468
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,931
I am upset.

469
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:40,931
So that's how it is.

470
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,210
How can a lady's body be exposed to men?

471
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:45,450
It won't do even if you are a god.

472
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,171
If you must enter,

473
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,200
fine.

474
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,911
You perform the treatment,

475
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:52,411
while I guard and guide from the side.

476
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,871
But during the treatment,

477
00:31:55,871 --> 00:31:58,171
there will inevitably
be physical contact.

478
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,610
Your Excellency,

479
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,272
can you handle it?

480
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,304
Forget it.

481
00:32:08,931 --> 00:32:10,691
I'll guard outside.

482
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,370
But I hope you will mind your conduct.

483
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,970
Do not speak inappropriate words.

484
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,291
Do not jest.

485
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:20,848
Let's go, Miss.

486
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,291
(I can't see anything in here.)

487
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,011
(And the sound is like)

488
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:37,970
(cut off by thick stone walls.)

489
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,171
(I can't smell anything either.)

490
00:32:42,531 --> 00:32:43,971
(It's like my five senses)

491
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:45,891
(are lost again.)

492
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:48,880
Wait.

493
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,024
What's the matter?

494
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,730
(Even though Xingzhi is not by my side,)

495
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,490
(I am still the unyielding Lord Bicang.)

496
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,450
Nothing, let's go.

497
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:05,891
I like your temperament, Miss.

498
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,384
Follow me.

499
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:39,571
This is where I practice and meditate.

500
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,011
Where does that lead to?

501
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:48,336
That?

502
00:33:49,931 --> 00:33:51,811
That is no place for living creatures.

503
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,970
Miss, you know I am a demon.

504
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,171
It's inevitable for demons
to have some wicked thoughts.

505
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,336
That cave

506
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,411
contains the wicked thoughts and desires

507
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:04,130
I've had over tens
of thousands of years.

508
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,130
I have sealed them
deep within this mountain.

509
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:08,771
So many years have passed.

510
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:10,531
I wonder what they have become.

511
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,424
So, miss,

512
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:16,930
if you cherish your life,

513
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:19,450
you mustn't go there.

514
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,011
Do not be curious about it.

515
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,890
I apologize for asking.

516
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,930
It's alright.

517
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,490
I was supposed to explain it to you.

518
00:34:28,752 --> 00:34:29,840
Please.

519
00:34:51,376 --> 00:34:52,528
Don't be nervous.

520
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:54,128
This is...

521
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,531
A fine wine blended by myself.

522
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:57,650
You can't find it anywhere else.

523
00:34:58,704 --> 00:34:59,790
Have a taste.

524
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,912
Thank you.

525
00:35:09,104 --> 00:35:10,288
Let's begin.

526
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:15,728
Thank you.

527
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,611
Sister,

528
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:21,851
are you sure you won't consider our men?

529
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,170
Quite a few of them are really good.

530
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:27,091
His Excellency is so old.

531
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:37,650
His Excellency is angry.

532
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,771
I nearly forgot.

533
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:44,250
With his power,

534
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,091
it's effortless

535
00:35:46,091 --> 00:35:47,611
to get through these magical barriers

536
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,170
and do some eavesdropping.

537
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,091
(Xingzhi is eavesdropping.)

538
00:36:03,216 --> 00:36:04,304
Fine.

539
00:36:05,051 --> 00:36:06,930
Sister, you just need
to remove your coat.

540
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:09,104
Okay.

541
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,951
(Lord Xingzhi is a man of few words,)

542
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:16,531
(now he gets anxious too.)

543
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:18,350
(At the crucial moment,)

544
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,930
(they still need me to matchmake.)

545
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:55,450
I'm going to start.

546
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,771
This is the Five-color Flame Lotus.

547
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,131
It will be a bit painful; bear with it.

548
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,280
Do not resist.
