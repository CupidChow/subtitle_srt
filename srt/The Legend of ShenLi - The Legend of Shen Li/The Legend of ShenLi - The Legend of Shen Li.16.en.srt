00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:39,543
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,291
(North Academy)

4
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:48,094
The real culprit will be handed over

5
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:50,415
to us Immortals to handle.

6
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:51,568
No.

7
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:54,855
This matter involves many Diviners.

8
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,575
We Diviners will pursue it to the end.

9
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:02,215
(He seems careless,)

10
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:04,775
(but he knows well where he stands)

11
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:07,775
(and never backs down
an inch on matters)

12
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,015
(involving the Divine Realm.)

13
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:13,694
Okay, a joint trial.

14
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,099
(North Academy)

15
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:39,254
We've even reached the city wall.

16
00:02:42,855 --> 00:02:43,952
What are you doing?

17
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:46,192
Let me perform a trick for you.

18
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:18,201
(Fusheng Sect, Mortal Realm)

19
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,959
(Fusheng Sect)

20
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:34,736
Isn't it magical?

21
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:36,894
Next time pull out your own hair.

22
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:47,974
This must be
the Fusheng Sect's home base.

23
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:47,334
Tell me where your boss is.

24
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:51,174
R-R-Right.

25
00:05:51,815 --> 00:05:53,415
What is on the left?

26
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:54,455
There...

27
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,415
There, the Diviners are imprisoned.

28
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,535
Being bloodthirsty

29
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:08,944
is not a good thing.

30
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:11,935
Even if your enemy stands before you.

31
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:19,408
I don't need your preaching.

32
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:23,435
Those Earth Diviners
are imprisoned on the left.

33
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:25,334
I'm not so skilled in spells,
so I will not go.

34
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:27,495
You'll go rescue

35
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:29,014
them yourself.

36
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:31,255
I will go and explore the right.

37
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:32,935
If we capture
the real culprit this time,

38
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:34,975
I hope you'll testify

39
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,275
on our behalf at the joint trial

40
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:38,574
and clear our name

41
00:06:39,294 --> 00:06:40,734
so that we won't be vilified again.

42
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:36,814
Impressive, Lord Bicang.

43
00:08:39,055 --> 00:08:41,574
Why are you setting up the Immortals?

44
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,855
Setting up?

45
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,574
I wouldn't call it a set-up.

46
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:06,494
Fu Sheng.

47
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,535
Fusheng Sect.

48
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:09,934
(He's a mere mortal.)

49
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:11,494
(How can he live so long?)

50
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:14,215
Who are you, and what is your purpose?

51
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,095
Death will tell you.

52
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:19,894
You think your men

53
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,232
can kill me?

54
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:22,894
Not them, of course.

55
00:10:54,894 --> 00:10:55,920
Zixia!

56
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,574
Save me.

57
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:17,814
- Save me.
- Please!

58
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,295
Save us.

59
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:22,374
Save us.

60
00:11:22,374 --> 00:11:23,855
Save us.

61
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:25,134
Please help us.

62
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,975
Help me, please.

63
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:08,775
(Her body...)

64
00:12:10,374 --> 00:12:11,415
(ShenLi...)

65
00:12:15,454 --> 00:12:17,334
Stop! She's still of use.

66
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:31,735
ShenLi.

67
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,415
Catch...

68
00:12:50,694 --> 00:12:51,775
You're seriously injured.

69
00:12:53,095 --> 00:12:54,384
Do you not want to live?

70
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,374
I do.

71
00:12:58,454 --> 00:12:59,535
I want myself

72
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:05,615
and all the Immortals to live better.

73
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:10,975
You and all the Immortals will be fine.

74
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:13,872
ShenLi,

75
00:15:15,454 --> 00:15:16,454
I will protect you.

76
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:27,814
(No one has ever...)

77
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:31,655

Here.

113
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:15,935
Thank you, Mr. Jing,
but I can do it myself.

114
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:18,415
It's not healed yet. Let me do it.

115
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:41,055
Perhaps you can

116
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:42,355
go help the Diviner with Miss Jing.

117
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:43,535
I can take the medicine myself.

118
00:17:45,014 --> 00:17:46,655
It's okay. She can do it herself.

123
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:28,614
Tired? Then take a rest.

I-I-I want to help you,

but I'm worried

127
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:40,894
that I might reveal my true form.

128
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,494
I've given some of my energy to you,

129
00:18:47,014 --> 00:18:48,415
so you absolutely won't.

130
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,408
Don't worry.

131
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,640
Please mind your manners.

132
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,455
Isn't your beloved lying there?

133
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:02,575
Why did you come out?

134
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,134
I have no private affair
with Miss Shi Luo.

135
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,254
Please do not slander us.

136
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,072
Why are you still standing there?

137
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,152
- I...
- Open the door.

138
00:19:19,494 --> 00:19:20,815
Furong, come here.

139
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,495
What happened?

140
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:26,254
Just a moment.

141
00:19:26,254 --> 00:19:27,854
What's going on?

142
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:32,368
What are you waiting for?

143
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:40,775
I haven't done anything wrong.

144
00:19:40,775 --> 00:19:41,775
If you're not happy,

145
00:19:41,775 --> 00:19:43,254
go take care of the girl on the ground.

146
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:46,768
Why be so harsh with me?

147
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:54,014
I have my reasons.

148
00:20:01,094 --> 00:20:03,055
Anyway, you're always right.

149
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:06,128
I am always wrong.

150
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:24,935
What happened?

151
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,536
Why did she get wounded badly?

152
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:29,555
Hold her other hand

153
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:30,695
and perform the purification.

154
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:36,624
Her body temperature is extremely low.

155
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:40,295
There is a strange energy within her

156
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,214
and it seems to merge with her blood,

157
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:46,374
making it hard to tell
whether she's been poisoned or cursed.

158
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:48,494
Why did she become like this

159
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,064
after just a short while?

160
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:53,155
If you guys found any clues,

161
00:20:53,155 --> 00:20:54,875
why didn't you tell us
and we would go together?

162
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,695
Wouldn't that be better?

163
00:20:56,695 --> 00:20:58,192
She doesn't trust you.

164
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:01,214
Nor does she believe me.

165
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:06,695
She doesn't trust anyone
from the Divine Realm.

166
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:10,094
If she hadn't been so hurt
that she couldn't move,

167
00:21:12,134 --> 00:21:17,575
she would've gone after
the mastermind behind it today.

168
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,815
So stubborn.

169
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:31,815
So who would marry such a feisty woman?

170
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:34,416
This woman

171
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:36,254
has no vulnerable charm

172
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:38,695
that makes you pity her.

173
00:21:43,455 --> 00:21:44,496
She has.

174
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,976
She has it.

175
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,235
(Did my ears have a problem just now?)

176
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,094
(Did I hear it wrong?)

177
00:22:00,094 --> 00:22:02,295
(Lord Xingzhi is aloof.)

178
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:05,295
(I've never heard of him falling
for anyone during the past years.)

179
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:07,815
(How could he possibly
feel pity for ShenLi?)

180
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:58,800
It's been a whole day and night.

181
00:23:00,374 --> 00:23:01,415
She's finally getting better.

182
00:23:05,295 --> 00:23:07,014
Your Excellency,

183
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:08,254
what kind of demon

184
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:10,374
could hurt Lord Bicang this badly?

185
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,455
My impression

186
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:13,575
of Lord Bicang

187
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:15,695
is an indestructible

188
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:18,455
and unbeatable warrior.

189
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,214
It is really unexpected

190
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:23,935
to see her like this.

191
00:23:24,655 --> 00:23:27,014
There are two kinds of energy within her

192
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,655
that haven't completely merged.

193
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:31,935
Two kinds of energy?

194
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:33,328
What are they?

195
00:23:34,214 --> 00:23:35,894
You won't understand.

196
00:23:35,894 --> 00:23:37,360
This matter has nothing to do with you.

197
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:39,935
She is already so formidable.

198
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:41,494
Does she need to learn
two cultivation methods?

199
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:45,055
The abduction of the Earth Diviners
is not as simple as it seems.

200
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:48,815
Although I have killed the mastermind,

201
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:53,734
I am not sure
if he had other conspiracies.

202
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:57,895
Tomorrow morning,
you shall go to the Immortal Realm,

203
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,815
tell Her Holiness
about the entire matter

204
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,415
and get her prepared.

205
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:04,655
Then return immediately
to the Divine Realm.

206
00:24:06,494 --> 00:24:08,255
It is of great importance.

207
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,335
No time to waste.

208
00:24:09,335 --> 00:24:11,295
Me?

209
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:15,535
I finally resolved
the matter in Jinxiu City.

210
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:18,014
Can't I just
have a bit of fun before that?

211
00:24:18,014 --> 00:24:19,056
What do you want to do?

212
00:24:20,815 --> 00:24:21,840
Alright.

213
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:24,895
I'll summon two divine beasts
to play with you.

214
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:27,254
No, I will go tomorrow.

215
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,494
Your Excellency,

216
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:31,575
what about the miasma here

217
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:33,214
and the people who have inhaled it?

218
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:35,175
The source of the miasma

219
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:36,214
has already been cut off by me.

220
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:39,255
All the Earth Diviners have returned.

221
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:40,555
Clearing the toxic miasma

222
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:41,715
is just a matter of time.

223
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:43,775
As for those people, I'll handle them.

224
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:47,134
There's nothing left for you to do here.

225
00:24:47,134 --> 00:24:48,214
Pack up and hurry on your way.

226
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:51,600
Yes.

227
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,344
Sir.

228
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:01,264
How is that Diviner?

229
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:04,974
She's not a Diviner at all.

230
00:26:07,094 --> 00:26:09,335
What's wrong?

231
00:26:11,734 --> 00:26:12,976
I...

232
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:24,494
At first, I was quite proud

233
00:26:26,175 --> 00:26:27,455
to have protected this academy

234
00:26:28,175 --> 00:26:29,254
and the people inside.

235
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:32,854
I felt it was no easy feat.

236
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:34,416
Quite an accomplishment.

237
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,494
But today, seeing ShenLi like that,

238
00:26:39,614 --> 00:26:41,415
I suddenly feel like
I did nothing, actually.

239
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,254
I never thought

240
00:26:45,254 --> 00:26:46,815
a person could suffer
such serious injuries.

241
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:49,175
If it were me,

242
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:51,695
I wouldn't stand it at all.

243
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:56,368
Sir,

244
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:58,094
you are great enough.

245
00:27:07,295 --> 00:27:10,535
Can ShenLi make it through this time?

246
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,094
The other Diviner is great, too.

247
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,095
And I've noticed

248
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,494
he is especially good to her.

249
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:21,614
He will surely keep her safe.

250
00:27:25,094 --> 00:27:26,384
That's true.

251
00:27:29,055 --> 00:27:30,455
His Excellency is omnipotent.

252
00:27:38,175 --> 00:27:41,854
You don't wear rouge

253
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:44,752
or act weak like others.

254
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:48,974
Because you're tough.

255
00:27:50,974 --> 00:27:54,614
You never hide behind someone.

256
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:59,955
You're used to fighting alone,

257
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:01,455
protecting others,

258
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:02,494
bearing the pain,

259
00:28:04,014 --> 00:28:05,815
and shouldering your responsibilities.

260
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:08,752
That's why

261
00:28:09,935 --> 00:28:11,014
it breaks my heart

262
00:28:13,214 --> 00:28:14,815
to see you hurt.

263
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:30,575
Just like a kitten

264
00:28:31,575 --> 00:28:33,535
lolling out its little paws

265
00:28:35,935 --> 00:28:38,614
and tugging at my heart.

266
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:43,214
I didn't notice it at first,

267
00:28:44,935 --> 00:28:45,974
but later,

268
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:49,455
I found it painful, itchy

269
00:28:51,535 --> 00:28:52,734
and hard to describe.

270
00:28:58,094 --> 00:28:59,216
ShenLi,

271
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,775
you really are...

272
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,968
♪Even if the world changes♪

273
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:08,080
Trouble.

274
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:10,736
♪A vision full of red♪

275
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:14,655
♪Embrace you in the world♪

276
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:15,935
The miasma has finally dispersed.

277
00:29:17,175 --> 00:29:18,896
It's much better.

278
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:24,752
Want to see the stars?

279
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:27,888
Can I?

280
00:29:29,614 --> 00:29:30,832
I can give you

281
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:34,352
whatever you want.

282
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:39,815
A starry sky!

283
00:29:39,815 --> 00:29:41,584
So pretty!

284
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:58,655
To me, you are
more beautiful than the starry sky.

285
00:30:08,944 --> 00:30:09,955
I mean...

286
00:30:09,955 --> 00:30:11,280
Jing Xi!

287
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:14,815
Why is it you again?

288
00:30:22,494 --> 00:30:23,535
I know you like him.

289
00:30:25,535 --> 00:30:27,415
But he was so harsh on you
before for a woman.

290
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,034
If you don't make him
jealous and anxious,

291
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:31,374
he will take you for granted.

292
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:35,035
Trust me.

293
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,494
I am quite a lover.

294
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,775
Are you helping me?

295
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:44,854
But

296
00:30:44,854 --> 00:30:46,455
I want something in return.

297
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:49,295
Give me a kiss.

298
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,824
No way.

299
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,192
Teasing you is really fun.

300
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:14,000
Catch...

301
00:31:15,134 --> 00:31:16,464
Have you caught him?

302
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:18,614
Have you caught Fu Sheng?

303
00:31:18,614 --> 00:31:20,254
Fu Sheng?

304
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:22,175
The man who burned down
Xingyun's courtyard.

305
00:31:25,655 --> 00:31:26,695
Looking back now,

306
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:28,874
too many things

307
00:31:28,874 --> 00:31:30,175
happened that night.

308
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:34,094
He took the Earth Diviners,

309
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:35,734
created those monsters

310
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:38,295
and even made use of Zixia.

311
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:40,575
Once I'm healed,
I must catch that scoundrel!

312
00:31:45,055 --> 00:31:46,854
Alright, lie down.

313
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,335
Heal your wounds first.

314
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:52,655
We can talk about it later.

315
00:31:53,254 --> 00:31:54,575
Is the poison inside me hard to cure?

316
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:58,128
A little.

317
00:31:59,655 --> 00:32:02,695
When can I return to the Immortal Realm?

318
00:32:04,734 --> 00:32:06,535
Let's take it slow.

319
00:32:06,535 --> 00:32:08,374
Let me hand over the method
of detoxifying the miasma

320
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:10,094
to the right person first.

321
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:15,056
Have a rest.

322
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:35,734
We didn't catch the mastermind,

323
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:39,415
but we've got a moment of peace,

324
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:42,295
which is a gain in itself.

325
00:32:44,335 --> 00:32:46,014
Getting a moment of peace

326
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:47,575
is good.

327
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:50,134
But next time,

328
00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:52,014
don't risk your life.

329
00:32:54,094 --> 00:32:55,175
It is strange.

330
00:32:56,575 --> 00:32:58,014
Before I met you,

331
00:32:58,815 --> 00:33:00,175
whether on the battlefield

332
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:01,894
or in private,

333
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:04,175
I had never suffered
such serious injuries.

334
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:07,254
But ever since,

335
00:33:08,134 --> 00:33:09,134
I've been getting

336
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:11,536
wounded badly in battle.

337
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:15,455
If one day I die on the battlefield,

338
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:19,175
you must pay with your life.

339
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:22,800
Nonsense.

340
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:25,295
You cherish

341
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:26,535
your precious life, right?

342
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:29,655
If such a day comes,

343
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:32,014
I'll pay you with my life.

344
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:40,656
You...

345
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:43,935
- What happened?
- What's that noise?

346
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:45,175
- What's wrong?
- Let's take a look.

347
00:33:48,094 --> 00:33:49,494
Jing Yan, what are you doing?

348
00:33:50,014 --> 00:33:51,455
You've gone too far!

349
00:33:51,455 --> 00:33:53,014
Step aside! I must deal with him today.

350
00:33:54,614 --> 00:33:56,974
Xi, your senior is so powerful.

351
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,135
Quit the act.

352
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:05,254
- Who is it?
- Stand up.

353
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:13,414
You recovered so quickly.

354
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:15,694
What have you done this time?

355
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:18,160
No.

356
00:34:19,414 --> 00:34:20,775
Stop looking.

357
00:34:20,775 --> 00:34:22,095
Now that the miasma has dissipated,

358
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,135
everyone, go back home.

359
00:34:23,135 --> 00:34:24,895
Come on.

360
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,414
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

361
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:33,694
Furong, what are you doing now?

362
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:35,815
Do you have no shame?

363
00:34:35,815 --> 00:34:37,375
Of course I do, Your Excellency.

364
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,575
I plan to return today.

365
00:34:39,254 --> 00:34:40,974
- No way!
- What on earth do you want?

366
00:34:44,734 --> 00:34:46,354
You stayed out all night with a man.

367
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:48,080
What do you think I want?

368
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:53,335
He just took me
to watch the stars all night.

369
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:56,375
Really?

370
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,872
Of course it's true.

371
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:02,575
Why such a temper?

372
00:35:03,095 --> 00:35:04,594
Is it because you're jealous

373
00:35:04,594 --> 00:35:06,375
after looking for her all night?

374
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:35,728
Yan,

375
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,494
you said you cared
about Miss Shi Luo for some reason.

376
00:35:41,295 --> 00:35:42,535
What exactly is the reason?

377
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:52,174
Miss Shi saved me when I was young.

378
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,055
Before I became a disciple of Master,

379
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,615
I was once captured by a sect.

380
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:58,576
She saved me.

381
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:01,895
We haven't seen each other since then.

382
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:04,414
This time, I saw
her again in Jinxiu City,

383
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,734
and I wanted to repay her.

384
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:13,775
You can do that,

385
00:36:14,934 --> 00:36:16,575
but don't treat me like a child.

386
00:36:17,254 --> 00:36:19,375
I am not anymore.

387
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:20,624
Jing Xi!

388
00:36:24,414 --> 00:36:26,064
Where are you going?

389
00:36:27,414 --> 00:36:28,720
To sort out medicinal herbs.

390
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:35,615
(I don't understand them.)

391
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:37,395
Sir,

392
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,575
would you like

393
00:36:38,575 --> 00:36:39,615
to take a walk with me?

394
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:50,694
Don't misunderstand. Just a walk.

395
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:04,454
I've heard that you are the disciple

396
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:06,335
of a famous cultivator.

397
00:37:07,174 --> 00:37:09,375
Perhaps you have learned some spells?

398
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,494
It's a shame.

399
00:37:12,494 --> 00:37:13,654
I didn't learn any spells

400
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:15,895
growing up.

401
00:37:17,014 --> 00:37:18,934
My master said it was not my talent,

402
00:37:18,934 --> 00:37:20,414
so he taught me only martial arts.

403
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:26,135
I will teach you a technique

404
00:37:27,335 --> 00:37:29,815
which can purge
the miasma poison within someone.

405
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:32,335
Are you interested?

406
00:37:33,654 --> 00:37:36,335
Of course, I want to learn, but I...

407
00:37:36,335 --> 00:37:39,335
If you want to, you will master it.

408
00:38:12,654 --> 00:38:14,494
Qingye, it's been a long time.

409
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,400
Xingzhi.

410
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,256
(Qingye, an ancient god
from the Extranatural Heaven)

411
00:38:21,694 --> 00:38:25,295
I thought we would never meet again.

412
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,568
The power of the Natural Law.

413
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:31,654
Even though I have lived
until now as a god,

414
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:34,375
I still can't fathom a little bit.

415
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:37,734
Seeing you again is all down to fate.

416
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:44,135
I was frivolous before
because I didn't realize it.

417
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,855
But now bound by the Natural Law,

418
00:38:47,694 --> 00:38:51,174
I see you and I are but specks of dust.

419
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:55,095
No matter how powerful we are,
it's just a blessing,

420
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:57,214
and no one can resist it

421
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:00,135
when it's taken back.

422
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:09,135
Now, you have awakened me.

423
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:12,815
I wonder if the universe wants it.

424
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:16,135
I didn't do anything.

425
00:39:17,135 --> 00:39:19,214
I just helped you unblock your meridians

426
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:20,815
so that now,

427
00:39:21,454 --> 00:39:23,414
you can learn the spell
to detoxify the miasma poison.

428
00:39:23,974 --> 00:39:26,335
And you've got to open your eyes

429
00:39:27,654 --> 00:39:28,895
and see

430
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:32,615
who the person you gave up

431
00:39:33,494 --> 00:39:34,654
everything to find is now.

432
00:39:36,654 --> 00:39:38,335
Don't make another mistake

433
00:39:39,014 --> 00:39:40,135
or pick the wrong person.

434
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:46,095
You weren't this nosy.

435
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:50,855
That's not a good thing for a god.

436
00:39:55,454 --> 00:39:57,014
One more thing.

437
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:01,974
Fu Sheng. Does it ring a bell?

438
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:05,974
Fu Sheng. I remember him.

439
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:08,174
As Gu Chengjin,

440
00:40:09,734 --> 00:40:11,174
I was plotted against by my brother.

441
00:40:12,095 --> 00:40:13,424
Later I found out

442
00:40:14,174 --> 00:40:15,895
(that it was Fu Sheng who advised him.)

443
00:40:20,815 --> 00:40:24,174
I recall he has been executed.

444
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:29,375
In this life, who do you think
resembles him?

445
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:43,376
There is someone.
