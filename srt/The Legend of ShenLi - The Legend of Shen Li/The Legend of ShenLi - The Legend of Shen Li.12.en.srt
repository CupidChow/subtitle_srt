00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,184
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:51,652 --> 00:01:53,891
What are you looking at?

4
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,251
Go away.

5
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:58,531
You have a divine aura. So what?

6
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,291
Big deal! Diviner.

7
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,452
So annoying, Diviner!

8
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:05,732
So you're Lord Bicang's parrot.

9
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:08,371
Go away, Diviner.

10
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,371
What a bossy parrot.

11
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,031
Are you mocking me, Diviner?

12
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:15,772
So annoying, Diviner!

13
00:02:17,008 --> 00:02:18,052
Annoying!

14
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:19,120
I did this to you.

15
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:23,052
You did this to me, Diviner.

16
00:02:24,132 --> 00:02:25,132
That's Shush.

17
00:02:25,132 --> 00:02:27,132
You did this to me, Diviner.

18
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:29,652
- Stop shouting.
- It's all your fault!

19
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:32,031
- So annoying. You did this to me.
- Silence.

20
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:33,104
You did this...

21
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:37,744
Shush.

22
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:42,511
I heard it from a mile away.

23
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,572
How come it's so quiet now?

24
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:49,332
Perhaps it got tired.

25
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:56,016
Please have a look.

26
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,064
Here you are.

27
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,091
An ice pop, please.

28
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:05,011
Alright, here comes your ice pop.

29
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,864
Candied lotus seeds.

30
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:11,972
Candied lotus seeds.

31
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,091
What's the rush?

32
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:15,011
Aren't we taking a stroll?

33
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,052
Candied lotus seeds.

34
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:19,091
Candied lotus seeds, ice pops.

35
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:21,692
Candied lotus seeds.

36
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:28,731
Your Excellency, hurry up.

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,624
Your Lordship.

38
00:03:33,292 --> 00:03:34,352
Your Lordship.

39
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:37,616
Try these candied lotus seeds

40
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:38,731
I just made.

41
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:40,332
I'll send you more if you like them.

42
00:03:41,451 --> 00:03:43,592
I don't want you to go.

43
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:44,731
Nuan, be good.

44
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,972
Daddy has to protect the people.

45
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:49,591
Let's get candied lotus seeds
once I'm back.

46
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:50,852
Ten portions.

47
00:03:50,852 --> 00:03:52,932
Ten? Alright.

48
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,251
(Listen to your mother.)

49
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:56,336
No need.

50
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:58,611
Pack everything. I'll pay.

51
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:01,952
How can I accept your money?

52
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:03,088
No way.

53
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:05,332
Wrap them up.

54
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,892
What is this? It looks tasty.

55
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:09,332
It's our ice pop.
It comes in many flavors.

56
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:12,412
Fresh milk,

57
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:13,968
apple,

58
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:15,760
grape,

59
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:17,680
durian...

60
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:19,536
Can I try one?

61
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,811
Sure.

62
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,251
But you have to pay, Your Excellency.

63
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:30,512
Your Excellency?

64
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,692
I didn't bring any money.

65
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:35,852
Please get me one, Your Lordship.

66
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:37,972
Your Excellency, do you hear yourself?

67
00:04:39,132 --> 00:04:41,952
I'll repay you once I have the money.

68
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:43,352
You don't have to pay.

69
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,612
Have them for free.

70
00:04:44,612 --> 00:04:45,680
Thank you.

71
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:47,568
Don't indulge him.

72
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:48,651
If you want something,

73
00:04:49,452 --> 00:04:50,544
pay for it.

74
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:54,931
Didn't Your Lordship

75
00:04:55,491 --> 00:04:56,692
promise Her Holiness

76
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,172
to treat me well?

77
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,332
You just promised her that

78
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:01,612
and now you're starving me?

79
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:05,892
I want the durian one.

80
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,156
(Durian)

81
00:05:11,408 --> 00:05:12,492
What did you say?

82
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,331
I want the durian one.

83
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:18,160
Fine!

84
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,568
Eat it up.

85
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:40,531
Is this a tea house?

86
00:05:41,172 --> 00:05:42,331
Clearly not.

87
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,144
Sister.

88
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,172
Nuan.

89
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:46,320
Your Lordship.

90
00:05:47,856 --> 00:05:48,880
Sis.

91
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:50,892
Here. Candied lotus seeds.

92
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,491
Did my dad ask you to bring them over?

93
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,631
That's right. Your dad said

94
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:04,132
that you could come to me
for candied lotus seeds.

95
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:06,800
Do you like these?

96
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:11,152
Let's go over there.

97
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,212
Your Lordship.

98
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:13,328
Sister.

99
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:17,552
Life is too short.

100
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:20,972
Zixia has returned
to where he's come from.

101
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:23,216
My condolences.

102
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,024
Don't worry, sister.

103
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:46,632
Have a durian-flavored one,

104
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:47,732
and it won't be so bitter.

105
00:06:49,331 --> 00:06:50,384
No, thanks.

106
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:52,784
Alright then.

107
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:55,651
Her Lordship is here!

108
00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:56,811
Her Lordship is here!

109
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,771
Your Lordship!

110
00:06:59,536 --> 00:07:00,656
It's Her Lordship!

111
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,431
I wasn't sure just now.

112
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,452
Who is the Diviner next to Her Lordship?

113
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,592
Yeah, who is he?

114
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,892
He must be Lord Furong.

115
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:09,391
I heard that Lord Furong has come

116
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:10,771
to bond with Her Lordship.

117
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:12,252
Do I look that ostentatious?

118
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,772
Yeah, they look like a great match.

119
00:07:14,772 --> 00:07:15,824
Yeah.

120
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,931
Greetings, Your Lordship.

121
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:20,632
I hope you aren't injured,
Your Lordship.

122
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,612
Would you like to try my special remedy?

123
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,771
No, thanks. Be cautious
with special remedies.

124
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:26,480
Take care of yourself.

125
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,331
Alright, Your Lordship.

126
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,688
Let's go...

127
00:07:33,612 --> 00:07:34,711
It seems that the people

128
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,732
of the Immortal Realm really admire you.

129
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,832
Because we pay for what we buy

130
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:42,032
and act with reason.

131
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:44,491
It's truly enviable.

132
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,732
Your life is my dream.

133
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,216
Let's go back.

134
00:08:06,692 --> 00:08:08,692
Isn't the capital quite clean?

135
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:13,811
Where is the miasma?

136
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:16,336
I don't see any.

137
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:24,651
Did His Excellency
send me out on purpose

138
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,752
to annoy me?

139
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,291
Lord Xingzhi restored
the five-element seals at the abyss.

140
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,328
That's right.

141
00:08:29,328 --> 00:08:31,931
And the abyss saw the most brilliant
moonlight in 1,000 years.

142
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:35,392
How I wish to
admire his celestial grace.

143
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:36,464
Pray for it now.

144
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,372
They're so eager to see His Excellency?

145
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:43,172
So I can plot something.

146
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,492
My plan to make ShenLi hate me

147
00:08:46,091 --> 00:08:48,292
can start from here.

148
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,451
Come on, throw me a few coins
if you're loaded.

149
00:08:52,451 --> 00:08:54,112
Or feel free to just join us.

150
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,192
Lord Bicang's Mansion
is open for visitors.

151
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:58,672
Lord Xingzhi outshines the moon
and makes the flowers shy.

152
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,012
Three spiritual stones

153
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:01,112
for one visit.

154
00:09:01,112 --> 00:09:03,692
Three spiritual stones, fair and square.

155
00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:05,211
Pay and enter.

156
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,932
Your spiritual stones are a bit small.

157
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:15,052
What do you mean?

158
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:16,691
Can I get in or not?

159
00:09:16,691 --> 00:09:18,172
Of course. Do you recognize me?

160
00:09:18,812 --> 00:09:20,492
I'm Her Lordship's future husband.

161
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:22,211
I own half of this mansion.

162
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:24,052
She can close the front gate,

163
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,172
but I can open the back one.

164
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:29,932
General Mofang is here.

165
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:33,972
Who kicked my chair?

166
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,292
How dare you barge into
Lord Bicang's Mansion?

167
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,812
T-This Diviner said we could enter...

168
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:52,331
Oh, yeah? He can return
to the Divine Realm. Can you?

169
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,512
I...

170
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:58,800
Go home.

171
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,392
Don't go...

172
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:04,632
I can let you in. Don't go.

173
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:05,744
He's just a swindler.

174
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,531
I'd put up with it
if ShenLi did this to me.

175
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,331
Who the heck are you? I will punish you!

176
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:14,091
Don't go. Come back.

177
00:10:15,771 --> 00:10:16,784
Ouch.

178
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:18,972
I didn't expect

179
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,211
that the ice pops

180
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:22,416
would be so amazing.

181
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,412
What a pity that

182
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:28,551
I only tried a few flavors.

183
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:31,052
There are still
so many flavors I want to try.

184
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,176
When are you leaving?

185
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:35,952
What's this?

186
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:46,292
- Who did this?
- Your Lordship, it was Furong.

187
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:47,651
Your Lordship.

188
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:48,891
Beat him up.

189
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,212
- It was him.
- Someone is attacking me!

190
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,292
Is there no law?

191
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,612
How dare you hit a Diviner?

192
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:56,720
Mofang.

193
00:10:57,936 --> 00:10:59,032
You've come.

194
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,691
I came to visit Your Lordship.

195
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,112
Your Excellency, they hit me!

196
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:10,192
What happened?

197
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,331
He was selling entry tickets.

198
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,372
What? Tickets?

199
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:17,532
- What tickets? What happened?
- Come down here.

200
00:11:17,532 --> 00:11:20,112
Many people want to meet His Excellency.

201
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,932
- I just met him in the mansion.
- I kill you!

202
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,911
Grandfather always
tells me to help others.

203
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:26,992
So, I opened the back door

204
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:29,012
to give them a chance.

205
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,531
But I couldn't let everyone in.

206
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,932
So I asked for a petty fee

207
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,512
for the ticket.

208
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,431
He even tied me up

209
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:37,652
so that I couldn't stop him.

210
00:11:37,652 --> 00:11:39,132
He's tarnishing your reputation

211
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,791
by collecting money from the people.

212
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,771
He's trouble. Get rid of him.

213
00:11:42,771 --> 00:11:43,771
Drag him to the lake.

214
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:45,571
Good, very good.

215
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,771
You think I can't deal with you?

216
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,331
Yeah, you really think
our lord can't handle you?

217
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,492
I'm a loser.

218
00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:55,292
This is how I live.

219
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,712
You're free to cancel the wedding.

220
00:11:57,712 --> 00:11:58,951
Or I will be your husband.

221
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,132
Will you kill your husband?

222
00:12:00,132 --> 00:12:01,296
I...

223
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:03,920
Beat him up, Your Lordship!

224
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,248
Don't do this again.

225
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:17,812
Didn't you hear him?

226
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:19,312
Why don't you beat him up?

227
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:22,212
Yeah, why don't you beat me up?

228
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:23,531
How dare you say that?

229
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:25,808
How dare you!

230
00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,372
It seems the Heavenly Lord
hasn't taught you manners.

231
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:31,612
Yeah, Your Excellency.

232
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:32,852
Look how outrageous he is.

233
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:47,612
Furong

234
00:12:48,464 --> 00:12:49,616
has always been

235
00:12:50,211 --> 00:12:51,211
arrogant and bossy.

236
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:52,912
He often causes trouble.

237
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:55,216
Today,

238
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:57,292
I shall properly educate you

239
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:59,372
on behalf of the Heavenly Lord.

240
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,091
Ouch.

241
00:13:12,131 --> 00:13:13,168
It hurts, ouch.

242
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:17,972
It seems that I have a great reason

243
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,292
to stay in this mansion.

244
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:23,732
That's right, Your Excellency.

245
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,211
Are you in charge here?

246
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,331
You're crossing the line,
Your Excellency.

247
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,331
Your Excellency, I apologize.

248
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,612
Please don't be mad.

249
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,256
I'll get out of here.

250
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:03,292
Furong will be my husband.

251
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:06,611
I have the final say on right and wrong

252
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:07,852
regarding his matters.

253
00:14:07,852 --> 00:14:08,932
This is my family affair.

254
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:11,912
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

255
00:14:11,912 --> 00:14:12,932
for you to step in.

256
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:20,932
I didn't expect that

257
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:23,032
Lord Bicang would

258
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,612
defend Furong one day.

259
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:28,112
He will be my family.

260
00:14:28,112 --> 00:14:30,172
Who else should I defend? You?

261
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:37,852
Please rest assured.

262
00:14:38,932 --> 00:14:40,011
I will take care

263
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:41,712
of his mistakes.

264
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:43,792
You don't get a say in it.

265
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:51,492
What's going on?

266
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,532
I thought Her Lordship
didn't like Furong.

267
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:54,931
Why is she upset

268
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,492
when His Excellency tries to help?

269
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,416
So despicable!

270
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:10,451
Lord Furong is trying to provoke you.

271
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,304
I can see that.

272
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,331
But I can't cancel the wedding.

273
00:15:17,372 --> 00:15:19,531
Both realms have been on guard.

274
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,456
We need a marriage alliance.

275
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:25,808
So you've resigned?

276
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,812
I'm just trying
to shoulder my responsibility.

277
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:32,172
Call it a resignation

278
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,936
if you want.

279
00:15:36,292 --> 00:15:38,492
I don't believe
he'd cause serious trouble.

280
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:42,011
And I don't want Lord Xingzhi
meddling with my affairs.

281
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,211
Mofang.

282
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,651
I may not contain myself.

283
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,771
Keep an eye out for me.

284
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,672
Understood.

285
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,052
Your Lordship.

286
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:55,132
Is Lord Xingzhi

287
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:56,252
going to stay?

288
00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:01,932
The more the merrier.

289
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:04,208
Let them stay.

290
00:16:05,392 --> 00:16:07,408
(Lord Bicang's Mansion)

291
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,576
Breakfast is ready, Your Lordship.

292
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,304
Take it away.

293
00:17:04,811 --> 00:17:05,904
What's wrong, Your Lordship?

294
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:07,824
Nothing.

295
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:14,712
I'm going to inspect the camp.

296
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:16,072
Stay home and keep an eye

297
00:17:16,072 --> 00:17:17,171
on Furong.

298
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,792
Rest assured, Your Lordship.
I'm prepared.

299
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,732
I won't let him cause trouble.

300
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,624
Right, Your Lordship.

301
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,772
We've been spending a lot of money

302
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:28,972
ever since Furong came.

303
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:31,171
Now His Excellency is also here.

304
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:33,892
We need spiritual stones
for food, clothing, and stuff.

305
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:35,772
Shall we ask Her Holiness for allowance?

306
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:36,816
No, no.

307
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:39,811
Don't bother her with trivial matters.

308
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:44,012
But we can't let them stay for free.

309
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,171
Ask them for money.

310
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:48,291
Furong must pay.

311
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,448
But Lord Xingzhi?

312
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:52,208
He pays if he wants meals.

313
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:56,092
Her Lordship changed so much

314
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:57,291
after she came back.

315
00:17:57,811 --> 00:17:59,372
She's learned to live frugally.

316
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:09,532
What are you doing?
Don't disturb His Excellency.

317
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,171
I'm here to ask
if His Excellency wants meals.

318
00:18:15,051 --> 00:18:17,492
Because he has to pay for the meals.

319
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:18,576
Pay for the meals?

320
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:20,752
Boarding fee. You have to pay, too.

321
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:21,931
I was about to look for you.

322
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,772
This is how you treat your guests?

323
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:27,892
Her Lordship is so stingy.

324
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:29,712
I...

325
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,732
Take it and leave him alone.

326
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:37,211
It's the money you got from our people!

327
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:39,892
It's mine.

328
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:41,732
Do you really think I'm broke?

329
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:51,032
Your stones are good. Three will do.

330
00:18:51,032 --> 00:18:52,652
We won't take more than necessary.

331
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,492
ShenLi's maid is such a fool.

332
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:10,288
What...

333
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:17,091
ShenLi has collected so many weapons?

334
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:21,132
So I have 100 ways to die.

335
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:28,592
This is terrifying.

336
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:31,184
Fortunately,

337
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,492
I have a Qiankun Bag.

338
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:35,248
I'll steal all of them.

339
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:14,152
It's been a long time, my armory.

340
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:15,571
Let me check on my hammer.

341
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:19,280
How come...

342
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:26,768
How come it's empty?

343
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,171
Rouya!

344
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:35,024
Where are my weapons?

345
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:38,811
Where's my hammer?

346
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:40,528
How come it's empty?

347
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:44,931
I-I don't know when I lost the keys.

348
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,932
I went to ask Lord Xingzhi
for the boarding fee

349
00:20:47,932 --> 00:20:49,252
and bumped into Furong...

350
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,291
I bet it was him!

351
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:57,532
Furong, I'm going to kill you!

352
00:20:58,451 --> 00:20:59,611
(Lord Bicang's Mansion)
Give me my keys!

353
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:00,691
Give me the weapons!

354
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,091
My keys!

355
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:06,411
Give the weapons back
and Her Lordship might spare you.

356
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:08,944
I...

357
00:21:10,411 --> 00:21:11,932
What weapons? I don't have them.

358
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:12,952
I said I didn't take any.

359
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,052
I'm going to fight back.

360
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:15,411
- Fight back.
- Come and get me.

361
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:17,191
One of us will perish

362
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:18,372
- today.
- Go ahead. Hit me.

363
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:20,912
How come you don't grow any taller?

364
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,032
Here.

365
00:21:24,012 --> 00:21:25,451
You...

366
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:27,632
Give it back!

367
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:31,792
Give me the keys, you...

368
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,072
Your Excellency.

369
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,131
Your Excellency.

370
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:36,132
- Your Lordship.
- Help.

371
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,532
Your Lordship, it's him. Again!

372
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:39,772
I took ShenLi's weapons.

373
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:41,552
They want to kill me.

374
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,892
Hand them over and I won't kill you.

375
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:48,491
I-I've sold them all.

376
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,371
Her Lordship collected those

377
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:51,972
over hundreds of years.

378
00:21:54,372 --> 00:21:56,472
ShenLi, I'm doing this for you.

379
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:58,772
It's dangerous
for a young lady to fight all day.

380
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:00,732
What nonsense?

381
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:03,891
Don't you want to marry me?

382
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:05,532
This is who I am and this is

383
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,372
how I cherish my wife.

384
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:10,172
I have all the rouge for you.

385
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:11,392
But if you want weapons,

386
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,612
I'll sell everything you get.

387
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:16,931
Your Lordship, don't hold back. Hit him.

388
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:19,824
Your Lordship.

389
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:22,732
Should I interfere

390
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,496
with your

391
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:28,624
family affairs?

392
00:22:31,376 --> 00:22:32,432
No need.

393
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:36,336
Furong.

394
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:37,904
Our marriage

395
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:40,071
is going to happen

396
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:41,532
even if you're against it.

397
00:22:42,291 --> 00:22:43,372
So stop struggling.

398
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:45,252
Nobody else has the final say

399
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:46,832
apart from me.

400
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:55,892
I-Instead of spouting threats here,

401
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:56,912
go to the market.

402
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:58,291
You might get a few things back.

403
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,384
Your Excellency.

404
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:28,816
Hand them over.

405
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:34,211
I-I've sold them.

406
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:39,372
You didn't even
have time to hide the keys.

407
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:41,008
And you sold the weapons?

408
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:43,856
Hand them over.

409
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:50,691
Your Excellency.

410
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:55,331
Do I have to return them?

411
00:23:56,372 --> 00:23:57,424
Of course.

412
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,520
But not yet.

413
00:24:13,488 --> 00:24:14,576
Will you tell her

414
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:18,352
that I took the initiative
to give them back?

415
00:24:18,352 --> 00:24:20,211
Otherwise, she might kill me.

416
00:24:21,012 --> 00:24:22,171
You deserve a beating.

417
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,256
But

418
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,400
it's not so serious.

419
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,492
Then I won't bother you anymore.

420
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,432
See you around.

421
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,248
Awful.

422
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:29,232
Horrible.

423
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:30,252
What's wrong, Your Lordship?

424
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:33,171
It breaks my heart.

425
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:36,931
Furong. That rascal!

426
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,600
He sold all my weapons.

427
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,624
Which one?

428
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:41,680
All of them.

429
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,704
All of them?

430
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,972
Your Lordship, I'll get them back.

431
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:48,532
I was looking but couldn't find them.

432
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:52,732
The swordsmith and I worked for 81 days

433
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:56,291
at the iron workshop
and finally forged that sword

434
00:25:57,012 --> 00:25:58,092
(with spiritual energy.)

435
00:25:58,092 --> 00:25:59,772
(We gave it a nice name,)

436
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:02,772
the Heavensplitter.

437
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:05,328
Not bad.

438
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:08,612
And the Soul-lifting Whip.

439
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:10,331
A masterpiece from 1,000 years ago.

440
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:12,772
It's made with a 10,000-year-old

441
00:26:13,411 --> 00:26:15,612
sandalwood handle

442
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,772
(and 99,000 bloody vines.)

443
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,852
(A crack can pierce the sky.)

444
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:22,576
So rare.

445
00:26:27,691 --> 00:26:28,752
And...

446
00:26:29,328 --> 00:26:30,384
And my

447
00:26:30,931 --> 00:26:33,852
Longevity Rings,

448
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:36,411
(Sky-Carver Axes,)

449
00:26:36,931 --> 00:26:38,252
(and...)

450
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:40,372
(the Netherstar Spike.)

451
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:44,252
What a special hobby she has.

452
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,384
Gone.

453
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:48,656
All gone.

454
00:26:57,171 --> 00:26:58,211
All gone.

455
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,488
That rascal.

456
00:27:04,732 --> 00:27:05,744
Yeah, rascal.

457
00:27:09,776 --> 00:27:10,800
Please forgive me.

458
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:12,880
Pig... pigskin.

459
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,292
Rascal.

460
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:18,320
Rascal.

461
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:20,272
Let's drink, Your Lordship.

462
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,664
I'm done.

463
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,304
I'll go on.

464
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,608
Rascal.

465
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:54,571
(Heavenly Golden Lock Box.)

466
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:58,912
(Lord Bicang seems
to lead a modest life)

467
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:00,372
(but has such a divine artifact.)

468
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,252
What is hidden inside?

469
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,171
(She didn't beat me up)

470
00:28:49,091 --> 00:28:50,372
(or pressure Her Holiness.)

471
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:53,972
(I've caused her so much trouble.)

472
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:57,051
(But she just tolerated everything.)

473
00:28:59,492 --> 00:29:01,451
(Don't tell me she's in love with me.)

474
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,612
(What does she like about me?)

475
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:08,972
(Could it be that)

476
00:29:08,972 --> 00:29:11,132
(she is fascinated
by my peerless looks?)

477
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,091
(Maybe I should give up.)

478
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,168
(I'm tired of it.)

479
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:20,892
(No, no...)

480
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:22,811
(It's about my marriage.)

481
00:29:22,811 --> 00:29:24,211
(I can't give up so easily.)

482
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:25,372
(I must carry on.)

483
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:28,880
(I can take)

484
00:29:29,532 --> 00:29:31,451
(extreme measures to achieve my goal.)

485
00:29:42,012 --> 00:29:43,088
I can't blame her.

486
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,024
So handsome.

487
00:29:49,612 --> 00:29:50,931
My weapons.

488
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:53,772
Rouya, boil some water.

489
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:55,372
- My weapons.
- She may get thirsty.

490
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,331
My weapons.

491
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,852
General Mofang, I'm afraid

492
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,532
that was inappropriate.

493
00:30:29,532 --> 00:30:30,612
Why would you say that?

494
00:30:31,856 --> 00:30:32,931
Her Lordship is a woman.

495
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:34,736
You two

496
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:36,852
stayed out overnight.

497
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:39,171
It's inappropriate.

498
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:41,811
The Immortals
don't follow superficial rules.

499
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:44,732
We've been through
life and death over the years

500
00:30:44,732 --> 00:30:45,972
on the battlefield.

501
00:30:47,091 --> 00:30:48,451
How's it inappropriate for me

502
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,096
to carry her home?

503
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:52,532
But what you said might

504
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,892
lead others to overthink.

505
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:01,252
How come I didn't realize

506
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:04,632
that you could be so eloquent?

507
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:05,892
Don't tarnish her reputation

508
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:07,612
with your speculations.

509
00:31:08,612 --> 00:31:10,431
Now that you've restored the seals

510
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:12,051
and have no other business here,

511
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:15,772
isn't it time to return
to the Extranatural Heaven?

512
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:19,504
Who says I have no other business?

513
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:22,652
Your Excellency must be swamped

514
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:23,672
by countless affairs.

515
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:25,372
You shouldn't stay at the Immortal Realm

516
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:27,772
or Lord Bicang's Mansion.

517
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,171
Be it the Immortal Realm

518
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:32,331
or Lord Bicang's Mansion,

519
00:31:33,931 --> 00:31:35,532
you're not in the position

520
00:31:36,091 --> 00:31:37,112
to call the shots.

521
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:38,252
I'm in a better position

522
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:40,171
than you, at least.

523
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:58,112
Your Excellency, General Mofang.

524
00:31:58,112 --> 00:31:59,732
What are you talking about?

525
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:00,752
Nothing much.

526
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,291
About who's in charge

527
00:32:03,184 --> 00:32:04,240
of the Three Realms.

528
00:32:04,852 --> 00:32:06,411
You're in charge, of course.

529
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:45,136
(Lord Bicang's Mansion)

530
00:33:22,612 --> 00:33:24,972
All my weapons are here.

531
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:35,408
My glazed hammer.

532
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,612
Nice bag.

533
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:46,091
You're awake. Here's the hangover soup.

534
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:48,752
The Qiankun Bag

535
00:33:49,451 --> 00:33:50,612
is filled with my weapons.

536
00:33:55,411 --> 00:33:57,051
All your weapons are here.

537
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:59,112
Maybe Furong had a change of heart

538
00:33:59,112 --> 00:34:00,691
and returned everything.

539
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,928
No way.

540
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:09,552
Where is Lord Xingzhi?

541
00:34:09,552 --> 00:34:10,572
He went out.

542
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:12,772
Where to?

543
00:34:12,772 --> 00:34:15,052
To walk around and get snacks.

544
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:17,432
Did he really come here

545
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:18,931
just for fun?

546
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:23,651
Right, Your Lordship.

547
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:25,391
I went to see Her Holiness this morning.

548
00:34:25,391 --> 00:34:26,392
She said that

549
00:34:26,392 --> 00:34:28,052
you could find her if you couldn't

550
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:29,136
accept Furong.

551
00:34:31,088 --> 00:34:32,112
Find who?

552
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:33,456
Her Holiness.

553
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:37,012
I can deal with Lord Furong myself.

554
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:38,851
Don't disturb her.

555
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,812
Don't complain to her again.

556
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:43,632
Fine.

557
00:34:49,211 --> 00:34:51,172
All my weapons are here.

558
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,212
I'm Furong, the 33rd descendant
of the Heavenly Lord

559
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:55,931
and the future husband of ShenLi.

560
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:59,192
Why can't I eat and take your things?

561
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:01,511
There's no such thing
as a free lunch in our realm.

562
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:02,551
- Exactly.
- Pay up.

563
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:04,092
- Pay up.
- Pay up.

564
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:05,451
- Listen.
- Pay up.

565
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,372
You'd better listen to me.

566
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:09,012
Hurt me and see what happens.

567
00:35:10,131 --> 00:35:11,451
And he's threatening us.

568
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:13,411
- Pay up.
- Pay up.

569
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:14,572
- Hurry.
- Pay up.

570
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:15,696
- Wait.
- Pay up.

571
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,772
General Mofang.

572
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,651
How much is it? I'll pay.

573
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:26,012
General Mofang.

574
00:35:26,012 --> 00:35:27,572
This little rascal is Lord Furong?

575
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:29,840
He...

576
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:33,851
Bad luck. Forget about the money.

577
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,172
Forget about it.

578
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:37,691
Forget about it.

579
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:39,211
Wait, let's settle accounts.

580
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:41,552
Take the money.

581
00:35:42,131 --> 00:35:43,572
Her Lordship would do the same.

582
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:45,452
Thank you, General Mofang.

583
00:35:45,452 --> 00:35:46,972
- Thank you, General.
- Sorry for the trouble.

584
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,912
Thank you.

585
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:51,532
W-Why are you dragging me?

586
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:54,411
Stop pulling me. What do you want?

587
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:55,452
I don't need your help.

588
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:56,464
I'm not helping you.

589
00:35:57,052 --> 00:35:58,172
But you're a Diviner.

590
00:35:58,172 --> 00:35:59,432
Her Lordship will be implicated

591
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:00,492
if you die here.

592
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:02,931
How dare you jinx me?

593
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:05,492
You're just a Deputy General.

594
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:06,891
How dare you disrespect me?

595
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:34,211
Petty tricks.

596
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:45,712
Come on.

597
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,672
Come on, cheers.

598
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:53,136
You're not drinking.

599
00:36:53,136 --> 00:36:55,011
Dig in. Don't be shy.

600
00:36:55,011 --> 00:36:56,451
- Rest assured, General.
- Dig in.

601
00:36:56,451 --> 00:36:57,531
Alright.

602
00:36:57,531 --> 00:36:58,576
You're late!

603
00:36:58,576 --> 00:37:00,232
Madam, please, take a seat.

604
00:37:00,232 --> 00:37:01,611
You're too kind.

605
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:03,552
- Two ice pops, please.
- Alright.

606
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:04,672
Come on.

607
00:37:04,672 --> 00:37:05,776
Cheers.

608
00:37:06,448 --> 00:37:07,504
Ice pops.

609
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:09,332
- Hurry up.
- Wait.

610
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:10,416
Let me help you.

611
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,012
You really enjoy

612
00:37:26,012 --> 00:37:27,451
ice pops at the market.

613
00:37:28,976 --> 00:37:30,064
It's lively here.

614
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:32,012
Your Lordship. Your Excellency.

615
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:33,212
Come and join us.

616
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:34,772
No, thanks.

617
00:37:34,772 --> 00:37:36,052
Never mind. Let's go.

618
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:39,732
You got them back?

619
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:43,312
It was nothing.

620
00:37:45,492 --> 00:37:48,332
Alright, I'll treat you
to these ice pops.

621
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:50,371
Have as many as you like.

622
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:52,092
I hate being in debt.

623
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:54,732
So many treasures.

624
00:37:55,252 --> 00:37:57,352
All for just a few ice pops?

625
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:58,416
Your Lordship.

626
00:37:59,052 --> 00:38:01,131
That's how you repay me?

627
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,092
What do you want?

628
00:38:05,092 --> 00:38:07,052
Sit down and talk to me.

629
00:38:13,012 --> 00:38:14,532
You and General Mofang

630
00:38:15,252 --> 00:38:16,252
drank all night

631
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,092
and stayed out.

632
00:38:18,812 --> 00:38:21,131
I just want to talk to you for a while.

633
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:23,568
And you're so reluctant.

634
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:32,611
I don't feel appreciated.

635
00:38:33,292 --> 00:38:34,851
All those treasures I reclaimed

636
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,972
