00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:39,216
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:50,410
Gu Chengjin, look at my clothes...

4
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,131
She is the one
Gu Chengjin loves the most.

5
00:04:45,811 --> 00:04:49,050
She is the one
Gu Chengjin loves the most.

6
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,819
Who are you?

7
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:57,370
She is the one to end your life.

8
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,571
Let me show you the truth.

9
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,411
Tea must be served with something sweet.

10
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,059
Xingyun.

11
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,971
How can this be, Master?

12
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,650
You shouldn't have gone to this place.

13
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,650
You shouldn't be like this either.

14
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:38,731
Haven't I told you

15
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:40,930
not to come out at night?
Why didn't you listen to me?

16
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,650
Stop blowing. Or else I will go blind.

17
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,610
I am dispelling your nightmares, right?

18
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:16,330
Let's leave this fierce formation.

19
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,370
It's really so powerful.

20
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,490
Why are you alright?

21
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:34,011
Is it because you are
the one who set it up

22
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,450
and you would not be affected?

23
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,591
It's just a formation.

24
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:41,690
How can it tell people apart?

25
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,731
It's just that I have no fear,

26
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,810
so it can do nothing to me.

27
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,291
(No fear.)

28
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,031
(Doesn't it also mean)

29
00:08:58,031 --> 00:08:59,770
(he cares about nothing?)

30
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,051
(Xingyun is really too indifferent,)

31
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,570
(but he somehow makes one feel at ease.)

32
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:09,411
What about them?

33
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,770
After dawn, throw them out of the yard.

34
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,330
The formation power has been weakened.

35
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:36,731
Everything in this courtyard

36
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,651
is a part of the formation.

37
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:39,830
Once any part is damaged,

38
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,330
it will affect the power
of the formation.

39
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,570
They even burn their own people.

40
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,291
Human life in their eyes

41
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,130
is too insignificant.

42
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,731
It was my oversight.

43
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,770
I've implicated all my neighbors.

44
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,210
Do you feel guilty?
I'll help you one last time.

45
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:31,715
(Palace, Immortal Realm)

46
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,424
(Shen Muyue, Her Holiness
of Immortal Realm)

47
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,955
Someone!

48
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,810
ShenLi has used a spell

49
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,250
in the Eastern Plains
of the lower realm.

50
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,570
Go look for her.

51
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,851
I don't want to kill people today.
All of you, get out.

52
00:10:57,611 --> 00:10:59,111
Master Fu Sheng,

53
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:00,291
be careful.

54
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,531
This demon

55
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:02,690
is very powerful.

56
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,810
You demon.

57
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,010
Who are you?

58
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,210
I'm the Demon Lord of Chaos.

59
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:38,371
You're a lady.
Don't look. It's too dirty.

60
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,835
Let's leave.

61
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,210
Let's go. I'll take you
to the Jinyue Mansion.

62
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,363
Let's go.

63
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:49,611
Your spells really come in handy.

64
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:52,931
But what are we doing in this garden?

65
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:54,111
You think I wanted to come?

66
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:56,051
Isn't it because I couldn't find
Gu Chengjin's bedroom?

67
00:12:57,531 --> 00:12:58,851
We have to search for it by ourselves?

68
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,171
Haven't you noticed
something strange about this place?

69
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,650
Strange? What's strange about it?

70
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:37,931
I didn't notice it during the day.

71
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:42,010
So many undeveloped demons
are kept here.

72
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:50,371
I think everything is fine here.

73
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,291
ShenLi, don't worry too much.

74
00:13:58,491 --> 00:13:59,650
It's not that I am overthinking.

75
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,650
You can't see it, so you don't know.

76
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:33,667
What should I know?

77
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,027
Look.

78
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:40,371
Nothing would hurt me, right?

79
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,891
(He...)

80
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:50,723
Let's go.

81
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,450
If you are afraid,

82
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,099
I'll just hold your hand.

Got it.

105
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:10,971
- Got it?
- Got it.

106
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,899
(What's with this answer?
It's so perfunctory.)

107
00:17:17,851 --> 00:17:19,450
(And his smile.)

108
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,491
(What kind of smile is that?)

109
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,491
(Even worse than a sneer.)

110
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,571
What are you looking at?

111
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,810
I sense something strange.

112
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,771
(It's coming from the southeast.)

113
00:18:07,731 --> 00:18:10,410
(It's not like from the pursuers
from the Immortal Realm.)

114
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,899
(Oh, no.)

115
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:54,723
Help me!

116
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,387
The demons are out of control.

117
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,290
Their attempt to tame demons failed.

118
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:08,251
Go find Gu Chengjin now.

119
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,611
S-ShenLi, wait for me.

120
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,211
Help me!

121
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,635
Help me!

122
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,395
Help me!

123
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,955
You stay...

124
00:19:57,491 --> 00:19:59,410
Don't leave me later.

125
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:02,231
You're holding my hand so tightly.

126
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:03,611
I can't even shake it off.

127
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,771
Gu Chengjin,

128
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,530
why did you lie to me?

129
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,403
Gu Chengjin,

130
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,643
you won't survive.

131
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:26,810
She won't survive either.

132
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,251
He.

133
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,035
Want to stop me?

134
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,851
You all must die.

135
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:48,771
He.

136
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,371
I prefer it when you blush and feel shy.

137
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,643
Don't force me to take action.

138
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,235
He.

139
00:21:15,891 --> 00:21:17,155
Don't hurt her!

140
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:30,210
Don't hurt me?

141
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,451
Gu Chengjin,

142
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,011
are you merciful or cruel?

143
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,739
If that's the case,

144
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:55,170
you all go to die!

145
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,707
He.

146
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,371
- Help me!
- Help me!

147
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:18,787
Help me!

148
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,971
The building seems to have collapsed.

149
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:53,611
This place is underground,
so it wasn't affected.

150
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,330
But there's only one way out.

151
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:56,971
This place is airtight.

152
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,915
No need for her to lift a finger.

153
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:00,810
You will all suffocate to death.

154
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:02,979
You have a way.

155
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,091
Stay with her forever.

156
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,731
And I will destroy your entire mansion!

157
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,251
- He.
- Don't go.

158
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:22,690
What are you doing?

159
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,771
Didn't you ask me to hold you?

160
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:25,891
You're blaming that on me?

161
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:40,851
I'll take you two
who can move out first,

162
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:43,091
and then, I will carry this lady away.

163
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:44,170
- No.
- No.

164
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,291
This is a Spirit Binding Formation.

165
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,131
If she leaves it, this lady will die.

166
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,131
Gu Chengjin, what's going on?

167
00:24:06,851 --> 00:24:07,891
This is my wife.

168
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,611
3 years ago,

169
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:16,290
she and I were ambushed
during an outing.

170
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,011
Shi.

171
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:29,283
To protect me,

172
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:31,371
she was struck by several arrows,

173
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:33,987
nearly losing her life.

174
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:39,891
I brought her back and settled her here,

175
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,779
waiting for her to open her eyes.

176
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,899
You were just waiting?

177
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,410
What's with those demons
in the courtyard?

178
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,011
And why is He out of control?

179
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,450
When I brought her back,

180
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:11,290
everyone said she was dead

181
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,411
and told me to accept it.

182
00:26:15,771 --> 00:26:17,570
But I knew.

183
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,731
How could a lady

184
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,131
like Ye Shi die so easily?

185
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:27,290
I searched through all immortal spells.

186
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,810
Eventually, I found a way

187
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,611
that could awaken her,
but it requires two things.

188
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,330
One is Spirit Binding Formation.

189
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:39,971
The other is a demon

190
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,611
for trading lives.

191
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:49,971
You failed to protect your wife,

192
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,891
causing her to die three years ago.

193
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,810
You can't accept the reality

194
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,651
and even think you can revive her.

195
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,971
You got this spell
that goes against natural laws

196
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:05,091
and raised demons for trading lives.

197
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,731
You are so self-righteous.

198
00:27:08,491 --> 00:27:09,955
So what?

199
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:11,930
As long as Shi can wake up,

200
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:16,091
I will do anything.

201
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:20,035
Please help us.

202
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:25,251
If not for you...

203
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,131
Never mind. What about He?

204
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,131
Why has she turned into what she is now?

205
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,170
I come here to see my wife every night.

206
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:47,651
I don't know why

207
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,810
she suddenly burst in today.

208
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,091
She harbored resentment
after she found out about this matter.

209
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,170
Of course, she would.

210
00:27:58,611 --> 00:27:59,690
Demons are naturally stubborn.

211
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:02,050
She sees you as the most important one,

212
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,210
but you want her life.

213
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:09,091
If she does not hate you,
she'll be a fool.

214
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:15,971
(Even He likes
Gu Chengjin, and so what?)

215
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,450
(This person only cares about)

216
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,371
(his wife.)

217
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,891
I don't care what your plan was.

218
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,290
You are powerless
over today's situation,

219
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,971
so I will do it in my own way.

220
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:45,170
After I find He,

221
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,530
if she can't stop wrongdoing,

222
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,083
I will kill her.

223
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:53,411
You just need to remember
the one who'll kill her

224
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:54,431
is me,

225
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:55,570
ShenLi.

226
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,690
It has nothing to do with others.

227
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,930
This place has been blocked off.

228
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,210
We should get out.

229
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,591
Let's go to the courtyard

230
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:10,611
and set up a formation, okay?

231
00:29:11,131 --> 00:29:12,419
Okay.

232
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,155
Hurry up.

233
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:44,003
Help!

234
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,163
- Go.
- Hurry up.

235
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,651
While the morning sun is rising,

236
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:53,651
you set up a formation first
to contain these demons.

237
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:55,791
These living people

238
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:57,851
can take this opportunity to leave.

239
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:01,131
Setting up a formation
is not as easy as you think.

240
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,170
Besides, I'm not familiar with
the layout here.

241
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,350
I really can't do that.

242
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,671
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

243
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,331
I'd have come out to look for He alone.

244
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:11,410
I wouldn't have brought you along.

245
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,731
Just now, down there,

246
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,031
I didn't catch what you said.

247
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:15,771
Why did you nod then?

248
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,891
You're such a troublemaker.

249
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:25,691
In a military camp,

250
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,210
someone like you
would've been taken away for a whipping.

251
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,163
What does that mean?

252
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,467
Understood.

253
00:30:35,731 --> 00:30:37,851
(I planned to leave
after taking Xingyun here.)

254
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,011
(It has taken me so long.)

255
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,631
(Every moment I stay here)

256
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:43,891
(brings more danger.)

257
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,288
(Once pursuers from Immortal Realm come)

258
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,570
(and we start fighting,)

259
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,251
(not just a few houses would collapse.)

260
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:58,251
- Your Lordship.
- Mofang.

261
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,130
The aura on this spear
can keep those demons

262
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,410
from approaching you.

263
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,179
Take it for now.

264
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,611
I'm going to talk with him. Stay here.

265
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:25,450
Stand up. Thank you
for helping me escape earlier.

266
00:31:26,371 --> 00:31:28,951
I deserve punishment
for injuring you earlier.

267
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:30,771
That's what I should thank you for.

268
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:32,491
Otherwise, I'd have been caught.

269
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,751
Once my marriage is canceled,

270
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:37,131
I will repay you well
in the Immortal Realm.

271
00:31:38,091 --> 00:31:40,251
It's my duty.

272
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,311
Don't mention it.

273
00:31:41,311 --> 00:31:43,410
Stand up. I'm really annoyed
by your formalities.

274
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,771
Right, Your Lordship, did you use
your spiritual power earlier?

275
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:53,810
I was noticed.

276
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,611
Her Holiness has sent people.

277
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:58,690
Leave now, or you can't leave later.

278
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,210
I still can't leave today.

279
00:32:04,771 --> 00:32:06,810
There are things here
I haven't dealt with yet.

280
00:32:07,371 --> 00:32:08,491
I'm not urging you,

281
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:10,930
but the situation is urgent.

282
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,810
Her Holiness
probably won't give you much time.

283
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:15,971
At that time...

284
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:45,131
I know it clearly.

285
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,731
But I can't leave this place yet.

286
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:50,947
Why?

287
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:56,450
These days in the Mortal Realm,

288
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:04,930
I have fallen for someone.

289
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,251
Are you referring to that useless man?

290
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:20,930
Before meeting him,

291
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,011
I didn't expect it.

292
00:33:22,891 --> 00:33:24,195
He is different from us.

293
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:27,450
He's vulnerable.

294
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,251
I must confirm his safe settlement
before leaving.

295
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,747
But he is a mortal.

296
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,211
I know.

297
00:33:38,771 --> 00:33:40,570
Their lifespans are extremely short,

298
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,091
and they can't carry the memories
of current life into the next life.

299
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:46,891
I am aware that there is no possibility
between him and me in this lifetime.

300
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,530
So all I wish for is his well-being.

301
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,651
Your Lordship, are you serious?

302
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,651
Yes.

303
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:03,451
I didn't want to involve you,

304
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:04,971
but no one is here to assist me.

305
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,431
What are your orders?

306
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:12,210
Help me delay the people from Immortal
Realm for another half day.

307
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:15,530
I will deal with things here
as soon as possible.

308
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:18,091
- Yes.
- Thank you.

309
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,931
Master Shen, why did he leave?

310
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,970
Your spear is quite powerful.

311
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,691
It's amazing for you to hold it

312
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,451
for such a long time.

313
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,131
My spear gives off such a killing aura.

314
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,250
Demons fear it.

315
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:30,910
You sickly fella

316
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,011
are indifferent.

317
00:35:32,011 --> 00:35:34,651
You may lack emotions
like fear or sorrow.

318
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:37,651
In some ways, you are a master too.

319
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,203
Are you really alright?

320
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,283
Yeah.

321
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,851
You were just talking
with an old friend.

322
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,530
And you finished it so soon.
Don't you want to chat more?

323
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,250
Why would I?

324
00:35:58,371 --> 00:35:59,891
I've spent more days
with him than with you.

325
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:12,691
The bubbles are still here.

326
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,570
He must not have gone far.

327
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:18,530
Where is she exactly?

328
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:22,551
If children

329
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:23,810
get beaten,

330
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,730
where else will they go
but go back home?

331
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,075
Lotus flowers in the lake.

332
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,611
If I didn't ask,
you wouldn't tell me, right?

333
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,530
Why would that be?

334
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,131
Because I think, with your intelligence,

335
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,290
you must have already found it out.

336
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,507
No need for reminding you.

337
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,530
(Since the moment we entered,)

338
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,851
(it seems)

339
00:36:55,451 --> 00:36:56,970
(he has been intentionally
hindering me,)

340
00:36:57,891 --> 00:37:02,010
(as if he doesn't want
me to finish my things.)

341
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,330
(How would delaying me benefit him?)

342
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,771
What are you doing?

343
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,259
Just now,

344
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,651
I damaged your hairpin.

345
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:17,987
I'll give you a new one.

346
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,355
This is a sleeve arrow.

347
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,787
And it's poisoned.

348
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,691
Why do you want to give me this?

349
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:27,811
What are you implying?

350
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,531
Maybe.

351
00:37:31,411 --> 00:37:32,730
Sturdy,

352
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,891
sharp,

353
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:35,107
and lethal.

354
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,931
But it dazzles brilliantly.

355
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,130
You send me this poisoned sleeve arrow.

356
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,635
You did it so casually.

357
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,091
I am hard and sharp.

358
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,010
But you're the lethal one, aren't you?

359
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,587
I suppose so.

360
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:28,899
Come out.

361
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,555
If that's the case,

362
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,947
I have to do it.

363
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:41,371
Master Shen.

364
00:38:41,371 --> 00:38:42,435
What are you doing?

365
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,250
Master Shen, I mean nothing.

366
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:49,331
I just saw

367
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:51,371
you were going to kill her

368
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,810
after just calling her once.

369
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,290
Moreover, she is innocent
in this whole matter.

370
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,071
With a wave of your hand,

371
00:38:58,071 --> 00:38:59,311
her life would be gone.

372
00:38:59,311 --> 00:39:01,371
I fear you might regret it later.

373
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,290
- You've suddenly become compassionate.
- No.

374
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:06,371
I just want to resolve this matter now.

375
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,091
If she doesn't cooperate,

376
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:10,530
I'll take the most direct approach.

377
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:15,931
I'm not tender-hearted.

378
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,810
For my purpose,

379
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,411
I can be ruthless temporarily.

380
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:22,499
Step aside.

381
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:26,275
Do as you will.

382
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,051
Come out.

383
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:33,923
If you don't come out, I will...

384
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:38,750
Why are you forcing me?

385
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,891
Why do you help him?

386
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,891
- Let go of me.
- Admit your mistake.

387
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:50,050
- I was not wrong.
- Admit it.

388
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,170
What did I do wrong?

389
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,611
Gu Chengjin is the one at fault.

390
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:54,331
You involved the innocent.
Aren't you wrong?

391
00:39:54,331 --> 00:39:56,231
Gu Chengjin let me down.

392
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,511
He deserves to die.

393
00:39:57,511 --> 00:39:59,611
- Everyone related to him should die.
- Still being tough.

394
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,650
- God is unkind.
- Admit your mistake.

395
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,850
- I was not wrong.
- Are you wrong?

396
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,530
- Let go of me.
- Admit your mistake.

397
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,570
I was wrong. Stop hitting me.

398
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:11,231
I was wrong.

399
00:40:11,231 --> 00:40:12,691
What did you do wrong? Say it yourself.

400
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:14,451
I was wrong.

401
00:40:15,091 --> 00:40:17,131
I should not have harmed the innocent.

402
00:40:17,931 --> 00:40:20,171
I should not have hurt others.

403
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,891
I was wrong.

404
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:23,931
I was wrong.

405
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,810
Turns out that even demons
are afraid of being hit.

406
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,110
This method

407
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:01,211
seems simple but is very effective.

408
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:03,931
You inspired me.

409
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:06,611
She's just like a child.

410
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:08,611
When wronged, she thinks of revenge.

411
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,851
But she didn't intend to kill him.

412
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,331
She went to hide at home when hurt.

413
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:14,970
Without all these demons in the yard,

414
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,971
perhaps she
couldn't have broken even a brick

415
00:41:17,971 --> 00:41:19,171
before hiding herself away.

416
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,510
Such a demon

417
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,851
deserved a beating.

418
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,770
If she didn't come out, I'd kill her

419
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,715
to avoid further issues.
