=The Legend of ShenLi=

00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:39,088
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:02,912
You are a fierce one, Cluck Cluck.

4
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,272
Why did you throw me into the water?

5
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,480
Look at you.

6
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,400
You're as dirty as this fresh ginseng.

7
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:11,024
- I...
- And I

8
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,872
have to give you a good scrub.

9
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:17,352
Or would you prefer
to frolic in that pond?

10
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:20,791
That's not necessary.

11
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:24,720
It's too crowded.

12
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:27,568
What are you doing?

13
00:02:29,672 --> 00:02:31,951
It won't sell for
a good price if it's ruined.

14
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,552
You sell this kind of ginseng?

15
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,712
What else could it be?

16
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:53,512
What are you doing?

17
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:54,791
Which kind did you think?

18
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:57,312
I don't know what you're talking about.

19
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:05,872
Itchy.

20
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:11,344
(He's quite handsome.)

21
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,431
Why are you getting so close?

22
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,208
(Why is he smiling?)

23
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,312
(Did I peck him silly?)

24
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:27,471
Nice one.

25
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,312
You are a strange one.

26
00:03:29,312 --> 00:03:30,320
Cluck Cluck.

27
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,584
Childish.

28
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:41,952
(I should settle down here for now.)

29
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,312
(This yard can help me recover faster.)

30
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:48,912
(It's been just a couple of days,)

31
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:52,711
(and the injuries Mofang gave me
have almost healed.)

32
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:57,271
(I won't have to worry
about being caught here.)

33
00:03:59,152 --> 00:04:01,232
(I don't know
when I will fully recover,)

34
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:03,952
(but one day in heaven
equals a year on earth.)

35
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,152
(I have a lot of time here.)

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,736
Why are you staring at me?

37
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,512
Go wash your ginseng, mortal.

38
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:01,232
Cluck Cluck.

39
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:03,568
Time to eat.

40
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,032
No meat again?

41
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,191
Don't like it?

42
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,791
I can't eat it every day
even if I do like it.

43
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,831
I want meat.

44
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:23,760
I have no money.

45
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,631
Not even occasionally?

46
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:28,472
You don't look rich,

47
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:30,952
but you can't be that poor.

48
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,752
I have no money.

49
00:05:33,872 --> 00:05:36,472
Although I might look
like an upper-class.

50
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:41,672
What about those wild ginsengs you sell?

51
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:44,191
Those are not wild ginseng.

52
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:48,551
Just ordinary southern ginseng.

53
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:51,391
You can make some money
from them as well.

54
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,452
I can't sell them.

55
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:57,352
I need to exchange them
for lifesaving medicine at the pharmacy.

56
00:06:05,152 --> 00:06:08,032
(This sickly fella
looks rather pitiful.)

57
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,792
(He has shown me kindness.)

58
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:26,192
(I know I ought to repay him.)

59
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:28,032
(But I hold a military position.)

60
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:29,840
(I am good at battling,)

61
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,632
(not treating the sick.)

62
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:33,831
(Since I can't cure him,)

63
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:37,192
(I can let him live better
in his remaining years.)

64
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,864
(Off you go.)

65
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,064
(It still doesn't work.)

66
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,912
(After so many days,
my internal energy is still weak.)

67
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:53,391
(I can't even perform
a simple alchemy spell.)

68
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:00,464
(I'll try again.)

69
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,744
(It worked!)

70
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:29,172
Gold.

71
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:38,472
The effect lasts too short a time.
I'm so pissed.

72
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,711
Gold.

73
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:47,831
Darn rock!

74
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:56,352
Ouch.

75
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:25,111
I'll get some meat tomorrow.

76
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:44,551
No basket or the hoe.
Aren't you going to sell ginseng?

77
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:48,848
It's still being dried.
I'm going to the market.

78
00:08:49,352 --> 00:08:51,792
Cluck Cluck, stay home
and watch the house.

79
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:54,064
Wait.

80
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:58,032
(Since the essence of
the moon is of no use,)

81
00:08:58,032 --> 00:08:59,551
(I'll try the essence of the sun.)

82
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:02,072
(If the alchemy is successful,)

83
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:03,472
(I can buy some nice things.)

84
00:09:07,536 --> 00:09:08,572
I'll go too.

85
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:10,872
How can you go out with me like this?

86
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,231
There are so many people in the market,

87
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:18,231
if we get separated, you might
end up as chicken soup.

88
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,391
You...

89
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:23,472
How about I tie a rope around your neck?

90
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:24,831
Sounds good?

91
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,336
How dare you! I'm being kind
accompanying you.

92
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:36,032
Out of gratitude, you should hold me.

93
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:40,431
Hold me, come on.

94
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:46,864
That's right.

95
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:53,592
Be careful, be steady.

96
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:57,792
Don't worry, as you wish.

97
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:07,191
Alright, come again next time.

98
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,871
- Fruit for sale!
- Meat for sale!

99
00:10:10,672 --> 00:10:12,032
- Meat!
- Fresh fruit!

100
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:14,751
Take a look, miss.

101
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:15,951
Freshly slaughtered pig.

102
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:18,511
Fresh fruits.

103
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,311
Alright, come again next time.

104
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,592
Sir, would you like some meat?

105
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:27,352
Fresh pork, just slaughtered today.

106
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,751
Just a little short on money.

107
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,631
- Well.
- Come next time.

108
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:35,472
Get another rock for me.

109
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:38,831
Stop poking rocks. I won't starve you.

110
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:42,912
The green mountains
and waters are evergreen.

111
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:46,672
For ten copper coins,
you can know your future. Sir.

112
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:48,240
Meat.

113
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,792
(Fortune-teller)
Not you, pauper.

114
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:55,071
This stout gentleman

115
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,592
has a look of great fortune.

116
00:10:56,592 --> 00:11:00,631
Come quickly.

117
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:05,592
For ten copper coins,
I'll read your fortunes.

118
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:08,391
Okay.

119
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:09,432
Meat.

120
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:11,592
What would you like to ask?

121
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:12,992
The imperial examination.

122
00:11:12,992 --> 00:11:14,096
The imperial examination?

123
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:19,751
You have been studying
hard these years, sir.

124
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:21,352
But never made the top rank, right?

125
00:11:22,871 --> 00:11:28,592
A great taboo that is. At the time of your
wedding, your name shall be on the rank.

126
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:33,472
The ancients say to establish a family
and then a career. You've got it wrong.

127
00:11:34,992 --> 00:11:38,352
This is a serious taboo.
You should marry first.

128
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:49,152
Fresh fruits.

129
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,408
(Fortune-teller)

130
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,696
A fragrant smell.
You'll meet your lady today.

131
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,792
Sir, ten more coins

132
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:00,672
and I'll tell you where she is.

133
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:01,744
Okay.

134
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:07,472
Sir, there may be a fire
at your home around noon.

135
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:11,112
If you don't go home now,

136
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:13,912
you may greatly regret it in the future.

137
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,831
Who do you think you are?

138
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,511
A competitor? Trying to poach?

139
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,071
Don't you have principles?

140
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:23,760
(Hemp-robed fortune-teller)
Get out of here.

141
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:26,112
Sir, don't listen to his nonsense.

142
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,032
He's talking your fortune away.

143
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:29,296
Let me give you a proper reading.

144
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:33,592
Sir, if you don't believe me,
just go home and see for yourself.

145
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:37,751
I'll still be here waiting
for you this afternoon.

146
00:12:38,472 --> 00:12:40,631
Nonsense. He's spouting nonsense.

147
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:43,152
Let me... Sir?

148
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,896
Setting a trap?

149
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:52,592
I don't know him.

150
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:58,871
Sir!

151
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:00,912
You lied.

152
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:02,391
This concerns the money for meat.

153
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,432
Pick more fruits, miss.

154
00:13:05,648 --> 00:13:06,768
Come, have a look.

155
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:10,592
Nuisance!

156
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:11,951
Do you know the rules at all?

157
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:14,352
- I don't.
- Then why did you spout nonsense?

158
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:15,888
I'm telling the truth.

159
00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:18,676
If you don't believe me,

160
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:24,071
wait here with me this afternoon.

161
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,328
If I'm proven right,

162
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,352
you must give me ten coins.
How about it?

163
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:34,152
I never gamble.

164
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:47,472
Look at you, I'm not convinced.
I'll bet with you.

165
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,271
If I lose, I'll give you
ten copper coins.

166
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,432
If you lose, give me that chicken, deal?

167
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:52,432
Looking for trouble?

168
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:56,871
Calm down, no one can
touch you with me here.

169
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:05,672
(I feel like being protected
by such a weak mortal.)

170
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,952
(Amazing.)

171
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,472
Stop scratching.

172
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:22,552
When heaven and earth were created,
there were three realms.

173
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:27,751
The lower realm is the human world,
and the upper realm is heaven.

174
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,951
The heavens originally had beasts.

175
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:36,191
The beasts absorbed the spiritual energy
of heaven and earth and practiced techniques.

176
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:39,592
They transformed into human form
and called themselves the Immortal.

177
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:45,311
Above the heavens is the abode of
the ancient gods, the Extranatural Heaven.

178
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:49,912
The ancient gods are powerful,
each with their own duties.

179
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:53,271
(The Liu Family Troupe, puppet show)
Some control time or create beings.

180
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:58,751
After humanity was created, they
learned the techniques of the five elements,

181
00:14:58,751 --> 00:15:02,352
ascended to the heavens and
called themselves the Divine.

182
00:15:03,432 --> 00:15:06,416
More and more of them
came to the heavens,

183
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:10,112
and there were constant disputes
between the Divine and the Immortal.

184
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:16,112
After millions of years of conflict,
the two sides finally drafted an agreement.

185
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:19,172
(The Liu Family Troupe)
They settled in two different parts of the heavens,

186
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:21,152
known as the Divine Realm
and the Immortal Realm.

187
00:15:50,472 --> 00:15:54,432
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

188
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:01,391
Look, it's already noon, isn't it?

189
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:04,992
During my life,

190
00:16:04,992 --> 00:16:07,440
I've never seen someone predict
a few hours into the future.

191
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:09,751
How can you put on such an act?

192
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:11,831
Come on, give me the chicken.

193
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:15,071
Today, I'll teach you a good lesson.

194
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:16,752
Why should I give it to you?

195
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:20,311
Look, he's coming.

196
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:25,871
My savior!

197
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:29,711
If it hadn't been for you
telling me to hurry home,

198
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:34,751
my mother would have burned
to death in the firewood room.

199
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:36,631
If you don't mind,

200
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:38,792
please accept these two pieces of meat.

201
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:42,544
Then I will take it.

202
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,328
(A deity in the human world)

203
00:17:05,751 --> 00:17:09,871
Study hard this year, and you will
succeed in the exams next year.

204
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:11,824
Thank you.

205
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,056
Master.

206
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:19,552
I apologize for my offense earlier.

207
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,032
I failed to recognize a true master.

208
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:25,311
Could you bestow upon me a divination?

209
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:32,352
Fine. As for you,

210
00:17:34,432 --> 00:17:40,112
blood will be shed today.

211
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:45,992
Goodbye.

212
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:08,912
The fortune-teller Wang didn't make
any money and even lost ten coins.

213
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:12,368
He had his face smashed by his wife.

214
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:13,616
Blood truly was shed.

215
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,216
Is that so?

216
00:18:16,472 --> 00:18:17,511
You really know divination?

217
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,271
A bit of it.

218
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,844
Who taught you?

219
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:24,464
I was born with it.

220
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:28,391
Revealing the future
can bring divine retribution.

221
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:32,711
I know. That's why
I take medicine every day.

222
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,152
Nature governs all
with gains and losses.

223
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:40,792
All things are always balanced.

224
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:45,152
(A mere mortal can fathom
the secrets of heaven)

225
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:47,432
(and also see them so clearly.)

226
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:52,231
(The backlashes on his body
must be tremendous.)

227
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,792
(No wonder his life seems short.)

228
00:18:56,391 --> 00:18:59,432
(Yet he's managed to live till now,
defying the heaven's rule.)

229
00:19:00,912 --> 00:19:03,792
(This sickly fella is
no ordinary person.)

230
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:09,271
Since you have this gift,

231
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,432
why not make a living by divination?

232
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:14,192
For a diviner with real skills like you,

233
00:19:15,231 --> 00:19:16,912
divining for officials and the wealthy,

234
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:18,991
even if only once a year,

235
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,471
could make your life ten times
better than it is now.

236
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:26,271
Divination is not a good skill.

237
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,312
It harms others and oneself.

238
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:30,511
I live well enough without it.

239
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:37,391
Xingyun, does the food
you prepare every day

240
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:39,751
contain ingredients
that replenish vitality?

241
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:42,991
Let me examine it.

242
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:47,552
Do you think I can afford such things?

243
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:55,552
(Indeed, he can't even afford meat.)

244
00:19:56,552 --> 00:19:59,152
(How could he add
replenishments to the buns?)

245
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:04,231
(But I do recover much
faster in this house.)

246
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:09,032
(My internal energy has also
stabilized over these days.)

247
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:13,231
(I can perhaps regain
my human form soon.)

248
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:28,072
I'm coming.

249
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,488
Diviner.

250
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,471
Are you the diviner who can see the past

251
00:20:37,471 --> 00:20:38,672
and the future?

252
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,952
Is it you?

253
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:49,391
I might be who you're looking for.

254
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,111
- But...
- Yunniang.

255
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:57,424
- Please help me.
- Yunniang.

256
00:20:57,991 --> 00:20:59,391
- Stop this.
- Diviner.

257
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,391
Stop making a fuss.

258
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:03,432
Read my fortunes, please, Diviner.

259
00:21:03,432 --> 00:21:04,591
Help me.

260
00:21:04,591 --> 00:21:06,211
My husband has been enlisted
for fifteen years.

261
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:07,672
Where is he now?

262
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:08,752
Let's go home.

263
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:09,912
(A soldier's wife.)

264
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:11,511
Diviner.

265
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:13,072
- Let's go home.
- Please help me.

266
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,096
Stop it.

267
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:17,192
I beg you to help me.

268
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,192
- Go home with me.
- Diviner.

269
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:20,631
- Diviner.
- Yunniang.

270
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:23,032
- I beg you to help me, Diviner.
- I'm begging you.

271
00:21:25,391 --> 00:21:28,152
(Once the enemy is vanquished,
I will surely return soon.)

272
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,351
(Yunniang, wait for me.)

273
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:34,992
(I will wait for you.)

274
00:21:41,152 --> 00:21:44,871
(I will wait until you return safely.)

275
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:48,176
- Help me, Diviner.
- Yunniang.

276
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:49,511
- Help me.
- It's been so many years.

277
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:52,271
Let's not ask anymore.

278
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:53,271
I must ask.

279
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:55,152
No matter how long it's been,
he is my husband.

280
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:57,672
I will keep looking for him.

281
00:21:57,672 --> 00:22:00,192
There will be the day I find him.

282
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,712
Yunniang.

283
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,391
My son.

284
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:16,591
(If a soldier dies, his bones
may not even be found,)

285
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:21,631
(no matter how his family
looks for him.)

286
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:32,312
Diviner, I beg you.

287
00:22:32,832 --> 00:22:35,536
Please cast a divination for me.

288
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:36,991
Madam, please get up.

289
00:22:44,032 --> 00:22:47,912
I cannot cast this divination.

290
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:51,912
Please return.

291
00:23:11,672 --> 00:23:15,591
(Fellow villagers either
returned or died in battle.)

292
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:18,432
(But he disappeared.)

293
00:23:19,912 --> 00:23:24,231
(For fifteen years,
I could not find his traces)

294
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,552
(or ascertain his life or death.)

295
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:30,192
(The clothes mended
with nowhere to send.)

296
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:34,072
(The letters written
with no one to read.)

297
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:39,792
Give me hope, Diviner.

298
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:44,072
Please, all I want is hope.

299
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,192
Let's just go.

300
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,991
- Diviner.
- Let's go.

301
00:23:48,991 --> 00:23:50,032
Diviner.

302
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:56,391
Let's go home.

303
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,631
Help me.

304
00:23:57,631 --> 00:23:58,992
Let's go.

305
00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:00,351
You saw something, right?

306
00:24:01,152 --> 00:24:04,152
Why didn't you tell her
where her husband is?

307
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:05,712
I didn't see anything.

308
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,511
(He could save an old woman
for just a piece of meat.)

309
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:19,111
(He could also watch a soldier's wife
weep indifferently.)

310
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:22,152
(He really lives a carefree life.)

311
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:24,871
(And that aura about that woman...)

312
00:24:44,832 --> 00:24:46,032
(Her aura has grown stronger.)

313
00:25:01,552 --> 00:25:02,792
This chicken should work more.

314
00:25:30,832 --> 00:25:33,231
Yunniang.

315
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:38,271
It's time for my shift. I have to go.

316
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,312
If you need anything,
go find your sister-in-law.

317
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:46,832

Cluck Cluck, there's a curfew,
don't you know?

345
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:32,432
Why did you come?

346
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:35,471
Let's go. Come with me.

Cluck Cluck, come back.

350
00:29:44,072 --> 00:29:45,136
Stay away.

351
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:52,591
Why did you bump into me?

352
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,952
If I hadn't, you'd be dead.

353
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:57,471
Get up, dummy. Be careful!

354
00:30:08,792 --> 00:30:10,111
Can't you see him?

355
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:14,391
Him?

356
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:17,072
Forget it, you mortals
can't see anything.

357
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:18,712
Go back and sleep.

358
00:30:19,912 --> 00:30:22,152

359
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:24,832
I sensed a strange aura about her.

360
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,912
I followed the aura
and found this person,

361
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:30,871
or should I say, this divine being.

362
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:31,920
Divine being?

363
00:30:33,591 --> 00:30:35,751
He seems to be the missing husband
of the woman.

364
00:30:36,391 --> 00:30:38,792
But his aura is extraordinary.
He must be a divine being.

365
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,672
It must be because of
his loyalty and courage,

366
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:44,111
he ascended to the Divine after victory.

367
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:46,471
There have been such rumors before.

368
00:30:47,271 --> 00:30:48,912
But he has yet to go to the heavens.

369
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:51,712
He might be reluctant to leave his wife,

370
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,511
and therefore, stays by
her side in the form of spirit.

371
00:30:55,511 --> 00:30:57,192
He's been guarding her all this time.

372
00:30:58,672 --> 00:31:00,832
He probably doesn't know
how to use his powers,

373
00:31:00,832 --> 00:31:02,271
which is why his wife can't see him.

374
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,552
Oh no, you've angered him.

375
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:05,912
I can't revert to human form yet.

376
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:09,032
Then let me help you.

377
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:10,864
How?

378
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:12,511
Hold him off for a moment.

379
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:12,032
Cluck Cluck, all set, come down.

380
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:30,912
Sickly, take off your robe.

381
00:32:31,504 --> 00:32:32,592
Okay.

382
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:10,832
Come here.

383
00:33:10,832 --> 00:33:11,920
Where?

384
00:33:12,552 --> 00:33:13,552
He's behind you.

385
00:33:17,072 --> 00:33:18,096
Who?

386
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,976
Hurry up.

387
00:33:22,712 --> 00:33:23,792
Alright.

388
00:33:45,712 --> 00:33:46,768
Mind your behavior.

389
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:52,231
You are her husband, right?

390
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:56,792
Do you know she has been
searching and waiting for you?

391
00:33:59,432 --> 00:34:00,672
Do you want her to see you?

392
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,624
Is that possible?

393
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:14,231
Xingyun, can you?

394
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:15,631
Since I've already meddled,

395
00:34:16,312 --> 00:34:18,391
I might as well do it well.

396
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:21,552
Just don't regret it once it's done.

397
00:34:48,368 --> 00:34:49,424
Madam.

398
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:57,264
Your husband has returned.

399
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,248
Sanlang.

400
00:35:39,984 --> 00:35:41,040
Yunniang.

401
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,528
You are back.

402
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:52,848
Yunniang.

403
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:00,512
I haven't prepared anything.

404
00:36:01,432 --> 00:36:03,672
Not even a meal for you.

405
00:36:07,672 --> 00:36:11,871
I've been waiting
for this day for too long.

406
00:36:13,712 --> 00:36:17,391
Where have you been all these years?

407
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:22,391
They think I'm crazy, but I'm not.

408
00:36:24,111 --> 00:36:27,512
You told me to wait for you
before you went off to war.

409
00:36:28,631 --> 00:36:31,351
I know you would never deceive me.

410
00:36:33,952 --> 00:36:40,232
Sanlang, this wait has finally ended.

411
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:45,031
Don't ever leave again.

412
00:36:47,888 --> 00:36:48,976
I won't.

Yunniang, wait for me.

418
00:37:25,272 --> 00:37:29,031
Be safe. I'll wait for you.

419
00:37:39,152 --> 00:37:42,791
This formation is so powerful.

420
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,736
It made them look young again.

421
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:50,152
This formation won't last long.

422
00:37:52,952 --> 00:37:56,831
So if you have anything
to say, speak quickly.

423
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:03,192
(He figured out what I wanted to do.)

424
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:07,888
During the day,

425
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:11,551
I faintly sensed a strange aura
about this woman.

426
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,992
But I never expected it
to be her missing husband

427
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,391
following her, wanting to protect her.

428
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:21,272
He shouldn't have stayed here.

429
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:23,432
The Divine and humans are different.

430
00:38:23,952 --> 00:38:25,551
The aura on him is too strong.

431
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:29,912
Being together for too long
will inevitably affect this woman

432
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:31,824
and shorten her lifespan.

433
00:38:33,152 --> 00:38:35,712
I wanted to persuade him
to leave, but...

434
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:40,952
Why not let them decide for themselves?

435
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:45,391
They are ordinary people.

436
00:38:46,432 --> 00:38:50,432
They are not aware of how much
this aura can affect people.

437
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,752
At this point,

438
00:38:55,672 --> 00:38:57,831
it's better to tell them everything

439
00:38:57,831 --> 00:39:01,192
and let them decide their destiny.

440
00:39:10,992 --> 00:39:13,912
You want to let them stay together
a bit longer, don't you?

441
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:18,311
Even if just for a moment.

442
00:39:19,512 --> 00:39:22,672
