00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,276
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,590
Zixia?

4
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,550
He must have stolen Zixia's body

5
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,951
and then refined them into

6
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:49,590
creatures that are
neither human nor demon.

7
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,550
They are powerful
and know how to cooperate,

8
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,431
as if they have become lifeless puppets

9
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,510
that only follow orders.

10
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,151
If such puppets were to be
created by the thousands,

11
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:05,671
it would be dreadful.

12
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,152
Puppets?

13
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,550
Created?

14
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,270
Feel free to say what you want to say.

15
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,991
Nothing.

16
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,311
That's all?

17
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,591
Yes.

18
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,670
But it's enough

19
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:37,791
to keep our guard up.

20
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,470
I will have someone go
to the Mortal Realm to investigate.

21
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:50,190
You and His Excellency
must be tired now.

22
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,050
Go back and rest.

23
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,711
This matter just takes time.

24
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:57,991
Take care of your health.

25
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,871
Don't worry.

26
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:02,991
If they take action

27
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:04,010
against us,

28
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,151
I'll make them regret it.

29
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:09,200
Go back.

30
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,352
ShenLi.

31
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,951
I've found Her Holiness
is so good to you

32
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,771
and that you show great respect
to Her Holiness in return.

33
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:46,951
She raised me.

34
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,951
Her Holiness treats me as her own child,

35
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,591
and she is both a teacher
and a mother to me.

36
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:54,630
In the court, I respect her most,

37
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,410
and in private, I am closest to her.

38
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,110
So whether it's for her

39
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,171
or for myself,

40
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:01,750
I will guard the Immortal Realm.

41
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,311
Just now, Lord Bicang mentioned
something about Fu Sheng.

42
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:14,871
Why wasn't I informed before?

43
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,431
Your Holiness, please forgive us.

44
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:21,431
But nobody reported it.

45
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,670
Capturing the Earth Diviners

46
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,311
without being noticed

47
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,904
is not easy.

48
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,871
Go and investigate personally.

49
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,151
If you capture Fu Sheng,

50
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,031
no need to bring him back
and execute him on the spot

51
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,950
so that no one else will know.

52
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,991
But the Divine...

53
00:04:47,991 --> 00:04:49,950
I will find an excuse.

54
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:51,824
Go now.

55
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,448
Yes.

56
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,808
Your Lordship.

57
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:15,011
General Zhao Meng.

58
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,700
(Zhao Meng, Immortal Realm)
Greetings, Your Lordship.

59
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:18,131
How's it going in the Xutian Abyss?

60
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:19,771
I just got back from there.

61
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:21,270
You can rest assured.

62
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,471
It's now even cleaner
than the Capital City.

63
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,691
Those little brats

64
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,031
are now fighting tooth and nail

65
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:27,331
to serve at the frontier.

66
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,110
Where is Mofang now?

67
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:32,070
Last time he kicked Furong,
and Her Holiness said

68
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,991
he'd be punished.

69
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,131
I haven't seen him
since I came back this time.

70
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,230
Where was he sent for punishment?

71
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:40,271
I just saw Luotian Goddess

72
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,351
ask him to go to the garden.

73
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,550
No idea what they were saying.

74
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,510
Youlan

75
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,390
asked him to go to the garden?

76
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,950
Yes.

77
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,991
(I don't think she was going)

78
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,390
(to talk to Mofang
about romantic trifles.)

79
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:57,030
Alright. Let's talk another day.

80
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,311
- Go back to your work.
- I'm leaving.

81
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,071
Your valiance

82
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:06,550
impressed me a lot.

83
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,711
I've heard about it recently.

84
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,711
My good-for-nothing brother

85
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,191
has caused you lots of trouble.

86
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,731
Here, I apologize to you on his behalf.

87
00:06:14,731 --> 00:06:16,631
Don't mention it.

88
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:17,670
You don't have to say sorry.

89
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,751
I'd appreciate it
if you could persuade Furong

90
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,550
to return to the Divine Realm soon.

91
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,904
I will.

92
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:27,951
It's just that my brother

93
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,191
is a ladies' man,

94
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:32,031
but he's never treated a man like this.

95
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,510
The mortals say
where there's smoke, there's fire.

96
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,911
I know your reputation
in the Immortal Realm.

97
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,171
Please mind your words and manners.

98
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:41,510
Do not bring my brother into disrepute.

99
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,191
It's so flattering.

100
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,550
Your brother would even flirt

101
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:51,350
with a statue if it had a pulse.

102
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,110
It seems you've come to the wrong place

103
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,151
and the wrong person.

104
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:58,030
You should go back

105
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,350
and discipline your brother.

106
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:02,170
How can you talk like this?

107
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,950
It takes two to tango.

108
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,191
I think Furong

109
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,270
quite enjoys

110
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,270
dancing alone.

111
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:13,191
You may leave
to stay away from the mess.

112
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,670
Stop.

113
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,411
This is how you treat your guests?

114
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:21,371
This is my way of treating guests.

115
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:23,190
I respect the respectable.

116
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,751
I love the lovable.

117
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,531
As for the annoying ones,

118
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,911
I treat them as I wish.

119
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,191
Please mind your manners.

120
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,390
I don't have the best temper.

121
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,871
As a Diviner,

122
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,151
I have never been treated like this.

123
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,551
- Let go.
- I won't.

124
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,984
No?

125
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,032
Fine, hold on to it then.

126
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,400
You can't leave.

127
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,870
L-L-Let go.

128
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,830
Are you going to break my hand?

129
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,971
Ow!

130
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:01,210
Does it hurt that much?

131
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,390
- It hurts!
- Drop the act.

132
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,391
- Your Lordship.
- Let go!

133
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:05,424
- Let go!
- Don't twist it.

134
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,311
Help me. Let go.

135
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,568
Help!

136
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,751
Why are you bullying her with force?

137
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,111
(He's playing the hero?)

138
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:38,230
(Great.)

139
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,790
Your Excellency, please forgive us.

140
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,311
Her Lordship didn't mean to bully her.

141
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:48,431
Well, you're good at reading her mind.

142
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,056
It's rare.

143
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:54,350
Don't blame him.

144
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,910
Youlan spoke rudely to our general.

145
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,350
I couldn't swallow the insult,

146
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:03,391
so I return it to her.

147
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,110
You look mad at us.

148
00:09:05,951 --> 00:09:07,350
Well.

149
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,871
You want to get back at me
on her behalf?

150
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:11,790
You're being so angry now
for your general.

151
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,910
You treat your people so well.

152
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,991
But I'm no match for you

153
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,550
in terms of how tenderly you treat her.

154
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,150
(He's completely toying with me.)

155
00:09:32,831 --> 00:09:34,670
(Again and again,
he severs our relationship)

156
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,511
(and then comes back to seduce me.)

157
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,792
I request to fight.

158
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,391
(And he's just so good at it.)

159
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:49,191
(He made me)

160
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,591
(willingly impale my mouth on his hook.)

161
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,784
(You're drunk.)

162
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:55,184
Diviners

163
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,384
don't have those feelings.

164
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,590
(I'll get myself killed
because of that.)

165
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:04,590
If you want to help her get justice,

166
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:06,930
you should go to Her Holiness.

167
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,130
If I am at fault,

168
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,431
I am willing to accept punishment.

169
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:11,792
You don't need to get angry.

170
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,648
I take my leave.

171
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,311
The people of the Immortal Realm
are so impolite.

172
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:18,910
How dare Lord Bicang

173
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,931
treat us Diviners like this?

174
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:22,150
They'll be a problem in the future.

175
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,030
Exactly.

176
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,030
If you

177
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,230
provoke her again

178
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:33,991
and she accidentally snaps your neck,

179
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:36,951
that would be terrible.

180
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,871
You will possibly get beheaded.

181
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,590
Will you uphold justice for me?

182
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,432
No.

183
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:58,111
Her Holiness loves Lord Bicang so much.
She will surely turn a blind eye.

184
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:01,710
And we won't make a big fuss
over it for just a Diviner.

185
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,910
After all, peace is paramount.

186
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:07,344
If that time comes,

187
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,271
just rest in peace.

188
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,951
I'll offer some tribute fruits.

189
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,790
Was His Excellency siding with ShenLi?

190
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,840
Really?

191
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,470
Come on.

192
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,840
Seems true.

193
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:43,871
Why are you so infuriated?

194
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,448
What?

195
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,448
Please forgive me.

196
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,751
It's alright. Stand up.

197
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:17,391
I dealt with Youlan for you

198
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,670
without getting beaten
by His Excellency.

199
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,470
Why would I be angry?

200
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,512
Right.

201
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,631
No matter how powerful
His Excellency is,

202
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:30,071
he wouldn't do
anything outrageous to us.

203
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,910
It's just that there was
no one around just now,

204
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,230
and it's hard to tell
Lord Xingzhi's mood.

205
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:37,951
To avoid unnecessary punishment,

206
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,790
I walked a little too fast.

207
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,968
Right.

208
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,550
Today, Youlan spoke rudely to you.

209
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,752
If I hadn't seen it,

210
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:50,991
you'd have swallowed your anger, right?

211
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,710
- You're right.
- Huh?

212
00:12:54,991 --> 00:12:56,031
Why should we

213
00:12:56,031 --> 00:12:58,071
make way for those arrogant Diviners?

214
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,071
It's their own mess.

215
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,611
How could they pin the blame on us?

216
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:05,350
From now on, whether it's Furong

217
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,350
or his sister,

218
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,030
whoever messes with you

219
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,631
is messing with my men

220
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:12,450
and me.

221
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,531
That's disrespect to us.

222
00:13:13,531 --> 00:13:15,350
Do not give in.

223
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,670
Otherwise, I will punish you

224
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:18,910
- by military law when I see it.
- Yes.

225
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:24,624
Your Lordship.

226
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,311
This may be somewhat improper.

227
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,491
The Heavenly Lord is

228
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:29,590
Furong and Youlan's grandpa.

229
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:33,071
Moreover, you are engaged to Furong.

230
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:35,311
If there is too much tension...

231
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,871
There's nothing improper.

232
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:37,931
Others mustn't think

233
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,470
we are easy to bully.

234
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,704
Yes.

235
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,910
I heard that you were injured
in the Mortal Realm.

236
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,431
I'm fine now.

237
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:55,710
I'm well enough to fight a Chimei.

238
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,550
I was too impulsive,

239
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,110
causing you to be injured.

240
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,528
Please punish me.

241
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,191
I was just wondering.

242
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,350
The generals of our realm

243
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,391
aren't easy to get along with,

244
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:12,910
and you have a temper.

245
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,631
But today, Youlan
slandered you like that

246
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,710
and you didn't show a hint of anger.

247
00:14:18,431 --> 00:14:20,810
Did what happened before

248
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,910
frighten you a lot?

249
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,168
So you're afraid

250
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,248
of dragging me into it?

251
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,071
I said it's fine. Rise.

252
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:40,670
Fine, I will punish you.

253
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,056
Stand up.

254
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,191
This is Zixia's badge.

255
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,071
Give it to his wife,

256
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,856
so that she can keep a memento.

257
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:11,600
(Zixia)

258
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:15,871
Don't blame yourself.

259
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:13,067
(Zixia)

260
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,703
(Zixia)

261
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:38,960
(Memorial tablet of Zixia)

262
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,520
Your Lordship.

263
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,136
I won't stop you.

264
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:23,430
- Excuse me.
- Your Lordship.

265
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,190
Go to the military camp

266
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,751
and get all those
who are off duty tonight.

267
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,190
- Tell them it's my order.
- Alright.

268
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:39,371
You mourn for Zixia.

269
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:40,688
So do I.

270
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:42,991
The entire Immortal Realm grieves.

271
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,151
Tonight,

272
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:47,151
let's commemorate

273
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:48,551
the thousands of soldiers

274
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,470
who sacrificed for us.

275
00:17:52,631 --> 00:17:53,872
I'll accompany you.

276
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,000
Your Lordship.

277
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,310
You lost.

278
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:14,671
- Drink.
- Come on.

279
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:22,830
- Continue.
- Great.

280
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,950
- Come on.
- You've drunk so much, Your Lordship.

281
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,950
Let's go back.

282
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:30,151
Come on.

283
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,551
- No.
- Cheers.

284
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:34,350
- Come on.
- A god stays in my home.

285
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:38,590
I've had too many drinks.
I don't want to be a hassle

286
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,430
and receive his contempt.

287
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,571
- I'll pour for you.
- Your Lordship, please go back.

288
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:49,571
No.

289
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:50,928
I won't.

290
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,631
General, what should I do?

291
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,791
Go home.
I'll send Her Lordship back later.

292
00:19:03,911 --> 00:19:05,296
Alright.

293
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,632
You really won't go back?

294
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,871
Really?

295
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,184
No, I won't.

296
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,250
Would you mind

297
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,391
staying at my residence tonight?

298
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:23,792
Okay.

299
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,391
- Continue.
- Fill it up.

300
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,952
Fill it up.

301
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:30,010
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

302
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,664
Mofang.

303
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:58,911
I really wish to keep going like this.

304
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,791
Okay, let's go see the stars.

305
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:09,616
Let's go.

306
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,671
Let's go watch the stars.

307
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,680
Go.

308
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,096
Go.

309
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:28,190
Where are we going to watch the stars?

310
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,000
The roof of my house.

311
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,071
Why are you still up,

312
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,691
standing here at this late hour?

313
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:44,991
You scared me.

314
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,751
The moon in the Immortal Realm
is enchanting tonight,

315
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,350
so I came out to watch it.

316
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,950
Hasn't your lord returned home yet?

317
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:10,070
So you're waiting for Her Lordship.

318
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,431
Her Lordship won't return tonight.

319
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,710
She's a little drunk

320
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,391
and has gone to stay
at General Mofang's mansion.

321
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,231
You can talk to Her Lordship

322
00:21:17,231 --> 00:21:19,280
after she returns tomorrow.

323
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:41,631
Aren't you leaving?

324
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:43,671
Y-Y-Yes.

325
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:47,070
I'll go out to the streets
for some fresh air.

326
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,671
Why is His Excellency

327
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,151
getting weird?

328
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:22,576
(I drank too much!)

329
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:25,470
(I'm watching the stars
with my subordinate)

330
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,791
(on his house's roof!)

331
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,391
(If this gets out,)

332
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,470
(it would sound too intimate.)

333
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,671
(But I just climbed up.
It doesn't feel right to go down now.)

334
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,310
Your Lordship, can you see the stars?

335
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,230
The miasma here has greatly reduced.

336
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,592
But

337
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:04,430
I still can't see the stars.

338
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,350
But I can see them.

339
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:30,992
Why?

340
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,391
My hands can wield a spear,

341
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:44,791
but they can't embroider.

342
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:46,751
How can the owner of such hands

343
00:23:47,671 --> 00:23:49,151
deserve such treatment from you?

344
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:55,511
For me, it should be asked
the other way around.

345
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,190
How can you not,

346
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,656
Your Lordship?

347
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:09,430
To me,

348
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,590
your Red Plume Spear

349
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,950
is like an embroidery needle,

350
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,151
and you've embroidered

351
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,350
a splendid tapestry
on the land of our realm.

352
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,631
Well said, Mofang.

353
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:22,491
Aren't you usually a dull talker?

354
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:23,590
You're actually talented.

355
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:26,871
I'm telling

356
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,656
the truth.

357
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:30,710
That's exactly what you do.

358
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,631
So of course you deserve
my heartfelt devotion.

359
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:46,096
No.

360
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,592
Still no.

361
00:25:11,391 --> 00:25:13,190
I know

362
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,864
my place,

363
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:17,991
so I won't have unrealistic thoughts.

364
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:23,271
I just wanted to convey
my feelings to you.

365
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,632
Mofang,

366
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,110
status doesn't matter.

367
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,416
It's just that...

368
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,271
Well, ShenLi,

369
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,051
you're such a double-dealer.

370
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,110
You've gone too far.

371
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,391
Should you go inside to avoid him?

372
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:01,871
Why?

373
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:03,110
Did you forget what I told you today?

374
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,671
I've warned you before, Furong.

375
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:10,151
Don't bother my general again.

376
00:26:10,751 --> 00:26:12,411
You really don't learn your lesson.

377
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:13,950
Do you believe
I'm going to beat you up again?

378
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,391
Your Excellency, look.
This is how she treats me.

379
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:18,511
How can I marry her?

380
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,950
(Was he standing there to listen)

381
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,911
(when we were chatting?)

382
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:45,590
(What a sneaky man!)

383
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,551
Do you Diviners have
a habit of eavesdropping?

384
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,031
Coming uninvited, is this how you
do it in the Divine Realm?

385
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,651
In the dead of night, a lone man
and a single woman

386
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:04,811
gazing at the stars on the roof.

387
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:06,151
Is this the etiquette of you Immortals?

388
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:13,111
Watching the stars?

389
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:14,631
I don't even see any.

390
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:20,830
ShenLi, you...

391
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:24,630
You want to kill me?

392
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,131
Since you are already blind,

393
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,551
let me help you remove
these useless things. Isn't that good?

394
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,830
Your Excellency, look! How dare she?

395
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,110
I mustn't marry her.

396
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:39,070
Why don't you

397
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,511
accept General Mofang's affection?

398
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,350
If the two of you are indulging
in romantic sentiments today,

399
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,751
I shall give you my blessing.

400
00:28:07,671 --> 00:28:10,031
You've been unwilling to cancel

401
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,470
our engagement for a reason,

402
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,030
so you didn't mean that, right?

403
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,151
Why are you angry?

404
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:22,191
You betrothed me to him,

405
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:23,711
and you've been helping it along.

406
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:24,991
Your Excellency, please don't

407
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:25,991
talk nonsense

408
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,751
to make everyone uncomfortable.

409
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,031
Furong,

410
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:40,110
let's make things clear today.

411
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:43,030
Our marriage concerns both realms.

412
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,551
It must be finished.

413
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,110
No matter what tricks you play,

414
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,350
it's all futile.

415
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,871
Why not return
to the Divine Realm to eat good meals

416
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:53,391
before our wedding
when you still have time?

417
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:14,511
I was joking just now.

418
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:18,190
- You took it too seriously.
- I am a serious person.

419
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,710
Your Excellency,
please don't joke with me.

420
00:29:27,271 --> 00:29:29,190
The seal of the Xutian Abyss
has been restored,

421
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:31,551
and the Earth Diviners' matter
has been reported back.

422
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:33,431
An ancient god

423
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:35,151
cannot always linger
in the Immortal Realm, right?

424
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,710
(He should return to his place)

425
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,430
(and continue to detachedly watch)

426
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,851
(the world change)

427
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:43,950
(and time pass by.)

428
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,551
(To him, all things in the Three Realms)

429
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,751
(are but trivial matters.)

430
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,784
Fine.

431
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,551
I'm done here.

432
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,312
Furong,

433
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,070
tell Youlan to go back

434
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,430
to the Divine Realm with me tomorrow.

435
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:14,451
I've stayed for too long

436
00:30:14,451 --> 00:30:15,751
in the Immortal Realm this time.

437
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,031
It is time to return.

438
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:21,871
Your Excellency.

439
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:23,830
Let me bid you and General Mofang

440
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:26,151
farewell today.

441
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:29,491
We may not see each other again.

442
00:30:29,491 --> 00:30:32,151
Take care.

443
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:34,991
(Will we never see each other again?)

444
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,904
Your Excellency,

445
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:48,791
why did you come here today?

446
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,671
I came for Furong.

447
00:30:58,511 --> 00:30:59,871
He brought you lots of trouble

448
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:01,431
in the Immortal Realm this time.

449
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:03,230
I'm sorry about that.

450
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,210
After I return to the Divine Realm,

451
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,811
I will report what I've seen

452
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:10,071
to the Heavenly Lord.

453
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:11,280
After you...

454
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,470
After you marry Furong,

455
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:28,110
I'm sure he won't be
so presumptuous as he is now.

456
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,871
No, please.

457
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,431
The poison within you

458
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:39,470
isn't completely detoxified.

459
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,424
Go to bed early.

460
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,271
(This is the power of gods.)

461
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,350
(With a wave,)

462
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,830
(he can dispel the pervasive miasma.)

463
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:14,190
(But under the stars,)

464
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,871
(it is the shadow of people.)

465
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:25,950
It's good that he's gone.
Out of sight, out of mind.

466
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,904
Your Lordship,

467
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,031
Lord Xingzhi

468
00:32:32,031 --> 00:32:33,350
left behind such a pretty starry sky.

469
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,312
Are you still going to watch?

470
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:39,888
No.

471
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,070
(I won't pine for it if I don't know)

472
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:47,911
(how beautiful it is.)

473
00:32:51,631 --> 00:32:52,912
Thank you for your time.

474
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,472
I think I should return to my residence.

475
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,830
(Saying I could separate
Xingyun from Xingzhi clearly.)

476
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:10,110
(How could I?)

477
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,151
(Even if I could before,)

478
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,070
(I can't now.)

479
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,160
(But now,)

480
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,430
(neither Xingzhi nor Xingyun stays.)

481
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,791
(What does it matter
if I can tell or not?)

482
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:27,830
(What does it matter
if I can hold back my feelings or not?)

483
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:31,070
(After all, I'll forget it
sooner or later.)

484
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,350
(It's just a matter of time.)

485
00:34:13,112 --> 00:34:14,871
(Lord Bicang's Mansion)
Are you really not going to take a look?

486
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:16,291
That's quite a sight outside.

487
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:19,211
Her Holiness is said to be personally
seeing off Lord Xingzhi and the others.

488
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:20,871
All the officials are there too.

489
00:34:20,871 --> 00:34:22,051
Your Lordship,

490
00:34:22,051 --> 00:34:23,831
you don't seem to be
suffering from a hangover.

491
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:25,351
Why not go take a look?

492
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,511
When did it eat last time?

493
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,350
Its mouth has been
tightly shut since returning

494
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,190
from the Palace in the Immortal Realm.

495
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,271
Is it going to die?

496
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,731
His Excellency did this to me,
Your Lordship.

497
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,710
His Excellency is a bad man.

498
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,271
He did this to me,

499
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:10,991
Your Lordship.

500
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:13,520
How did he do it to you?

501
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,211
He made me pluck my feathers,
Your Lordship.

502
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:18,191
He said it himself.

503
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:19,790
He cast a spell on me.

504
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,430
He is not a good person.

505
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,251
A scoundrel.

506
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:25,710
Please stand up for me, Your Lordship.

507
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,271
So Lord Xingzhi

508
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,071
remembers everything.

509
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:35,751
He even bullied a little bird.

510
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,151
Your Lordship, help me take revenge.

511
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:41,751
It's something Lord Xingzhi would do.

512
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:45,150
- Farewell, Your Excellency.
- Farewell, Your Excellency.

513
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,760

Just now, the generals

552

recommended some people

for the investigation.

555
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,511
This time, it's not to start a war

556
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:48,671
but to give

557
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:51,630
the rookies a good training opportunity.

558
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,751
Since it's a recon mission,

559
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:01,390
we should choose a meticulous general.

560
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:14,991
General Mofang is detail-oriented
and good at strategy.

561
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,430
How about we have him lead the troops?

562
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:39,791
Do any of you have objections?

563
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:46,128
Then

564
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:49,150
that's it for today.

565
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,568
Everyone, you may leave.

566
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,771
- ShenLi.
- (I guess I'm getting scolded today.)

567
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,208
You stay.

568
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:16,950
You played

569
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,430
this game so terribly.

570
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:20,751
You got flustered

571
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,230
when your move failed.

572
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,751
It's not like you at all.

573
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,790
Ever since Furong left,

574
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,870
I've noticed

575
00:40:39,991 --> 00:40:41,271
you've been restless.

576
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,831
You've misunderstood.

577
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:54,896
Then that would be good.

578
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,311
Lately, I've been feeling tired

579
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,271
and don't want to go out.

580
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,831
The Divine sent an invitation
to the Hundred Flowers Banquet.

581
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:04,430
Go on my behalf.

582
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,791
Anyway, don't disgrace our realm.

583
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,311
After all, you will live there
after your wedding.

584
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:14,791
It's a good thing

585
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:17,511
to take a look at the place.

586
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,071
- Your Holiness...
- Stop. This is an order.

587
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:36,390
(The Divine Realm...)

588
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:39,591
(Forget it.)

589
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,190
(He probably won't be there.)

590
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:43,831
(Hasn't he always been)

591
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,311
(in the Extranatural Heaven
all this time?)

592
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,430
