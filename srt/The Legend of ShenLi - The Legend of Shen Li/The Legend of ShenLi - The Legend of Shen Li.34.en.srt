00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,188
=Episode 34=

3
00:01:40,675 --> 00:01:41,712
It's been a month.

4
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:43,995
Liuyu.

5
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,514
Has Fenglai mastered the power
of the Chimei?

6
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:49,840
Master.

7
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:53,194
I think we misjudged him.

8
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:54,995
Given his performance,

9
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:56,976
I think he doesn't

10
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:58,995
have the power of Chimei.

11
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:01,635
You think so?

12
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,112
Why?

13
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:08,514
He is no different from ordinary people.

14
00:02:09,915 --> 00:02:11,154
He cannot

15
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:13,395
control the Chimei.

16
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,415
Master.

17
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,634
So, I have wasted one month on him.

18
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:42,355
For him, I even delayed the emergence
of other Chimei.

19
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:43,675
But now, you're telling me

20
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:45,434
that he has no power of Chimei?

21
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:48,720
Master.

22
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:51,440
I told you the truth.

23
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,755
Master, this is not her fault.

24
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:00,695
I will give you three more days.

25
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:02,315
I don't care how,

26
00:03:02,874 --> 00:03:04,994
but you must make Fenglai have it.

27
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,434
If you fail,

28
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:11,472
I will have no reason

29
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:13,315
to keep you.

30
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,275
He's becoming more and more insane

31
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:32,195
Liuyu.

32
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:33,234
The Chimei have caused trouble

33
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:35,095
in the military camp.

34
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:36,354
You must have heard of it.

35
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:38,895
The soldiers,

36
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:39,915
civil and military officials,

37
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:40,974
and even the Divine Realm

38
00:03:40,974 --> 00:03:42,794
are very dissatisfied
with the matter of the Chimei.

39
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,154
If Master continues to be so crazy,

40
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:52,944
I might not

41
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:55,536
tolerate him anymore.

42
00:03:57,794 --> 00:03:58,832
Muyue.

43
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:00,848
He is

44
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:02,514
our Master.

45
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:03,664
He has changed.

46
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,355
Ever since he took that position,

47
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:07,434
he's become increasingly

48
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:09,395
tyrannical and insane.

49
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,136
Liuyu.

50
00:04:17,955 --> 00:04:19,155
If he gets totally crazy,

51
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,395
will you stay and help him

52
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,136
or leave with me?

53
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:33,520
Perhaps,

54
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,395
there might be another way.

55
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:42,384
I know

56
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:44,112
you previously

57
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:46,235
wanted to use Fenglai

58
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,275
to control the Chimei

59
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,675
and prevent them from doing evil.

60
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:50,928
But...

61
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,755
Fenglai is one of the Chimei.

62
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:55,955
Can you guarantee

63
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,275
that he won't kill the innocent?

64
00:04:58,634 --> 00:05:00,555
Yes, I can. I trust him

65
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:01,855
Can you trust me?

66
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:02,960
Fine.

67
00:05:04,354 --> 00:05:05,488
Things have changed, anyway.

68
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:08,080
You think it over carefully.

69
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,035
(After infusing the magic)

70
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:30,354
(into the light,)

71
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:32,995
(I can see more from it.)

72
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:36,555
(But it's still not easy)

73
00:05:37,194 --> 00:05:38,194
(to find a way out of here.)

74
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:24,354
(I didn't expect to see my Master
from the past events.)

75
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:28,194
(Given what I did with Xingzhi
at the South Celestial Gate,)

76
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,514
(Master must have known my existence.)

77
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:34,275
(She must be worried about me now.)

78
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:21,840
I hope

79
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,314
Li returns safely.

80
00:07:45,514 --> 00:07:46,634
Master is in the Divine Realm.

81
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:56,995
(I hope my mother is happy.)

82
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:00,875
(I hope my husband returns safely.)

83
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:03,155
(I hope Her Lordship returns safely.)

84
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:06,155
(I hope
the Xutian Abyss restores peace.)

85
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:07,994
(I hope)

86
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,155
(everyone can be safe.)

87
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,095
(I hope Her Lordship returns safely)

88
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:13,675
(and the Immortal Realm
survives the crisis.)

89
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:18,736
Xingzhi.

90
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:20,816
Xingzhi.

91
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,184
Xingzhi.

92
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:34,754
You still can't stay.

93
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:43,280
Xingzhi.

94
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:45,395
Do the stars
over the Extranatural Heaven

95
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:47,235
stand for the blessings
and wishes of the people?

96
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:50,832
Yes.

97
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:53,155
I have heard of their wishes.

98
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:55,984
Xingzhi.

99
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:57,904
I don't belong here.

100
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:02,275
We understand each other.

101
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,976
I have guessed it.

102
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:07,194
You must have a reason for this.

103
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,795
Please tell me what it is.

104
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:23,664
I will handle it.

105
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:33,275
Lord Xingzhi, please wait.

106
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:36,528
I know what you're going to say.

107
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,275
Just leave her
in the Extranatural Heaven.

108
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,915
She will be safe there.

109
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:47,120
What do you mean?

110
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:56,144
Fu Sheng.

111
00:10:58,416 --> 00:10:59,440
He's been looking for

112
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:02,314
what can replace the seals
in the Xutian Abyss.

113
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:03,434
To remove the seals,

114
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,424
ShenLi

115
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:07,395
has the last thing he is looking for.

116
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:09,808
The Fire Seal.

117
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:16,240
You've known

118
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:18,864
Li's identity?

119
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:21,754
Gods are not so easy to fool.

120
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:55,824
Master.

121
00:11:57,754 --> 00:11:59,434
You let me down.

122
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:06,395
I'm sorry, Master. I failed.

123
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:30,416
Fenglai.

124
00:12:31,514 --> 00:12:32,688
Liuyu, are you okay?

125
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:35,074
The power of Chimei?

126
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:38,074
You said he had no power of Chimei.
So, what was that?

127
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,074
Don't hurt her.

128
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:53,674
Fenglai, stop.

129
00:13:10,395 --> 00:13:11,595
The power of Chimei.

130
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:13,835
Great.

131
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:16,674
Fenglai's power is stronger
than I imagined.

132
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,155
From now on,

133
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,835
I will watch him in the palace.

134
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:25,935
His power is too strong.

135
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:27,120
It's not safe

136
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:29,200
to keep him here.

137
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:42,800
Master.

138
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,355
Fenglai has not...

139
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,424
What?

140
00:13:46,595 --> 00:13:48,395
He has not fully obeyed you?

141
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:00,272
Master.

142
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:02,000
Fenglai.

143
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:04,720
Fenglai.

144
00:14:05,514 --> 00:14:06,544
Fenglai.

145
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:08,464
Fenglai.

146
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:10,114
Master.

147
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,114
Please don't hurt him.

148
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:16,375
Master, please.

149
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,514
Please. Don't hurt Fenglai.

150
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:21,520
Master.

151
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,374
- Master.
- Liuyu.

152
00:14:26,374 --> 00:14:27,376
Master.

153
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:29,955
Master, please.

154
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:34,994
Please don't hurt Fenglai.

155
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:46,994
If you don't want to be bait
for the Chimei,

156
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,035
don't stop me.

157
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:54,074
Liuyu, I've been proud of you.

158
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,528
Don't disappoint me.

159
00:15:00,074 --> 00:15:01,395
Don't!

160
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:14,736
Don't hurt her.

161
00:15:16,554 --> 00:15:17,616
I'll go with you.

162
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:25,795
Liuyu, don't worry.

163
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:28,368
Fenglai and I

164
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:30,514
won't disappoint you.

165
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:19,856
Kill him.

166
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:22,704
Kill him!

167
00:17:23,394 --> 00:17:24,400
Do it!

168
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:16,914
Liuyu told me

169
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,376
not to kill people.

170
00:18:22,154 --> 00:18:23,274
I won't do it.

171
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:28,595
King of Chimei.

172
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:35,194
King of Chimei.

173
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:40,875
I can't believe Liuyu made you this way.

174
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:43,835
She ruined my plans.

175
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:47,856
Kill him.

176
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,536
Do it!

177
00:19:12,274 --> 00:19:13,495
You guys search over there.

178
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:14,854
Everyone else, follow me. Quick!

179
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,016
Yes.

180
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:22,512
Go.

181
00:19:27,554 --> 00:19:29,295
Search carefully and catch them.

182
00:19:29,295 --> 00:19:30,320
Yes.

183
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,504
Quick!

184
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,274
Fenglai, hang in there.

185
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:35,235
I will get you out of here.

186
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,040
I did not kill anyone.

187
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,794
I know you didn't kill anyone.

188
00:19:47,274 --> 00:19:48,400
You did no wrong.

189
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:50,832
You are doing great.

190
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,034
But why do they want to hurt us?

191
00:19:59,194 --> 00:20:00,515
You guys. Search over there.

192
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:02,320
Yes!

193
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,504
Go.

194
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,488
Liuyu.

195
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:48,955
Little Fenglai.

196
00:20:50,034 --> 00:20:51,195
It can't move.

197
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:52,315
And it's not breathing.

198
00:20:52,315 --> 00:20:53,434
Its body is cold.

199
00:20:58,755 --> 00:20:59,760
Fenglai.

200
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:02,274
Little Fenglai

201
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:04,455
is dead.

202
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:05,488
Dead?

203
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,344
He's dead?

204
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,448
What does that mean?

205
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:14,032
It means

206
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,475
it won't open its eyes

207
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,314
and breathe anymore.

208
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,224
Well,

209
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:28,554
aren't you skilled in medicine?

210
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:30,515
And we have medicinal herbs.

211
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:32,400
Save it, please.

212
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:37,776
Sit.

213
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,154
Death is not the same as being sick.

214
00:21:47,995 --> 00:21:50,715
Death cannot be cured.

215
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:00,336
It's okay.

216
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:03,554
Everyone will be dead one day.

217
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:08,400
Liuyu.

218
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:10,595
Will you stop breathing

219
00:22:11,515 --> 00:22:12,595
and never wake up again?

220
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:16,880
Of course, I will.

221
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:22,416
I can't let it happen.

222
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,552
It's okay.

223
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:31,760
Death

224
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:33,875
means a return.

225
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,656
Where to?

226
00:22:38,755 --> 00:22:39,792
To the place

227
00:22:41,074 --> 00:22:42,192
we came from.

228
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:51,674
That is where all beings

229
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:53,674
and things will ultimately reach.

230
00:22:55,536 --> 00:22:56,560
We can

231
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,320
meet again what we missed

232
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,048
and lost

233
00:23:01,115 --> 00:23:02,314
in that place.

234
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:05,355
Life is like this flowing river.

235
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:07,595
Sometimes it rushes

236
00:23:08,914 --> 00:23:10,074
and dries up,

237
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:12,595
but it never stops.

238
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:17,475
This is the continuation of life.

239
00:23:35,635 --> 00:23:37,194
The continuation of life?

240
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:53,835
(What's the ultimate fate)

241
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:56,074
(of the King of Chimei)

242
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,440
(and Liuming's disciples?)

243
00:24:03,194 --> 00:24:06,794
(That traitor can't
hide the King of Chimei.)

244
00:24:07,355 --> 00:24:08,592
(Find them.)

245
00:24:15,835 --> 00:24:16,976
Fenglai.

246
00:24:44,794 --> 00:24:46,194
Master.

247
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,115
Please spare Fenglai.

248
00:24:49,904 --> 00:24:50,955
Master.

249
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,715
I beg you. Please spare him.

250
00:24:55,184 --> 00:24:56,240
Master.

251
00:24:57,154 --> 00:24:58,160
Master.

252
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:15,375
Master, please.

253
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,914
Please spare him.

254
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:29,195
Liuyu.

255
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,288
Fenglai.

256
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:33,955
Fenglai!

257
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:36,176
Liuyu!

258
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,168
Kneel.

259
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,688
Liuyu.

260
00:26:33,955 --> 00:26:34,960
Liuyu, wake up.

261
00:26:35,674 --> 00:26:36,688
Don't die.

262
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:40,235
Liuyu.

263
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,160
Fenglai.

264
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:07,216
I'll get you out of here.

265
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:09,488
I'll take you home.

266
00:27:25,674 --> 00:27:27,034
Liuyu.

267
00:27:28,154 --> 00:27:29,168
Liuyu.

268
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,096
Are you alright?

269
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,136
I'm fine.

270
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,592
Careful.

271
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:57,904
Red light means a warning.

272
00:27:59,632 --> 00:28:00,752
There's a mutiny in the army.

273
00:28:03,034 --> 00:28:05,194
Muyue has finally decided to rebel.

274
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:09,875
If the Chimei escape,

275
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:12,784
the Immortal Realm will be in havoc.

276
00:28:13,794 --> 00:28:14,832
In that case,

277
00:28:16,115 --> 00:28:17,475
the common people are going to suffer.

278
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:28,195
Lord Xingzhi has already used his power

279
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,232
to create an external seal.

280
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,314
The Chimei have been controlled.

281
00:29:32,034 --> 00:29:33,168
When will

282
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:35,595
the last seal be found?

283
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,955
You haven't eaten all day.
Have some porridge.

284
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:05,104
Liuyu!

285
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:08,208
Muyue?

286
00:30:12,274 --> 00:30:14,715
It's emergent now.

287
00:30:16,274 --> 00:30:18,475
Fenglai, please leave us alone.

288
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:29,094
Muyue.

289
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,455
The armies of the Divine
and Immortal Realm retreated in defeat.

290
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,955
And the Chimei are growing in number.

291
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:34,215
We have no control over them.

292
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,235
Even my subordinates...

293
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,955
I can't see the Immortal Realm

294
00:30:44,554 --> 00:30:45,616
collapse like this.

295
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:47,755
So many lives...

296
00:30:58,914 --> 00:30:59,984
I regret

297
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:03,696
rebelling too late.

298
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:07,440
So now,

299
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:09,674
is there a remedy?

300
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,154
To seal the Chimei,

301
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:18,960
we need the last seal

302
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:22,794
to compose the Seals of Five Elements.

303
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:29,712
It's the Fire Seal,

304
00:31:31,115 --> 00:31:32,144
Fenglai.

305
00:31:37,635 --> 00:31:38,674
Fenglai?

306
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:51,920
I came to see you today

307
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:55,475
for this matter.

308
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,635
I have no other choice.

309
00:32:00,674 --> 00:32:02,154
Only by making him the Fire Seal

310
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,194
can we end this war.

311
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:06,256
Liuyu.

312
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:09,296
I don't push you.

313
00:32:10,914 --> 00:32:12,355
But you need to make a decision quickly.

314
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:33,552
(Seals of Five Elements.)

315
00:32:34,434 --> 00:32:35,568
(The Power of Fire.)

316
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,274
Only Fenglai has the power

317
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:42,595
to match the power
of the mountains and rivers.

318
00:32:44,794 --> 00:32:45,995
Fenglai.

319
00:32:49,554 --> 00:32:50,794
Only he can do it.

320
00:33:36,595 --> 00:33:37,835
Is there something you need me

321
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:40,554
to do?

322
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:46,608
Fenglai.

323
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:51,794
If there is something

324
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:55,875
that only you can do,

325
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:00,715
and if you do it,

326
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:08,035
we will not see each other
for a long time.

327
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:10,874
A long time?

328
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,995
How long?

329
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:15,728
Very long.

330
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,088
A long time.

331
00:34:31,354 --> 00:34:32,434
I can wait for a long time.

332
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:35,504
After I return,

333
00:34:36,434 --> 00:34:37,584
I will refine pills

334
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:39,914
for you to relieve fatigue.

335
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,288
We can

336
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:45,715
raise a pet again.

337
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:50,192
When night falls,

338
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:52,154
I will hold your hand

339
00:34:53,515 --> 00:34:55,715
and watch the beautiful starry sky.

340
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,394
If I do it,

341
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:08,434
you won't cry anymore,

342
00:35:09,584 --> 00:35:10,672
right?

343
00:35:12,914 --> 00:35:14,955
You can sleep well every night

344
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:17,154
and be as happy as usual, right?

345
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:27,568
I don't know.

346
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:34,416
I don't know.

347
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:39,440
But I know

348
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:43,594
if you do it,

349
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:50,555
many people like you and me

350
00:35:53,874 --> 00:35:55,555
won't have to cry anymore

351
00:35:59,674 --> 00:36:01,194
and can sleep well at night.

352
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:09,035
They will be much happier than now.

353
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:18,512
