00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,565
=Episode 26=

3
00:02:08,682 --> 00:02:09,843
It seems that Your Lordship

4
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:12,483
can still feel pain.

5
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:14,802
Then bear with it.

6
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,336
Your Lordship.

7
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:23,242
He didn't hesitate

8
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:25,602
when he came to take me.

9
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,602
Are you alright? Don't play dead on me.

10
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:01,682
You're not dead!

11
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:02,843
That's great! You're alive.

12
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:14,043
Offer them all the intelligence
about the North Sea.

13
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,442
Have the North Sea royal family

14
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:18,483
stripped of their royal power

15
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:20,963
and turned into puppets

16
00:04:22,683 --> 00:04:23,882
to sneak attack the Divine Realm.

17
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:30,363
Aren't you feeling any guilty?

18
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,296
I

19
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:40,322
feel guilty, sure.

20
00:04:41,363 --> 00:04:43,083
But there's nothing I can do.

21
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,402
I am not you. I can't bear such pain.

22
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,402
Moreover, my mother is guilty.

23
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,882
I've been discriminated against
since childhood.

24
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,963
The North Sea royal family really
means little to me in terms of kinship.

25
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:13,040
My betrayal

26
00:05:15,923 --> 00:05:17,043
was an act of desperation.

27
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:19,322
We all have our problems.

28
00:05:24,162 --> 00:05:27,442
But betrayal is always hard to forgive.

29
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,602
Every man for himself!

30
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,943
Why talk tough here?

31
00:05:31,943 --> 00:05:34,243
This formation has already started.

32
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:36,162
Just give them that bead and it's done.

33
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:37,643
You could suffer less.

34
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,136
Absolutely impossible.

35
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,002
I really don't get you.

36
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:52,403
Even at this time, you can still smile.

37
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:53,882
Of course.

38
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:55,442
I'm a veteran at this.

39
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:06,960
Veteran?

40
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:13,282
The Silk Thread Formation
has been activated.

41
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:15,442
Within three days,

42
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:18,923
I'll get the Azure Sea Pearl

43
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,842
from ShenLi's body.

44
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:25,203
Young master,

45
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,322
we are about to get

46
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:32,842
the Azure Sea Pearl.

47
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,043
Stop fighting.

48
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:39,722
Once I retrieve the Azure Sea Pearl,

49
00:06:40,602 --> 00:06:45,363
her broken body is at your disposal.

50
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,722
I told you

51
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,402
to stay away from ShenLi.

52
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:18,043
Please take me with you.

53
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:39,632
Your Lordship.

54
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:45,082
(Can't believe Mofang saved me.)

55
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:47,722
(He betrayed Fu Sheng?)

56
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,082
(Even if I could speak,)

57
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:54,082
(I'd have nothing to say to him.)

58
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,842
(So many soldiers and people
of Immortal Realm have died.)

59
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:03,202
(There's no going back
between me and him.)

60
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:08,522
(The man I once fought alongside)

61
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,842
(has killed himself with his own hands.)

62
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:15,282
(The one kneeling before me now)

63
00:10:16,443 --> 00:10:18,003
(is the invader of the Immortal Realm,)

64
00:10:19,003 --> 00:10:20,363
(the slaughterer of its people,)

65
00:10:21,123 --> 00:10:23,123
(and the enemy who killed its soldiers.)

66
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,602
(If I had my spear in hand,)

67
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:27,923
(I would surely fight him.)

68
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:45,264
Your Lordship.

69
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:48,043
I haven't got the time to get
the Darksteel Nails out.

70
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,023
I'm going to distract the pursuers.

71
00:10:50,023 --> 00:10:51,472
I'm sorry, Your Lordship.

72
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,448
Li!

73
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:45,584
Li.

74
00:12:56,762 --> 00:12:58,082
You've saved my life.

75
00:13:25,202 --> 00:13:28,043
You told me
you could take care of yourself.

76
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,123
How could you let yourself
end up like this?

78

You never cry out in pain
in front of others.

80
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:56,112
If it weren't for you

81
00:13:58,243 --> 00:13:59,842
being in a dream,

82
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,282

Lord Bicang,

87
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:20,762

days of great pain

91
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:35,602
and sadness.

92
00:14:35,602 --> 00:14:37,123
With no one by your side to protect you,

93
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:42,363
you got no choice but to be tough.

94
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:51,642
From now on, I'll always be by your side
to protect you,

95

Li.

00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:25,082
I can walk by myself.

106

You and I

107
00:15:30,123 --> 00:15:31,323
are now strangers.

108
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:33,722
If we meet on the battlefield next time,

109
00:15:36,082 --> 00:15:39,443
I won't have mercy on you.

110
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:43,563
Today you can either kill me

111
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,082
or just leave.

112
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,762
Li, it's me.

113
00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:56,522
Though I can't see or hear,

114
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:58,722
I'm not useless.

115
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,923
For old times' sake,

116
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,344
just leave.

117
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:28,243
How dare you! Let me go.

118
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:32,522
From now on, I won't let you go.

119
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:37,282
Mofang wouldn't dare to do so.

120
00:16:38,642 --> 00:16:40,363
Who are you?

121
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:41,762
Since you can neither see nor hear,

122
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:43,683
you wouldn't know who I am.

123
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:47,962
I've been searching for you these days.

124
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:50,563
Now you're breaking my heart.

125
00:16:51,363 --> 00:16:52,923
I smell seawater on you.

126
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,043
Are you a fisherman?

127
00:16:56,243 --> 00:16:57,842
Fisherman?

128
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:58,962
I don't care who you are

129
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,563
or what you want to do.

130
00:17:02,642 --> 00:17:04,563
Listen carefully,

131
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:05,683
I am no ordinary person.

132
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:10,002
You can tell by these unusual wounds.

133
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,923
But even if I am wounded like this,

134
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:16,242
if you want to harm me,

135
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:18,122
I have a hundred ways to deal with you.

136
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:20,603
But if you want to help me,

137
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:22,683
when my wounds heal,

138
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,323
trust me, I'll reward you greatly.

139
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:27,242
Still battling it out

140
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:28,282
even in this condition, huh?

141
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,443
ShenLi,

142
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:33,043
I don't know whether to praise you

143
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:34,928
or feel sorry for you.

144
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:38,282
I can feel your chest vibrating.

145
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,603
But I can't hear you speaking.

146
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,843
If you agree to help me,

147
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,762
pat me twice.

148
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:04,923
(I've been blind
for three days straight.)

149
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:07,803
(It was one thing
being in the cell before,)

150
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:11,162
(but now
I'm in a whole new place outside.)

151
00:18:12,443 --> 00:18:14,083
(I need to know
what's going on around me.)

152
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,443
(Where am I?)

153
00:18:16,443 --> 00:18:18,162
(Am I safe?)

154
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:19,162
(How far am I from)

155
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,762
(the Immortal Realm
and the place I escaped?)

156
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,122
(Most importantly,)

157
00:18:25,122 --> 00:18:28,882
(I want to know who saved me.)

158
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:36,002
(He must be a fisherman,)

159
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,608
(not a talker.)

160
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:42,603
(During these three days,
I've never heard him speak)

161
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:44,522
(even when I could hear.)

162
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:57,642
(As of now, he seems to be harmless.)

163
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:00,482
(But why did he save me?)

164
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,203
(Not for money or personal gain,)

165
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,482
(not expecting anything in return.)

166
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,603
(This is what's most suspicious.)

167
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,002
(I am a cripple at this moment,)

168
00:19:32,282 --> 00:19:34,083
(lying in bed,
being taken care of by others.)

169
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,242
(Truly frustrating.)

170
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:47,963
(Such gentleness.)

171
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:51,683
(He's not one of those
country bumpkins.)

172
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:11,803
Is it noon or night?

173
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:24,162
Noon.

174
00:20:24,162 --> 00:20:25,882
Where am I?

175
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,723
By the East Sea.

176
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:30,002
(Mofang took me to the East Sea?)

177
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:34,162
(He expected someone to pick me up?)

178
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:37,882
(The Immortal wouldn't hold any)

179
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:41,323
(unrealistic fantasies
about the confirmed things.)

180
00:20:42,563 --> 00:20:43,923
(I've been missing for so long.)

181
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:46,603
(Her Holiness must think I am dead.)

182
00:20:47,603 --> 00:20:49,083
(Why would they send someone
to find me?)

183
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:52,464
(As for the Divine Realm,)

184
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:55,402
(I doubt
anyone would come looking for me.)

185
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,043
(Although ever since I met Xingzhi,)

186
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:00,762
(it seems I get injured
in every battle.)

187
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,402
(But he always manages to save me.)

188
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:06,288
(Yet this time...)

189
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:08,560
I got this.

190
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:20,432
(Such a shame.)

191
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,304
Want more?

192
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,843
These six Darksteel Nails
consist of two parts,

193
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:33,282
with the outer layer
wrapping around the inner core.

194
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:41,843
Back then they had the iron core
penetrate my flesh and bones,

195
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,723
then twisted the outer layer,

196
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:48,122
and fastened the two pieces together,

197
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:50,522
each end attached to a chain,

198
00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:53,162
making it impossible for me to escape.

199
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,683
During these past days of escape,

200
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,522
the nails have loosened a bit.

201
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:08,323
Please help me loosen it.

202
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:11,402
The scene might be a bit unsightly.

203
00:22:13,563 --> 00:22:14,603
But if you help me,

204
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:19,443
I will grant you a wish in return.

205
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:22,960
Okay.

206
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,043
While I have no pain today,

207
00:22:27,843 --> 00:22:29,043
please help me loosen it.

208
00:23:28,402 --> 00:23:30,162
Didn't expect you to be
so meticulous in your work.

209
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:32,083
Any thoughts on further cultivation?

210
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:35,443
After my injuries heal,

211
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,362
I can indeed find you a path.

212
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:45,122
I think I'd be more carefree
just staying the way I am now.

213
00:23:47,282 --> 00:23:49,683
The Divine are carefree.

214
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,402
The least carefree in the Divine Realm

215
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:02,162
is perhaps just that one person.

216
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:38,096
Hurry.

217
00:24:38,762 --> 00:24:39,920
I don't feel pain.

218
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:43,122
But my body does have its limits.

219
00:27:09,563 --> 00:27:10,576
You good?

220
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,096
Fine.

221
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:16,432
Continue.

222
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:21,122
(I must slay the gods.)

223
00:28:21,122 --> 00:28:22,502
(- ShenLi.
- Your Lordship.)

224
00:28:22,502 --> 00:28:23,603
(- ShenLi.
- Lord Bicang.)

225
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:24,983
(I must slay the gods.)

226
00:28:24,983 --> 00:28:26,923
(- ShenLi.
- Lord Bicang.)

227
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:28,963
(- Your Lordship.
- ShenLi.)

228
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,803
(I must slay the gods!)

229
00:29:18,803 --> 00:29:19,952
Come on,

230
00:29:21,203 --> 00:29:22,384
sunbathe with me.

231
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:32,528
No.

232
00:29:33,642 --> 00:29:35,024
I will harm you.

233
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:36,880
I'm quite formidable.

234
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:39,184
It's fine.

235
00:29:55,923 --> 00:29:57,923
(I know)

236
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,642
(I shouldn't take this.)

237
00:30:01,522 --> 00:30:03,002
(The responsibilities)

238
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:05,482
(on our shoulders keep us apart.)

239
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,362
(However,)

240
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:10,482
(I'm begging for forgiveness)

241
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,683
(for my recklessness,
as I can't and mustn't)

242
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:15,203
(break free from him now.)

243
00:30:17,522 --> 00:30:20,603

(I knew)

277
00:34:42,563 --> 00:34:45,282
(no fisherman could possess
such a unique aura.)

278
00:34:48,363 --> 00:34:49,722
(So, Xingzhi,)

279
00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:52,762
(you found me again.)

280
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:56,363
(What a twist.)

281
00:34:57,682 --> 00:34:59,242
(We're granted
such a fateful relationship.)

282
00:35:16,722 --> 00:35:18,403
(You saved me.)

283
00:35:18,403 --> 00:35:20,163
(Yet, you didn't make it clear.)

284
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:22,883
(Is it because you guessed)

285
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,363
(that I'd surely leave if I knew)

286
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,202
(the person by my side was you?)

287
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:31,242
(We're both aware of
each other's responsibilities.)

288
00:35:32,442 --> 00:35:34,363
(We know the choices
the other would make.)

289
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:38,482
(But what you don't know is)

290
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:41,962
(I, Lord Bicang, am not heartless.)

291
00:35:43,922 --> 00:35:44,962
(I, too, can be vulnerable,)

292
00:35:46,123 --> 00:35:47,762
(wishing to indulge myself
in warmth somehow.)

293
00:35:59,043 --> 00:36:00,762
(So, before my wounds heal,)

294
00:36:01,522 --> 00:36:02,603
(let me just be ShenLi,)

295
00:36:03,722 --> 00:36:04,803
(instead of Lord Bicang.)

296
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,424
I...

297
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:35,242
I can actually see things today.

298
00:37:52,722 --> 00:37:54,603
(Right now, he must be frowning,)

299
00:37:55,282 --> 00:37:56,282
(shaking head with wry smile.)

300
00:37:57,482 --> 00:37:59,002
(Amusing indeed.)

301
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:18,282
You can see things now?

302
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:23,962
My five senses work intermittently.

303
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,202
Today, I lost my sense of touch,
smell, and taste.

304
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:29,843
But I can hear, see, and speak.

305
00:38:31,482 --> 00:38:33,002
It's still considered a lucky day.

306
00:38:33,002 --> 00:38:34,643
Why is it so?

307
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,002
I'm not quite clear about
the specific reason.

308
00:38:38,603 --> 00:38:40,242
Anyway,
there's nothing I can do about it now.

309
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:43,282
I'll just make do for now.

310
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,323
While you appear rough and tough,

311
00:38:51,883 --> 00:38:55,083
your manner of speaking is gentle,
cultured, and polite.

312
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:02,843
You flattered me.

313
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:06,762
I just don't want to frighten you.

314
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:11,482
May I ask your name?

315
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:14,183
My surname is Yu,
and my given name is...

316
00:39:14,183 --> 00:39:15,922
Could it be
that your given name is just Fu?

317
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,083
No, it's Yi.

318
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:24,720
Mr. Yu Yi.

319
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,403
Thank you, Mr. Yu Yi,

320
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:30,363
for removing the nails from my limbs.

321
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:32,442
I really appreciate it.

322
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:36,843
I don't want to bother you any further,

323
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:40,083
yet I'm still unable to move.

324
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:43,163
I still need you to take care of me
for a few more days.

325
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:45,872
