only confined you for a month.

So 30 years in the Mortal Realm
have passed.

78
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,420
Please return, both of you.
I will escort my lord back.

Please punish me, Your Lordship.

Thank you for this time.

84

which would have been enough for me.

85
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,059
It was just
that I couldn't escape at the time.

86
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,019
It was all on me. I failed your efforts.

87
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:08,300
Enough. Rise.
Let's return to the mansion.

It's been a long time
since I last slept at home.

89
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,740
Your Lordship, that mortal
has passed away in the Mortal Realm.

90
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,740
I guessed as much.

91
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,900
Did you see him when he died?

92
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,980
He looked peaceful without fear.

93
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,740
(Of course, because he was Xingyun.)

94
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,619
(No matter how dire, everything
was no big deal in his eyes.)

95
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,100
(He must have been smiling still.)

96
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,300
Your Lordship,
do you want to search for him?

97
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,860
No need. I was fond of only Xingyun.

98
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,420
It matters not who he was before

99
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,699
or who he will be.

100
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,819
I will continue to live my life well.

101
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:56,420

102
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,520
Please wait a moment.

(Lord Bicang's Mansion, Immortal Realm)

104
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,139
Your Lordship,
you have finally returned.

105
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,579
I thought I was dreaming.

106
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,019
I didn't believe it
when General Mofang told me.

107
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,660
Let Chef Li cook. I'm hungry.

108
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,704
It's already done. Okay.

109
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:18,300
General Mofang informed me earlier
that you would return today,

110
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,860
so I prepared hot water
and had the cook prepare dishes.

111
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:26,860
Mofang is really thoughtful.

112
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:43,619
You've lost weight.

113
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,780
Has everything been well
in the mansion during my absence?

114
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,740
Yes, it's just Mrs. Zhang,
Chef Li and me in the mansion.

115
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,744
We've been all doing well.

116
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,259
It's just that Shush was lonely.

117
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:03,300
Your Lordship, you are back.

118
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:07,184
You failed to escape.

119
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:10,100
You were caught
and brought back to get married.

120
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,816
Are you upset, Your Lordship?

121
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,180
You were brought back to get married.
Are you upset, Your Lordship?

122
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,860
You are the strongest
in the Immortal Realm.

123
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:24,208
And you were caught.
Isn't that humiliating?

124
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:27,440
Your Lordship, are you upset?

125
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,499
To tell the truth,
I have never seen you bald.

126
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,499
You're joking with me again.

127
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,540
Stop it, Shush.

128
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,379
Never mind it. It can't run away.

129
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,220
Anyway, it can't fly now.

130
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,980
Her Lordship must have suffered a lot
during her days in the Mortal Realm.

131
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,340
Why has Her Lordship become so violent?

132

(Lingxiao Hall, Divine Realm)

133
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,220
It's an auspicious omen.

134
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:29,699
Has another god been born
in the Extranatural Heaven?

135
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,860
You're clueless, Lu Qing.

136
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,540
When the last ancient god was born
tens of thousands of years ago,

137
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,900
a celestial spectacle
appeared everywhere.

138
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,900
All the flowers bloomed,
and all the birds sang as one.

139
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,139
This doesn't match his birth.

140
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,139
I guess Lord Xingzhi has made
another breakthrough in his cultivation.

141
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,300
Speaking of him, we haven't heard from
him for a long time.

142
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,059
Heavenly Lord.

143
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,144
Heavenly Lord.

144
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,420
The sky. Surely,
Lord Xingzhi has returned.

145
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,699
Come with me to welcome His Lordship.

146
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:09,900
Yes. Shall we inform others?

147
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,420
His Lordship is low-key and didn't tell
others about his descent this time.

148
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,459
Don't be gossipy.

149
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,376
Okay.

150
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,059
Welcome back.

151
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,939
You haven't been busy lately?
You came personally to greet me?

152
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:47,139
There hasn't been
much official business.

153
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,980
Yes, people here seem leisurely.

154
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,340
You could try getting
something for yourself to do.

155
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,300
Yes. Has your journey
to the Mortal Realm been smooth?

156
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,060
Smooth?

157
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,619
I knew it'd be smooth.

158
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,464
Not exactly.

159
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,379
It's also good
to go through some hard times.

160
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,660
I want to pay homage
to the deceased gods by myself.

161
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:30,900
That is good.
I'll leave you alone, Your Lordship.

162
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:37,019
If someone inquires with you
about my descent to the Mortal Realm.

163
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,064
Remember to deny it for me.

164
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:40,499
Sure.

165
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:51,979
Why is it hard
to understand Lord Xingzhi?

166
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:56,300
His Lordship has his reasons.
Do not over-inquire.

167
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,288
Alright.

168
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:00,180
That is good.

Now, only you remain
in the Mortal Realm.

175
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,219
I felt bored in this place before,

176
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,768
so I thought about becoming
a mortal in the Mortal Realm,

177
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,580
putting aside everything to live a life.

178
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,660
But who would've thought
the Mortalizing Platform took away

179
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,259
my divine power
but left my memories intact?

180
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,739
What a blunder.

181
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,940
But my journey
in the Mortal Realm was not in vain.

182
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:05,339
I met an interesting person.

183
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:13,180
But that's it.

184
00:20:16,404 --> 00:20:19,024
(Lord Qingye)

185
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:41,428
(Lord Bicang's Mansion)

186
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,379
Heavenly Golden Lock Box.

187
00:21:05,019 --> 00:21:09,780
When I got this, I thought there was
nothing left for me to hide anymore.

188
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:24,560
(Furong's Mansion, Divine Realm)

189
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,339
What is this?

190
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,619
Your Lordship, someone just brought
words from Her Holiness

191
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:25,460
that bridal outfits were sent over here.

192
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,512
You need to go and choose.

193
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:28,816
You junk.

194
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,859
Please calm down.

195
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:33,180
Didn't she run away?
Why should I choose a wedding robe now?

196
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,379
Lord Bicang was found
and brought back a month ago.

197
00:22:36,979 --> 00:22:39,139
Isn't she strong?
Why did she blow it this time?

198
00:22:40,339 --> 00:22:43,379
During these days when you were
in the Mortal Realm and locked up,

199
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:45,300
Furong of the Divine Realm
has done much mischief.

200
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:50,060
He even made a scene
before the Heavenly Lord many times

201
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,499
to refuse to marry you.

202
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,580
As if you wanted him.

203
00:22:58,379 --> 00:22:59,940
I feel better now.

204
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:06,180
(At least someone is tormented
by this marriage just like me.)

205
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,099
(Just thinking about it makes me happy.)

206
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:28,060
Grandfather.

207
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,700
I'm so miserable.

208
00:23:30,979 --> 00:23:32,060
Greet Lord Xingzhi.

209
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:39,780
(Lord Xingzhi,
the only ancient god who's still alive.)

210
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,024
Greetings, Your Lordship.

211
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,339
A very lively young man.

212
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,940
He's but a good-for-nothing.

213
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,920
What's wrong with you now?

214
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,540
Grandfather,

215
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,928
I can't marry Lord Bicang
of the Immortal Realm.

216
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,859
My illness will affect the relations
between the two realms.

217
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,540
How disrespectful.

218
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,219
Tell me. What ailment do you have?

219
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:26,420
You can come up with any lie.

220
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:31,540
You scoundrel.

221
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:34,379
I am telling you.
The wedding date is set.

222
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:37,552
Even if your legs are broken,
you will still have to marry her.

223
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,680
Continue.

224
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,660
Please, Grandfather.

225
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,580
Lord Bicang is unwilling too.

226
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,420
She's already run away once.
If I marry her,

227
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,099
she'll vent all her fury
on me and I won't take it.

228
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,048
You...

229
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,280
What's wrong?

230
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,540
You were wandering around before,
so you might not know it.

231
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,739
We and the Immortal
are negotiating a marriage alliance.

232
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,540
The two young ones are a bit unwilling
and anxious about this marriage.

233
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,660
But it doesn't matter.
Since it was proposed by you,

234
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,019
it's absolutely irrevocable.

235
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,139
Your Lordship.

236
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,800
Long time no see.

237
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,888
Long time no see.

238
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,420
I finally saw you come out
of the Extranatural Heaven.

239
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,339
Where are you going?

240
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,600
To the Mortal Realm.

241
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,499
I-I-It's been 1,000 years.

242
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:41,060
Why do you want to go there
immediately upon coming out?

243
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,064
Is there any urgent matter?

244
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,259
Nothing. I'm just bored
and looking for some fun.

245
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:54,060
Are you here for something?

246
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,900
Yes. We want to form a marriage alliance
with the Immortal Realm.

247
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
I was finalizing the candidates for it.

248
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,060
Suddenly,
I noticed the divine light here

249
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,099
and thought it must be you.

250
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,619
It was so coincidental,
so I was thinking

251
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,259
of asking for your approval

252
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:15,420
to this millennial union
between the two realms.

253
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,580
The only candidate in the Immortal Realm
is the Lord of War, Bicang.

254
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,608
Alright.

255
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:26,420
Wait a second. Come on.

256
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:28,976
What is this?

257
00:26:28,976 --> 00:26:31,760
These are our candidates.
Please pick one.

258
00:26:33,712 --> 00:26:35,984
The 33rd one.

259
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,800
(Furong)

260
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,824
Furong?

261
00:26:48,379 --> 00:26:52,280
Furong. Good.
Let it be her. That name is good.

262
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,328
But Furong...

263
00:26:56,784 --> 00:26:57,880
Farewell.

264
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,800
How could it be that young brat?

265
00:27:05,232 --> 00:27:10,079
I-I-I was chosen by you, Your Lordship?

266
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,808
It seems so.

267
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,520
You've lived in the Extranatural Heaven
for countless years.

268
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,279
Do you even know us?

269
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,279
How on earth did you
choose the candidate?

270
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,312
How dare you!

271
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,559
It is a great honor
to be granted a marriage by you.

272
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,120
But

273
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,840
I've never had any encounter
with Lord Bicang.

274
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,159
But it is heard she has a silver spear
and is fearsome... I mean captivating.

275
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:53,960
I'm not yet ready to marry such a wife.

276
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,480
How daring! Bring me
my Immortal-Hitting Whip.

277
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,799
Let it be.

278
00:28:07,439 --> 00:28:10,360
Since both of them are so resistant,

279
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,919
how about we postpone the wedding date

280
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,159
and give them some time?

281
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:25,640
If they're forced together,
I fear there might be bloodshed.

282
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,199
The wedding date is set. It's not
appropriate to suddenly change it.

283
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,319
Speaking of that, it was my fault.

284
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,120
I thought Lord Bicang, ShenLi, was a man

285
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,760
and that Furong was a woman.

286
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,679
Their names sounded matched,
one strong and one soft.

287
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,159
But it turns out that I was mistaken.

288
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,559
So I'm gonna give them a respite

289
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,880
as a token of my kindness
to the two young ones.

290
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,960
It's settled then.

291
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,032
Alright.

292
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,919
Thank you.

293
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:23,252
(South Celestial Gate, Divine Realm)

294
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,919
Are you okay?

295
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,159
Yeah, but it is strange.

296
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,159
Since it was a mistake,
why not simply cancel the marriage?

297
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,919
Why delay it further?

298
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,799
"Furong was a woman."

299
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,799
So he was implying my name
sounded effeminate.

300
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,079
What are you saying?

301
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,840
Never mind. I have more free time now.

302
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,120
Let's go visit
the Flower Deity at the Flower Pond.

303
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,399
Sir.

304
00:30:16,368 --> 00:30:18,896
(Xutian Abyss, Immortal Realm)

305
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,319
I'd like two candied lotus seeds.
The kind that's not too sweet.

306
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,304
Here.

307
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,960
His spiritual stone has fallen.

308
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,840
I've been so busy
that I've forgotten it.

309
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
Why don't you use
your spiritual power to take it?

310
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,840
Due to the miasma, I don't have
much spiritual power left.

311
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,808
Take care.

312
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,159
- Run! It is miasma.
- Run!

313
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,679
- Madam, leave!
- Nuan.

314
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:20,880
Madam, hurry and leave!

315
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,000
- Madam.
- Nuan!

316
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,696
- Madam.
- Nuan!

317
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,016
This way.

318
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:30,159
My things.

319
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,240
Mother, don't be afraid.
Lord Bicang has come.

320
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,760
It's okay now.

321
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,159
News from the border garrison.
Something's off in the Xutian Abyss.

322
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,079
It's not a big deal,

323
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,679
but the seal has been undisturbed
for a thousand years.

324
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,120
The recent anomaly is worrying.

325
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,240
I request permission to investigate it.

326
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,079
It's about the Xutian Abyss.
It must be taken seriously.

327
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,399
Mofang, you and Zixia go together
to investigate the border.

328
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,559
If there's an anomaly, one stays there
while the other returns to defend.

329
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,880
Assist the garrison in handling it.

330
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,576
- Yes.
- Yes.

331
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:00,399
Your Holiness, those of the Divine Realm
request to postpone the marriage.

332
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,576
Who do they think they are?

333
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,840
Thinking they can decide everything?

334
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,720
- Exactly.
- How can it be postponed?

335
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,559
It's already a grievance
for Lord Bicang.

336
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,079
Think they can reschedule it
all they want? They're going too far.

337
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,760
The marriage agreement...

338
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,600
Alright. All of you leave.

339
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,552
- Yes.
- Yes.

340
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:26,760
ShenLi, you stay.

341
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,376
Her Holiness is ill?

342
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,360
You know

343
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,159
1,000 years ago, Her Holiness
was injured in a battle with the Chimei.

344
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,000
Only in this palace can she recuperate.

345
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,039
Her Holiness went to personally
search for you after you escaped.

346
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,664
You may leave.

347
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:04,752
Yes.

348
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,480
Li, come here.

349
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:16,000
Master, your health...

350
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,192
It's alright.

351
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,439
Do you know what all these are?

352
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:24,976
Court affairs.

353
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,399
Some generals
have pleaded on your behalf,

354
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,280
and some officials refute them.

355
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,159
And some even say they're going
to take action against the Divine Realm.

356
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:49,040
It's been around a month,
and it still hasn't stopped.

357
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,879
The civil and military factions have
already had many disagreements.

358
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,280
And now, this matter
has caused even more rifts.

359
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,879
I feel guilty about your marriage,

360
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,320
but there is no better candidate
in the Immortal Realm.

361
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,080
Li, you need to consider
the bigger picture.

362
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,040
Master, if the Divine truly
want to help us,

363
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,000
they just need to send one to purify
the miasma in our realm.

364
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,599
Then even if that one
has a tarnished reputation,

365
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,839
I'd personally welcome them
by the Ruo Water.

366
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,360
But Furong...

367
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,399
He sounds like a playboy.

368
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,879
He must be a ladies' man.

369
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,599
You know him so well.

370
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,639
I don't know him.

371
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,480
His reputation as a womanizer
is so well-known

372
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:11,399
that even people as indifferent as me
have heard about it.

373
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,960
How can such a man
from the Divine Realm clear the miasma?

374
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:19,000
They're just going to send
a good-for-nothing to appease us.

375
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,080
Li, are you blaming me
for agreeing to the marriage?

376
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,424
I wouldn't dare.

377
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,919
Do you know who arranged the marriage?

378
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,280
Who else could it be
besides the bored Heavenly Lord?

379
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,520
Lord Xingzhi, the lone god lives
in the Extranatural Heaven.

380
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,480
It is thanks to him too.

381
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,199
Lord Xingzhi shows up again.

382
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,399
Does he have nothing else to do?

383
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,760
Li, the Heavenly Lord presented

384
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,320
the names to Lord Xingzhi
and asked for his approval.

385
00:37:10,879 --> 00:37:13,159
His Lordship must have had a reason.

386
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,040
Reason?

387
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,560
Lord Xingzhi has been
in seclusion for 1,000 years.

388
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,720
He probably doesn't know which one

389
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,320
of Furong and me is male or female.

390
00:37:23,399 --> 00:37:24,960
He just carelessly picked any two names.

391
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,040
Those fools in the Divine Realm

392
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,919
even follow his every word.
It is truly ridiculous.

393
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,839
He chose us.

394
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,879
Postponing the wedding
must be his idea, too.

395
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:49,879
He just sealed a few beasts
in the Xutian Abyss. Why so haughty?

396
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,159
He decided on the marriage
and delayed the wedding date at will.

397
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,480
He thinks I can be trifled with?

398
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,800
Lord Xingzhi holds favor
in the Three Realms.

399
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,159
- He turned the tides...
- Slew Liuming and sealed the Chimei.

400
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,520
You have told me countless times.

401
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,439
Then you should know

402
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,199
not only the Divine Realm,
even we follow his words.

403
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,480
Why? With a wave of his hand,
he created the Xutian Abyss.

404
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,879
He has had us guard the seal
for over 1,000 years.

405
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,919
And now, he even wants
to manipulate us through marriage.

406
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,520
Why should we obey the Divine
and be at their beck and call?

407
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
We have so many valiant warriors.

408
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,040
We might as well storm them.

409
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,576
Shut up!

410
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,399
You take a war so lightly.

411
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,199
ShenLi, this only proves
you have never experienced a real war.

412
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,760
Go back. I kept you here
to help you vent your anger

413
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,679
without bottling it up.

414
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,439
I didn't expect it to make you
even more aggrieved.

415
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,000
I don't want to marry him.

416
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:22,576
(Lord Bicang's Mansion)

417
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,599
Your Lordship, you've returned!

418
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,280
Help me. I'm too ashamed to meet people.

419
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,000
Your Lordship, please.

420
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,520
Look at me. I'm all bald!

421
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,679
Your Lordship, don't you feel sorry?

422
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,679
Where is your conscience?

423
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,879
You can't just torment me
because you can't escape your marriage.

424
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:48,320
Your Lordship,
what are you thinking about?

425
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,679
Did you suffer a setback again?

426
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,240
Shush. Come here.

427
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,520
I'm coming, Your Lordship.
Are you going to restore my look?

428
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,199
Your Lordship, you do have a conscience.

429
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,839
What are you doing?

430
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:06,896
You're dirty.

431
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Come to think of it,
I have never seen you bathe.

432
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,320
Rouya, prepare water.

433
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:21,359
Your Lordship, I'm coughing up blood!

434
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,639
Please spare me.
Are you in a bad mood, Your Lordship?

435
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:28,040
I want to see every aspect of you.

436
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:30,096
What did you say, Your Lordship?

437
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:31,152
It's nothing.

438
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:33,639
Your Lordship.

439
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,159
What happened to her?

440
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:37,439
