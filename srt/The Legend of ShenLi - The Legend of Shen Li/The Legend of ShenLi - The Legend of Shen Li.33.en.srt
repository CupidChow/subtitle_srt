(I can't breach this barrier,)

4
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,802
(or it will harm Xingzhi.)

5
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:51,882
(That man is really too bad.)

6
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:54,003
(He's expert in formations.)

7
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:55,632
(Every formation)

8
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,123

9
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:03,443
(Xingzhi repaired
the distant fallen rocks previously)

Just now,

14
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:09,442
I saw my master.

15
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,242
Is this what Xingzhi left in the scroll

16
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:15,843
or an illusion?

17
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:22,128
Well...

Why isn't the making
of a Chimei over yet?

103

Is the power offered not enough?

104
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:14,803
(Liuyu, Immortal Realm)
The Fire element.

105
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:16,202
The Fire element.

106
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:17,682
The Fire element.

107
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:20,363
(Liuming, former Immortal Lord)
If we integrate it into this...

108
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:23,483
Oh, right.

109
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:25,843
A nirvanic phoenix with the power
of the Five Elements

110
00:11:25,843 --> 00:11:27,442
can bear the supreme energy.

111
00:11:27,952 --> 00:11:29,003
Liuyu,

112
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:31,403
how about we make this into a phoenix?

113
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,522
That's the best of the ideas

114
00:11:41,264 --> 00:11:42,302
that we've thought of.

115
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,743
The current materials
and a phoenix feather,

116
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:46,562
with ten times the firepower.

117
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:48,483
It might take shape.

118
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,923
Phoenix feathers.

119
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:53,456
Phoenix feathers.

120
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:00,720
Phoenix feathers.

121
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:04,912
Come on.

122
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,923
Let me add all the firepower!

123
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:13,443
Once I possess

124
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:16,002
the supreme power to control Chimei,

125
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:19,562
I will have nothing to fear.

126
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:21,723
The Three Realms

127
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,103
will be mine.

128
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:25,843
Burn.

129
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:54,352
It's done.

130
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:01,872
It's okay.

131
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:04,816
It's okay.

132
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:09,392
Don't be afraid.

133
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:12,048
Don't be afraid.

134
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:14,483
You are very safe.

135
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,483
I will not harm you.

136
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:12,882
He was just born

137
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:15,202
and already has such great strength.

138
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:18,923
He is now the King of Chimei.

139
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,456
In the future,

140
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,803
no matter
how many more Chimei are made,

141
00:15:24,322 --> 00:15:26,082
I will be able
to control them with ease.

142
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:29,520
Master,

143
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:32,163
will you continue

144
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,843
to create more Chimei in the future?

145
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:35,408
Of course.

146
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:38,002
There will be a battle
between the Divine and us.

147
00:15:39,202 --> 00:15:40,803
And we'll dominate

148
00:15:40,803 --> 00:15:42,723
the Three Realms

149
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:44,562
and enter a golden age.

150
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:47,632
Master,

151
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:50,043
he is different from other Chimei.

152
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,600
He needs to be taken care of.

153
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,163
I'd love to take care of him

154
00:15:54,882 --> 00:15:56,403
and teach him Chimei' skills for you

155
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,064
so that in the future

156
00:15:58,923 --> 00:16:00,043
he can control other Chimei.

157
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:05,363
Good.

158
00:16:05,363 --> 00:16:08,043
I will take advantage of the time
to develop other Chimei.

159
00:16:09,043 --> 00:16:10,483
Take good care of him

160
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:12,923
and teach him to use
his power as soon as possible.

161
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:15,504
His name

162
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,882
is up to you to decide.

163
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,064
Yes.

164
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:36,784
Feng,

165
00:16:39,723 --> 00:16:40,784
Lai.

166
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
From now on,

167
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:48,923
you shall be called Fenglai.

168
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,016
Fenglai?

169
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:02,480
The King of Chimei.

170
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:04,603
Why would I see this?

171
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,922
(It's bad. He's coming back.)

172
00:17:13,763 --> 00:17:15,463
(If I am to leave
through the time rift,)

173
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:17,202
(I must not tell him about this)

174
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,082
(in case he will seal this loophole.)

175
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,243
(If I can persuade him to let me go,)

176
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,240
(that would be best.)

177
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:37,936
I'm back.

178
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,202
Very good. That's enough.

179
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:42,922
Stop it.

180
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:56,723
Did the meteorites

181
00:17:57,682 --> 00:17:58,883
affect the Immortal Realm?

182
00:18:00,003 --> 00:18:01,008
No.

183
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,042
That's the best outcome.

184
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:06,003
Now Fu Sheng has taken control of Mofang

185
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:09,648
and is hiding in the shadows.

186
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,003
He's still plotting
against the Xutian Abyss.

187
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:14,143
We have spent too much time

188
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,123
at this snowy mountain
and in the East Sea

189
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,442
and the Extranatural Heaven.

190
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:25,483
I must return to our realm.

191
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:34,003
Is this tea too hot?

192
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,728
Do you not want to taste it?

193
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:36,816
Xingzhi,

194
00:18:38,003 --> 00:18:39,562
why must you imprison me like this?

195
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:42,282
You know I won't stay here forever

196
00:18:42,928 --> 00:18:44,080
for you.

197
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:45,712
Why can't you?

198
00:18:46,243 --> 00:18:47,483
You know why I can't.

199
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:54,843
Over all these years,

200
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,123
we ancient gods

201
00:18:58,682 --> 00:19:00,763
have continuously warned
ourselves and each other

202
00:19:02,402 --> 00:19:04,483
not to do things

203
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:07,963
we mustn't do.

204
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:09,922
One misstep

205
00:19:10,843 --> 00:19:12,763
would lead to endless calamities.

206
00:19:14,483 --> 00:19:15,504
If we achieved enlightenment,

207
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:18,283
we would become

208
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,682
a glimmer of hope for the world.

209
00:19:21,363 --> 00:19:23,442
But why must we struggle within the stir

210
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:24,483
caused by the Natural Law?

211
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:26,963
Why must we protect the Three Realms?

212
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,643
Why must we obey

213
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:32,883
the Natural Law?

214
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:36,082
If I am endowed with a god's body,

215
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,282
why give me the heart
of an ordinary person?

216
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,363
If I am to be heartless,

217
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:43,483
why grant me emotions and desires?

218
00:19:44,322 --> 00:19:46,082
It bestowed upon me
an unbeatable strength

219
00:19:47,282 --> 00:19:49,243
but didn't give me an invincible heart.

220
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:56,144
Does the Natural Law

221
00:19:57,104 --> 00:19:58,162
truly

222
00:19:58,162 --> 00:20:00,243
want us gods to protect
the Three Realms?

223
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:02,883
All things

224
00:20:03,763 --> 00:20:04,784
are like flowing water,

225
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,928
gravel,

226
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:09,922
floating clouds and dust.

227
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:14,402
What is there to cherish about them?

228
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:20,203
If I do not protect the Three Realms,

229
00:20:20,203 --> 00:20:21,360
what of it?

230
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,032
Chaos exists naturally,

231
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:32,003
giving birth to ancient gods

232
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:35,883
who possess supreme magical powers.

233
00:20:37,723 --> 00:20:38,843
You are the last of them,

234
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:41,680
so...

235
00:20:42,562 --> 00:20:43,922
I've heard

236
00:20:44,963 --> 00:20:46,128
too many high-sounding words.

237
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,383
Do not try to persuade me.

238
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:49,402
I am not trying.

239
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:53,003
People see you as the last ancient god,

240
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,208
but in my eyes,

241
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,162
you are a lonely person.

242
00:21:20,883 --> 00:21:21,922
Ancient gods

243
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,402
possess the ultimate power.

244
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,603
You're given the supreme power

245
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:28,922
and also the emotions and desires.

246
00:21:30,003 --> 00:21:32,723
You're upset, angry and cold,

247
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:35,202
which is not within your control.

248
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:38,202
It is not your fault.

249
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:43,202
Just proof that you are still alive.

250
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,080
I will not blame you

251
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:50,800
because I believe

252
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,082
you have your own convictions
in your heart.

253
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:56,402
Occasional indulgence is not forbidden.

254
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,123
Do what needs to be done.

255
00:21:58,643 --> 00:21:59,723
Say what needs to be said.

256
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,328
Vent your anger

257
00:22:01,963 --> 00:22:03,088
and frustration.

258
00:22:04,003 --> 00:22:06,883
Don't waste our precious time.

259
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,162
Stop drinking tea. Get a pot of wine.

260
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:15,683
If the Natural Law treats you badly,

261
00:22:15,683 --> 00:22:16,982
curse it.

262
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,862
What's it to the beings
in the Three Realms?

263
00:22:18,862 --> 00:22:20,483
Get a pot of wine.
I'll join you in your curses.

264
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:01,922
You're heartless and unkind!

265
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:09,843
Darned be the eternal Natural Law.

266
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,008
Should we

267
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,363
go to His Excellency?

268
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:33,843
There's thunder in the sky.

269
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:35,824
Disastrous!

270
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:36,848
His Excellency

271
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,502
must have done something terrible again.

272
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,442
That must have caused
the thunder to roll.

273
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,802
Disastrous!

274
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:54,096
Are you alright?

275
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:57,922
Even some curses are not allowed?

276
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,643
You even strike His Excellency?

277
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:02,442
Do it one more time.

278
00:24:09,523 --> 00:24:11,082
Darned be the eternal Natural Law.

279
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,088
Well done.

280
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,584
Are you cooled down now?

281
00:24:26,723 --> 00:24:27,888
Yeah.

282
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,032
Xingzhi,

283
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:37,003
I truly like you.

284
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,440
But

285
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:41,282
I have to leave you.

286
00:24:43,216 --> 00:24:44,336
You...

287
00:24:48,123 --> 00:24:50,523
I've already said it many times.

288
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:52,464
No.

289
00:24:55,442 --> 00:24:56,883
Will you never let me go

290
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:58,123
no matter what I say?

291
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:03,322
Enough talk. Let's have a fight.

292
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:05,040
Alright.

293
00:25:20,243 --> 00:25:21,562
You're serious?

294
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,363
Yes. Let's be serious about it.

295
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:29,322
Here you go. Take it.

296
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:33,243
Do you really think I won't do it?

297
00:25:38,723 --> 00:25:40,123
Unless you kill me,

298
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,723
otherwise, you can't get out.

299
00:25:57,072 --> 00:25:58,082
You just can't do it.

300
00:26:02,192 --> 00:26:03,344
So,

301
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:05,843
Li, put it down.

302
00:26:07,282 --> 00:26:08,363
I'll go get you some food.

303
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,032
Wait for me to come back.

304
00:26:15,504 --> 00:26:16,560
Wait for me.

305
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:54,963
There's a large rock over there.

306
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,883
This place is so weird.

307
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:34,322
A formation from the Immortals?

308
00:27:35,643 --> 00:27:36,720
It doesn't seem like it.

309
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:42,162
Such a large stone.

310
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:44,003
Such a big hole.

311
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:48,763
It didn't hit anyone, did it?

312
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,442
Seems no one was here.

313
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:58,032
Mofang?

314
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:02,544
It's okay.

315
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:06,322
Why is he inside?

316
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,723
They say he betrayed the Immortals
and colluded with their enemy.

317
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,376
Is it really so?

318
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,162
He doesn't seem
to be that kind of person.

319
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:31,682
Mofang, what are you doing?

320
00:28:32,202 --> 00:28:33,562
Have you gone mad? I am Furong.

321
00:28:33,562 --> 00:28:35,363
A sacrifice that came to the doorstep.

322
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:36,402
I'll kill you

323
00:28:36,402 --> 00:28:37,723
and use you to break the formation.

324
00:28:37,723 --> 00:28:39,003
Let me see what you can do.

325
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:47,282
Furong, leave.

326
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:55,920
He recognized me.

327
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,883
You will not find

328
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:09,072
another kind person like me.

329
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:14,603
If you hit me again after waking up,

330
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:16,202
you will be struck by lightning!

331
00:29:46,442 --> 00:29:47,983
He's really thoughtful

332
00:29:47,983 --> 00:29:49,202
when it comes to these snacks.

333
00:29:54,322 --> 00:29:55,763
It seems impossible to persuade him now.

334
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:57,682
I have to figure out a way

335
00:29:58,322 --> 00:29:59,322
of leaving this place myself.

336
00:30:06,442 --> 00:30:07,504
(Will the glow)

337
00:30:08,162 --> 00:30:09,883
(appear on the scrolls here?)

338
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:23,523
(Each time)

339
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:25,162
(I touched the gleam on the scroll,)

340
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:27,363
(I'd always see
some scenes from the past.)

341
00:30:28,402 --> 00:30:29,963
(The first time, I saw my master.)

342
00:30:30,723 --> 00:30:32,363
(The second time, I saw Xingzhi.)

343
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,802
(And then I saw)

344
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,442
(Liuming making the King of Chimei.)

345
00:30:36,082 --> 00:30:38,043
(Does this glow)

346
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:39,322
(show me scenes randomly)

347
00:30:39,843 --> 00:30:40,963
(or does it follow a pattern?)

348
00:30:42,864 --> 00:30:43,963
(Let me check out)

349
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:45,682
(what exactly this glow is.)

350
00:30:59,202 --> 00:31:01,363
(He just looks like an ordinary human.)

351
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:17,360
(Fenglai, Immortal Realm)

352
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:19,024
It's all right now.

353
00:31:20,202 --> 00:31:21,296
It's all right now.

354
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:40,402
Hello, Fenglai.

355
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:42,832
I am Liuyu.

356
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:48,682
Liuyu.

357
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:53,616
Liu,

358
00:31:54,736 --> 00:31:55,760
Yu.

359
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,603
Yes, Liuyu.

360
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:02,922
Would you like some tea?

361
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,464
Tea.

362
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:32,752
Tea.

363
00:32:33,643 --> 00:32:35,202
Yes, tea.

364
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,723
What kind of monster
has Master created now?

365
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:40,912
Fenglai.

366
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:42,682
Fenglai, it's fine.

367
00:32:43,282 --> 00:32:44,802
It's fine, Fenglai.

368
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:46,864
This is too absurd.

369
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:48,763
He made a Chimei

370
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:50,243
look like a human!

371
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:53,584
Fenglai.

372
00:32:54,202 --> 00:32:55,248
Fenglai,

373
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:57,403
it's okay.

374
00:32:57,403 --> 00:32:58,523
It's okay, Fenglai.

375
00:32:58,523 --> 00:32:59,723
It's okay.

376
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:01,520
It's all right now.

377
00:33:02,843 --> 00:33:04,363
It's all right now.

378
00:33:06,224 --> 00:33:07,248
It's fine.

379
00:33:14,922 --> 00:33:16,163
You're just a Chimei.

380
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,723
How can you give me that look?

381
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:18,963
You're angry with me?

382
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:29,082
Muyue.

383
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,123
Muyue!

384
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,503
- No!
- How dare you?

385
00:33:34,503 --> 00:33:35,536
Muyue!

386
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:37,063
- Step aside. Don't stop me.
- Fenglai.

387
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:38,363
- Fenglai.
- Let go of me!

388
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,123
Fenglai, you...

389
00:33:40,963 --> 00:33:42,402
- Fenglai.
- Step aside!

390
00:33:42,402 --> 00:33:44,003
Muyue,

391
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:45,202
don't take it to heart.

392
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:47,202
I'm pissed off.

393
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:49,263
He's just like a child.

394
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:51,603
Muyue, why bother
getting angry with him?

395
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:53,296
What an annoying thing.

396
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,003
Do you still plan
to help him make Chimei?

397
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:03,322
How can you not understand?

398
00:34:04,363 --> 00:34:05,563
He claims he's doing it

399
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:07,562
to help us resist the Diviners.

400
00:34:08,202 --> 00:34:10,362
But in fact,
it's just for his own ambition.

401
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:12,402
The Diviners already know.

402
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:14,803
He will only plunge our realm

403
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:16,442
into chaos and war!

404
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:19,024
Muyue, don't worry.

405
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:20,803
I will discipline him

406
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:22,642
to make sure he won't run amok.

407
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,442
You're encouraging a disaster.

408
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:39,600
Muyue.

409
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,192
Fenglai!

410
00:34:54,162 --> 00:34:56,202
If even the gods can't stop him,

411
00:34:58,642 --> 00:35:00,243
you'll be the last resort.

412
00:35:02,323 --> 00:35:03,803
You need to grow fast

413
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:05,882
and grow strong enough

414
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:09,162
to command all the Chimei of the world

415
00:35:10,362 --> 00:35:11,882
to protect the innocent.

416
00:35:13,323 --> 00:35:15,402
Only then can our realm truly enter

417
00:35:16,402 --> 00:35:17,424
a golden

418
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:19,248
and prosperous age.

419
00:35:26,162 --> 00:35:27,682
I hope it won't be a mistake

420
00:35:31,202 --> 00:35:32,842
to create you.

421
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,162
Let me play for a while.

422
00:36:05,162 --> 00:36:06,256
Be careful.

423
00:36:06,768 --> 00:36:07,823
Catch me!

424
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:08,882
Be careful.

425
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:11,002
Let me play for a while.

426
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,122
Be careful. Okay.

427
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:15,742
Let me play for a while, please.

428
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:16,784
Stand up.

429
00:36:30,003 --> 00:36:31,024
This realm

430
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:33,008
is so beautiful.

431
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:01,283
How is the learning

432
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:02,483
of the breathing technique?

433
00:37:04,763 --> 00:37:06,122
By mobilizing the power within,

434
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:08,323
I can see far away.

435
00:37:09,744 --> 00:37:10,800
What have you seen?

436
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:14,922
I've seen weird things locked in cages,

437
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,083
children playing by the river,

438
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:23,642
beautiful woods

439
00:37:24,763 --> 00:37:25,872
and the starry sky.

440
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,003
Liuyu, the Immortal Realm
is really beautiful.

441
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,128
Yes,

442
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,400
it is very beautiful.

443
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:38,992
Let's go.

444
00:37:43,602 --> 00:37:44,642
The growth of plants

445
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:47,682
may take months or even years.

446
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:49,963
That of animals

447
00:37:50,563 --> 00:37:52,003
takes decades

448
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:53,283
or even hundreds of years.

449
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,243
And the mountains and rivers

450
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,723
take tens of millions
of years or more to form.

451
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,723
The beauty of this realm

452
00:38:03,442 --> 00:38:04,523
doesn't come easily.

453
00:38:10,544 --> 00:38:11,600
Fenglai,

454
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:14,043
so no matter what happens,

455
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,523
we must cherish the beauty of the realm.

456
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,402
And this realm

457
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:29,602
has bred you too, right?

458
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:32,343
Of course.

459
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,642
If this realm is not well,

460
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:36,162
does it mean you will not be well?

461
00:38:40,723 --> 00:38:41,808
I don't want it to happen.

462
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:44,602
I will cherish you

463
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,960
and the Immortal Realm.

464
00:38:57,602 --> 00:38:58,842
I just heard you coughing.

465
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:01,680
I'm fine.

466
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:03,792
Let me do it.

467
00:39:05,936 --> 00:39:07,024
You...

468
00:39:10,523 --> 00:39:11,803
What are you going to do?

469
00:39:11,803 --> 00:39:12,880
Don't move.

470
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:15,763
When I was just practicing my breathing,

471
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:17,763
I saw how others

472
00:39:18,882 --> 00:39:20,282
took care of

473
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:21,642
those who were unwell.

474
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:27,043
Do you feel better?

475
00:39:57,803 --> 00:39:58,896
(Oh, my God.)

476
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:01,842
(He doesn't look like a Chimei at all.)

477
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:05,483
(He's so good.)

478
00:40:07,402 --> 00:40:08,842
(How can I involve him)

479
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:12,083
