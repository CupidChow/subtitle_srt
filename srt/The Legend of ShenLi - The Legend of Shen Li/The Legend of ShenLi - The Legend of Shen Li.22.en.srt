2
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,056
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,759
The Diviners are taking their time.

4
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,018
Why are you in a rush?

5
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:45,138
I'm going blind if you

6
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:46,178
keep locking me up.

7
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:50,576
If it were the old days,

8
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:51,759
I would grab my spear

9
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,258
and wipe out those scoundrels.

10
00:01:56,858 --> 00:01:57,872
The way I see it,

11
00:01:58,818 --> 00:01:59,920
you are infuriated

12
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:02,096
because you got bullied

13
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:03,099
and want to get even with them.

14
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:07,504
You can't leave.

15
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,578
I'll help you get back at them.

16
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:19,824
No need.

17
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,698
Does your wound still hurt?

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,024
Let me out.

19
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,944
No.

20
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,744
Your Excellency.

21
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,218
Your Excellency, Your Lordship.

22
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,659
Your Lordship, the Heavenly Lord
needs you in the Lingxiao Hall urgently.

23
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:58,138
Can't he ask someone to send a message?

24
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,338
Your Excellency,
it truly is an important matter.

25
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:07,536
Lead the way.

26
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:11,578
Let's go together.

27
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,299
Lord Bicang,
news from the Immortal Realm.

28
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,099
The Capital City was attacked
by the North Sea Clan.

29
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,219
Her Holiness is in a coma,
and numerous generals have died.

30
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,218
There is chaos everywhere.
The situation is extremely dire.

31
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,179
When did the message come?

32
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:33,299
It was sent five days ago.

33
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:35,698
But our realm suffered a fire attack.

34
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,079
We've been all running around
to deal with it,

35
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,379
so this letter
has only reached me today.

36
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:43,138
(The report was from five days ago.)

37
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:45,099
(The situation must be even worse now.)

38
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:46,819
(The Divine act so slowly.)

39
00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:48,099
(I have no comment.)

40
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:49,698
(But now,)

41
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:51,498
(any complaints
about allies are useless.)

42
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:53,579
(The more it is at such a time,)

43
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:54,978
(the more I need to stay calm.)

44
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:00,418
So the attack

45
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:02,578
on the Divine Realm five days ago
turns out to be a feint.

46
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:04,739
It was a distraction.

47
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,939
But it

48
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,379
already made you run around

49
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:10,379
in total disarray

50
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,498
with no time for other matters

51
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,218
and not able to assist our realm.

52
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:17,699
Her Holiness is in a coma,

53
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:19,859
and dozens of generals have been killed.

54
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:24,458
Such heavy casualties.

55
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:26,819
That shouldn't have happened.

56
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,579
(Our generals are all top-notch.)

57
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:38,179
I hope you will

58
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:39,498
allow me to return immediately.

59
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:41,456
I will.

60
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,259
Her Holiness's coma means
she must have been badly injured.

61
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,379
Take these pills for Her Holiness.

62
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:47,439
I have gathered my troops

63
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,659
and will soon help you
eliminate your enemies!

64
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:55,079
The chaos in the Immortal Realm

65
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,139
and the attacks they've got

66
00:04:57,058 --> 00:04:58,096
are definitely not accidental.

67
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,139
By normal reasoning,

68
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,659
it's a struggle for power.

69
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:04,816
The North Sea Clan.

70
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:07,659
Perhaps it's just an excuse.

71
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,298
We have come to the same conclusion.

72
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:15,079
I believe there must be
someone in the Immortal Realm

73
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,419
who wants to overthrow Her Holiness
and establish themselves as a lord.

74
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,139
But then, the new lord

75
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,579
will surely oppose us.

76
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:24,099
It is a great trouble.

77
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:30,738
You've had a tiring journey,

78
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:33,458
and the Hundred Flowers Banquet
has not been held.

79
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,659
I'm sorry for our incompetence.

80
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,538
You've been away
from the Extranatural Heaven

81
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:47,178
for so long, so should you...?

82
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:50,018
I will return tomorrow.

83
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,328
Okay.

84
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,099
Thank you for your care.

85
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:41,008
I'll take my leave.

86
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:03,218
I should hold it back.

87
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:08,859
She made me

88
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,939
lose my cool.

89
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:18,859
(Whether it's the world or her,)

90
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:21,218
(you've known it all along.)

91
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:24,048
(You should let go.)

92
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,738
Slow down.

93
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:43,539
Slow down.

94
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:44,898
Be careful. Get up.

95
00:07:50,898 --> 00:07:52,016
Drink some water.

96
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,256
Here.

97
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:10,448
- Who's there?
- Who?

98
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,298
Her Lordship. It's Her Lordship!

99
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,139
Her Lordship has returned.

100
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:32,139
Stop acting like this!

101
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,298
No matter what happens,

102
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:35,979
soldiers must not cry

103
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,579
while on duty.

104
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,379
Any soldier who cries

105
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:41,858
and wavers the army's resolve
shall be executed!

106
00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:43,472
- Yes.
- Yes.

107
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,848
Where is Her Holiness?

108
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,379
Your Lordship,

109
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:51,939
Her Holiness is resting in her room.

110
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:53,904
Still unconscious?

111
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:04,720
Your Lordship.

112
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,298
Have Her Holiness's injuries worsened?

113
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,498
Her Holiness is still in a coma.

114
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:16,859
The Heavenly Lord gave me the pills.

115
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:17,978
See if they can be of use.

116
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,498
We are lucky to have you, Your Lordship.

117
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:23,819
Spare me the flattery.

118
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,099
Why is Her Holiness injured?

119
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,578
Her Holiness was wounded
on the neck by a sword.

120
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:29,859
It was not a serious injury.

121
00:09:29,859 --> 00:09:32,379
- Actually, it was a poison
- Your Lordship.

122
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,488
that put Her Holiness in a coma.

123
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,439
What poison?

124
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:38,879
It seems to be a type of miasma.

125
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,199
It can cause one
to lose their sanity at first

126
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:43,098
and then lead to unconsciousness.

127
00:09:43,618 --> 00:09:45,399
If the poisoned person has wounds,

128
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,259
the wounds won't heal
and will keep bleeding.

129
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,779
But this miasma is slightly different.

130
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:55,779
It seems to cause
great harm to Immortals.

131
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:57,598
But to other things,

132
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,899
it poses no threat.

133
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,939
It's as if it's specifically

134
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:02,459
targeted at us.

135
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,552
Miasma?

136
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:07,699
Is the poison inside me hard to cure?

137
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:11,479
A little.

138
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,499
(But the poison wasn't too severe.)

139
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:16,019
(Xingzhi helped me remove it
by using some of his energy.)

140
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,498
(Now, this poison...)

141
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,819
(Didn't that person die?)

142
00:10:20,298 --> 00:10:21,392
What about Qingyan and Chirong?

143
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:23,759
They were sent by Her Holiness

144
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,799
to investigate the puppet matter before

145
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,928
and have not yet returned.

146
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:28,528
Such a coincidence!

147
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,019
Seems calculated.

148
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:35,696
Those generals...

149
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,658
Have the sacrificed generals
been buried?

150
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,579
Their bodies are still
in the military camp outside the city.

151
00:10:42,098 --> 00:10:43,899
It might take a few more days
before they can be buried.

152
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,808
Why?

153
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,472
According to military regulations,

154
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:49,538
after a great battle,

155
00:10:49,538 --> 00:10:50,858
the soldiers must all be buried first

156
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:52,758
before the generals can be laid to rest.

157
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:53,978
Five days have already passed,

158
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,779
but the soldiers have not
yet been fully buried?

159
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:14,738
Guard Her Holiness

160
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:17,819
and try to make
Her Holiness wake up soon.

161
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:19,759
- Yes.
- Yes.

162
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,816
- Yes.
- Yes.

163
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:29,738
My son!

164
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,498
My son!

165
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:40,779
How could you leave me alone?

166
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,058
My son!

167
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:46,259
My son!

168
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,299
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

169
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,320
Her Lordship is here!

170
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,879
Her Lordship is back!

171
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,379
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

172
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,918
- Her Lordship is back!
- Your Lordship.

173
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:56,699
- Your Lordship!
- Her Lordship is back!

174
00:11:57,418 --> 00:11:59,119
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

175
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,838
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

176
00:12:00,838 --> 00:12:02,618
(They shouldn't be in disarray.)

177
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,418
(These soldiers should not
pin their hopes on anyone.)

178
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:07,538
(They should be orderly)

179
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,059
(and stick to the plan)

180
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,298
(no matter what happens.)

181
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:14,178
(Usually, they are like that.)

182
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,119
(Even if they suffer a defeat,)

183
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,819
(they'd not act like this.)

184
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:19,888
(But this time,)

185
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,538
(the situation seems
more serious than imagined.)

186
00:12:25,424 --> 00:12:26,439
Your Lordship.

187
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:27,440
Your Lordship.

188
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,168
Your Lordship.

189
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,008
I'm sorry for my incompetence.

190
00:12:33,008 --> 00:12:34,058
I'm at fault.

191
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,058
Please stand up.

192
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:43,298
(How great was the blow)

193
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:46,398
(to cause the spirited soldiers)

194
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,459
(to be so disheartened?)

195
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:50,416
Tell me

196
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,139
what exactly happened.

197
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:00,976
5 days ago,

198
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:03,819
a troop suddenly attacked
from the south.

199
00:13:05,072 --> 00:13:06,192
There were...

200
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,538
There were only 200 people.

201
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,298
200?

202
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,064
Yes.

203
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:17,939
Just these many people

204
00:13:18,538 --> 00:13:20,699
could trample our realm
to such an extent!

205
00:13:33,264 --> 00:13:34,320
What's their background?

206
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,858
They were flying the flag
of the North Sea Clan.

207
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:39,339
Burly men

208
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:40,738
clad in black armor.

209
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:41,758
They were amazingly powerful

210
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:42,779
and in their hands

211
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:44,919
were incomparably sharp blades.

212
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,098
They broke people's necks

213
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,059
or beat them to death.

214
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,178
Some even

215
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,058
chopped people to death.

216
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:55,664
Tremendous strength.

217
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:58,939
Their skin was different
from ordinary people.

218
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:01,219
Ordinary soldiers couldn't penetrate it.

219
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:04,538
Only generals with magical power
could hurt them

220
00:14:05,058 --> 00:14:06,339
by infusing their power

221
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:08,538
into their weapons.

222
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:10,819
Were any corpses left?

223
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:13,712
No.

224
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,440
I am certain

225
00:14:16,658 --> 00:14:18,699
I chopped off the heads
of more than 30 enemies,

226
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:21,058
but all the bodies
were taken away by them.

227
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:22,658
Only eight or nine enemies

228
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:24,538
were captured

229
00:14:25,058 --> 00:14:26,178
and blown up by Her Holiness.

230
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:36,939
(If it was them,)

231
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,704
(even 200 of them)

232
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:40,579
(could make a powerful troop.)

233
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:43,899
Who was their leader?

234
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:47,379
A person in black wearing a cloak.

235
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:49,699
He looked like a normal person,

236
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:51,539
but his swordsmanship was strange.

237
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:53,779
Her Holiness was wounded by his sword.

238
00:15:13,978 --> 00:15:16,339
Impressive, Lord Bicang.

239
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:21,178
(It makes sense.)

240
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,379
(But how could he be
a member of the North Sea Clan?)

241
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,779
(He captured many Earth Diviners
in the Mortal Realm,)

242
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,539
(went to great lengths to feign
an attack on the Divine Realm)

243
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:31,779
(and then assaulted our realm.)

244
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:37,978
What exactly is their attack

245
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,399
on our realm for?

246
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,488
Her Holiness's golden seal

247
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:43,536
was taken by him.

248
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:46,576
The golden seal?

249
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,098
Is it really a power grab?

250
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,019
But what can he get

251
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,498
through only a golden seal?

252
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:43,699
(The people lying here.)

253
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,939
(I can call out each of their names.)

254
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,328
(But now,)

255
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:00,899
(I no longer recognize
some of their faces.)

256
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:03,858
(Some bodies are incomplete.)

257
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:06,898
(Some are beyond recognition.)

258
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:10,416
(And some...)

259
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,288
Who is this?

260
00:17:19,499 --> 00:17:20,592
Mofang.

261
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:24,339
He fought to the death
to behead three enemies

262
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,538
but was surrounded by several enemies

263
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,178
and was devoured alive.

264
00:17:32,624 --> 00:17:33,712
Mofang.

265
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:38,000
Mofang?

266
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:41,808
He was devoured?

267
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:02,819
Alive or dead, I must see his body.

268
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:05,099
Or I won't believe it.

269
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,739
I personally witnessed General Mofang

270
00:18:22,378 --> 00:18:23,472
being devoured by them.

271
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:25,898
I am a witness as well.

272
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:40,848
Alright.

273
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:45,648
I got it.

274
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:48,944
We suffered a tragic defeat,

275
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,339
and many soldiers died.

276
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:56,560
If I had been here,

277
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:00,432
perhaps

278
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,472
it wouldn't have ended this way.

279
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:18,672
Your Lordship,

280
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:20,859
don't blame yourself.

281
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:31,219
The dead are dead.

282
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:35,856
Regret is useless.

283
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,272
So is remorse.

284
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:44,944
What I can do

285
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:47,499
is to let those alive

286
00:19:49,258 --> 00:19:50,448
keep on living.

287
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:06,219
How can you leave me behind?

288
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:10,658
How can I go on living without you?

289
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:14,018

I shall

332
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,488
take revenge.

333
00:24:20,378 --> 00:24:22,579
General, solid information.

334
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:24,539
ShenLi returned
to the Immortal Realm this afternoon.

335
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:25,959
She brought back elixirs
from the Divine Realm

336
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,139
and cured the Her Holiness.

337
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:28,319
Then, she used her spells

338
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,699
to soothe tens of thousands
of beings in the Capital City.

339
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:33,939
She was just like a savior.

340
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,579
No wonder she's revered

341
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:39,459
by those stupid Immortals.

342
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,259
I searched the whole palace

343
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,178
and couldn't find the Azure Sea Pearl.

344
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:50,319
Shen Muyue

345
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,819
must have already given it to ShenLi.

346
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:55,152
It seems

347
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:59,459
that we must deal with her now.

348
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:01,439
General, the last battle

349
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,119
cost us 58 puppets.

350
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,739
New ones are still in production.

351
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:06,099
It might not be suitable

352
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:07,792
to start a war in a short time.

353
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,658
No matter how formidable ShenLi is,

354
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:22,819
she's alone after all.

355
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:27,258
Send a few puppets to the Xutian Abyss.

356
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:31,939
Make a big scene

357
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,378
to draw ShenLi out.

358
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:42,418
Then I'll kill her personally

359
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:46,499
and retrieve the Azure Sea Pearl.

360
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,176
Yes.

361
00:25:48,699 --> 00:25:50,898
But the young master...

362
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:57,939
Before the matter is accomplished,

363
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:01,058
the young master must not know.

364
00:26:01,739 --> 00:26:04,298
Yes, yes.

365
00:26:07,138 --> 00:26:09,178
The young master is too lenient

366
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:12,699
with ShenLi.

367
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,859
I will kill her

368
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:19,979
to take back the Azure Sea Pearl

369
00:26:21,658 --> 00:26:23,658
and also to remove a future threat.

370
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:28,258
Once ShenLi is dead,

371
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,339
even if the young master disagrees,

372
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:35,699
he can do nothing.

373
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:45,339
Go find some robust living people

374
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,258
to help me recuperate.

375
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:51,984
Yes.

376
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:05,178
Her Holiness has been detoxified,

377
00:28:05,859 --> 00:28:07,899
but due to excessive blood loss,

378
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,058
she has not yet awakened.

379
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,238
The three of us

380
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:13,739
will temporarily act
in Her Holiness's stead.

381
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:17,538
Riots occurred in many places
when the enemy attacked the capital.

382
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:19,139
But within just a few days,

383
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:20,939
they gradually calmed down.

384
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:22,658
Just like

385
00:28:22,658 --> 00:28:24,038
it was to distract

386
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:25,739
the armies throughout the realm.

387
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:30,178
So

388
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:32,560
it indicates...

389
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,619
A mole.

390
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:37,619
Not just the riots show it.

391
00:28:39,058 --> 00:28:41,538
I spent the last few days analyzing

392
00:28:41,538 --> 00:28:43,479
the enemy's retreat route.

393
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:46,699
Someone not very familiar
with the layout of the capital

394
00:28:47,418 --> 00:28:49,619
would not retreat

395
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:50,898
so quickly.

396
00:28:56,739 --> 00:28:57,898
And what's worse,

397
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:00,819
there is chaos everywhere,

398
00:29:01,778 --> 00:29:02,864
which indicates

399
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:04,880
there are moles

400
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,800
everywhere.

401
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,616
Investigate.

402
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:13,378
Those traitors are familiar
with not only the local area

403
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:15,579
but also our armies.

404
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,360
They must be within the armies.

405
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:20,339
Those who went missing in this battle,

406
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:22,499
the ones of mysterious whereabouts.

407
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:24,439
Capture all their family members.

408
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:25,552
Interrogate them one by one.

409
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:27,600
Report!

410
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:32,279
My Lords,

411
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,379
those monsters impervious
to strikes have reappeared.

412
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:35,408
What?

413
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:37,739
Where? How many?

414
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:39,178
Only four or five of them.

415
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,138
They are heading
towards the Xutian Abyss.

416
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:44,379
The abyss is home
to thousands of Chimei.

417
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:45,779
If they break the barrier

418
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:46,879
and release those Chimei,

419
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:49,099
it would be a disaster
for the Immortal Realm.

420
00:29:49,099 --> 00:29:50,219
- Yes.
- Yes.

421
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:53,298
The barrier won't break.

422
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,579
Everyone, please don't panic.

423
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:57,478
Besides that, what have they done?

424
00:29:57,478 --> 00:29:59,559
They've been burning
and killing along the way,

425
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:01,819
leaving no survivor.

426
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:03,679
Those monsters!

427
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,178
So outrageous!

428
00:30:05,739 --> 00:30:08,038
Your Lordship,
I'd like to go into battle.

429
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:09,079
I'd like to go into battle.

430
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,179
I'd like to go into battle.

431
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:11,280
I'd like to go into battle.

432
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,199
You can't.

433
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:15,239
We were previously unable
to deal with them in the capital.

434
00:30:15,239 --> 00:30:17,239
Can we win this time?

435
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,538
What do you mean?

436
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:20,658
Are we going to let
them do as they please?

437
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:22,339
Even if it costs me my life,

438
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:23,499
I must stop them!

439
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:24,560
Shut up.

440
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,459
How can our generals

441
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:28,319
lose their lives because of that?

442
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,658
It would be a joke.

443
00:30:35,298 --> 00:30:36,368
This time,

444
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:39,079
I will personally confront
those monsters.

445
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,859
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

446
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:43,499
I have previously engaged
with those monsters.

447
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:45,538
But I'm not sure

448
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,098
if those monsters have become
even more formidable.

449
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,218
Just in case.

450
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:51,258
General Zhufei, General Shangbei.

451
00:30:51,258 --> 00:30:52,538
- Yes.
- Yes.

452
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:53,979
The two of you

453
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:56,219
have previously engaged with them

454
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,859
and are more experienced and stronger

455
00:31:00,418 --> 00:31:01,488
than the other generals.

456
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:04,058
This time, you two

457
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:05,619
will accompany me.

458
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:06,704
- Yes.
- Yes.

459
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:10,418
It is not for killing them,
but for capturing them alive this time.

460
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:12,258
Even capturing just one is good.

461
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:14,178
Bring them back for study

462
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:16,178
and find their fatal weaknesses

463
00:31:18,018 --> 00:31:19,178
to prevent another attack.

464
00:31:21,008 --> 00:31:22,064
Yes.

465
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:24,139
Do you still consider us as recruits?

466
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:25,579
One must not act rashly
on the battlefield.

467
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:27,728
We know.

468
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:33,538
The two of you are elites
in the military.

469
00:31:35,538 --> 00:31:36,560
We

470
00:31:37,138 --> 00:31:38,418
cannot afford to any of you.

471
00:32:04,819 --> 00:32:06,138
Set off!

472
00:32:06,138 --> 00:32:08,018
- Kill!
- Kill!

473
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:13,499
We, the villagers of Hongyuan,

474
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:18,538
live at the edge of the Xutian Abyss

475
00:33:19,658 --> 00:33:23,179
and are constantly plagued by miasma.

476
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:25,459
We're weak
and don't have spiritual power

477
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:28,919
to help the Immortal Realm

478
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,259
eradicate evil.

479
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,778
We can only pray

480
00:33:39,138 --> 00:33:41,979
- for peace in the Immortal Realm.
- Kneel down.

481
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:47,459
May all evil beings leave.

482
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:50,979
Bow!

483
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:57,456
Let's go.

484
00:34:34,578 --> 00:34:35,739
Come here.

485
00:34:57,019 --> 00:34:58,779
Just stay here and give him a scare.

486
00:35:11,979 --> 00:35:13,939
Don't go. It's me, Yuan.

487
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:16,699
You scared me.

488
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,719
I knew you were messing around here.

489
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:20,498
It's too dark inside the house.

490
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:22,059
Let's go play outside.

491
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:35,259
Isn't this Hong's mask?

492
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:37,618
He was just here a moment ago.

493
00:36:01,658 --> 00:36:03,138
- What happened, Yuan?
- I don't know.

494
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:04,240
What happened, Yuan?

495
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:09,898
- Run!
- Run!

496
00:36:09,898 --> 00:36:11,539
- Run!
- A demon!

497
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:19,856
What is that?

498
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:25,999
Demons!

499
00:36:25,999 --> 00:36:27,579
Demons! Run!

500
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:28,784
Demons!

501
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,544
Run!

502
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:06,658
You burned the Divine Realm and me.

503
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:08,400
I'm getting back at you.

504
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:22,499
How interesting.

505
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,138
Only you're powerful enough
to be my opponent.

506
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,138
It is my honor

507
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:29,578
to be thought of by you.

508
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:31,339
To be honest,

509
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:34,338
today I wish to get an item from you.

510
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:37,578
I know you will surely not agree.

511
00:38:38,578 --> 00:38:40,259
So please

512
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:42,658
let me take your life here.

513
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:44,658
Who do you think you are?

514
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:01,178
Her Lordship is chasing the mastermind.

515
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,719
Follow Her Lordship.

516
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,792
