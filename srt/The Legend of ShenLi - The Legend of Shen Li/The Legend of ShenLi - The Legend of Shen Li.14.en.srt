=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,152
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,180
Lord Furong,

4
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,699
the spoiled 33rd descendant

5
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,220
of the Heavenly Lord

6
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,460
drove away several attendants
from Lord Bicang's Mansion.

7
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:53,456
You feel embarrassed?

8
00:01:54,276 --> 00:01:55,344
I have someone else to read it?

9
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:00,236
He sold tickets
to Lord Bicang's Mansion,

10
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:03,617
stole and sold weapons
stored in the mansion,

11
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,636
made a scene in public,

12
00:02:05,196 --> 00:02:06,836
undermined social morals,

13
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:09,597
bullied the citizens
of the Immortal Realm,

14
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:10,877
and harassed a female citizen.

15
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:11,920
Unbelievable!

16
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:18,957
Get that disgraceful creature here!

17
00:02:19,517 --> 00:02:21,217
I swear I'll break his legs!

18
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:22,320
Understood.

19
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:28,036
Look what you've done.

20
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:31,476
You're harassing women now?

21
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:34,476
Fine, fine.

22
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:39,196
Fine, fine.

23
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:40,237
Who taught you that?

24
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:50,097
One, two, one, two...

25
00:02:50,097 --> 00:02:51,216
Hurry up.

26
00:02:53,584 --> 00:02:54,597
One, two...

27
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,304
Hurry.

28
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:06,756
You guys can't drink.

29
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:13,008
Treat me to a drink one day.

30
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:14,116
- No problem.
- Okay.

31
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:15,397
- No problem.
- No problem.

32
00:03:15,397 --> 00:03:16,597
See you, Your Lordship.

33
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,648
Take care.

34
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:19,504
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

35
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:21,476
- Let's drink more.
- Yeah!

36
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:23,888
(Lord Bicang's Mansion)

37
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:41,584
Your Excellency.

38
00:03:43,184 --> 00:03:44,240
Rouya.

39
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:46,096
Rouya.

40
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,476
- Rou...
- You're marrying into the Divine Realm.

41
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:56,877
Isn't it inappropriate
to return late at night

42
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,184
with other men?

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,000
Inappropriate?

44
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,057
What would be appropriate?

45
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,184
Tell me, Your Excellency.

46
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:14,437
Is it appropriate
to allow my future husband

47
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,516
to behave recklessly?

48
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:19,877
You're drunk.

49
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,197
I'm very sober.

50
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:24,317
Do you remember what you did today,

51
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:26,928
Your Excellency?

52
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,437
Fine, you made me concede.

53
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:35,152
Are you happy?

54
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:41,676
I bet you don't know.

55
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,836
Your behaviors make me think

56
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:47,917
that you're just a jealous mortal

57
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,477
trying to prove something.

58
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:57,796
What?

59
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,757
Are you having feelings for me?

60
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:16,560
You're drunk.

61
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,752
Diviners

62
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,208
don't have those feelings.

63
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:39,728
That's right.

64
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:42,396
The ancient gods desire nothing.

65
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:45,076
Why would they fancy anyone?

66
00:05:48,796 --> 00:05:49,904
In that case,

67
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:52,797
I have things to do

68
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:53,877
and people to protect.

69
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:57,236
Please refrain from
meddling with my affairs.

70
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:26,956
(Please spare me.)

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,216
Fine.

72
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:36,240
I'll try.

73
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,037
(If I escalate it even more)

74
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:04,656
(and make things worse,)

75
00:07:05,276 --> 00:07:06,516
(I don't believe)

76
00:07:06,516 --> 00:07:07,917
(ShenLi's going to put up with it.)

77
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:19,056
Mofang.

78
00:07:28,236 --> 00:07:29,717
He can't die in the Immortal Realm.

79
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:41,236
(I can't mess with him.)

80
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:42,816
(I can't mess with any of them.)

81
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:43,888
(I've miscalculated.)

82
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,037
D-Don't hit me.

83
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,040
The same trick again.

84
00:08:07,088 --> 00:08:08,208
Your Lordship.

85
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:10,756
What's wrong?

86
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,236
Her Holiness
asked to see you this morning.

87
00:08:14,448 --> 00:08:15,472
I got it.

88
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:28,816
What's wrong?

89
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,417
Last night, Lord Furong
ran off to the Mortal Realm

90
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:38,476
across the Ruo Water.

91
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:42,640
So sudden?

92
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,796
It's all my fault.

93
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:45,957
I take full responsibility.

94
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:47,824
I'll find him

95
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:48,912
and accept any punishment.

96
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:54,320
Did you hit him?

97
00:08:58,596 --> 00:09:00,556
I got drunk and ended up kicking him.

98
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:03,957
Well, whatever.

99
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:05,796
It's a lesson for him.

100
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:08,517
There are no demons in the Mortal Realm.

101
00:09:09,036 --> 00:09:10,064
He's not going to die.

102
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:12,752
Let him be.

103
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,556
No way.

104
00:09:18,556 --> 00:09:20,617
The Heavenly Lord
sent an urgent decree last night,

105
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:22,997
ordering Furong to return
within three days.

106
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:25,520
Please deliver the message

107
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:27,676
for me, Your Excellency.

108
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:34,288
(Was it Xingzhi?)

109
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:36,277
(That was unexpected.)

110
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:38,397
(He didn't seem to care.)

111
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:40,676
(But he handled it so fast.)

112
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,596
(The decree came so urgently.)

113
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:46,277
(I bet he had added
a few things to the message.)

114
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:52,157
(To Your Holiness)
Bring him back

115
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:53,556
in three days.

116
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:56,577
Thankfully, time goes slower
in the Mortal Realm.

117
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:58,236
We have plenty of time to find him.

118
00:10:05,796 --> 00:10:07,356
You want me to look for him?

119
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:13,476
Your Holiness,

120
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:15,397
I'm the one to blame,

121
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,072
not Her Lordship.

122
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,152
Li.

123
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:33,872
Time goes slow there.

124
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:35,504
It's not about

125
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,716
finding Furong as fast as possible.

126
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:39,957
I hope you can

127
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:43,437
seize the chance
and get to know each other.

128
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,488
Do you understand?

129
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:48,657
I wasn't planning

130
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:49,877
to avoid this marriage.

131
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:51,757
I accept it as my fate.

132
00:10:51,757 --> 00:10:52,757
I will find Furong.

133
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:55,236
But we don't need to know each other.

134
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:08,277
General Mofang,

135
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,317
you've disrespected

136
00:11:10,317 --> 00:11:11,556
and assaulted Lord Furong.

137
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:13,637
You shall be punished.

138
00:11:15,637 --> 00:11:16,688
Don't punish him.

139
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,384
I gave him the permission.

140
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,137
Punish me if you want.

141
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,657
I will come for the punishment

142
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,596
once I bring Furong back.

143
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,476
He was heading towards Jinxiu City.

144
00:11:33,072 --> 00:11:35,511
(Jinxiu City, Mortal Realm)

145
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,392
Who are you?

146
00:11:58,192 --> 00:11:59,216
Where am I?

147
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:01,516
W-What are you doing?

148
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:03,376
We are feeding you water.

149
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,796
This is Jinxiu City.

150
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:05,840
Who are you?

151
00:12:06,356 --> 00:12:07,497
You're so well-dressed.

152
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:08,716
Why are you here?

153
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:10,837
Jinxiu City?

154
00:12:12,796 --> 00:12:13,796
Mortal Realm?

155
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:16,304
I have descended?

156
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:21,104
It is the Mortal Realm.

157
00:12:22,288 --> 00:12:23,344
I have descended.

158
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:25,584
I have escaped.

159
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:27,837
Freedom.

160
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:32,880
Here I am.

161
00:12:35,197 --> 00:12:36,240
Ladies.

162
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:38,032
Here I am.

163
00:12:41,488 --> 00:12:42,597
I appreciate your help.

164
00:12:42,597 --> 00:12:43,876
From now on,

165
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,317
you shall enjoy life with me.

166
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,256
Silver!

167
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,737
Let go! It's mine!

168
00:12:56,737 --> 00:12:58,676
Stop it! It's mine!

169
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:02,128
What is that?

170
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:10,997
Forget it. This is my new life.

171
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:12,596
ShenLi, you can't bother me anymore.

172
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:42,796
Auntie Zhang, doing the laundry?

173
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:44,816
Where did you go today?

174
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,556
I caught some fish. I'm going to cook.

175
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:49,397
(Qingsheng City, Mortal Realm)
Zhang, bring me some meat.

176
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,960
Alright.

177
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,437
(Such fine weather)

178
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,476
(calls for a nap under the grapevines.)

179
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:00,080
(Forget it.)

180
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,356
(That's all in the past.)

181
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:03,797
(Now that I'm here,)

182
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:05,437
(I must enjoy myself)

183
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:06,837
(before looking for Furong.)

184
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:40,437
- Lower the sedan.
- Your steamed buns.

185
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:42,077
- Welcome the bride.
- Thank you.

186
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:46,637
Tie the knot.

187
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,837
A double-heart knot
signals long-lasting love.

188
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:54,036
A marital destiny
is fashioned across a distance.

189
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:56,496
Cross over the saddle.

190
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:01,156

I wanted to apologize to you today.

341
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,656

that you had come here.

343
00:27:09,076 --> 00:27:10,096

00:27:35,917 --> 00:27:36,917
I was also at fault.

351
00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:37,236
I was seriously injured

352
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:39,196

353
00:28:41,557 --> 00:28:42,640

354
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,836
exhausted

355
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:49,744

356
00:28:52,956 --> 00:28:54,096
I had never been

357
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,436
that embarrassed and helpless.

358
00:29:05,997 --> 00:29:08,116

360
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,637

361
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:21,917
that I was saved.

362
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,517
It was like running into

363
00:29:25,517 --> 00:29:26,716
a hero from the legends.

364
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:35,757
I met a hero

365
00:29:37,157 --> 00:29:39,076
for the first time in my life.

366
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:48,037
But he was such an ordinary mortal.

367
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,317
I could clutch his throat

368
00:29:50,317 --> 00:29:51,917
and suffocate him to death

369
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:53,476
without any effort.

370
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:59,037

ShenLi?

372
00:30:13,836 --> 00:30:15,157
I guess that was when

373
00:30:17,877 --> 00:30:18,928
I started having feelings

374
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,296
for Xingyun.

375
00:30:23,236 --> 00:30:24,368
Your Excellency.

376
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:28,592
Xingyun.

377
00:30:30,637 --> 00:30:31,760
I'm not stupid.

378
00:30:39,436 --> 00:30:40,436
You saw through me again.

379
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,637
Actually, I've been suspecting it.

380
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:52,397
But I couldn't figure out

381
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:54,476
why you'd be a powerless mortal

382
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,777
instead of staying

383
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:58,397
at the Extranatural Heaven.

384
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:00,464
I'm more powerless

385
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:02,596
as a Diviner.

386
00:31:05,476 --> 00:31:06,656
Wait until you have

387
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,997
lived forever like me.

388
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:09,712
You'd understand that

389
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:10,757
boredom

390
00:31:10,757 --> 00:31:12,917
could trigger many unexpected moves.

391
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:17,836
I wanted to be an average person

392
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,557
in the Mortal Realm,

393
00:31:21,116 --> 00:31:22,836
living an ordinary life.

394
00:31:23,397 --> 00:31:24,464
However...

395
00:31:29,877 --> 00:31:32,157
Even though I became a mortal,

396
00:31:34,037 --> 00:31:35,237
I kept

397
00:31:35,237 --> 00:31:36,917
the memories of a Diviner.

398
00:31:42,436 --> 00:31:43,504
No wonder.

399
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:46,956
You knew so many odd formations

400
00:31:47,757 --> 00:31:48,877
but possessed no divine power

401
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:50,877
nor saw spirit.

402
00:31:51,836 --> 00:31:52,917
A mortal body

403
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:55,557
couldn't bear so many memories.

404
00:31:58,797 --> 00:31:59,956
No wonder you were a sickly fella.

405
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:07,436
Since you remembered everything,

406
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:10,157
why did you act like a stranger?

407
00:32:22,637 --> 00:32:24,037
For the same reason

408
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:28,116
you drove Mofang back to the capital

409
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,960
from the barracks.

410
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,064
You don't like me.

411
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:37,037
So you hate to give me false hope.
Right?

412
00:32:41,157 --> 00:32:43,397
It's better to act like a stranger.

413
00:32:52,976 --> 00:32:54,064
So...

414
00:32:56,397 --> 00:32:57,517
So that is what you mean.

415
00:33:06,476 --> 00:33:07,504
Xingzhi.

416
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,216
Do you even know

417
00:33:10,216 --> 00:33:11,797
how to make someone dislike you?

418
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,397
You were obviously luring me.

419
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,440
Or

420
00:33:20,637 --> 00:33:22,397
you had no idea what you were doing?

421
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:26,320
You were lured?

422
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:29,648
Is that possible?

423
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,037
Don't get me wrong, Your Excellency.

424
00:33:36,157 --> 00:33:37,517
I am Lord Bicang.

425
00:33:39,277 --> 00:33:40,716
How can I lack judgment?

426
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:49,797
The man I met was Xingyun, the mortal.

427
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:53,997
So I could fall for him.

428
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:58,037
But you are an ancient god.

429
00:33:59,557 --> 00:34:01,716
How can I extend those emotions to you?

430
00:34:03,116 --> 00:34:04,116
The change of identity

431
00:34:04,797 --> 00:34:06,037
truly changes many things.

432
00:34:07,076 --> 00:34:08,144
If we meet

433
00:34:08,837 --> 00:34:10,156
on the battlefield one day,

434
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:14,956
I will play my role as Lord Bicang.

435
00:34:19,088 --> 00:34:20,176
But the two realms

436
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:22,617
will be allied through marriage soon.

437
00:34:22,617 --> 00:34:23,837
There won't be a war.

438
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:27,177
What I'm trying to say is,

439
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:28,757
you won't be Xingyun

440
00:34:28,757 --> 00:34:30,037
if you don't want to be.

441
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:32,236
There's nothing to hide.

442
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:34,997
To me,

443
00:34:35,797 --> 00:34:37,037
Xingyun died a long time ago.

444
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:43,196
You are Lord Xingzhi.

445
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:48,304
ShenLi.

446
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:49,517
Both Xingyun

447
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,517
and Xingzhi

448
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:53,636
have been just me.

449
00:34:56,944 --> 00:34:58,128
No.

450
00:34:59,077 --> 00:35:00,156
They are different for me.

451
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:07,632
So

452
00:35:09,236 --> 00:35:10,557
I will follow your order

453
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:12,557
and marry Lord Furong.

454
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:15,956
I no longer have any ties with you.

455
00:35:23,117 --> 00:35:24,396
Don't worry, Your Excellency.

456
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:31,632
Alright.

457
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:37,396
It's for the best that

458
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:41,557
you can come around it.

459
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:54,096
The city gate is closing.

460
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:56,797
I may not come to Qingsheng City again.

461
00:35:57,636 --> 00:35:58,916
I'll look for Furong in Jinxiu City.

462
00:35:59,597 --> 00:36:00,624
Your Excellency.

463
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:02,352
Where are you going?

464
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:07,837
I'm planning...

465
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:15,636
A strange aura.

466
00:36:16,517 --> 00:36:17,956
And it's not friendly.

467
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,176
Can't you feel it?

468
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:22,928
Even so,

469
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:24,876
why are you dragging me away?

470
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:28,037
Do I need to hide?

471
00:36:33,872 --> 00:36:34,960
I almost forgot.

472
00:36:35,632 --> 00:36:36,720
You are not Xingyun.

473
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:39,117
You can roam around

474
00:36:39,117 --> 00:36:40,277
in the Three Realms.

475
00:36:40,837 --> 00:36:41,997
Others can only make way.

476
00:36:49,904 --> 00:36:50,960
You...

477
00:36:52,396 --> 00:36:53,837
You're so presumptuous.

478
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:55,797
But then again,

479
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:57,476
you are a Diviner.

480
00:36:59,436 --> 00:37:00,560
Earth Diviner?

481
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,097
The aura of an Earth Diviner.

482
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,196
How can they catch him

483
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:05,517
without a divine decree?

484
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:14,672
Ice Forming Spell?

485
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,672
Water Halting Spell.

486
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:24,496
What's the difference?

487
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,137
Water Halting Spell

488
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:27,676
is an ancient mystical spell,

489
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:30,057
which freezes everything.

490
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:31,636
And the Ice Forming Spell is something

491
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:33,552
I haven't heard of.

492
00:37:34,357 --> 00:37:35,504
It's nothing.

493
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,457
What spell is it?

494
00:37:58,457 --> 00:37:59,600
Binding Spell.

495
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,316
Thank you for saving my life.

496
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:08,476
It's been ages
and you are still so powerless.

497
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:12,837
Y-You are...

498
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:14,608
That's right, it's me.

499
00:38:15,716 --> 00:38:16,716
Why did they catch you?

500
00:38:19,517 --> 00:38:21,276
It's a long story.

501
00:38:21,276 --> 00:38:23,677
A sect started

502
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:24,716
this mess.

503
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:26,977
(Three months ago,)

504
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:29,597
(a minor sect called the Fusheng Sect)

505
00:38:29,597 --> 00:38:31,357
(gained fame in the martial world.)

506
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:33,797
(It had nothing to do with us.)

507
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:36,757
(But they started holding feasts
for the Earth Diviners.)

508
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:39,676
(Many were invited and went there)

509
00:38:40,636 --> 00:38:42,517
(but we never heard from them again.)

510
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:44,617
(We didn't)

511
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:46,077
(pay much attention to it.)

512
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:48,636
(But the sect people came again)

513
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:50,137
(and extended another invitation.)

514
00:38:50,137 --> 00:38:51,917
- Let's go.
- (Many of us went with them).

515
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:53,297
(Again, nobody returned.)

516
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:54,416
Let's go.

517
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:56,636
(We knew something was wrong.)

518
00:38:57,156 --> 00:38:59,377
(So when they invited us
for the third time,)

519
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:00,636
(nobody would go.)

520
00:39:01,357 --> 00:39:02,577
(We didn't expect that)

521
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,937
(they'd turn hostile)

522
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:05,277
(and start capturing us.)

523
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:18,317
There aren't many of us
in the first place.

524
00:39:18,997 --> 00:39:21,296
Some went voluntarily
and some got captured.

525
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:22,997
Then, the sect managed to

526
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:24,577
take the remnants.

527
00:39:24,577 --> 00:39:25,956
It's only been a few months,

528
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:27,837
but I'm afraid I'm the only one left

529
00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:30,517
for hundreds of miles around.

530
00:39:31,196 --> 00:39:33,077
I survived by hiding in the city.

531
00:39:33,597 --> 00:39:35,077
The crowd helped me

532
00:39:35,077 --> 00:39:36,317
hide a bit longer.

533
00:39:36,837 --> 00:39:38,957
But they caught me in the end.

534
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:40,236
I wouldn't make it home

535
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:43,156
if it weren't for you today.

536
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:47,137
You are Diviners, after all.

537
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,377
You may not be powerful,

538
00:39:48,377 --> 00:39:50,436
but you surely can't be that powerless.

539
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:52,676
Some powerful Earth Diviners

540
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:54,077
tried to resist.

541
00:39:55,277 --> 00:39:57,797
But it seems they have
specific ways to deal with us.

542
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,837
Look at this rope.

543
00:40:00,396 --> 00:40:01,757
As long as you're tied up,

544
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:04,096
you can't break free
no matter how much you struggle.

545
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,076
Some Earth Diviners said that

546
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:07,120
the attackers

547
00:40:07,797 --> 00:40:09,517
weren't using the Divine spells.

548
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,472
It was something

549
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:14,876
from your Immortal Realm.

550
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:20,517
(The two realms had no mutual trust.)

551
00:40:21,676 --> 00:40:24,476
(It's not scary to have a falling out
with the Divine Realm.)

552
00:40:25,436 --> 00:40:27,037
(But it's hard to accept it)

553
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:28,117
(if we fall for)

554
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:30,037
(someone's trick.)

555
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:35,837
Undo your spell.

556
00:40:40,317 --> 00:40:42,396
Isn't it inappropriate
to command an ancient god?

557
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:44,208
Hurry up.

558
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:50,936
I only ask each question once.

559
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:51,997
Answer properly,

560
00:40:52,757 --> 00:40:54,597
or I will cut off your fingers.

561
00:40:54,597 --> 00:40:56,277
Count the fingers you have.

562
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,597
Who sent you to catch
the Earth Diviners?

563
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:04,236
Talk.

564
00:41:04,236 --> 00:41:05,296
Our sect leader.

565
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:12,464
He's been cursed.

566
00:41:13,277 --> 00:41:14,997
They die if they answer questions

567
00:41:14,997 --> 00:41:16,112
they shouldn't.

568
00:41:16,997 --> 00:41:18,597
What a vicious curse.

569
00:41:19,557 --> 00:41:20,624
It's a dead end.

570
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:25,808
Perhaps,

571
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:29,097
I can help you
find the other Earth Diviners.

572
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:30,557
How?

573
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:32,037
The ancient god of the earth

574
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:33,037
bestowed his power

575
00:41:33,797 --> 00:41:34,917
on the earth

576
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:36,317
before he perished.

577
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,217
All the Earth Diviners

578
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:40,517
are blessed by the Earth God

579
00:41:41,077 --> 00:41:43,477
with a hint of ancient divine power.

580
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:45,037
Unfortunately,

581
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:47,297
the Earth God
has been gone for too long.

582
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:50,036
We can only maintain a weak connection.

583
00:41:50,036 --> 00:41:52,277
But I have a general feeling

584
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,077
about where they are.

585
00:41:54,077 --> 00:41:56,196
Fine, that will work.

586
00:41:56,837 --> 00:41:59,016
Lead the way. Let's save them.

587
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,240
Alright.

588
00:42:06,448 --> 00:42:07,472
Your Excellency.

589
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:09,357
I've come to look for

590
00:42:09,357 --> 00:42:10,517
Lord Furong.

591
00:42:12,436 --> 00:42:13,557
But this is urgent.

592
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:16,317
Maybe you could look for him.

593
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,104
Your Excellency?

594
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:24,757
Don't worry about Furong.

595
00:42:26,716 --> 00:42:27,760
What's on your mind?

596
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:30,160
I'm thinking

597
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:32,497
why they'd catch so many

598
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:33,537
Earth Diviners.

599
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:34,704
Any ideas?

600
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:37,077
Based on what Hulu said,

601
00:42:37,712 --> 00:42:38,736
if they caught

602
00:42:39,277 --> 00:42:41,317
the Earth Diviners to get their power,

603
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,716
perhaps

604
00:42:43,716 --> 00:42:45,557
they were after
the power of the ancient god.

605
00:42:46,716 --> 00:42:47,837
If that is the case,

606
00:42:47,837 --> 00:42:48,876
this is not

607
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:50,800
a simple matter.

608
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:53,876
We should look into it.

609
00:42:57,104 --> 00:42:58,128
Alright.

610
00:42:58,837 --> 00:42:59,997
You'll break the formation

611
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:01,717
and the spells.

612
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:02,736
I'll do the beating.

613
00:43:03,716 --> 00:43:04,752
You are a girl.

614
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:06,640
Be discreet.

615
00:43:17,037 --> 00:43:18,517
You are a girl.

616
00:43:19,636 --> 00:43:21,396
Don't treat yourself like a man.

617
00:43:23,956 --> 00:43:25,377
(Such demeanor and tone)

618
00:43:25,377 --> 00:43:26,597
(are identical to Xingyun's.)

619
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:30,156
(He was trying to disguise himself.)

620
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,277
(But we talked it over.)

621
00:43:33,797 --> 00:43:34,917
(And he's exposing)

622
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:35,997
(all those bad traits.)

623
00:43:37,277 --> 00:43:39,077
(How I wish I could
give him a good beating.)

624
00:43:39,956 --> 00:43:41,156
(What's his problem?)

625
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:42,197
(He rejected me)

626
00:43:42,197 --> 00:43:43,317
(and kept luring me.)

627
00:43:55,728 --> 00:43:56,784
It's been a thousand years.

628
00:43:58,436 --> 00:43:59,876
