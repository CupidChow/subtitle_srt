00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,248
=Episode 32=

3
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:43,523
Lord Bicang! I can't believe it's her.

4
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:45,782
She's alive? I'll inform Heavenly Lord.

5
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:47,003
Go ahead.

6
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,784
Are you heading
to the Extranatural Heaven?

7
00:01:48,784 --> 00:01:49,883
Please wait.

8
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:52,343
You acted
rather impulsively at the East Sea

9
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,563
and shook the Extranatural Heaven.

10
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:55,163
It may not be a good time to return.

11
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,000
Please hold.

12
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:00,403
How can it be? ShenLi?

13
00:02:01,043 --> 00:02:02,843
- Your Excellency...
- She's still alive?

14
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:04,562
- He found her!
- You shouldn't have.

15
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:08,642
Lord Bicang is a real calamity.

16
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:10,683
Has His Excellency

17
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:12,562
fallen for her tricks?

18
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,323
Maybe it's plotted
by the Immortal Realm.

19
00:02:15,922 --> 00:02:17,040
Indeed.

20
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,323
I bet you haven't imagined that

21
00:02:21,762 --> 00:02:22,803
you'd be accused

22
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:24,682
of being a seductress.

23
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:27,523
Your Excellency.

24
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,482
You're in the mood for a joke?

25
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:31,536
It's not funny at all.

26
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:36,363
Lord Bicang's nirvana in the East Sea

27
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:38,642
is a great fortune for the Three Realms.

28
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:40,842
We know that love is hard to find.

29
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:44,243
But it's impossible
to have everything we desire.

30
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,823
Please remember
your heavy responsibilities

31
00:02:47,823 --> 00:02:49,503
and sympathize with the suffering

32
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:50,923
of the common people.

33
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,042
Please get rid of your affection

34
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:56,083
to keep the world safe.

35
00:02:57,323 --> 00:03:00,902
May Your Excellency
sympathize with the suffering

36
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:02,402
of the common people.

37
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,743
Please get rid of your affection

38
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:07,963
to keep the world safe.

39
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,323
(See, no one is blessing us.)

40
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:16,122
I know of all the suffering

41
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,842
and hardships of the common people.

42
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:21,482
It's just that

43
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:23,682
I've never done any harm
to the common people.

44
00:03:24,323 --> 00:03:26,482
I don't think you should judge me

45
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:28,202
for something that

46
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:30,384
has never happened.

47
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:33,842
Your Excellency froze the East Sea

48
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:37,243
with Water Halting Spell
for ten days and nights,

49
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,762
violating the Natural Law
and damaging yourself.

50
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,562
The Extranatural Heaven was shaken.

51
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:46,523
Stones fell,
plummeting to the lower realm.

52
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:50,443
No one was hurt, but thousands
of hectares of forest were ruined.

53
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:54,402
The relentless fire burned
in the Mortal Realm for half a month.

54
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:57,923
Hundreds of mountain diviners
worked for days

55
00:03:57,923 --> 00:03:59,443
to extinguish the fire.

56
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:01,520
Your Excellency,

57
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:04,323
is that subject to punishment?

58
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:07,920
That was

59
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:09,904
my fault.

60
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:11,856
I deserve punishment.

61
00:04:12,603 --> 00:04:14,363
You're the last honored diviner.

62
00:04:15,443 --> 00:04:16,503
The Extranatural Heaven

63
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,562
is linked to your divine body.

64
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,162
The stones fell
from the Extranatural Heaven

65
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:24,122
after you found Lord Bicang.

66
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:26,643
If something happens to her again,

67
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:27,863
wouldn't you endanger

68
00:04:27,863 --> 00:04:29,923
the Three Realms altogether?

69
00:04:31,568 --> 00:04:32,603
Your Excellency.

70
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:36,003
How can the people be at peace?

71
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,616
Please do not mind him.

72
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,402
Lord Wuyuan may sound harsh,

73
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:46,362
but he has a point.

74
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,883
Please think twice.

75
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:52,163
Please think twice.

76
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:56,688
Lord Bicang,

77
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:59,182
can you bear to watch His Excellency

78
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,242
face irreversible doom,

79
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,723
and let the Three Realms
fall into chaos because of you?

80
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:06,576
This is

81
00:05:07,723 --> 00:05:08,723
solely my fault.

82
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:12,282
It has nothing to do with her.

83
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:15,083
Please refrain
from reckless accusations.

84
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,112
Besides,

85
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,904
even if I've done wrong,

86
00:05:17,904 --> 00:05:18,923
it's about

87
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:21,883
abusing my divine power
against the Natural Law,

88
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:24,402
and not about

89
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,682
falling in love with her.

90
00:05:27,603 --> 00:05:28,723
Are you saying that

91
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:31,363
you're going to remain like this?

92
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,482
That won't do.

93
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,582
You can't do that, Your Excellency.

94
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:36,723
I will resolve the issue

95
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:38,608
with the Extranatural Heaven.

96
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:41,043
I'll take responsibility

97
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,242
for the burnt forests.

98
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:44,763
But when it comes to ShenLi...

99
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:57,603
I won't back down.

100
00:06:00,176 --> 00:06:01,200
Not to mention you,

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,216
even she can't

102
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:06,082
change my mind.

103
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:13,203
You're our benefactor.

104
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:15,362
I will never lay a hand on you.

105
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:18,122
But I will not let you remain

106
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:20,082
obsessed with ShenLi.

107
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,000
If you do not

108
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:23,763
part with ShenLi,

109
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,623
I won't let you leave.

110
00:06:26,623 --> 00:06:28,323
I believe I've made myself very clear.

111
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,384
There is

112
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,962
no room for negotiation.

113
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:34,800
Those who disagree,

114
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:36,976
as I quote Lord Bicang,

115
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:40,122
can bring it on.

116
00:06:45,808 --> 00:06:46,928
Are you alright?

117
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm fine.

118
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,003
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

119
00:06:58,203 --> 00:06:59,243
Falling rocks.

120
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:00,643
What should we do?

121
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,184
Yeah.

122
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,123
What should we do?

123
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,184
Get up.

124
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,363
Get up. Let me help you.

125
00:07:08,363 --> 00:07:09,520
Heavenly Lord.

126
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,163
I am fully aware of

127
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:18,842
your concerns.

128
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:20,902
His Excellency has his beliefs.

129
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:22,402
And I have my principles.

130
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:23,983
Our top priority

131
00:07:23,983 --> 00:07:25,923
is to stop the rocks from falling.

132
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:28,883
You sound reasonable.

133
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:31,603
We must stop the falling rocks

134
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:33,264
right away.

135
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:38,883
May Your Excellency sympathize
with the suffering of the common people.

136
00:07:41,483 --> 00:07:45,163
May Your Excellency sympathize
with the suffering of the common people.

137
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:14,736
I'm on my way back

138
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:16,402
to the Extranatural Heaven

139
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:18,000
to solve this problem.

140
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:27,023
What about the next time?

141
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:28,723
And what about the time after that?

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,024
None of us

143
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,083
from the Divine Realm

144
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,203
will bless you two.

145
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:52,240
What's wrong?

146
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,640
You can't wait

147
00:08:55,763 --> 00:08:56,802
to follow your principles?

148
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:59,722
I didn't speak up.

149
00:09:01,602 --> 00:09:03,682
But that doesn't mean I agree with you.

150
00:09:05,643 --> 00:09:06,843
We've settled this

151
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,482
on the snowy mountain...

152
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:10,576
That

153
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:17,008
was my fault.

154
00:09:18,042 --> 00:09:19,163
I admitted it then.

155
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:20,562
Since you admitted your mistake,

156
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:25,242
wouldn't you take responsibility?

157
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,203
Sorry, I wouldn't.

158
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:43,643
What a heartless

159
00:09:45,122 --> 00:09:46,224
and faithless lover.

160
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,482
I've made myself clear to you.

161
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,168
You know me.

162
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,602
Let's wait and see what happens.

163
00:09:59,722 --> 00:10:01,843
There's no room for maneuver,

164
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:04,083
be it in the past or the future.

165
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:12,103
Let's go first.

166
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,223
As you said,

167
00:10:13,223 --> 00:10:15,602
stopping the falling rocks
is our top priority.

168
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:17,488
You must

169
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:19,216
help me with that.

170
00:10:20,816 --> 00:10:21,840
Let's go.

171
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:36,058
(South Celestial Gate)

172
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:08,562
Guard the South Celestial Gate.

173
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:10,416
Understood.

174
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:14,960
Who are you?

175
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:17,072
Are you from the Immortal Realm?

176
00:11:19,802 --> 00:11:22,223
I'm a maid of Lord Bicang.

177
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,503
I'm looking for Lord Xingzhi

178
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:24,763
to retrieve my lord's spear.

179
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:27,643
Maid of Lord Bicang.

180
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,922
Your master is quite something.

181
00:11:32,283 --> 00:11:34,722
She's bewitched Lord Xingzhi.

182
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,482
She followed him
to the Extranatural Heaven.

183
00:11:40,883 --> 00:11:42,323
I don't know if she wants the spear.

184
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,203
But it seems that

185
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,042
she has won over His Excellency's heart.

186
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:50,843
Her Lordship? What did you say?

187
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:54,883
Her Lordship is still alive?

188
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,203
She's more than alive.

189
00:11:58,362 --> 00:11:59,562
She's doing great.

190
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,216
Let me see Her Lordship.

191
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,843
You can't just enter the Divine Realm.

192
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:13,242
Get an imperial order

193
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:14,832
from Her Holiness first.

194
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:36,643
You enter
the Extranatural Heaven from here?

195
00:12:38,722 --> 00:12:40,242
Their memorial tablets

196
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:43,283
are naturally placed close
to the Extranatural Heaven.

197
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:48,723
No one is allowed except for the gods.

198
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:50,003
Will it incur condemnation

199
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,283
if you take me in there?

200
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:54,256
I have no idea.

201
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:56,003
You...

202
00:12:56,003 --> 00:12:57,263
How do you know

203
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,443
that no one else has entered?

204
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:01,392
I'm not

205
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,403
the first ancient god

206
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:06,242
in love with someone.

207
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:27,802
As far as I know,

208
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:30,482
none of the ancient gods

209
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:31,523
is so well-behaved.

210
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:47,843
The stars here are stunning.

211
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:49,872
Indeed.

212
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:20,843
Has it always been like this here?

213
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:23,763
Yeah.

214
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:25,023
If these rocks

215
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,323
fall into the lower realm...

216
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,722
Does it have to do with your wounds?

217
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,162
We can't let it collapse anymore.

218
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:31,888
Xingzhi.

219
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,683
The universe has its limits.

220
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:34,082
A thousand paths lead to one.

221
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,344
You're bleeding.

222
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:16,482
I stopped the rocks.

223
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:19,683
Those Diviners

224
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:22,242
keep threatening me

225
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:25,482
with the safety of the Three Realms.

226
00:18:26,962 --> 00:18:28,583
Look around.

227
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:29,643
Who else is

228
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:32,482
as bound as I am?

229
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,242
You stand at a high place

230
00:18:41,842 --> 00:18:42,992
with great power.

231
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:44,784
The people adore you.

232
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:46,576
Who else is worshipped

233
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:48,722
like you in the Three Realms?

234
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:51,643
You can't have it all.

235
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:58,962
I'm just whining a bit.

236
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,243
Why are you scolding me?

237
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,384
My food and clothing

238
00:19:03,923 --> 00:19:06,703
are provided through their offerings
in the Immortal Realm.

239
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:07,842
I have no other abilities.

240
00:19:08,624 --> 00:19:09,680
I can only

241
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:12,122
protect the citizens

242
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,602
and keep those who worship me safe.

243
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:17,242
This is what I can do.

244
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:18,864
Lord Xingzhi,

245
00:19:20,442 --> 00:19:22,403
perhaps we are born
with things we must do.

246
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,003
It is both a duty and a mission.

247
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,384
Do you think

248
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm unaware of

249
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:33,104
these principles?

250
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,824
I like you.

251
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,523
I want to be with you
more than anything.

252
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,122
I want to go back to that courtyard

253
00:19:53,122 --> 00:19:54,463
and sit under the grapevines

254
00:19:54,463 --> 00:19:55,962
with you for sunbathing.

255
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:03,683
I have loved only one person.

256
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:07,202
And that is you.

257
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:12,163
Sometimes, I feel

258
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:15,362
I'm losing myself
because I like you too much.

259
00:20:17,003 --> 00:20:18,003
But I know that

260
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:20,242
love is not the only thing I live for.

261
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,962
I have things I must do.

262
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,442
And you have your duties to shoulder.

263
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:31,523
So...

264
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:32,523
You may be right.

265
00:20:33,136 --> 00:20:35,758
♪Filling the empty spot in the heart♪

266
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:36,848
But at least,

267
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:39,683
love is something you live for.

268
00:20:42,256 --> 00:20:43,322
And that is all

269
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,264
I need.

270
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:52,442
I will take on my responsibilities.

271
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:55,120
And I will help you

272
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:58,082
do your job.

273
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:05,082
What should I do if you

274
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:07,383
finish my job?

275
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:08,464
Just stay here,

276
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,416
and be safe.

277
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,982
That would be great.

278
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:13,008
This is absurd.

279
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,082
Since you have control
over the falling rocks,

280
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:18,832
I shall return.

281
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:24,803
I will not let go.

282
00:21:24,803 --> 00:21:25,936
Unbelievable.

283
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:28,803
Why do I need your permission?

284
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:29,872
I'd feel sorry.

285
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:44,432
I'd feel sorry for you.

286
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,563
Let me handle the dangerous tasks.

287
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,136
Xingzhi.

288
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:00,322
I am not a pet bird

289
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,122
to be caged.

290
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,072
In that case...

291
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:14,032
♪Defend the sun and the moon♪

292
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,155
♪Devote everything
to the long-lasting wishes♪

293
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:20,491
♪Love is hardly complete♪

294
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:24,876
♪We can only protect
all beings from perishing♪

295
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:28,656
♪Toast to the love and hate
engraved into our bones♪

296
00:22:30,202 --> 00:22:32,322
Xingzhi, you...

297
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:34,322
Why would you do that?

298
00:22:38,043 --> 00:22:39,122
You'll be mad, anyway.

299
00:22:40,043 --> 00:22:42,043
At least, it gives me
some peace of mind.

300
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:45,923
Have a good rest here.

301
00:22:47,163 --> 00:22:48,763
I will pay for my mistakes.

302
00:22:49,763 --> 00:22:51,803
I will keep you here.

303
00:22:53,442 --> 00:22:54,448
I'll also guard

304
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:56,624
the Three Realms.

305
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:03,962
I can't reason with him!

306
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:07,408
You're so unreliable.

307
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:08,482
His Excellency returned

308
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:09,962
and you knew nothing about it.

309
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:12,922
How would I know
that they'd turn themselves in?

310
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:15,083
And I told you to go to
the South Celestial Gate.

311
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,563
Grandfather and Lord Xingzhi

312
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,643
almost started a fight there, you know?

313
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,583
Grandfather made me kneel.

314
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,663
What could I do?

315
00:23:21,663 --> 00:23:22,704
You...

316
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,583
I don't sense his presence.

317
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,202
Did they really come?

318
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:11,122
It seems that you do not agree

319
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:13,616
with the way I act.

320
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,242
But I have no other option.

321
00:24:32,912 --> 00:24:33,936
Your Excellency.

322
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:36,560
Are you alright?

323
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:40,816
Where is Lord Bicang?

324
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,483
Yeah, I thought you

325
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,496
brought her back.

326
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,472
She's at the Extranatural Heaven.

327
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,482
Did Her Lordship want to go there

328
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:52,543
or did you simply...

329
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:53,648
It doesn't matter.

330
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,696
What matters is that

331
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:58,602
she has to stay there.

332
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:04,763
Your Excellency, did you

333
00:25:04,763 --> 00:25:06,362
imprison her there?

334
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:13,563
Imprison her?

335
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,722
If you put it that way,

336
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:18,704
then so be it.

337
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,923
This may be inappropriate.

338
00:25:25,883 --> 00:25:27,842
I've made up my mind.

339
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:28,912
No one can stop me.

340
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:30,923
The falling rocks

341
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:32,283
contain spiritual power.

342
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:34,883
I can't let them
fall into the lower realm.

343
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:36,962
I must retrieve them all.

344
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:40,203
If there's nothing else, you...

345
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:42,763
I will go with Your Excellency.

346
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:44,592
But someone

347
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:46,563
from the lower realm

348
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:49,043
may bear evil intentions...

349
00:25:49,043 --> 00:25:50,643
It's fin. I've improved

350
00:25:50,643 --> 00:25:52,023
my power of purification.

351
00:25:52,023 --> 00:25:53,123
Perhaps I can be of help.

352
00:25:53,123 --> 00:25:55,103
Even if I can only
help locate the rocks,

353
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:56,482
it would be faster, right?

354
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,648
It sounds like a plan.

355
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:19,442
You've enhanced
my power of purification?

356
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:23,242
Consider it my way of thanking you.

357
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:37,683
You've finally returned!

358
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:40,643
Did anyone from the Immoral

359
00:26:41,242 --> 00:26:43,743
and Divine realms come to investigate?

360
00:26:43,743 --> 00:26:46,483
My lord, they've been overwhelmed

361
00:26:46,483 --> 00:26:47,504
by the falling rocks.

362
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:48,523
No one has come here.

363
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:26,362
Do you think

364
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,482
you can control me like this?

365
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:40,122
It was Xingzhi's spell.

366
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:44,442
That ancient god is quite something.

367
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,803
You used

368
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,202
your last bit of power to trap me here.

369
00:27:53,763 --> 00:27:54,923
Why?

370
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,952
I've told you.

371
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:58,362
Do not hurt ShenLi.

372
00:27:59,202 --> 00:28:01,482
She actually made you

373
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:04,962
turn against someone who brought you up?

374
00:28:04,962 --> 00:28:06,722
You nurtured me with your heart's blood

375
00:28:08,683 --> 00:28:10,883
so that I could avenge my father.

376
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:14,143
You taught me
to face the world with hatred.

377
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,362
But you have no physical presence.

378
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,763
You don't know anything
beyond loyalty and hatred.

379
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:36,483
If I had known earlier,

380
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,552
I wouldn't have

381
00:28:38,202 --> 00:28:41,883
risked my life
to save you a thousand years ago.

382
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:48,880
It's been 1,000 years.

383
00:28:51,722 --> 00:28:53,322
I've awakened far too late.

384
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,683
I've been looking for you everywhere.

385
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:22,482
The stones are crashing down.

386
00:29:23,202 --> 00:29:24,482
And you're still after me?

387
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:28,602
Never mind the falling rocks.

388
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:31,902
Even if the sky collapses,

389
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,503
I won't let you off.

390
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:34,962
What about those rocks?

391
00:29:35,842 --> 00:29:37,202
Once they fall,

392
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:39,202
the whole city will suffer.

393
00:29:39,803 --> 00:29:41,803
Someone else
is going to handle the rocks.

394
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:44,643
And I am going to deal with you.

395
00:29:45,523 --> 00:29:47,523
You were born from my desire.

396
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:48,962
Don't you know me?

397
00:29:50,482 --> 00:29:52,043
Trying to escape now?

398
00:29:53,923 --> 00:29:54,928
No way.

399
00:30:44,563 --> 00:30:46,602
How dare a cultivator
meddle with my affairs?

400
00:30:58,163 --> 00:31:00,242
Who are you, mortal cultivator?

401
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:02,883
You saved my life.

402
00:31:03,883 --> 00:31:05,763
I acted rashly in a moment of panic.

403
00:31:06,643 --> 00:31:07,728
It seems that

404
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:10,043
you don't need my help.

405
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:14,416
Mother.

406
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:18,992
How dare you leave before I'm done?

407
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,763
Get up.

408
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:21,872
Mother.

409
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:45,923
You can save them
but you can't keep them safe.

410
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:48,282
I bet something

411
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,803
is seriously wrong above there.

412
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,722
It's no use trying to save them.

413
00:31:53,403 --> 00:31:56,043
At least, I have a clear conscience.

414
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,968
Go!

415
00:32:04,602 --> 00:32:05,962
- Go.
- How many people can you save?

416
00:32:05,962 --> 00:32:07,043
How long can you last?

417
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:08,043
How long can you

418
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:11,722
keep a clear conscience?

419
00:32:18,643 --> 00:32:19,962
Forget it.

420
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:22,563
You did help me today.

421
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:53,763
I guess it's not that bad above there.

422
00:32:54,523 --> 00:32:56,442
Someone is in charge.

423
00:33:16,563 --> 00:33:19,122
Fate brought you to me.

424
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:26,923
Your Holiness.

425
00:33:26,923 --> 00:33:29,283
The falling rocks have struck
our abandoned city.

426
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:31,482
No casualties yet.

427
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:38,000
Your Holiness.

428
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:44,848
What about the Xutian Abyss?

429
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:46,943
Ever since Lord Xingzhi

430
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,063
restored the Five Elements Seals,

431
00:33:49,063 --> 00:33:50,542
the Xutian Abyss has been very stable

432
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:51,563
with no miasma leakage.

433
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,883
The falling rocks haven't

434
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:55,202
affected the Xutian Abyss yet.

435
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,383
Good.

436
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:58,480
Your Holiness.

437
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:00,592
Your Holiness.

438
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:02,512
Your Holiness.

439
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:03,568
ShenLi's maid.

440
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,323
Still so impertinent.

441
00:34:05,323 --> 00:34:06,482
Barging into any place.

442
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:08,272
It's fine.

443
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:10,983
Did you get the spear back?

444
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:12,523
Your Holiness, it is Her Lordship.

445
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:13,523
Her Lordship is back!

446
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,483
What did you say?

447
00:34:16,483 --> 00:34:19,343
It's true. A Diviner told me in person.

448
00:34:19,343 --> 00:34:20,723
His Excellency took Her Lordship

449
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,162
to the South Celestial Gate...

450
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:24,432
Your Holiness.

451
00:34:25,162 --> 00:34:26,224
Your Holiness.

452
00:34:33,232 --> 00:34:34,288
Greetings, Your Excellency.

453
00:35:03,216 --> 00:35:04,363
Lan, what's wrong?

454
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:05,424
Grandfather.

455
00:35:06,283 --> 00:35:07,943
Just tell me.

456
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:09,232
Promise me you won't be agitated.

457
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,352
I promise.

458
00:35:10,352 --> 00:35:11,402
You're ready?

459
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:15,152
His Excellency

460
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:17,763
imprisoned Lord Bicang

461
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:20,922
in the Extranatural Heaven.

462
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,064
What?

463
00:35:22,064 --> 00:35:23,216
You...

464
00:35:25,202 --> 00:35:27,342
Didn't ShenLi say she has principles?

465
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,363
What about her principles?

466
00:35:29,523 --> 00:35:31,242
It's about His Excellency,

467
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:32,363
not Lord Bicang.

468
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:34,544
He took the initiative?

469
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:38,003
His Excellency is so confused.

470
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,463
He is so obstinately misguided.

471
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:40,843
What should we do now?

472
00:35:40,843 --> 00:35:42,642
See, you're always so agitated.

473
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:43,843
Then how should I be?

474
00:35:43,843 --> 00:35:44,880
Should I smile then?

475
00:35:46,442 --> 00:35:47,563
Let's go there

476
00:35:49,442 --> 00:35:52,003
and bring back Lord Bicang.

477
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,064
Your Excellency.

478
00:36:11,728 --> 00:36:12,944
I'm fine.

479
00:36:14,482 --> 00:36:16,043
I can feel the rocks ahead.

480
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:19,523
Go look around

481
00:36:19,523 --> 00:36:20,528
this area.

482
00:36:21,563 --> 00:36:22,763
I'll find you once I clear

483
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,456
the falling rocks here.

484
00:36:26,256 --> 00:36:27,280
Alright.

485
00:36:34,283 --> 00:36:36,482
Your Holiness, what brings you here?

486
00:36:36,482 --> 00:36:37,642
Lord Xingzhi

487
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,782
took Lord Bicang
to the Extranatural Heaven

488
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,882
and imprisoned her.

489
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:43,882
It is so absurd.

490
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:46,283
We will not tolerate it.

491
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:49,083
I am determined to take ShenLi home.

492
00:36:52,882 --> 00:36:55,062
But no one can enter
the Extranatural Heaven

493
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:56,402
except for the ancient gods.

494
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:02,483
It is said that Deity Youlan

495
00:37:02,483 --> 00:37:03,763
was frail as a child.

496
00:37:04,528 --> 00:37:05,616
You sought

497
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:07,642
His Excellency's help.

498
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:10,723
His Excellency took her
to the Extranatural Heaven.

499
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:12,483
With such great honor,

500
00:37:12,483 --> 00:37:14,603
you were given the honorary title.

501
00:37:15,682 --> 00:37:17,603
I wonder if you know

502
00:37:18,642 --> 00:37:20,763
how he ascends
to the Extranatural Heaven.

503
00:37:22,363 --> 00:37:24,363
I-I was young back then.

504
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,162
I don't remember.

505
00:38:02,922 --> 00:38:05,363
I don't know how to get there from

506
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:06,960
the ancient god's room.

507
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:10,043
His Excellency has gone
to look for the falling rocks.

508
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:13,402
I'm afraid we won't be able to ascend.

509
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:18,402
He descended
to collect the falling rocks.

510
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,656
We can only try

511
00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:23,162
when he is not here.

512
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:28,816
Anyway,

513
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:30,483
could you please

514
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:31,843
take me to the Western Garden?

515
00:38:33,202 --> 00:38:35,003
I really want to bring Lord Bicang

516
00:38:35,603 --> 00:38:37,363
back to the Immortal Realm.

517
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,995
(Western Garden)

518
00:38:51,043 --> 00:38:52,603
We are really sorry

519
00:38:54,043 --> 00:38:55,882
to bother you.

520
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,422
But we have

521
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,402
no other choice at this point.

522
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,563
Lord Xingzhi

523
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:04,843
is the last god from ancient times.

524
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,642
He shouldn't have made such a mistake

525
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:07,803
and endangered

526
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:09,904
the Three Realms.

527
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,568
We are willing

528
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:13,763
to persuade Lord Xingzhi

529
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,523
to change his mind

530
00:39:17,682 --> 00:39:20,482
and remain true
to his initial aspiration.

531
00:39:32,563 --> 00:39:33,584
Yulan.

532
00:39:35,323 --> 00:39:36,323
Do you remember

533
00:39:37,123 --> 00:39:39,162
if His Excellency has cast any spells

534
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:42,043
or activated any formations

535
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:45,003
to take you to the Extranatural Heaven?

536
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:49,442
He just glanced at me.

537
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:52,176
That very glance

538
00:39:53,043 --> 00:39:55,823
was the key to the ascension.

539
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:56,883
Grandfather.

540
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:59,363
It was quite an ordinary glance.

541
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:01,882
Nothing about him is ordinary.

542
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:03,600
There must be something.

543
00:40:04,922 --> 00:40:06,482
- Should I try?
- Try it.

544
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:07,664
Okay, I'll give it a try.

545
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:27,792
Lan.

546
00:40:28,642 --> 00:40:30,242
That was how he looked at me.

547
00:40:33,843 --> 00:40:34,864
Try from another side.

548
00:40:35,882 --> 00:40:36,912
Yeah.

549
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:47,402
I'll try the other side.

550
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:00,784
Come down.

551
00:41:01,744 --> 00:41:02,832
You lack spiritual cultivation.

552
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,136
Yeah.

553
00:41:06,323 --> 00:41:07,376
Try it.

554
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,682
Is there a certain move?

555
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,336
Well...

556
00:42:05,402 --> 00:42:07,402
Why don't you try it, Your Holiness?

557
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:13,083
Just a glance? Are you sure?

558
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:14,160
I'm sure.

559
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:20,843
Well...

560
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,402
The Diviners don't seem very reliable.

561
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,242
And you just realized that?

562
00:42:31,952 --> 00:42:33,008
They've been at ease.

563
00:43:19,123 --> 00:43:21,043
Your Holiness...

564
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:26,163
His Excellency may have made a mistake.

565
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:27,582
But we can't be disrespectful

566
00:43:27,582 --> 00:43:29,782
to the ancient gods' memorial tablets.

567
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:31,162
No.

568
00:43:31,162 --> 00:43:33,843
I'm just trying to find a way to ascend.

569
00:43:35,043 --> 00:43:36,302
But I doubt

570
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:37,963
there are any mechanisms

571
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:39,003
on these tablets.

572
00:43:41,123 --> 00:43:42,523
Grandfather, Your Holiness.

573
00:43:43,202 --> 00:43:45,463
I don't think
we can find a way to ascend.

574
00:43:45,463 --> 00:43:46,763
Why don't we go back?

575
00:43:46,763 --> 00:43:49,243
If His Excellency returns
and finds us here,

576
00:43:49,243 --> 00:43:50,722
we'll be in deeper trouble.

577
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:53,223
Alright, try to remember if there was

578
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:54,343
something else

579
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:55,523
apart from that glance.

580
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:59,463
I think it was just a glance.

581
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:00,528
Grandfather.

582
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:03,523
I can't think of anything.

583
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:42,603
(I must have retrieved)

584
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:45,043
