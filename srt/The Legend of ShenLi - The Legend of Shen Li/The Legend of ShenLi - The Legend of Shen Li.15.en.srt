=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,290
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:53,788
Look, it's right there.

4
00:01:54,852 --> 00:01:57,133
(Qingya Cave, Mortal Realm)
A large demon lived there.

5
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:58,533
It was

6
00:01:58,533 --> 00:01:59,833
kind

7
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:02,052
and lived in peace

8
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:03,513
with us Earth Diviners.

9
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:04,953
But later, I don't know why.

10
00:02:04,953 --> 00:02:07,813
We're being held here.

11
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,692
We can get there on that raft.

12
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:40,912
What happened?

13
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,013
Our leader...

14
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:52,752
Do you have to?

15
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:53,808
No,

16
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,292
but I find it very interesting.

17
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:02,113
All right, leave the rest to us.

18
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,313
You can go back to rest.

19
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,733
Don't worry.

20
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,613
Your people will soon be freed.

21
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,773
No, you don't understand.

22
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:09,932
They are very powerful.

23
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,553
I am worried about you.

24
00:03:11,553 --> 00:03:13,493
I think I'd better go with you.

25
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:14,973
You should be worried about them.

26
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:22,896
Sir,

27
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,492
this is a gift for you.

28
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,192
Take it for self-defense.

29
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:47,373
You're an ancient god.

30
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,453
At least give him something better.

31
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,293
As long as he doesn't
throw away the stick,

32
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:53,453
no one can match him

33
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:54,453
within a hundred miles.

34
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:57,173
You gave him that to thank
him for useful clues

35
00:03:57,893 --> 00:04:00,492
and for coming to our rescue
in the Mortal Realm,

36
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:02,253
even though it failed.

37
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,152
Don't worry.

38
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:16,852
I won't let you drown.

39
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,292
I'm not that scared.

40
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:35,216
Are you alright?

41
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:37,072
Why was there

42
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,928
a sudden big wave?

43
00:04:41,712 --> 00:04:42,832
I'm fine.

44
00:05:05,532 --> 00:05:06,733
I beg you.

45
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:09,572
Let me out.

46
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:12,213
Who exactly are you?

47
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:16,493
Why have you captured us here?

48
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:18,733
Looks like you are
from the Immortal Realm.

49
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:19,773
Let us out.

50
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:22,213
You Immortals have gone too far!

51
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:24,252
- Let me out.
- What did we do wrong?

52
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:26,672
Get in.

53
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:27,813
Let me out.

54
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:29,613
Let me out.

55
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,172
Let me out.

56
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,912
Just hold on.

57
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:34,653
The Divine will come to rescue us!

58
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:35,728
Let me out.

59
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:37,372
Let me out.

60
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:38,852
How can you do this?

61
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,692
Let me out.

62
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:45,933
I'm begging you.

63
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,613
I want to go home.

64
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:53,893
I can't hold on anymore.

65
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,053
Let us out.

66
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:17,904
Do I need to wear it?

67
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:20,048
Yes.

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,033
How do we save them?

69
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:36,412
Leave the formation and spells to me.

70
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:38,160
You do the beating.

71
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:02,332
Bro,

72
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:03,733
wake up!

73
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,093
Someone has come to rescue us.

74
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:06,192
Wake up!

75
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:04,933
Seems to be someone
from the Immortal Realm.

76
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:06,213
How is that possible?

77
00:08:06,213 --> 00:08:08,653
How could they be that kind?

78
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,492
Go.

79
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:39,812
Go out.

80
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:41,593
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

81
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:42,932
- Go.
- Hurry.

82
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,753
We are finally saved.

83
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:45,808
Go.

84
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,824
Go.

85
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:53,328
Faster.

86
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,592
Go.

87
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,760
- Quick.
- Hurry.

88
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,853
Hurry up.

89
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,333
We are finally saved.

90
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:11,533
We are saved.

91
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,453
- Many thanks to you.
- Thank you.

92
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:14,480
- Many thanks.
- Many thanks.

93
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:16,453
Thank you very much.

94
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:18,893
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

95
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,812
Thank you for the rescue.

96
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:22,132
Thank you very much.

97
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:24,133
Thank you for the rescue.

98
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,333
Thank you.

99
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:27,533
Thank you.

100
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,333
This place is not safe. Hurry and leave.

101
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:32,372
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

102
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,288
- Let's go home.
- Let's go.

103
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:35,413
Go.

104
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:36,560
Thank you very much.

105
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,733
Thank you very much.

106
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,372
- Many thanks.
- Come on.

107
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:45,968
Thank you very much.

108
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:51,728
Let's go.

109
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:56,853
Thank you.

110
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,853
Many thanks for your rescue.

111
00:09:58,853 --> 00:10:00,193
Thank you.

112
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:01,296
Stand up.

113
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,893
Where were other Earth Diviners
taken before?

114
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:06,753
You even have the gall

115
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:08,093
to ask us?

116
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,412
How can you not know where they are?

117
00:10:10,412 --> 00:10:11,853
She saved us.

118
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:12,932
Don't be like that.

119
00:10:12,932 --> 00:10:13,973
I'll say this only once.

120
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,213
Your getting caught had nothing

121
00:10:16,732 --> 00:10:18,413
to do with us Immortals.

122
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:20,713
I didn't know it until today.

123
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,732
Nonsense.

124
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,113
You Immortals have always been

125
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:26,073
barbaric, domineering,

126
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:28,013
- and full of plots.
- That's enough.

127
00:10:28,013 --> 00:10:29,812
I don't know why you imprisoned us,

128
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:31,812
but are you going to
catch the Diviners next?

129
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:33,813
None of you Immortals

130
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:34,913
is innocent!

131
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:36,893
- Her Holiness is the worst!
- Come on.

132
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,413
Watch your mouth

133
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:41,653
or I will

134
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:43,233
tear you apart.

135
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:44,272
ShenLi.

136
00:10:46,533 --> 00:10:48,253
- No, please.
- Please calm your anger.

137
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:49,413
I didn't want to kill you.

138
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:51,572
But since you've already condemned me,

139
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:53,832
I shall make this accusation a reality

140
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,932
so that you could rest in peace.
Is that good?

141
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:59,113
He's slandering Her Holiness

142
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:00,812
and framing us.

143
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,144
These gossip-lovers

144
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:06,013
always try to harm us

145
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:08,653
with their nonsense.

146
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:10,812
I shall kill you

147
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,132
to vent my anger.

148
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:17,172
Please calm down.

149
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:18,812
- If you kill him,
- Your Lordship.

150
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,612
it will be even harder
to clear your name.

151
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:31,953
Just a few words.

152
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:33,612
Why so angry?

153
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:34,640
Yeah.

154
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,832
Can't you Immortals

155
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:37,213
show some understanding?

156
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,224
Everyone,

157
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:40,713
- Yeah.
- just because the people who hurt you

158
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:41,932
carried spiritual energy

159
00:11:42,544 --> 00:11:43,653
didn't mean

160
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:45,893
they were from the Immortal Realm.

161
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:49,492
It could be someone
with ulterior motives

162
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:51,973
stirring up discord
between the two realms.

163
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,073
Some time ago,

164
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:55,093
I visited the Immortal Realm.

165
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:57,153
The Immortals

166
00:11:57,153 --> 00:11:58,653
are not as bloodthirsty and warlike

167
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,453
as you imagine.

168
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:04,193
Please don't believe the rumors

169
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:06,413
and don't fall for
the schemes of villains.

170
00:12:09,252 --> 00:12:11,093
As far as I know,

171
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:13,433
Furong, the Heavenly Lord's grandson,

172
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,213
went to the Immortal Realm days ago.

173
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,096
Just now,

174
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,653
that lady identified herself
as ShenLi, Lord Bicang.

175
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:23,572
Are you

176
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:25,413
that couple?

177
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,193
Furong and Lord Bicang

178
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:32,240
haven't married yet.

179
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,692
Since you're saying it,

180
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:37,993
it must be true.

181
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:39,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

182
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,144
Yes.

183
00:12:40,144 --> 00:12:41,293
Lord Bicang

184
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,053
is fully devoted to the Immortal Realm

185
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,333
and very loyal.

186
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,213
She can't stand someone

187
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,732
disrespecting the Immortal Realm.

188
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:50,352
She was just

189
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:52,773
too angry.

190
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,448
Please forgive her.

191
00:12:56,172 --> 00:12:59,293
- It's fine.
- You're very good to Her Lordship.

192
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:03,172
Not as rumored before.

193
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:05,264
Right.

194
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:07,760
Because

195
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:09,904
she deserves it.

196
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,136
They've all gone?

197
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:23,408
Yeah.

198
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:25,252
Just now they told me

199
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,932
another group of Earth Diviners seemed

200
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,733
to be held in the south.

201
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,052
But they are not clear

202
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:31,913
about the exact location.

203
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:34,172
That is your business, not mine.

204
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:35,893
Go save them by yourself.

205
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:37,149
I'm going to Jinxiu City.

206
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,233
Why are you following me?

207
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,893
Jinxiu City is in the south too.

208
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:03,952
We're heading the same way.

209
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:14,612
Do you want to go eat something?

210
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:16,176
No.

211
00:14:26,293 --> 00:14:27,812
There is a village right below.

212
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,773
We can use their kitchen
to make some food.

213
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,816
It's been ages since I ate mortal food.

214
00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:34,416
I miss it very much.

215
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,128
You'll do the cooking?

216
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,192
Yes.

217
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:44,473
(I do miss)

218
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:46,372
(the food he made.)

219
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,600
Let's go.

220
00:14:57,552 --> 00:14:59,917
(Tea)

221
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:07,213
Come and have some tea.
Please take a seat.

222
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:10,492
Excuse me, may we use
your kitchen for a moment

223
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:12,176
to make some food?

224
00:15:13,893 --> 00:15:15,093
What do you want to eat?

225
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,413
I can make it for you.

226
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:19,773
My sister

227
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:20,773
is picky.

228
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,132
I'm afraid what you make
may not suit her taste.

229
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:26,572
Don't worry. We will pay for it.

230
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:30,413
Alright, I will go tidy up
the kitchen in a bit.

231
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:32,333
Have some tea now.

232
00:15:43,132 --> 00:15:44,176
Please.

233
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,760
A tourist trap.

234
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:54,480
Scared?

235
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:03,812
I don't think

236
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:05,492
they can match your slyness.

237
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:10,320
You flatter me.

238
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,732
Everything is ready. You can go in now.

239
00:16:47,504 --> 00:16:48,528
What's wrong?

240
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:50,672
It's nothing.

241
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:53,453
You came all the way
to this remote place,

242
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,153
but you don't seem tired at all.

243
00:16:55,153 --> 00:16:58,093
You've got a strong constitution.

244
00:16:58,093 --> 00:16:59,120
Nah,

245
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:01,113
just strong enough to kill

246
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:02,372
hundreds and thousands of Chimeis.

247
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:08,693
That's a good joke.

248
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:10,773
I never joke.

249
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,576
Come here.

250
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:23,813
What can I help you?

251
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:57,776
Come out,

252
00:17:58,332 --> 00:17:59,332
or I will kill her.

253
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:01,616
Don't kill my mother!

254
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:05,933
Two foolish demons.

255
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,664
He?

256
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:21,612
I am not He.

257
00:18:22,933 --> 00:18:24,053
Sorry, I...

258
00:18:25,264 --> 00:18:26,384
My name is Jing Xi.

259
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,732
(Oh, right.)

260
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,933
(She already sacrificed herself
for the one she loved.)

261
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:33,072
(Moreover,)

262
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,612
(even if she was He, so what?)

263
00:18:37,212 --> 00:18:38,852
(There was only one Xingzhi
in the world.)

264
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,612
Both of you aren't very powerful.

265
00:18:45,372 --> 00:18:46,953
How dare you open

266
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:48,013
a tea house to harm people?

267
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:49,813
Outrageous.

268
00:18:51,293 --> 00:18:53,533
Aren't you afraid of the Immortals
and Diviners here

269
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,573
coming to you for your crimes?

270
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,173
They

271
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,132
have long been captured.

272
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,104
When were they captured?

273
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:02,992
Where were they taken?

274
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:06,492
Tell us. I won't beat you.

275
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:13,933
Please spare us.

276
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:16,432
We didn't want

277
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,332
to engage in this shady business,

278
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:22,773
but we were forced into it

279
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,372
by our difficult life.

280
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,160
In these past few months,

281
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,813
we haven't killed a single person.

282
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:31,913
We just took their food

283
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:33,092
and then let them go.

284
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,173
Please.

285
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:36,212
Spare us.

286
00:19:37,013 --> 00:19:38,313
When did you

287
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:39,413
start doing it here?

288
00:19:40,573 --> 00:19:41,732
And why did you do it?

289
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:43,653
Because the Immortals

290
00:19:44,612 --> 00:19:45,732
and Diviners nearby

291
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:47,513
kept disappearing.

292
00:19:47,513 --> 00:19:48,773
All of them are missing.

293
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:52,053
Later, I heard other demons
in the mountain say

294
00:19:52,893 --> 00:19:55,833
they seemed to be taken away

295
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,092
by some people of the Fusheng Sect.

296
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:58,212
Again.

297
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,452
So they didn't only capture
the Earth Diviners near Qingsheng City.

298
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:06,492
A small cultivation sect
that has only risen in recent years.

299
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:09,653
How could they capture
so many Earth Diviners?

300
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:13,452
And they even have spiritual energy.

301
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:16,912
(Is there actually someone)

302
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,693
(among us Immortals
with ulterior motives?)

303
00:20:21,968 --> 00:20:23,056
Well,

304
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:24,953
how about we set out

305
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:26,064
for Jinxiu City right now?

306
00:20:27,053 --> 00:20:29,293
I'll cook for you some other day.

307
00:20:31,248 --> 00:20:32,368
Sir.

308
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:37,360
Sir.

309
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,293
Could you please take me
with you to Jinxiu City?

310
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:43,633
I miss my father
and my brother, Jing Yan, very much.

311
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,353
The city is filled with miasma.

312
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:46,473
Aren't you afraid

313
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:47,492
you can't withstand it?

314
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:53,893
Let's go. Put a spell on her
to protect her from the miasma.

315
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,533
I don't wanna travel alone
with you anymore.

316
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:12,573
Remember to tell me

317
00:21:13,173 --> 00:21:14,333
whenever you feel any discomfort

318
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,372
in the city later.

319
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:22,800
Mother.

320
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:25,533
Mother.

321
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:26,608
Go.

322
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,372
Take good care of yourself.

323
00:21:46,092 --> 00:21:47,132
(Jinxiu)
This is Jinxiu City?

324
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:50,893
How did it become like this?

325
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:52,732
I feel like

326
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:54,573
I'm in the Xutian Abyss.

327
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:58,273
All the Immortals
and Diviners of Jinxiu City

328
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,693
were captured long ago.

329
00:22:00,332 --> 00:22:02,933
The miasma drifts down from the mountain
and gathers in the city every day.

330
00:22:04,132 --> 00:22:05,252
That's why it's become like this.

331
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:11,053
Let's check it out.

332
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:14,608
(Jinxiu)
Follow me.

333
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,751
(Well-being for All)

334
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,332
It is worse than I imagined.

335
00:22:24,452 --> 00:22:26,252
How can the mortals here endure it?

336
00:22:28,773 --> 00:22:30,092
Is there a way to clear the miasma?

337
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,856
Sure.

338
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:34,973
But the miasma in the city

339
00:22:34,973 --> 00:22:36,293
is from the mountain.

340
00:22:37,212 --> 00:22:38,833
Clearing the miasma here

341
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:39,920
is only a temporary solution.

342
00:22:40,573 --> 00:22:42,432
Clearing the miasma in the mountain

343
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,664
is the fundamental cure.

344
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,573
But at least, it is

345
00:22:49,612 --> 00:22:50,693
better than doing nothing.

346
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:52,573
Mother, don't stop me.

347
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,053
Mother.

348
00:22:55,053 --> 00:22:56,493
Mother, don't stop me.

349
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:57,573
Let me make medicine for you.

350
00:22:58,173 --> 00:22:59,212
You'll get better after that.

351
00:22:59,732 --> 00:23:00,880
Mother.

352
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:02,864
Mother.

353
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,552
Mother.

354
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:07,472
Mother.

355
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,296
Mother.

356
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,032
The power of purification?

357
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:15,664
Mother.

358
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:18,013
Mother.

359
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:23,893
What have you done to my mother?

360
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,232
Your mother has been poisoned by miasma.

361
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,653
I know. It's none of your business.

362
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:31,132
I got the medicine given
by the Ragged Diviner.

363
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:33,432
My mother will get better
after taking it.

364
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,773
You weirdos get away from us!

365
00:23:37,132 --> 00:23:39,513
Kid, he is trying to help you.

366
00:23:39,513 --> 00:23:41,013
I only listen to the Ragged Diviner.

367
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:42,704
I don't trust you.

368
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:44,773
I will take my mother and leave.

369
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:49,072
Mother.

370
00:23:50,773 --> 00:23:51,824
Give me back the medicine.

371
00:23:54,413 --> 00:23:55,693
I can give it back to you,

372
00:23:56,432 --> 00:23:57,493
but you have to tell me

373
00:23:57,493 --> 00:23:59,553
where the Ragged Diviner
you mentioned is.

374
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:00,560
He is

375
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:02,413
at the North Academy

376
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:05,492
He has been there
healing people for a long time.

377
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,813
- Mother.
- That area

378
00:24:09,773 --> 00:24:11,252
does seem fresher.

379
00:24:16,212 --> 00:24:17,328
Can the medicine work out?

380
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:19,984
I don't know.

381
00:24:19,984 --> 00:24:21,252
But just now,

382
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,088
I gave her a flick like this,

383
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:24,784
and that was enough.

384
00:24:26,212 --> 00:24:29,372
Is there another Diviner
who loves to descend to the Mortal Realm

385
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:30,813
and save people like you?

386
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:31,813
Do you know?

387
00:24:32,852 --> 00:24:34,612
Go there, and we'll see.

388
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:44,093
Let's go.

389
00:24:44,093 --> 00:24:46,252
Are there ghosts here?

390
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:48,893
A demon is afraid of ghosts?

391
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:53,813
They are just affected by the miasma.

392
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:01,744
Help!

393
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,372
How can you hit me?

394
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:12,880
ShenLi?

395
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:16,432
Your Excellency?

396
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,008
Who are you?

397
00:25:23,472 --> 00:25:24,592
I am Furong.

398
00:25:34,384 --> 00:25:35,408
What's up?

399
00:25:35,972 --> 00:25:37,452
I have no time for you. Go away.

400
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:44,656
You've gone too far.

401
00:25:45,452 --> 00:25:46,893
I've risked my life to save a town,

402
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:47,952
and this is how you treat me?

403
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:50,372
Without me, everyone here

404
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:52,013
would be engulfed by the miasma.

405
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:54,013
I used the power of purification

406
00:25:54,013 --> 00:25:55,132
to bring it under control.

407
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:56,893
How can you give me that look?

408
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,096
It's true that these people

409
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:07,773
have been purified.

410
00:26:13,392 --> 00:26:14,480
Go back.

411
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:16,368
Let's go.

412
00:26:22,132 --> 00:26:24,132
I came to Jinxiu City for fun,

413
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:26,053
but only to find them like this.

414
00:26:26,612 --> 00:26:27,972
I couldn't just ignore it.

415
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
(North Academy)

416
00:27:18,413 --> 00:27:19,453
Cleanse

417
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:20,653
the world...

418
00:27:23,212 --> 00:27:24,240
What is it?

419
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:26,320
The incantation for the spell.

420
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:28,848
Oh, right.

421
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,332
All right, you're fine now.

422
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:57,104
Go inside.

423
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:59,664
(North Academy)

424
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:38,092
(I have exhausted all my strength
to purify the miasma,)

425
00:28:39,173 --> 00:28:41,492
(but it pervaded immediately again.)

426
00:28:43,252 --> 00:28:44,452
(Too many were affected.)

427
00:28:45,252 --> 00:28:46,693
(I couldn't help the worst off ones,)

428
00:28:47,933 --> 00:28:49,553
(so I took those with milder conditions)

429
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,473
(to the North Academy.)

430
00:28:51,473 --> 00:28:53,132
(I set up a barrier to protect them.)

431
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:25,653
I come out every day
to dispel the miasma,

432
00:29:26,252 --> 00:29:27,252
but it keeps getting worse.

433
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,224
I'm at my wits' end.

434
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:32,332
Why didn't you report

435
00:29:32,332 --> 00:29:33,332
to the Divine Realm at first?

436
00:29:34,492 --> 00:29:35,573
Afraid of being taken back?

437
00:29:36,852 --> 00:29:37,972
Now,

438
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:39,132
you have to

439
00:29:39,132 --> 00:29:41,492
rely on yourself
to purify the miasma here.

440
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:44,452
You can't handle it anymore,
so you're asking for help.

441
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,573
Want to save a city by yourself?

442
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:51,600
Ridiculous.

443
00:29:57,693 --> 00:29:58,736
Sir,

444
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:01,413
have you seen a cultivator

445
00:30:01,413 --> 00:30:02,693
with a disciple?

446
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:13,332
Sure.

447
00:30:13,852 --> 00:30:15,332
They are inside my barrier.

448
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:17,972
Can you take me there?

449
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:19,056
Of course.

450
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:23,893
Let me hold your hand.
The miasma here is too thick.

451
00:30:24,612 --> 00:30:25,712
You might not see clearly.

452
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:29,972
Ouch, ShenLi!

453
00:30:29,972 --> 00:30:31,492
ShenLi, why are you pinching me?

454
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:32,852
Lead the way.

455
00:30:32,852 --> 00:30:34,252
It's over there.

456
00:30:34,972 --> 00:30:37,013
Let go of me!

457
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,064
Let me go!

458
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:44,492
This way. Follow me.

459
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:46,533
It hurts, ShenLi!

460
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,213
Drop the act. It doesn't hurt that much.

461
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,333
Let go!

462
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:50,452
- Let go!
- Hurry up.

463
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:52,400
- Let go of me!
- Go.

464
00:31:00,972 --> 00:31:02,000
(North Academy)
I'm back.

465
00:31:05,936 --> 00:31:07,056
You've returned?

466
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:08,720
The Diviner has returned!

467
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,492
Thank you.

468
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:12,093
You've saved a few people again.

469
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:13,168
Sir.

470
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:14,533
Come, the Diviner has returned.

471
00:31:15,252 --> 00:31:16,713
- Please take a look.
- Get together.

472
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:17,808
Easy.

473
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:18,864
Sir.

474
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:20,573
- Please take a look.
- Calm down.

475
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:22,212
We seem to be getting...

476
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:30,293
It's alright now.

477
00:31:30,293 --> 00:31:31,733
- Sir.
- Sir.

478
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,784
Thank you.

479
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:38,593
Thank you.

480
00:31:38,593 --> 00:31:39,972
Thank you.

481
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:41,352
Thank you.

482
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:42,372
Alright, everyone stands up.

483
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:45,372
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

484
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:46,573
That is amazing.

485
00:31:46,573 --> 00:31:48,053
You're a great man.

486
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,212
This place used to be an academy.

487
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,933
Later, the headmaster
indulged in bribery

488
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,092
and corruption and did bad things.

489
00:31:58,452 --> 00:32:00,292
After he got arrested,
the academy was abandoned.

490
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:01,593
I thought this place was not bad,

491
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:03,053
so I used it as a shelter.

492
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:07,653
Someone was arrested,
and it is still good?

493
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:10,253
The person was arrested,

494
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:11,413
so this place is good.

495
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:13,264
How could a villain deserve it?

496
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:18,332
Father, Jing Yan!

497
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,252
(Jing Yan)

498
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:37,424
Jing Yan!

499
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:45,136
They...

500
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:46,332
Father.

501
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:47,408
Why are you here?

502
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:50,128
Jing Yan.

503
00:33:41,092 --> 00:33:42,224
Are they repeating

504
00:33:45,173 --> 00:33:47,332
their fate?

505
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:52,573
It's just a coincidence.

506
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:01,573
After Gu Chengjin became the city lord,

507
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:04,212
during the many days
and nights of his life,

508
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:07,173
did he ever stop to think,

509
00:34:07,173 --> 00:34:08,732
even for a moment,

510
00:34:09,773 --> 00:34:11,932
of the girl who was just
entering her prime years

511
00:34:13,212 --> 00:34:14,320
but never got the chance

512
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:17,732
to blossom because of him?

513
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:18,753
Where is your mother?

514
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,472
How could she let you come here?

515
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:22,053
My mother was worried about you.

516
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:24,233
But she was injured

517
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:25,893
and might get affected by the miasma,

518
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:26,972
so she didn't come.

519
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,624
How could you?

520
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:30,753
You wanted to be affected by the miasma?

521
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:31,953
Take the medicine,

522
00:34:31,953 --> 00:34:32,972
and go back right away.

523
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,088
Father!

524
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:36,112
Sir.

525
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:40,892
Sir.

526
00:34:40,892 --> 00:34:42,293
The miasma isn't thick
within the barrier.

527
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:44,412
There is no need to let her go away.

528
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:46,253
She was too worried about you.

529
00:34:46,253 --> 00:34:47,312
Please understand.

530
00:34:56,533 --> 00:34:57,653
If something happens to you,

531
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:58,813
how will I explain it

532
00:34:58,813 --> 00:34:59,824
to your mother?

533
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:02,373
Nothing has happened yet.

534
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:06,992
He definitely would.

535
00:35:08,412 --> 00:35:09,892
After Gu Chengjin became the city lord,

536
00:35:11,172 --> 00:35:12,913
he filled the garden
of the Jinyue Mansion

537
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:14,172
with lotus flowers.

538
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:21,616
It was of little use,

539
00:35:22,492 --> 00:35:23,633
but if He knew,

540
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:24,692
she would probably be happy.

541
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,024
At least,

542
00:35:27,813 --> 00:35:28,976
she was remembered by him.

543
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,633
This is the disease
that emerged in Jinxiu City

544
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:49,692
due to the miasma.

545
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:55,888
What are you doing?

546
00:35:58,512 --> 00:35:59,536
Well?

547
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:04,492
You've been watching her,
but you can do nothing.

548
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,013
Why not let a pro take a look?

549
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:17,492
Your Excellency, please.

550
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,533
I'll go check on the other patients.

551
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:59,033
Furong, you've been here for many days.

552
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,233
Have you noticed

553
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:02,252
in which direction
the miasma is the thickest?

554
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,972
The west.

555
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,692
The miasma in the southwest
hurts the most.

556
00:37:10,252 --> 00:37:11,492
If I am not mistaken,

557
00:37:12,252 --> 00:37:13,573
the miasma

558
00:37:13,573 --> 00:37:15,133
isn't flowing into the city

559
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,880
from outside.

560
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:19,652
It's flowing from
inside the city to the outside.

561
00:37:20,496 --> 00:37:21,520
I'm afraid

562
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:23,753
this situation has been
going on for a while.

563
00:37:23,753 --> 00:37:24,784
I don't think so.

564
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:27,833
Although I live in seclusion
in the mountain,

565
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,792
I often go into the city

566
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:31,293
to buy some necessities.

567
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:33,673
I visited last month,

568
00:37:33,673 --> 00:37:34,753
and there was already

569
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,273
some miasma outside the city.

570
00:37:36,273 --> 00:37:37,353
But inside the city,

571
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:38,533
it was relatively clean.

572
00:37:40,732 --> 00:37:42,212
But actually,

573
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:45,093
they don't have a disease at all.

574
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,452
It's energy flowing
in reverse in the body

575
00:37:48,412 --> 00:37:49,872
due to years of miasma inhalation.

576
00:37:58,416 --> 00:37:59,504
It's a shame,

577
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:01,904
but a few days ago,

578
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,920
I inhaled miasma.

579
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:05,932
And then,

580
00:38:06,692 --> 00:38:07,692
it left such marks in my body.

581
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,732
(He got the wound)

582
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,333
(after being attacked
by Chimeis in the Xutian Abyss.)

583
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:15,972
(I didn't know it'd be still there.)

584
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:18,544
(And Xingzhi)

585
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:20,853
(even didn't mention a word about it.)

586
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:33,452
Such marks

587
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:36,212
either come from being bitten
by miasmatic monsters

588
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:39,133
or from inhaling miasma
for years which causes

589
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:40,932
blood to flow in reverse.

590
00:38:41,936 --> 00:38:43,013
After a certain amount

591
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:44,252
of time,

592
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:46,032
it will erupt.

593
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:48,433
Earth Diviners disappeared everywhere.

594
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,692
A mysterious cultivation sect.

595
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:52,373
The spreading miasma.

596
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:54,096
I think the answer

597
00:38:55,053 --> 00:38:56,333
may just lie in the west of the city.

598
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:03,120
Who is she?

599
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,040
Keep it down.

600
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:06,704
Don't you see she's asleep?
