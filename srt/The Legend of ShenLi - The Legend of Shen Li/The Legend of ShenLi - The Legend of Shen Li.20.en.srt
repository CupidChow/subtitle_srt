00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,184
=Episode 20=

3
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,360
Come on.

4
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:24,219
This is too much. You scared me.

5
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,180
What are you waiting for?
Hurry up and free them.

6
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,416
Who dares?

7
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,460
Come on. Do me a favor.

8
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:44,059
Let them speak.

9
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:45,168
They'll apologize to you.

10
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,272
Who am I going to do a favor?

11
00:02:51,184 --> 00:02:52,240
Your

12
00:02:52,779 --> 00:02:53,904
future

13
00:02:53,904 --> 00:02:54,992
fiancé, you know.

14
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,264
Alright.

15
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:17,960
My Lord.

16
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,060
Stop.

17
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,160
Let us out!

18
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,699
My Lord, help me!

19
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:22,900
Stop.

20
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,419
- The Immortals are so impudent!
- Yeah!

21
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,719
They don't respect us at all.

22
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,859
How can Lord Bicang

23
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,339
be so rude?

24
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,579
My Lord, get ShenLi out of our realm!

25
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,699
No one has ever treated us like this.

26
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:36,139
Let us out!

27
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,180
Stop.

28
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,300
Let us out.

29
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,460
- My Lord.
- Let us out.

30
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,499
My Lord, let us out.

31
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,656
My Lord.

32
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,900
Heavenly Lord is here!

33
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,220
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

34
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,376
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

35
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,680
What a disgrace!

36
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:08,660
I remember

37
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,820
when Furong and Lord Xingzhi were
in the Immortal Realm,

38
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,680
we

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,499
may not have gone all out
to entertain them,

40
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,219
but we showed them all the courtesies.

41
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:20,260
But now,

42
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,339
the poisoned food is still on the table.

43
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:24,580
The air still carries
a strange fragrance.

44
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:27,100
And I still keep

45
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,219
these poisonous silver needles.

46
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:31,899
I received three amazing gifts
in one day.

47
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,936
This is

48
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,739
how you treat your guests?

49
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,179
Sorry for my thoughtlessness

50
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:54,580
and bringing you unpleasantness.

51
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,380
Starting today, these three

52
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,080
are imprisoned for a century.

53
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,256
- Your...
- Silence!

54
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,619
Thank you for upholding justice for me.

55
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:13,459
But I still have to stay in this realm

56
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:14,779
for quite some time longer.

57
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,219
Staying in this mansion

58
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,339
may cause me more trouble.

59
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,140
(These girls)

60
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,260
(can't really hurt me,)

61
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,260
(but who knows how much trouble)

62
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,739
(Furong would bring me?)

63
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,900
(If things continue like this,)

64
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,459
(I'll either get killed or be a wreck.)

65
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,119
Could you please

66
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,980
find a tranquil place for me?

67
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,940
- My Lord.
- Stop.

68
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,020
- My Lord.
- Here you are.

69
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,860
Shush now.

70
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,420
The courtyard in the west is suitable.

71
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,100
Lord Bicang,

72
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,480
in the west of our realm,
there's a quiet small courtyard.

73
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,399
It's just a bit out of the way

74
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,619
and plain.

75
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,740
Hope you won't find it

76
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,899
too shabby.

77
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,820
Not at all.

78
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,339
Your definition of plain

79
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,540
surely won't be so bad to me.

80
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,104
I will move there tomorrow.

81
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,720
Okay.

82
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
You have met His Excellency,

83
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,040
so I guess it won't be awkward

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,100
for you two to live together.

85
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,024
His Excellency?

86
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,019
(In this realm, isn't there only one)

87
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:34,980
(who can be addressed as that?)

88
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,700
(Why didn't you tell me earlier?)

89
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,080
(It will be awkward.)

90
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,380
(It will surely be awkward, alright?)

91
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,728
Stop there!

92
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,632
Who are you?

93
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:12,336
ShenLi.

94
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,344
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

95
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,860
May I know what you're doing here?

96
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:19,820
Just strolling around.

97
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,940
The banquet is upon us.

98
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,459
Please do not wander around

99
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,660
or you might get suspected

100
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:26,380
and cause unnecessary trouble.

101
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,059
(What's wrong with these people?)

102
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:32,860
(They're all like this.)

103
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,059
(I would rather stay)

104
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,019
(with Xingzhi in the Western Garden.)

105
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:47,120
(Western Garden)

106
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,299
(Xingzhi descended to the Mortal Realm
with his memory intact,)

107
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,179
(so his courtyard)

108
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,260
(must be arranged
according to this layout.)

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,260
(I remember the arrangement here)

110
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,580
(follows a formation
that gathers energy.)

111
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:19,899
(Staying here)

112
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,140
(helps to remove the toxins)

113
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,260
(left by Fu Sheng within me.)

114
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:52,979
(Perhaps only in the Mortal Realm)

115
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,099
(and in mortal form)

116
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,859
(could he be carefree.)

117
00:08:58,659 --> 00:08:59,859
(He's become hard to understand)

118
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:02,739
(after being a god again.)

119
00:09:03,568 --> 00:09:04,656
(Can the difference in status)

120
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,020
(truly change a person's attitude?)

121
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,808
(Western Garden)

122
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,979
The fish grow so fat without being fed.

123
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,340
The water in the Divine Realm is good.

124
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,619
They are little carp spirits.

125
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,480
Do you want to play with us?

126
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,220
Are you a phoenix?

127
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,260
Why would phoenixes be afraid of water?

128
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,799
Who says they are afraid of water?

129
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,139
I think they are afraid of water, too.

130
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,359
I don't believe that.

131
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:49,659
You'll know if you try.

132
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,059
- Come down!
- Come down!

133
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,979
- Come down!
- Come down!

134
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:55,739
- Come down!
- Let's play!

135
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,179
- Play with us!
- Play with us!

136
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,299
- What are you doing?
- Come down!

137
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,539
Let go.

138
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,540
Come on!

139
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,552
Let go.

140
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,472
Stop splashing.

141
00:10:35,659 --> 00:10:36,752
You guys.

142
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,184
Just wait.

143
00:11:58,499 --> 00:11:59,539
His Excellency.

144
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,220
(Forget it then.)

145
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,299
Let's take a bath first.

146
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,419
Time to take a bath.

147
00:12:34,992 --> 00:12:36,048
Twice now.

148
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:37,904
Twice.

149
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,140
But you enjoyed yourself just now.

150
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:50,736
I admit it.

151
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:52,592
The first time,

152
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:55,120
I did it on purpose.

153
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
But this time,

154
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,288
I really didn't.

155
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:21,072
Come out.

156
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,739
I will punish them.

157
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,499
- Your Excellency,
- Your Excellency,

158
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:45,640
- could you please spare us all?
- could you please spare us all?

159
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,704
Come up.

160
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,299
Everyone, stick out your buttocks.

161
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:11,440
Come on.

162
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:42,192
Say it.

163
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,340
How many smacks do you want?

164
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,820
- Your Excellency,
- Your Excellency,

165
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,340
- could you please spare us all?
- could you please spare us all?

166
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,380
You decide.

167
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,400
How about...?

168
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,499
Take it.

169
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:04,368
You can do it yourself.

170
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,179
- Please don't hit us!
- Please don't hit us!

171
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,179
- Don't beat us.
- Don't beat us.

172
00:15:12,272 --> 00:15:13,419
I'm scared.

173
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,739
I'm really scared.

174
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,099
Hurry up and apologize.

175
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,659
- Don't beat me.
- Don't beat me.

176
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,340
- Please don't hit us!
- Please don't hit us!

177
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,800
- Please!
- Please!

178
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,820
- Don't beat me.
- Don't beat me.

179
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,260
Alright.

180
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,619
Stop it.

181
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,299
Stop it. Stay away.

182
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,208
Get off me.

183
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,140
Please don't beat me.

184
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,020
- Please.
- Please.

185
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:39,696
Leave.

186
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:42,059
Leave.

187
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,664
- Go.
- Go.

188
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,488
Come on.

189
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,984
When did you

190
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,419
become soft?

191
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,419
Just some kids.

192
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:57,859
You make it seem like I'm bullying them.

193
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,419
Aren't all these kids noisy?

194
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,032
It's lively, isn't it?

195
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,020
Don't you think it's fun?

196
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:19,419
(I thought it'd be awkward
when seeing him,)

197
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,488
(but after this,)

198
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,419
(I don't feel it at all.)

199
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,859
Could you please get me a room?

200
00:16:28,099 --> 00:16:30,220
Now I only

201
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,780
want to get a good sleep.

202
00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:36,780
You can choose any room on the left.

203
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,299
And

204
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,360
these little kids

205
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,619
can count as attendants
in the Western Garden.

206
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:44,740
During this period,

207
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,700
they'll serve you.

208
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:52,499
I don't need them.

209
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,683
(Western Garden)

210
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,700
(He's probably cultivating
in seclusion inside the room.)

211
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,019
(That is good.)

212
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,740
(If he stays inside until the banquet,)

213
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,019
(I will possibly only see him)

214
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,860
(at my wedding with Furong,)

215
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,059
(and then I will never see him again.)

216
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:51,139
- Your Lordship, let us serve you!
- Your Lordship, let us serve you!

217
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,139
I'll help you wash your face.

218
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:00,659
This is a towel here.

219
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,419
Wipe your face.

220
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,376
Come!

221
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,232
Stand still.

222
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,620
Knock it off

223
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
or you'll all get in the pond

224
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:30,460
and steamed.

225
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,580
But His Excellency told us

226
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,080
you were different from other Diviners

227
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,419
and that if you didn't eat,
you'd get hungry.

228
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,899
If we don't serve you,

229
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:41,860
you will starve to death.

230
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,940
I won't. I am a Diviner too.

231
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,992
I don't need to eat.

232
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,016
Go back.

233
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,379
- Come on.
- It's so lively

234
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,504
early in the morning.

235
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,059
Are you here to cause me trouble?

236
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,740
I did not mean it.

237
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,599
We are serving Her Lordship
with all our hearts.

238
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,459
- It's true!
- It's true!

239
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,740
- We're sincere!
- Sincere!

240
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,899
You are sincere?

241
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:17,220
Let His Excellency serve me.

242
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,024
Alright.

243
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,379
Go back to the pond, guys.

244
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,424
Say it.

245
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,179
How would you like me to serve you?

246
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:42,100
What are you here for?

247
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,539
I-I-I...

248
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:55,199
Heavenly Lord asked me
to notify Lord Bicang.

249
00:20:55,199 --> 00:20:57,040
Her Lordship has been living
in the Immortal Realm,

250
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,520
so she'd be possibly affected by miasma.

251
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,400
So before the banquet,
she needs to cleanse

252
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,700
herself at the Cleansing Pool.

253
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:04,440
This is the day.

254
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,620
I thought I could bring some fruits

255
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,000
since you were living with Lord Bicang.

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,980
I saw the door was open, so I came in.

257
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:11,568
What a coincidence.

258
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,392
I didn't hear anything.

259
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,280
Your Excellency, the fruits.

260
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,080
Since it's the Heavenly Lord's order,

261
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,120
let's hurry.

262
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,504
Your Lordship,

263
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,059
that is the divine light
from the Extranatural Heaven.

264
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,440
It's quite rude

265
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,460
for you to stare at it.

266
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,104
(The Extranatural Heaven.)

267
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,179
I've been to the Immortal Realm before.

268
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,240
I didn't really explore much,

269
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,899
but I got a rough idea
of what it was like.

270
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:30,980
I know

271
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,659
the Immortals must harbor
dissatisfaction with the Divine Realm.

272
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:38,980
Please feel free to say it.

273
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:41,380
Be it dissatisfaction

274
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,440
or resentment,

275
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,620
please

276
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,500
watch your boundaries.

277
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,139
Now, there is only one god left
in the Three Realms.

278
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,779
No one can bear the cost of losing him.

279
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,100
So, you mean

280
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:55,419
we Immortals harbor ill intentions

281
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:57,700
and use me to seduce Xingzhi

282
00:22:58,299 --> 00:22:59,899
with the intent to strip away
his divinity?

283
00:23:02,576 --> 00:23:03,664
Lady,

284
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,779
even if I could do what you're saying,

285
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,179
it's his own issue

286
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:12,059
if he loses

287
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:15,740
his divinity.

288
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,059
What's the use of warning me?

289
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:28,299
We're nearly at the Cleansing Pool.
Please, Your Lordship.

290
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:32,500
Your Lordship,
you've stepped on my dress.

291
00:23:39,958 --> 00:23:42,799
(Cleansing Pool, Divine Realm)

292
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:47,984
Greetings.

293
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,259
(The Cleansing Pool
can not only remove miasma)

294
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,500
(but also sap my spiritual power.)

295
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:30,340
(I guess I'll have to wait)

296
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,700
(until the banquet to restore it.)

297
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,060
(They weaken me)

298
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,179
(to keep me in check.)

299
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:48,700
(Those sanctimonious Diviners)

300
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,259
(are always on guard
against us Immortals,)

301
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:55,419
(even though we've compromised a lot.)

302
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,019
(My energy is unstable.)

303
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,980
(It's caused by the Cleansing Pool.)

304
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,740
I don't need an Immortal's help!

305
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:20,368
Alright then.

306
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,544
Do you want to save your face?

307
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,560
Beg me.

308
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,820
I'm begging you.

309
00:29:13,616 --> 00:29:14,720
I wasn't planning to save you

310
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,860
even if you begged me.

311
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
But you came with me.

312
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,100
What a coincidence, isn't it?

313
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,980
I just don't want others
to spread rumors about me.

314
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,659
(The white lion's hit
will hurt me for a few days at most.)

315
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,480
(But Youlan)

316
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,059
(may get killed.)

317
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:33,680
Are you alright?

318
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,408
It's just a flesh wound.

319
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:45,168
Why did you anger it?

320
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:43,408
Dangerous.

321
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,659
Let's wait for others.

322
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,179
(She knows gratitude.)

323
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,040
It's alright.

324
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,296
Tell me.

325
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,820
Who are you?

326
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:01,820
Your Lordship.

327
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,100
Please show mercy.

328
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:07,160
This is the White Spirit Divine Beast

329
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,700
raised by His Excellency
in the Extranatural Heaven.

330
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,700
It's not a demon.

331
00:34:11,536 --> 00:34:12,640
Xingzhi?

332
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,744
Right.

333
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,460
Is His Excellency going
to be a stockman?

334
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:21,179
He keeps so many animals.

335
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,280
It's okay.

336
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,139
Are you blaming

337
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:26,832
me?

338
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,780
It's my mistake.

339
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,792
You got injured?

340
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Thanks to you. Just a flesh wound.

341
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,152
What happened?

342
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,120
I was going to take the Divine Beast

343
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,460
from the Extranatural Heaven
to the Western Garden as you commanded.

344
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,680
But when passing this place,

345
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,100
it suddenly went mad.

346
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,139
I couldn't stop it.

347
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,240
It was my fault that it injured you

348
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,460
and Luotian Goddess.

349
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:22,940
It was the beast who went mad.

350
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,560
Not your fault.

351
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:28,300
Take Lord Bicang to the Western Garden
and get a physician

352
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,096
to check her injury.

353
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,816
Your Lordship.

354
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,339
Why did you provoke it?

355
00:36:04,179 --> 00:36:05,740
I don't understand you.

356
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:12,460
Lord Bicang is unruly,

357
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,419
and she treats us rudely.

358
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:16,980
I was going to teach her a lesson

359
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,760
so that she'd mind her manners.

360
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,580
But the Divine Beast
went out of control.

361
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,200
You're the one

362
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,099
who should control their temper.

363
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:27,408
I'm sorry.

364
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,500
But Your Excellency,

365
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,060
you're the only god in the Three Realms.

366
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:34,080
Please consider the beings
of the Three Realms.

367
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,419
You shouldn't get too close

368
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:38,288
to Lord Bicang.

369
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:43,060
I don't know her that well,

370
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,700
so there's no way we're close.

371
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,600
This time,

372
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,119
you almost caused a great disaster.

373
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,328
Next time,

374
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:52,179
you won't be this lucky.

375
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,899
Be good. Don't move.

376
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,240
(It's a divine beast.)

377
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,980
(Why would it go mad without cause?)

378
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,419
(Xingzhi took Youlan aside
for a private talk,)

379
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:47,700
(so it was she who did it.)

380
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,179
(I've only been here for a few days)

381
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,139
(and I'm in so much trouble.)

382
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,659
(This place just isn't meant for me.)

383
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,616
Leave it.

384
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,859
But it might hurt you, Your Lordship.

385
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,700
When it's good, no collar is needed.

386
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,859
When it's not, a collar is useless.

387
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,952
It'll be just a waste.

388
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:16,208
That's true.

389
00:38:20,656 --> 00:38:21,680
Your Lordship,

390
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,480
if you like it,

391
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,740
you can play with it.

392
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,980
His Excellency brought it along

393
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,260
to keep you company
and for you to kill time.

394
00:38:32,379 --> 00:38:33,744
Come.

395
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,880
Here.

396
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,888
Alright.

397
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,260
Your Lordship, I shall take my leave.

398
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,960
(He seems distant)

399
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,020
(yet he's caring towards me.)

400
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,500
(What exactly is Xingzhi thinking?)

401
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,139
(I feel like I am that beast,)

402
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,659
(something he plays with)

403
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,339
