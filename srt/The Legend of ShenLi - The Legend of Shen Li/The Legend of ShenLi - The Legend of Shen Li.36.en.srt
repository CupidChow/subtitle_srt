00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,120
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:43,828
What exactly are you plotting?

4
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,068
I came here

5
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,349
to discuss important matters

6
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:52,389
with you.

7
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:54,709
You're an essential part

8
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,508
of my plan.

9
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:02,629
Nice try.

10
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,709
Yes, great.

11
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:27,068
Here you go.

12
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,584
Lord Bicang.

13
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:00,029
Today, I must take you away

14
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:01,829
to fulfill my long-cherished wish.

15
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:30,428
This time,

16
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:32,068
I will not let you act recklessly.

17
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:34,096
Leave here.

18
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,228
Master, why?

19
00:03:42,512 --> 00:03:43,536
Shen Muyue.

20
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:46,068
You are indeed a good disciple.

21
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,228
After so long,

22
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,669
your senses are still so sharp.

23
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:52,808
Your Lordship.

24
00:03:52,808 --> 00:03:54,428
You want
to save the Immortal Realm, right?

25
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:56,389
I have a way.

26
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,189
If you are willing to help me,

27
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,628
the Immortal Realm will not be shackled
by the Xutian Abyss.

28
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,068
You want me to replace the Fire Seal?

29
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,148
The Mountain immortal is Wood.

30
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:12,949
The Earth Diviner represents Earth.

31
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:15,129
The Third Prince represents Water.

32
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,109
The Golden Serpent represents Metal.

33
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:18,832
Your Lordship.

34
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,109
You know what I'm talking about, right?

35
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:25,669
Do not listen to his nonsense.

36
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:28,508
He has gathered the four elements,

37
00:04:29,188 --> 00:04:31,408
but it can only sustain the Xutian Abyss
for a while.

38
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:33,508
He merely wants
to release all the Chimei

39
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:36,068
before the Xutian Abyss collapses.

40
00:04:39,348 --> 00:04:41,989
Your Lordship,
you help me release the Chimei.

41
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,549
Even if the Xutian Abyss collapses,

42
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:47,269
the Immortal Realm will still be safe.

43
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:49,328
What do you say?

44
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,296
You wish.

45
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,429
If thousands of Chimei get out,

46
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,789
they will doom the beings
of the Immortal Realm.

47
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:58,960
It's also destructive.

48
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:01,149
How could I let you have your way?

49
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:10,669
Then don't blame me
for not showing mercy.

50
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,069
What he wants is you.

51
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:18,469
To exchange the seal within,

52
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:19,869
the Xutian Abyss will be open.

53
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,028
Once all the Chimei escape,

54
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:24,028
it will be harder to control the chaos.

55
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,608
Get out of here.

56
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:40,688
This is an order.

57
00:06:10,908 --> 00:06:11,920
Set up the formation.

58
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,429
Master, you and Xingzhi told me
to stay away.

59
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,128
But it's impossible

60
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,949
to fix it all if I back off.

61
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:21,648
I will not stay out of this.

62
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,288
Fu Sheng.

63
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:29,429
You will not get your way.

64
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:52,464
I even don't know

65
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:54,589
when she took her spear back.

66
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,548
The Magic of Flames
can greatly exhaust physical strength.

67
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:45,068
I will see how long you can last.

68
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:22,988
Master, just hang in there.

69
00:09:25,469 --> 00:09:26,544
Li!

70
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:04,349
Your Lordship, this is Mofang's body.

71
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:06,668
How could you be so ruthless

72
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,188
to destroy his body?

73
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,029
If he hadn't saved you,

74
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,949
he wouldn't have ended up like this.

75
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:27,184
Li!

76
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:34,748
Fu Sheng,

77
00:11:34,748 --> 00:11:37,089
my most loyal Chimei.

78
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:39,509
You did not disappoint me.

79
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:41,828
Now that your task is completed,

80
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:45,069
and my scheme is about to succeed,

81
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,949
leave the rest to me.

82
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,016
Mofang.

83
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:54,128
My child.

84
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:56,389
Come inside now.

85
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,628
I've waited for you for too long.

86
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:20,709
You conclude

87
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,029
that I'm no longer fit for the role
of a god,

88
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:28,368
right?

89
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:32,949
Are you telling me

90
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,949
that I cannot guard the Three Realms

91
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:41,008
anymore?

92
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:49,808
This time,

93
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,188
I am determined to compete

94
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:56,624
with the Natural Law.

95
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:37,469
Mofang, why do you resist my power?

96
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:39,349
I've been trapped here
for a thousand years,

97
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:41,428
and you have tossed around
for a thousand years.

98
00:13:41,428 --> 00:13:43,889
Now, we've nearly made it.

99
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,149
How can you be indulged
in personal affections?

100
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:49,549
Capture ShenLi.

101
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:51,428
Capture her.

102
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:54,949
I will be reborn through your flesh.

103
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:59,188
Then, I will be the only ruler
of the Three Realms.

104
00:14:02,988 --> 00:14:04,149
Aren't you their young master?

105
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:06,640
Quick.

106
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:08,816
Kill me.

107
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:10,909
This isn't Fu Sheng's power.

108
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:12,949
I can't control it for long.

109
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:19,568
Quick!

110
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:21,648
Kill me.

111
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:27,728
Mofang.

112
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:29,680
In your life,

113
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:31,829
what do you live for?

114
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,064
Why?

115
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,176
Why?

116
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:42,988
Due to my identity,

117
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:45,909
I had to betray you.

118
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:48,188
Following my heart,

119
00:14:50,544 --> 00:14:51,664
I can't

120
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:55,760
kill you.

121
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:13,360
In my life,

122
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:16,829
I carried hatred

123
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,709
and lived for others,

124
00:16:26,508 --> 00:16:27,508

You don't even spare your child.

167
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:23,869
You're so heartless.

168
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:28,229
My son is unfilial.

169
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:32,689
He has ruined my plan
for personal affairs.

170
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:33,744
His life

171
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:36,248
is nothing

172
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:37,469
compared to my great ambition.

173
00:21:37,469 --> 00:21:38,669
Liuming.

174
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:41,068
It's been a long time
since I've heard my own name.

175
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:42,749
It even sounds strange to me.

176
00:21:43,388 --> 00:21:45,868
Young girl, come inside quickly.

177
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:46,960
Otherwise,

178
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:49,388
that deity will be coming after you.

179
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,749
Do you really think
the gods are omnipotent?

180
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:03,829
Why have the gods been disappearing
over the millennia?

181
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,068
Why

182
00:23:06,068 --> 00:23:08,749
has no gods been born anymore?

183
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:13,668
The forces contending
with the Natural Law are too powerful.

184
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,188
At the beginning of ancient times,
Heaven and Earth were chaotic.

185
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:20,269
So, they were needed
to create a pure and clear realm

186
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:22,229
for all things in the world.

187
00:23:22,829 --> 00:23:25,268
But now, the power
of gods is no longer needed.

188
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,388
They can only be worshiped

189
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,349
and confined.

190
00:23:29,869 --> 00:23:32,308
The gods are fading away

191
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:36,068
because they have no reason to exist.

192
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:39,589
They have been abandoned.

193
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:41,469
Xingzhi

194
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,329
is merely the proof

195
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:47,589
of the ancient gods' struggle
to survive.

196
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:51,509
A thousand years ago,

197
00:23:53,028 --> 00:23:54,469
he relied on the power
of the five elements

198
00:23:55,148 --> 00:23:57,109
and the Immortal Realm

199
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,109
to create the Xutian Abyss.

200
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:01,529
But a thousand years have passed.

201
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:04,109
His divine power has faded.

202
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:05,709
Do you think

203
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,589
he still has the power
to create another Xutian Abyss?

204
00:24:09,788 --> 00:24:11,349
The Divine Realm

205
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,949
relies on Xingzhi

206
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:15,668
to dominate the Three Realms.

207
00:24:17,148 --> 00:24:18,709
Without Xingzhi,

208
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:21,268
would they rule the Immortal?

209
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:23,349
Kill them.

210
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:27,268
The Divine Realm is indeed weak,

211
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,028
and the Immortal suffer from injustice.

212
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:34,668
But to create puppets and Chimei,

213
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:38,548
you even harmed the lives
of the Immortal Realm.

214
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,349
Why should they die

215
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,349
for your dissatisfaction?

216
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:50,148
I will not help you.

217
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,949
Are you also unwilling
to help your father?

218
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:21,589
You feel it, don't you?

219
00:25:22,428 --> 00:25:24,829
This is my proudest creation,

220
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:28,109
your father.

221
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:36,589
Fenglai?

222
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:37,668
Good child.

223
00:25:39,229 --> 00:25:42,109
Good child, it's time to wake up.

224
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,989
It's time for you to go out.

225
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:36,240
Just do it.

226
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,949
I have replaced the other four seals.

227
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,308
I set you free,

228
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:45,608
and you won't be the seal anymore.

229
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:48,028
You will be free.

230
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:52,176
Liuyu.

231
00:26:55,749 --> 00:26:56,869
Where is Liuyu?

232
00:26:59,428 --> 00:27:00,432
Liuyu.

233
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,388
Liuyu has been dead for a long time.

234
00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:12,829
Dead?

235
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:15,068
Yes.

236
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,188
She's abandoned by the world.

237
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:22,109
- Impossible
- She died for the gods.

238
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,216
Impossible.

239
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,268
The one who killed her is right
outside the Xutian Abyss.

240
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:42,576
No.

241
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,028
I haven't come back yet.

242
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:49,028
How could she be dead?

243
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:53,584
Hurry up and go out.

244
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:56,669
Kill that god to avenge Liuyu.

245
00:27:56,669 --> 00:27:57,709
Go out.

246
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:01,168
Impossible.

247
00:28:05,068 --> 00:28:06,160
No.

248
00:28:13,989 --> 00:28:15,088
It's not true.

249
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:19,109
(Xutian Abyss is created
with the power of five elements.)

250
00:28:19,709 --> 00:28:20,749
(The Fire Seal is crucial)

251
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,469
(among the Seals of Five Elements.)

252
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:24,428
(If Fenglai breaks the seal,)

253
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:26,148
(the Xutian Abyss will collapse.)

254
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,856
(I must stop it.)

255
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:37,328
Mofang is dead.

256
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:39,869
Do you still work for him?

257
00:28:40,589 --> 00:28:43,268
I was born for my Lord's wish.

258
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:45,788
I'm willing to die

259
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:48,829
for my Lord.

260
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,109
Fine, I'll kill you right now.

261
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,428
Your Lordship.

262
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:31,548
Don't move. That's not her.

263
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,069
That is the King of Chimei.

264
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,548
- King of Chimei.
- He has escaped.

265
00:29:39,829 --> 00:29:41,269
The Xutian Abyss is about to open.

266
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,308
The Chimei inside are all going
to run out.

267
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,749
(If the Xutian Abyss collapses
and the Chimei escape,)

268
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:05,629
(the Immortal Realm will be in turmoil.)

269
00:30:06,229 --> 00:30:08,229
