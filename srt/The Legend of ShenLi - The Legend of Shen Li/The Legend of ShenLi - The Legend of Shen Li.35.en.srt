=Episode 35=

3
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,360
He intends to attack His Excellency?

4
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,807
No, he is reminding him.

5
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:09,872
Reminding him of what?

6
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:24,746
Reminding him that he can use him.

7
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,947
Candied lotus seeds, come take a look!

8
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,587
Ice pops!

9
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:02,906
(Our people were lucky
to be protected and safe.)

10
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:07,546
(And I'm lucky to watch
this memory to know)

11
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:11,427
(where exactly
Xingzhi's formation's core is.)

12
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:52,944
Xingzhi.

13
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,786
That is the ancient god, Xingzhi.

14
00:05:29,424 --> 00:05:30,427
Go.

15
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:31,536
Thank you.

16
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:34,448
Drink it.

17
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,167
- I won't drink it!
- Young master.

18
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,747
- Young master.
- I won't!

19
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:41,327
Only by drinking my heart's blood

20
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:42,807
will you become stronger

21
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:46,427
and open the Xutian Abyss
to save your father.

22
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,087
I've said it. I won't drink.

23
00:05:51,087 --> 00:05:53,867
You have drunk it
for so many years, why refuse now?

24
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:56,208
Because it was wrong.

25
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,352
It was wrong?

26
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:01,826
You shouldn't have saved me
when you escaped the Immortal Realm.

27
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:03,568
I shouldn't have?

28
00:06:05,427 --> 00:06:07,707
I was born weak and not ruthless enough.

29
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:10,967
Destined not to fulfill your wish.

30
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,066
It is our wish.

31
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,907
Can we turn back now?

32
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:25,264
We can't already!

33
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:35,546
It's been so many days.

34
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:38,346
I've consumed
so much power of purification.

35
00:06:39,187 --> 00:06:40,266
But he hasn't woken up.

36
00:06:57,786 --> 00:07:00,907
Don't come to me! I'll hit you!

37
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:08,907
It's your power of purification.

38
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:16,747
You're awake now?

39
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,967
It is not enough.

40
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,927
You cannot control me for long.

41
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:29,187
I can't suppress him for too long.

42
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:31,666
Hurry back to the Divine Realm
and relay the message.

43
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:33,207
He is going to act
against the Xutian Abyss.

44
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:34,480
He'll replace the seal

45
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,536
and open it.

46
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:38,907
How can the Xutian Abyss be opened?
What are you saying?

47
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:40,016
Kill me!

48
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:44,007
What? I saved you.

49
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,546
You cannot decide your death.

50
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:50,346
Furong, kill me and end all this now!

51
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:52,647
Are you being possessed?

52
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:53,727
He wants to control you.

53
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,586
- Kill me.
- Dream on.

54
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:56,667
Now!

55
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:58,747
No. I better purify you.

56
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,066
Your life is at my disposal.

57
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:47,507
Go. Get the message back
to the Divine Realm.

58
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:05,136
Why don't you understand yet?

59
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:11,146
This matter
is now unstoppable by anyone.

60
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:24,427
Lord Furong.

61
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:25,706
What's wrong? Are you okay?

62
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:28,747
I need to see my grandfather now!

63
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:30,987
His Lordship is meeting
with Her Holiness.

64
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,546
Just right! I'll see them both.

65
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,927
After you talked to His Excellency,

66
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,346
did he change his mind?

67
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:42,747
Just leave Li
in the Extranatural Heaven.

68
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:45,746
What do you mean?

69
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,706
I have come to bid farewell to you.

70
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,026
I shall return.

71
00:09:51,504 --> 00:09:52,546
Well...

72
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:56,346
Grandfather, this is bad!

73
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:58,987
Grandfather, this is bad!

74
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,207
What now? You're so jumpy.

75
00:10:02,207 --> 00:10:04,624
With so much going on,
where have you been wandering around?

76
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:05,808
Grandfather,

77
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,947
he has been collecting meteorites
for His Excellency recently.

78
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:09,904
I've seen Mofang.

79
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:12,080
Mofang.

80
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,026
Who is Mofang?

81
00:10:15,026 --> 00:10:16,627
It seems like
he was controlled by something.

82
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:17,776
He told me a villain

83
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:19,447
wanted to replace
the Xutian Abyss's seal

84
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:21,267
and open it to release
the Chimei inside.

85
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:23,047
Who dares to do it?

86
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:26,627
Heavenly Lord,
matters are pressing. I gotta go.

87
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,026
Qingyan, Chirong, let's go.

88
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:30,672
Wait.

89
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,507
Grandfather, the Xutian Abyss
concerns not only the Immortal Realm.

90
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,407
If tens of thousands of Chimei escape,

91
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:46,706
we won't remain uninvolved.

92
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:51,387
I've been diligently practicing
the power of purification

93
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:55,507
which seems to have
an effect in dispelling miasma.

94
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:06,307
I'd love to join Her Holiness to resist
the enemies in the Immortal Realm.

95
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:13,827
It's commendable, but this is not
a matter to be treated lightly.

96
00:11:16,747 --> 00:11:20,106
This is what I think...

97
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:22,288
I...

98
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:31,827
Please permit, Grandfather.

99
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:34,207
According to what I've observed,

100
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:36,466
Furong has grown up.

101
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,906
Alright, go with Her Holiness.

102
00:11:57,906 --> 00:12:00,466
I'll muster troops and come to aid you.

103
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:02,352
Thank you, Grandfather.

104
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:04,528
Thank you.

105
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,027
After thousands of years,

106
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:11,707
our realms are joining forces
to battle Chimei again.

107
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:14,906
Let's hope we will
emerge victorious once again.

108
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:16,400
I can't make sure of it,

109
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:19,924
but I'll strive to give my all,
with no regrets.

110
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,627
Please take care of him for me.

111
00:12:25,387 --> 00:12:26,480
Let's go.

112
00:12:38,947 --> 00:12:42,187
Peace is hard to earn in the world.

113
00:12:44,084 --> 00:12:46,580
(Western Garden)

114
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,987
Lords, I've come here to pray.

115
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,586
Lord Xingzhi has lost his composure.

116
00:13:08,106 --> 00:13:10,106
I know it is not His Excellency's fault.

117
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:12,786
But rocks are falling
from the Extranatural Heaven.

118
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:17,026
Disasters befall the world,
and villains seize the opportunity.

119
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:20,227
My brother possesses
the power of purification.

120
00:13:20,227 --> 00:13:21,867
He can do something for the world,

121
00:13:22,627 --> 00:13:24,067
but I do not know

122
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,067
how I can help others.

123
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:31,546
So here I am,
sincerely praying to all of you.

124
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:35,024
I hope you'll protect the Three Realms

125
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:37,364
and Lord Xingzhi.

126
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,346
And may everyone be safe.

127
00:14:05,987 --> 00:14:08,427
I am in the Extranatural Heaven!

128
00:14:10,546 --> 00:14:13,187
The gods helped me come here.
I gotta go look for ShenLi.

129
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:46,736
ShenLi's spear.

130
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:51,586
Let me take it to her.

131
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:55,248
It's so heavy.

132
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,987
(I knew it. Xingzhi used a double seal
on the Xutian Abyss.)

133
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:43,026
(Same goes for this one.)

134
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:45,507
(The formation's core is within it.)

135
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:52,466
(The least likely place
to be discovered is on me.)

136
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:00,272
ShenLi.

137
00:16:00,272 --> 00:16:04,047
Youlan, how did you get here?

138
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,767
I don't know.

139
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:07,824
Perhaps the gods

140
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,967
no longer wished
to see things develop this way.

141
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:11,056
The gods?

142
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,026
There's no time to explain.
Is this your spear?

143
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:18,267
My spear...

144
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:26,026
My spear. How come it...?

145
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:28,546
His Excellency repaired it for you.

146
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,566
Let's leave now.

147
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:33,307
Or you can't

148
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:34,387
when Lord Xingzhi returns.

149
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,586
These clothes can be
worn by both boys and girls.

150
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:49,207
I will make more, both large and small,

151
00:16:49,207 --> 00:16:50,466
for the baby to wear longer.

152
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:59,466
Liuyu, you can't

153
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:02,546
bear the power of your half-Chimei baby.

154
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:05,927
You shouldn't keep it.

155
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:09,586
Muyue, I will keep it.

156
00:17:12,066 --> 00:17:13,136
I definitely will.

157
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:28,267
Liuyu!

158
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:30,000
Muyue.

159
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:38,507
Liuyu, are you alright?

160
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:45,226
Muyue, I'm afraid
I can't hold on any longer.

161
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,487
I want to go outside the Xutian Abyss.

162
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,627
How can you go now?

163
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,946
Just take me there.

164
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:58,787
In the final moments, I want to...

165
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:05,027
I want to be a bit closer to him.

166
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,627
I'll take you there.

167
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,136
Muyue.

168
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:34,066
My inner core, though it can
help her conceal her identity,

169
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,027
is not hers by birth after all.

170
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:42,826
It will certainly be more difficult
for her than for normal people

171
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:47,787
to learn spells in her youth.

172
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:56,667
But I believe that one day,

173
00:19:58,507 --> 00:20:00,346
she will integrate
the inner core completely.

174
00:20:06,826 --> 00:20:10,066
Liuyu, even if you give
her your inner core,

175
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,586
its energy can only last
until she comes of age.

176
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,346
After that, she'll have to

177
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:21,186
rely on her own original one.

178
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:35,466
Muyue, I can't accompany her anymore.

179
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:41,507
Please do it in my stead
as she grows up.

180
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:47,507
Help me take a look at

181
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:52,186
what she will be like as an adult.

Let's call it the Azure Sea Pearl.

192
00:21:40,147 --> 00:21:45,747
I only hope that she can
freely sail through the vast ocean,

Great.

204
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:20,907
Leaving the Extranatural Heaven
is easier than I thought.

205
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:24,186
As you said, the gods are helping us.

206
00:23:26,226 --> 00:23:28,066
I will sincerely worship upon my return.

207
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,706
Grandfather, Lord Bicang
is returning to the Immortal Realm.

208
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,507
Heavenly Lord.

209
00:23:40,507 --> 00:23:44,087
Lord Bicang, the Three Realms
are in peril,

210
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:45,907
including the Immortal Realm.

211
00:23:45,907 --> 00:23:47,507
I know.

212
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:55,407
If Lord Xingzhi does it again,

213
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:57,826
could you please try to stop him?

214
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:03,147
If you only want to say it, I'm leaving.

215
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:06,864
He knows what he's doing.

216
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,667
Grandfather, Lord Bicang has left.
Let's do it right away.

217
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:38,466
Furong's power of purification
really has been a great help.

218
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:41,106
The miasma in our camp
has almost all been cleared.

219
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:44,007
But now, the Sifang Seal
and the entrance of the Xutian Abyss

220
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:45,072
are all surrounded by puppets.

221
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:47,267
We can't break through them.

222
00:26:13,466 --> 00:26:15,387
Your Holiness, it's too late.

223
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:20,867
No matter who the opponent is,
we cannot step back.

224
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:27,186
This is the last hope for our people.

225
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:39,152
Shen Muyue, you are already
at the end of your strength.

226
00:27:39,152 --> 00:27:40,884
Why endure the struggle?

227
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:44,186
I thought you were Mofang.

228
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:51,226
Turns out you're just a reject.

229
00:27:52,627 --> 00:27:55,867
You took over his body,
and you're this arrogant?

230
00:27:56,787 --> 00:27:59,627
Are you giving me attitude even now?

231
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:02,426
You can't even block my puppets,

232
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:06,226
let alone the thousands
of Chimei inside the Xutian Abyss.

233
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:10,106
They will soon be free.

234
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:25,872
Here.

235
00:28:41,907 --> 00:28:42,960
Hold on.

236
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:48,267
The Three Realms will eventually
be as my master wishes.

237
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,346
F-F-Furong,

238
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:32,627
I want to see my mother again.

239
00:29:35,027 --> 00:29:37,867
You will. Hang in there.

240
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,344
Furong.

241
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:57,552
Luotian.

242
00:31:04,147 --> 00:31:06,707
You're hurt. Let me take a look.

243
00:31:06,707 --> 00:31:09,907
I'm fine. Her Holiness told me
to stay behind and heal people.

244
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:11,568
But it can't solve the problem.

245
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:13,456
I have the power of purification.

246
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:16,066
I will no longer hide behind anyone.

247
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,907
He has finally grown up.

248
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,207
Some of you set up
defenses on the east side.

249
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:46,466
Some of you on the west side.
You must hold your ground.

250
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,720
General Shangbei.

251
00:31:56,176 --> 00:31:57,247
Your Lordship.

252
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,426
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

253
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,147
Your Lordship, welcome back.

254
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:04,186
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

255
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,667
We are all waiting for you.

256
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:11,027
Where is Her Holiness?

257
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:13,127
Her Holiness has taken troops
to the Xutian Abyss.

258
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:16,027
We are defending the city here,
unaware of the situation over there.

259
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:20,144
Okay, everyone takes their positions.

260
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:21,872
No mistakes are allowed.

261
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:23,066
- Yes.
- Yes

262
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,987
I'll go to join
Her Holiness. I'll leave.

263
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,000
Yes.

264
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,826
Another one comes to seek death.

265
00:33:54,706 --> 00:33:56,346
Heed my command.

266
00:33:57,346 --> 00:34:00,306
Protect the Immortal Warriors.
Slay the puppets.

267
00:34:01,066 --> 00:34:02,160
- Yes!
- Yes!

268
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,672
Mofang.

269
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:12,046
Your purification technique
is quite good,

270
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:14,186
but not enough to harm me.

271
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,587
How dare you harm
the Heavenly Lord's grandson?

272
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:28,336
Heavenly Lord's grandson?

273
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:33,706
This world is already within my grasp.

274
00:35:35,226 --> 00:35:36,386
I am heaven.

275
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:42,466
Luotian, stand behind me
as you're just a pill maker.

276
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:44,624
Don't try to be strong now.

277
00:36:19,866 --> 00:36:20,976
ShenLi.

278
00:36:23,426 --> 00:36:25,626
Take him to be treated
and leave it to me.

279
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:27,696
I am fine.

280
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:28,752
Leave!

281
00:36:28,752 --> 00:36:29,840
Listen to her.

282
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,107
Hello again, Your Lordship.

283
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,547
Fu Sheng, what have you done
to the Xutian Abyss?

284
00:36:49,426 --> 00:36:51,226
I have done something.

285
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:53,747
But now, I'm the last person

286
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:56,906
who wants the seal to be broken.

287
00:36:57,626 --> 00:36:58,906
If it gets destroyed,

288
00:37:00,146 --> 00:37:01,827
implicating the Immortal Realm
is a minor matter.

289
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:04,827
If the Chimei are destroyed too,

290
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:08,747
it would be a headache.

291
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:13,347
(For thousands of years, the abyss
has become part of the Immortal Realm.)

292
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,827
(If it disappears,)

293
00:37:14,827 --> 00:37:16,827
(the Chimei within
will certainly be completely destroyed.)

294
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,067
(But the Immortal Realm
will be destroyed too.)

295
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:27,666
What exactly are you plotting?

296
00:37:31,946 --> 00:37:36,267
I am here to discuss it with you.

297
00:37:37,186 --> 00:37:38,747
You're an essential part

298
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:42,547
