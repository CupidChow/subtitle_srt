00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,178
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:40,848
As I said,

4
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,604
as long as you are ShenLi,

5
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:54,608
nothing

6
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:56,924
will change

7
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:01,405
no matter whether

8
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:04,485
you're a Chimei.

9
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:06,672
Xingzhi.

10
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:09,808
You're everything

11
00:02:10,885 --> 00:02:11,984
I need.

12
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,344
(ShenLi.)

13
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,945
(The King of Chimei lost his sanity)

14
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,165
(under Liuming's control.)

15
00:02:40,605 --> 00:02:41,885
(It can't go on like this.)

16
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:43,885
(We must restrain him)

17
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,204
(from killing the innocent.)

18
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,564
Hang in there.

19
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,576
ShenLi.

20
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:49,925
ShenLi, I can purify him.

21
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:51,984
Let me help you.

22
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:11,280
Liuyu.

23
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,088
Liuyu.

24
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:32,545
The Red Plume Spear can't hold out.

25
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:33,552
Let's go.

26
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,605
It's impossible. We can't win.

27
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:54,404
Come to your senses.

28
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:55,645
We can't escape from it.

29
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:57,785
It's a critical moment.

30
00:07:57,785 --> 00:07:59,645
This is the final battle, understand?

31
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,465
We're not fighting for ourselves.

32
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,445
We're defending
the Immortal and Divine realms.

33
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,685
No retreat. Not even a single step.

34
00:08:12,685 --> 00:08:13,945
We either win

35
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,005
or die!

36
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,304
We either win

37
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:18,925
or die!

38
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:20,325
No retreat.

39
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:44,592
United we stand.

40
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:46,484
There is a chance.

41
00:08:47,804 --> 00:08:48,912
There must be.

42
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:05,136
ShenLi.

43
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,684
The Extranatural Heaven
is going to break down.

44
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:11,645
Perhaps the Natural Law

45
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:13,456
can no longer stand

46
00:09:14,405 --> 00:09:15,765
a disobedient god like me.

47
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:19,632
Forget it.

48
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,484
Listen carefully to what comes next.

49
00:09:24,044 --> 00:09:25,244
You have a decision to make.

50
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:33,205
They replaced the seals

51
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:36,285
of the Xutian Abyss
with four other things.

52
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,405
But they are far less

53
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,965
powerful than the original seals.

54
00:09:42,244 --> 00:09:44,765
Thus I'm only
holding up the Xutian Abyss

55
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:49,604
and sealing its entrance with a barrier.

56
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,336
Right now,

57
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,032
there is

58
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:55,600
but one way out.

59
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:57,232
Just tell me.

60
00:09:58,684 --> 00:09:59,924
I will take those four seals

61
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:01,840
and link them

62
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,285
to the Extranatural Heaven.

63
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:06,925
That would be great.

64
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:09,364
It could resolve
both crises at the same time.

65
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:12,505
But when I connect

66
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,885
the Xutian Abyss
with the Extranatural Heaven,

67
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:18,192
the Fire Seal

68
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,240
must hold firm.

69
00:10:24,464 --> 00:10:25,484
I'm afraid this spear

70
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,085
won't hold out.

71
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:32,464
Then,

72
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,005
the Xutian Abyss will vanish
with the Extranatural Heaven.

73
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:39,244
The Divine and Immortal realms

74
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:41,325
will be intact.

75
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:43,564
It's only going to

76
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:48,688
implicate you.

77
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:01,604
You know what I will choose.

78
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:05,008
Yes, I do.

79
00:11:58,924 --> 00:12:00,965
Stop hesitating.
Destroy the Xutian Abyss.

80
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:11,484
Your life is at stake.

81
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,445
How can you agree to it
without any hesitation?

82
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:19,244
It's not in my nature.

83
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,164
Sorry.

84
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,244
The life you so painstakingly saved

85
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:26,285
is going to perish now.

86
00:12:32,405 --> 00:12:33,665
Once I'm done with

87
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,885
those four seals,

88
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:38,525
I'll keep you company.

89
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:44,364
I will

90
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:46,244
perish as Xingzhi.

91
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,048
The Extranatural Heaven

92
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:50,684
will vanish along with the Xutian Abyss.

93
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,645
The Divine and Immortal realms

94
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:57,164
will be intact.

95
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:00,784
You have

96
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:04,164
thought it through on your way here?

97
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,368
Actually,

98
00:13:17,285 --> 00:13:19,364
you could have done it
outside the Xutian Abyss.

99
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,705
Why did you...

100
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,205
I dare not imagine

101
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:26,645
a world without you.

102
00:13:30,405 --> 00:13:31,440
Ending it

103
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,320
with you

104
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:37,445
is the best outcome

105
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:39,760
I can think of.

106
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:47,124
I'm just afraid

107
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:49,936
that I can't even

108
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,164
join you in the end.

109
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:58,564
It won't happen.

00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:51,085
I will leave for a while.

122
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,564
The divine power may weaken.

123
00:14:53,405 --> 00:14:55,204
I must trouble you all to support

124
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,144
this temporary barrier for a while.

125
00:14:57,144 --> 00:14:58,325
It goes without saying.

126
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,325
We will defend the barrier

127
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,164
and we won't let you down.

128
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:03,856
You may achieve

129
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:05,405

can no longer heal.

149
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:34,124
So my divine power

150
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,364
has deteriorated to this point.

151
00:17:00,804 --> 00:17:02,484
Even without this trial,

152
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:06,960
it seems I'm about to

153
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:09,604
reach the end of my days.

154
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,364
When it comes to indifference,

155
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,165
who can surpass you

156
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:28,045
in this world?

157
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:30,685
It's made for use

158
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,124
and discarded afterward.

159
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,685
The divine power of a god

160
00:17:38,565 --> 00:17:40,324
can rival the Natural Law?

161
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:42,724
Utter nonsense.

162
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,005
Now that I think about it,

163
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,324
everyone

164
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,456
is just

165
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:57,045
a toy for you.

166
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:21,885
The exit is shrinking.

167
00:20:23,324 --> 00:20:24,484
His Excellency did something.

168
00:20:29,484 --> 00:20:31,285
Follow His Excellency's instruction.

169
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:33,645
Guard the barrier well
before everything ends.

170
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:45,872
The Extranatural Heaven

171
00:20:47,885 --> 00:20:49,045
and the Xutian Abyss

172
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,964
are finally connected.

173
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:28,964
I'm coming over now.

174
00:21:31,525 --> 00:21:32,624
Li.

175
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,444
We can finally lay down

176
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:45,885
the burdens we shoulder.

177
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,112
I had a nice dream.

178
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:30,364
It couldn't be better

179
00:22:31,645 --> 00:22:32,964
to wake up and see you.

180
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:45,084
You're just watching yourself die.

181
00:22:47,444 --> 00:22:48,496
Xingzhi.

182
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:53,604
You are so harsh on yourself.

183
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,808
I'm sorry

184
00:22:59,324 --> 00:23:00,604
for making you worry.

185
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:03,844
I don't want your apology.

186
00:23:04,604 --> 00:23:05,724
I feel for you.

187
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:12,604
It's really nice

188
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:15,280
to be cared for.

189
00:23:17,364 --> 00:23:19,005
I've always felt for you.

190
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:21,360
♪In this lifetime♪

191
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,264
♪I only feel complete around you♪

192
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:27,888

in this lifetime.

199
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:00,912
Now,

200
00:24:02,765 --> 00:24:03,964
neither of us can get out.

201
00:24:09,645 --> 00:24:11,165
We never planned to leave.

(Lord Bicang's Mansion)

217

Liuyu.

218
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:37,712
Where are you?

219
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,848
Fenglai.

220
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:54,448
Shen Muyue.

221
00:25:57,604 --> 00:25:58,765
The courtyard is gone.

222
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:01,204
And the Yu Courtyard.

223
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,364
The only trace of her presence is here.

224
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:08,176
Where is Liuyu?

225
00:26:21,484 --> 00:26:22,640
I never thought

226
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:25,525
I'd see you again.

227
00:26:27,204 --> 00:26:28,272
Where is Liuyu?

228
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:33,104
She's dead.

229
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:39,885
It's been 1000 years.

230
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:42,925
I'm afraid
you can't even find her remains.

231
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:45,776
No way.

232
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:50,204
She said she'd wait for me.

233
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:01,805
She said she'd wait for you.

234
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:06,285
But the ways of the world
seldom grant our wishes.

235
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:09,324
A thousand years ago,

236
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:12,124
you were sealed in the Xutian Abyss.

237
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:15,120
Liuyu perished

238
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,525
outside the abyss soon after that.

239
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:25,124
I buried her in person.

240
00:27:26,484 --> 00:27:28,885
But I can still sense her presence here.

241
00:27:33,724 --> 00:27:35,484
She gave birth to your daughter.

242
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:40,364
My daughter?

243
00:27:43,805 --> 00:27:45,364
She left behind a daughter

244
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:49,185
as if she extended her own life.

245
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:51,964
To protect her, she was given my surname

246
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:53,936
and named ShenLi.

247
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:00,685
This is where she used to live.

248
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:04,165
The presence you sensed

249
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:05,885
was left by her.

250
00:28:08,124 --> 00:28:09,244
You've arrived here.

251
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,685
It means Li has already taken your place

252
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:19,244
and become the seal of the abyss.

253
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,888
My daughter.

254
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:31,124
Xutian Abyss.

255
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,604
Liuyu perished outside the Xutian Abyss.

256
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:37,805
ShenLi is in there now.

257
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,844
They have reunited in a way.

258
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:44,720
Did Liuyu

259
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:47,765
like this child?

260
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,016
Yes, she did.

261
00:28:53,405 --> 00:28:55,484
She loved her more than anything.

262
00:28:57,685 --> 00:28:59,005
She gave ShenLi her inner core

263
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:02,324
as a way to extend her life.

264
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,345
Life is like flowing water.

265
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,685
Sometimes it is turbulent.

266
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:10,204
Sometimes it dries up.

267
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:13,244
But it never stops.

268
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,120
This is

269
00:29:16,484 --> 00:29:17,645
the continuation of life.

270
00:29:34,032 --> 00:29:35,120
Fenglai.

271
00:29:44,084 --> 00:29:45,168
Your journey

272
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:48,565
will be fraught with danger.

273
00:29:49,444 --> 00:29:50,544
I'm doing this

274
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:53,444
for Liuyu

275
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:56,656
and also

276
00:30:00,496 --> 00:30:01,552
my daughter.

277
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,072
Sorry.

278
00:30:10,364 --> 00:30:11,645
I have to save Li.

279
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:29,392
Her Lordship is still in there.

280
00:30:29,925 --> 00:30:31,244
And His Excellency hasn't come out.

281
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:33,204
The Xutian Abyss has collapsed.

282
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:42,324
Someone is helping us.

283
00:31:57,765 --> 00:31:58,800
Your Lordship.

284
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,984
Your Excellency.

285
00:32:02,084 --> 00:32:03,120
He flew in.

286
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:05,724
Why does this phoenix
look just like ShenLi?

287
00:32:07,324 --> 00:32:08,525
It's been a thousand years.

288
00:32:09,324 --> 00:32:11,885
I almost forgot
what the King of Chimei looks like.

289
00:32:21,392 --> 00:32:22,576
The Xutian Abyss

290
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,160
has been saved.

291
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:30,480
We are

292
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:32,784
a real mess.

293
00:33:00,565 --> 00:33:01,964
You may be an ancient god.

294
00:33:04,405 --> 00:33:05,964
But I don't find you so fancy.

295
00:33:20,925 --> 00:33:21,936
However,

296
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,124
