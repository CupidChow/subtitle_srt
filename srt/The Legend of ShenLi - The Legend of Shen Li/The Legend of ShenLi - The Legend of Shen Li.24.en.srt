=Episode 24=

3
00:01:41,956 --> 00:01:42,960
ShenLi.

4
00:01:43,835 --> 00:01:44,912
ShenLi.

5
00:02:02,316 --> 00:02:03,344
ShenLi.

6
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:10,960
ShenLi.

7
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:20,528
Was it a hallucination?

8
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,144
Xingzhi.

9
00:02:33,836 --> 00:02:34,864
Xingzhi.

10
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:38,320
ShenLi.

11
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:40,816
You...

12
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:42,640
Are you here?

13
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,075
The Heavenly Lord was right.

14
00:02:46,515 --> 00:02:48,396
As a god,
I am bound to protect the world.

15
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,875
My life is not my own.

16
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:55,036
It is my duty
to protect all living beings,

17
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,196
looking at the greater good.

18
00:02:57,995 --> 00:02:59,235
There are so many things

19
00:03:00,196 --> 00:03:01,200
I shouldn't,

20
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:02,896
can't,

21
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,912
or mustn't do.

22
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:13,075
Why do you look like you
want to take liberties with me?

23
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,515
Assume it that way then.

24
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,196
It is strange.

25
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:27,196
Especially after meeting
Your Excellency,

26
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:29,235
I got injured in every fight.

27
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:32,316
If one day I die on the battlefield,

28
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,160
at that time

29
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:36,155
you must pay with your life.

30
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:37,756
If such a day comes,

31
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,075
I'll pay you with my life.

32
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:42,160
ShenLi.

33
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:45,488
Wait for me.

34
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:22,515
You can't stop me.

35
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:27,760
Even if today

36
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,315
I am backlashed by divine power

37
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:31,315
and have my bones scraped,

38
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:39,915
you still can't stop me.

39
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:25,936
ShenLi.

40
00:07:29,436 --> 00:07:30,436

We might as well call off
the marriage alliance

85
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:10,636
between the two realms.

86
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:14,156
Heavenly Lord, help!

87
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:16,256
Heavenly Lord,

88
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:19,635
you must stand up for me!

89
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,236
Heavenly Lord!

90
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:25,836
Heavenly Lord!

91
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:30,956
You must stand up for me!

92
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:32,716
Heavenly Lord!

93
00:12:32,716 --> 00:12:33,706
Take it easy.

94
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:35,696
(Dragon King of East Sea)
You should be more careful at your age.

95
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:37,275
Why so panic?

96
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:41,836
His Excellency has frozen
thousands of miles of the East Sea,

97
00:12:41,836 --> 00:12:44,715
making it miserable
for all creatures in the sea.

98
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:48,195
Heavenly Lord, please save us all!

99
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:50,768
What?!

100
00:13:55,596 --> 00:13:56,656
Your Excellency.

101
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,156
What has happened to you?

102
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,824
You've been bleeding.

103
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:10,480
Your Excellency,

104
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:13,995
they said ShenLi was gone for good,

105
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,596
nowhere to be found,
so don't look for her anymore.

106
00:14:18,276 --> 00:14:19,344
Your Excellency.

107
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:30,576
Your Excellency.

108
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:32,796
During the freezing of the East Sea,

109
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:34,796
sea creatures
have been suffering greatly.

110
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,675
Your Excellency, please
empathize with them.

111
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:44,915
If ShenLi were here,

112
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:46,635
she would not want to see
this pointless searching.

113
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:58,796
I want to find her,

114
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:01,796
dead or alive.

115
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,476
Even if she's turned to ashes,

116
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:08,675
I must bring her back,

117
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:11,195
piece by piece.

118
00:15:13,836 --> 00:15:14,875
Please restrain your grief.

119
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:23,632
You shouldn't

120
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:26,836
say these to a deity.

121
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,216
Deities,

122
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:32,956
devoid of feelings,

123
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:38,675
are immune to grief.

124
00:15:41,956 --> 00:15:43,716
In that case,

125
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,276
there is no reason to restrain it.

126
00:15:59,596 --> 00:16:00,624
Your Excellency!

127
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:02,320
Your Excellency!

128
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,376
I now understand

129
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:09,435
what it's like to have

130
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:12,156
Natural Law backfire on me.

131
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,276
I never thought

132
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:18,224
I'd

133
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:22,396
wind up

134
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:24,995
like this.

135
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,555
I'd wind up like this...

136
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,672
In the past,

137
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,755
I underestimated how vast
the Three Realms were.

138
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:43,956
As a deity,

139
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,075
I could travel to any place

140
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:49,916
in an instant.

141
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,036
But now,

142
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,075
I've just come to realize

143
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:58,916
the vastness of the Three Realms,

144
00:17:01,836 --> 00:17:02,864
that I couldn't even

145
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,596
thoroughly search

146
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:09,075
the East Sea,

147
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:13,795
and couldn't find her.

148
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,176
Perhaps

149
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:18,915
it's the will of heaven.

150
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:20,996
(I regret it, ShenLi.)

151
00:18:23,956 --> 00:18:25,476
(I do like you.)

152
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:58,675
With injuries so severe, don't know

153
00:18:59,435 --> 00:19:00,675
if His Excellency could make it.

154
00:19:03,792 --> 00:19:04,912
But fortunately,

155
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:06,996
East Sea's ice seal has been broken.

156
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:09,328
(East Sea Dragon Palace)

157
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:17,104
My Lord.

158
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:19,035
My Lord.

159
00:19:19,915 --> 00:19:20,976
Come over here.

160
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:23,035
Don't wake His Excellency.

161
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,224
Sure.

162
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,356
You've had a hard time.

163
00:19:33,356 --> 00:19:34,596
It's good that the seal is broken.

164
00:19:34,596 --> 00:19:36,075
It's good that the seal is broken.

165
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:40,304
Given the situation now,

166
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,075
His Excellency
needs to stay here for a few days.

167
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:44,688
No problem.

168
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:48,656
List the losses of the East Sea.

169
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:49,915
I'll tell Grandfather once I return.

170
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,776
Do not hold a grudge against
His Excellency for this.

171
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,795
I dare not.

172
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:21,195
I didn't expect him

173
00:20:23,236 --> 00:20:25,555
to be so deeply emotional.

174
00:20:31,516 --> 00:20:32,592
Well.

175
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,596
East Sea's ice seal has been broken.

176
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,155
And Lord Bicang has...

177
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:53,536
Lord Bicang has fallen in battle.

178
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:55,035
I hope that Lord Xingzhi

179
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:58,836
will come to his senses soon.

180
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:01,840
Grandfather.

181
00:21:02,876 --> 00:21:04,155
The loss of Lord Bicang

182
00:21:04,756 --> 00:21:06,375
is a misfortune for the Immortal Realm.

183
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,996
But for Lord Xingzhi,

184
00:21:08,555 --> 00:21:10,435
it might be a blessing in disguise.

185
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:14,896
ShenLi died to exterminate the evil.

186
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,035
That's hardly fair.

187
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,555
Lord Xingzhi is the last ancient god
of the Three Realms,

188
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:21,636
the last guardian
and hope for all beings.

189
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,675
To keep his mind pure and clear,

190
00:21:24,356 --> 00:21:25,356
let alone ShenLi,

191
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:27,336
even you, I, or even the Immortal Realm,

192
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,560
can all be sacrificed.

193
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:38,448
Grandfather,

194
00:21:39,596 --> 00:21:41,956
I know how important His Excellency is
to the Three Realms,

195
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:45,555
and the relationship between them
goes against the Natural Law.

196
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:49,476
But ShenLi died for the Three Realms.

197
00:21:50,864 --> 00:21:51,952
Grandfather,

198
00:21:52,516 --> 00:21:54,476
please do not dishearten them.

199
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,956
Upset, huh?

200
00:22:16,956 --> 00:22:19,315
I'm grieved and shocked.

201
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:21,636
Grieved by ShenLi's death.

202
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:24,495
Shocked at the relationship
between her and His Excellency.

203
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:29,195
I have seen them in the Immortal Realm,
Mortal Realm, and Divine Realm.

204
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:31,836
How come I didn't notice anything
between them?

205
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:35,195
You didn't?

206
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:43,088
Sis,

207
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:45,456
you really are heartless.

208
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:48,636
I heard that ShenLi saved you
at the Cleansing Pool before.

209
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:53,756
Don't you feel anything about her death?

210
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:00,555
It's my fault, I am just stupid.

211
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:02,916
I've been with them for so long,

212
00:23:02,916 --> 00:23:05,155
had I known it'd end up like this,
I should've intervened.

213
00:23:06,756 --> 00:23:07,776
Indeed.

214
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,476
You've been with them for so long.

215
00:23:09,476 --> 00:23:12,495
Yes, why didn't I

216
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:14,336
try my best to seduce ShenLi?

217
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:16,236
Then it wouldn't have
turned out this way.

218
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:17,896
Then tell me in detail,

219
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,395
what happened between them?

220
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:24,215
Now I realized there were indeed many...

221
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:25,264
Tell me.

222
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,595
What's the point, though?

223
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:34,876
Just tell me.

224
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:37,956
You know the truth, then what?

225
00:23:39,915 --> 00:23:41,756
Don't leave me hanging,
spill the beans now.

226
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:43,504
Forget about it.

227
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,476
I won't tell anyone.

228
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:48,876
I'll bury these memories

229
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:51,120
forever.

230
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:54,176
Take it as the last thing I can do

231
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:55,996
for His Excellency and ShenLi.

232
00:24:04,636 --> 00:24:05,716
What's this stone for?

233
00:24:13,876 --> 00:24:16,275
To crack your head open
and find the truth myself.

234
00:24:28,996 --> 00:24:31,236
The Cleansing Pool
can not only remove miasma,

235
00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:33,296
but also

236
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:35,116
see the past.

237
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:46,768
Lord Furong.

238
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:51,195
Hasn't the Heavenly Lord

239
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:53,836
taught you to be properly dressed?

240
00:24:55,312 --> 00:24:56,368
Lord Furong.

241
00:24:57,075 --> 00:24:58,756
You said you came to help,

242
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:01,315
and you have taken a bath.

243
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:03,336
What a shame if we don't

244
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,716
purify the surroundings

245
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:06,416
with your great aura.

246
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:09,516
I just saw that there was miasma at
the southeastern corner of the city.

247
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,435
Is this

248
00:25:12,996 --> 00:25:14,915
His Excellency's first encounter
with Lord Furong?

249
00:25:15,675 --> 00:25:16,756
He was already this displeased.

250
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:28,075
Come on, throw me a few coins
if you're loaded.

251
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:29,736
Or feel free to just join us.

252
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,816
Lord Bicang's Mansion
is open for visitors.

253
00:25:31,816 --> 00:25:34,236
Lord Xingzhi outshines the moon
and makes the flowers shy.

254
00:25:35,356 --> 00:25:38,596
ShenLi has actually collected
so many weapons.

255
00:25:40,035 --> 00:25:42,315
So I have 100 ways to die.

256
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:43,915
Fortunately, I have a Qiankun Bag.

257
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:46,480
I'll steal all of them.

258
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,996
What on earth did you do
in the Immortal Realm?

259
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:01,456
I guess

260
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:02,675
ShenLi was quite courteous to me

261
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:04,836
when I was in the Immortal Realm.

262
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:10,224
Let's look at the next one.

263
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,040
Hand them over.

264
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:14,996
I-I've sold them.

265
00:26:16,476 --> 00:26:18,315
You didn't even
have time to hide the keys.

266
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,112
And you sold the things?

267
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:23,075
Hand them over.

268
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,476
At this moment,
His Excellency has already

269
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:25,795
started making decisions for ShenLi.

270
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:31,888
Take a look at this one.

271
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:34,608
Who else?

272
00:26:34,608 --> 00:26:35,675
I request to fight.

273
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:44,275
His Excellency seems jealous.

274
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:04,796
See, you should've practiced harder

275
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:06,516
to avoid ending up like this.

276
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:23,915
Alright, let's take a break.

277
00:27:36,035 --> 00:27:37,104
Tell me,

278
00:27:38,155 --> 00:27:39,315
how did I come back?

279
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:41,876
The goddess sent you back.

280
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,936
She said you fainted from

281
00:27:43,936 --> 00:27:45,756
excessive grief on your way.

282
00:27:48,272 --> 00:27:49,296
I

283
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,056
was that sad?

284
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:54,116
The goddess said so.

285
00:27:58,356 --> 00:27:59,836
I'm just too emotional.

286
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,116
Easy, my head hurts!

287
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:08,816
My Lord.

288
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:10,435
In my opinion,

289
00:28:11,116 --> 00:28:12,476
you might have been hit on the head.

290
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:17,376
Nonsense, who dares to hit my head?

291
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:18,448
Heavenly Lord?

292
00:28:19,356 --> 00:28:20,956
Besides the Heavenly Lord,
who dares to do so?

293
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:23,216
The goddess?

294
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:26,836
She dares not, and she can't.

295
00:28:28,035 --> 00:28:29,116
Why would she?

296
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:30,832
Keep massaging.

297
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:50,544
Let's continue.

298
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:52,395
And what is General Mofang

299
00:28:53,996 --> 00:28:55,035
to Your Lordship?

300
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:02,064
Another colleague.

301
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,035
The eye contact...

302
00:29:10,996 --> 00:29:12,116
Too obvious, isn't it?

303
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,395
If she hadn't been so hurt
that she couldn't move,

304
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:22,656
she would've gone after

305
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:25,195
the mastermind behind it today.

306
00:29:26,155 --> 00:29:27,716
So stubborn.

307
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,520
So

308
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:31,836
who would marry such a masculine woman?

309
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:34,096
This woman

310
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:36,275
has no vulnerable charm

311
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:38,716
that makes you pity her.

312
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:41,072
She has.

313
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:44,272
She has it.

314
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:46,448
She has.

315
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:48,304
He said she has it.

316
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:55,236
How could you ignore that?

317
00:29:55,236 --> 00:29:57,016
What were you doing back then?

318
00:29:57,016 --> 00:29:59,595
And you told me there was
nothing between them?

319
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:00,688
Useless.

320
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:11,795
I haven't had enough yet!

321
00:30:17,356 --> 00:30:18,416
It hurts so much.

322
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,000
Goddess,

323
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:23,736
how could the Diviner

324
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:26,195
just faint all of a sudden?

325
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,075
Maybe we should get a doctor
to check on him.

326
00:30:29,675 --> 00:30:31,435
I can't believe he passed out like that.

327
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:32,496
No need.

328
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:34,128
Lord Furong

329
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,195
was too upset.

330
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:41,840
Come here.

331
00:30:44,956 --> 00:30:45,996
Look,

332
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:47,676
I've applied some calming spells on you.

333
00:30:47,676 --> 00:30:49,116
You feel much better now, right?

334
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,275
The throbbing pain in my head

335
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:56,616
seems gone, all of a sudden.

336
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:59,275
You are just too sentimental.

337
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:02,544
I

338
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,836
really can't help myself.

339
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:11,776
(Tomorrow I can watch the final)

340
00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:13,075
(as your swelling goes down.)

341
00:31:13,996 --> 00:31:15,056
(Can't wait.)

342
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:22,160
Your Excellency,

343
00:31:24,155 --> 00:31:25,236
why did you come here today?

344
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,915
I came for Furong.

345
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:33,056
He brought you lots of trouble

346
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:34,656
in the Immortal Realm this time.

347
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,476
I'm sorry about that.

348
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,675
After I return to the Divine Realm,

349
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:40,315
I will report what I've seen

350
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,435
to the Heavenly Lord.

351
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,184
After you

352
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:48,956
marry into

353
00:31:48,956 --> 00:31:50,356
the Divine Realm,

354
00:31:51,435 --> 00:31:52,756
I'm sure

355
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:54,555
he won't be
so presumptuous as he is now.

356
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:56,848
Your Excellency,

357
00:31:57,356 --> 00:31:58,384
no.

358
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,315
No, Your Excellency.

359
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:04,516
The poison within you
hasn't been fully detoxified.

360
00:32:05,476 --> 00:32:06,608
Rest early.

361
00:32:14,315 --> 00:32:15,408
Is that all?

362
00:32:17,195 --> 00:32:18,716
Then they came to the Divine Realm,

363
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:20,915
and parted ways?

364
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:24,208
Is that it?

365
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,416
What a pity.

366
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:48,956
How could ShenLi...

367
00:33:52,675 --> 00:33:54,435
If only I had known earlier.

368
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:56,656
Sis.

369
00:33:58,356 --> 00:33:59,576
Don't tell me

370
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:01,595
I just passed out

371
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:03,075
lying on the bed.

372
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:06,315
No, you just fell asleep.

373
00:34:07,596 --> 00:34:09,875
But I feel so weak,

374
00:34:10,835 --> 00:34:11,996
and exhausted.

375
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,316
It's okay, you'll be better tomorrow.

376
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,736
Really?

377
00:34:20,276 --> 00:34:21,756
I make medicines,

378
00:34:21,756 --> 00:34:23,016
almost like a physician.

379
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:24,112
You should trust me.

380
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:26,672
That's true.

381
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:29,875
Hope I won't have

382
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,516
such a headache tomorrow.

383
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,196
Go check on His Excellency

384
00:34:37,196 --> 00:34:38,355
if you feel better tomorrow.

385
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:46,236
Diviner, Goddess.

386
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:47,875
Heavenly Lord's decree.

387
00:34:57,915 --> 00:34:59,036
Goddess,

388
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:00,236
given the severe loss

389
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:01,316
of Immortal Realm,

390
00:35:01,915 --> 00:35:04,875
Heavenly Lord has commanded you
to set off immediately and present

391
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:07,216
half of the Immortal Realm's
spiritual stones

392
00:35:07,216 --> 00:35:08,435
to the Immortal Realm

393
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:10,956
to help them rebuild the order
as soon as possible.

394
00:35:12,435 --> 00:35:14,556
Half of the spiritual stones?

395
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:19,635
Fair enough.

396
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:21,595
That's what they need most right now.

397
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:25,236
Heavenly Lord cares
for the Immortal Realm.

398
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,556
Thank you, envoy. I'm on my way.

399
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:34,956
I'll be off then.

400
00:35:34,956 --> 00:35:37,116
Remember to check on His Excellency
when you feel better.

401
00:35:37,116 --> 00:35:38,355
I don't want him waking up

402
00:35:38,355 --> 00:35:39,440
with nobody by his side.

403
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:49,236
People from the Divine Realm?
What are they doing here?

404
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:51,016
Why didn't they lend a helping hand

405
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:52,355
when our realm was in distress?

406
00:35:58,756 --> 00:35:59,895
What are you doing

407
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:01,296
in the Immortal Realm?

408
00:36:01,296 --> 00:36:02,856
I am here on behalf of Heavenly Lord

409
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:04,795
to present you the spiritual stones
from the Divine Realm

410
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:05,796
in order to repair your realm.

411
00:36:07,036 --> 00:36:08,635
They intend to appease us
with spiritual stones?

412
00:36:08,635 --> 00:36:11,088
You think we are beggars or something?

413
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,176
You're right.

414
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:13,675
Exactly.

415
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:14,796
We don't want your stones.

416
00:36:15,355 --> 00:36:16,432
Take them back.

417
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:19,635
The Heavenly Lord
was just trying to help.

418
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:22,640
Help?

419
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:25,355
We've been guarding

420
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:27,595
the Xutian Abyss
for over a thousand years.

421
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:31,216
Her Lordship even

422
00:36:32,236 --> 00:36:33,956
sacrificed her life for it.

423
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,635
Yet you want to appease us
with spiritual stones?

424
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:40,196
We don't want your stones.

425
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:41,396
Bring Her Lordship back if you can!

426
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:42,876
Give Her Lordship back to us.

427
00:36:42,876 --> 00:36:44,536
Yes, we only want Her Lordship back.

428
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,635
We do not want your stones!

429
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:47,076
Bring Her Lordship back!

430
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:49,236
Bring Her Lordship back!

431
00:36:49,236 --> 00:36:50,716
Bring Her Lordship back!

432
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:54,516
Bring Her Lordship back!

433
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:31,216
Your Holiness.

434
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,720
What's wrong?

435
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,096
Divine Realm had Luotian Goddess

436
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:36,155
send us the spiritual stones.

437
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:38,435
People on the street seem to be upset.

438
00:37:38,996 --> 00:37:41,355
Should we return the spiritual stones?

439
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,076
The spiritual stones from Divine Realm

440
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,276
are exactly what we need right now.

441
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:53,956
Send someone to calm the people.

442
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:55,920
Yes.

443
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:08,156
Your Holiness had instructed
Her Lordship to keep her distance

444
00:38:08,156 --> 00:38:09,716
from the Xutian Abyss,
so that she wouldn't

445
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,476
get involved with
the remnants of Liuming.

446
00:38:12,716 --> 00:38:14,516
Your Holiness has tried
everything possible

447
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,360
to protect, but still...

448
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:20,036
Perhaps it was her destiny.

449
00:38:22,476 --> 00:38:23,996
If she had to make a choice,

450
00:38:26,915 --> 00:38:27,915
Li'd surely choose

451
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,716
to protect the Immortal Realm.

452
00:38:35,635 --> 00:38:37,155
Now she's traded her life

453
00:38:38,476 --> 00:38:39,716
for the peace of the Immortal Realm.

454
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:41,776
I hope it will

455
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:44,556
put an end to this

456
00:38:47,076 --> 00:38:48,395
