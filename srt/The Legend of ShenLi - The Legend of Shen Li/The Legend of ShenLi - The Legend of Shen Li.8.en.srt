00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,992
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:42,164
(Zhaoqian Hall)
Mofang, I can't accompany you this time.

4
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:44,325
Please be careful.

5
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:47,645
General Zixia.

6
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:48,804
Your Lordship, Mofang.

7
00:01:49,804 --> 00:01:52,804
The mission is urgent and I haven't had
time to inform my family.

8
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,285
Could you please relay it to my family?

9
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,645
Alright.

10
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:57,680
- You...
- Father.

11
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,880
Nuan, how come you're here?

12
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,320
I've come to say
thank you to Lord Bicang.

13
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,920
Why?

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,504
My mother took me out
to buy candied lotus seeds today.

15
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:09,280
We encountered the black miasma.

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,081
Her Lordship saved me and my mother.

17
00:02:15,161 --> 00:02:16,321
No need to thank me. It's my duty.

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,721
It was my fault.
I promised to accompany her,

19
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:21,241
but then I got too busy and forgot it.

20
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:22,928
Are you alright?

21
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,480
You have to leave again?

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,441
It's fine. Come back safe.

23
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,280
I don't want you to go.

24
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,601
Be good, Nuan.
I'm going to protect more people.

25
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,801
When I return, I will take you
to buy 10 candied lotus seeds.

26
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,560
10? Alright.

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,696
Listen to your mother.

28
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:49,588
Take care of yourself and Nuan.

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,840
I know.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,912
Come.

31
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:54,064
Return safely.

32
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:56,624
I'll be on my way, Your Lordship.

33
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,721
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

34
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:38,480
Everyone, there's too much miasma.
Take cover!

35
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,504
- Yes.
- Yes.

36
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:53,424
Let's go take a look.

37
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,536
General Zixia.

38
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,544
(A Chimei got in
and out of the Xutian Abyss)

39
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:22,881
Notify the Divine Realm now.

40
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:24,120
Why do we need to do that?

41
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,840
After those useless ones
come to a decision,

42
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,001
most of our soldiers
may have been wounded.

43
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,881
Your Holiness,
I request to go to the battlefield.

44
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,520
Your Holiness, although there are
many generals in court,

45
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,641
no one has more experience in dealing
with the Chimei than Her Lordship.

46
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:42,120
I understand your concerns regarding
Her Lordship's betrothed status.

47
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,481
But it's an emergency.
I earnestly request you

48
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:46,360
to consider the soldiers
who are guarding the border.

49
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
ShenLi.

50
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:56,944
Yes.

51
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:08,201
This month
you shall not leave your mansion.

52
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
But the border...

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,921
General Shangbei will investigate it.

54
00:06:17,921 --> 00:06:21,120
Depart immediately
and do not kill the Chimei

55
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,520
until the Divine Realm sends people.

56
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:28,528
Yes.

57
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:41,481
Your Holiness,
I request to go into battle.

58
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,761
Bury General Zixia with honors.

59
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,161
Everyone else, stand by and wait

60
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,120
for people from the Divine Realm.

61
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:01,840
The Divine Realm again.
Are you really going to be their puppet?

62
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:13,400
(The physician said
in order to bring back the message,)

63
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,161
(Zixia rushed back
without rest after being wounded.)

64
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,080
(That's why the poison
from the Scorpion-Tailed Fox)

65
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,176
(spread and killed him.)

66
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,280
(He risked his life,)

67
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,520
(but the message
didn't receive enough regard.)

68
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:26,641
(Why do we need to tell the Divine?)

69
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,528
(Why must we catch the Chimei alive?)

70
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,120
(Why should we wait for
the Divine to deal with it?)

71
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,840
(Zixia traded his life for the survival
of the border soldiers.)

72
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,481
(The sooner the message arrives,
the more soldiers will survive.)

73
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,120
(I will fulfill his wish.)

74
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:49,520
You've returned, Your Lordship.

75
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,321
Your Lordship, you're back!

76
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:01,200
Please don't, Your Lordship.
Shush will die.

77
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,240
Your Lordship.

78
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,601
My bird is not that useless.

79
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,296
Your Lordship.

80
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:08,680
I am beginning my seclusion.
Tell everyone not to disturb me.

81
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,721
Spare me, Your Lordship.

82
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,680
Why suddenly enter seclusion?

83
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,280
Her Lordship has been strange lately.

84
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:12,521
Exterminate the Chimei until we win.

85
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,688
- Exterminate the Chimei until we win.
- Exterminate the Chimei until we win.

86
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:17,936
(Barracks outside the Capital)
Exterminate the Chimei

87
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:19,920
(Immortal Realm)
until we win.

88
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
- Exterminate the Chimei until we win.
- Exterminate the Chimei until we win.

89
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,080
Depart for battle!

90
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

91
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,521
Your Holiness, generals report
the spiritual stones are running out.

92
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,521
Should we continue mining?

93
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:12,784
Yes.

94
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:13,936
Got it.

95
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,201
Your Holiness.

96
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,360
Lord Bicang avoided the guards
and went to the barracks.

97
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:24,001
Seems she's going to accompany
the army to the Xutian Abyss.

98
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:27,881
I'll chase her.

99
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,008
Let her go.

100
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:28,496
Loose!

101
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:19,441
- Lord Bicang has come to save us.
- Your Lordship!

102
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,072
Your Lordship.

103
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,641
I'm sorry. I'm late.

104
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:57,201
How dare you lowly beast?

105
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:03,360
I will crush you.

106
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,281
(Its wound has healed.)

107
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:25,001
(My Red Plume Spear has killed many.
Its deadly energy is overwhelming.)

108
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,441
(If an ordinary demon is pierced,
its wounds would heal very slowly.)

109
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,240
(It seems this Chimei cannot be defeated
by ordinary means.)

110
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:37,160
(Then I shall break through
from within using my spiritual power.)

111
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
(It must be badly hurt now.)

112
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,592
What?

113
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,441
(It can still fight.)

114
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,800
(It can transform into a human form.)

115
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:07,201
(This Chimei carries poison in its body
and has a very strong healing ability.)

116
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,321
(The miasma here is thick.
I can't stay long.)

117
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:14,032
(This is tough.)

118
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:22,240
I didn't expect there would be
such a talent in the Immortal Realm.

119
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,641
Given time, you are sure
to become a great figure.

120
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Pity. There's no more time.

121
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,401
(This just doesn't work.)

122
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:50,441
(To end this quick,
I can't let him hop around again.)

123
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,961
(To deal with it...)

124
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,521
Shangbei, Spiritual Shield Formation.

125
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:05,712
Form up.

126
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,936
Your way of arranging formations
has not changed a bit over 1,000 years.

127
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,560
There's no need
for any new tactics to deal with you.

128
00:16:49,961 --> 00:16:51,961
You all submit to a powerless ruler,

129
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:55,120
who is under the control of the Divine.

130
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:59,240
After just 1,000 years,
you've become so submissive.

131
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:05,440
It would be better to let me devour you.

132
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,096
Enough talk.

133
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,801
Great, but you've underestimated me.

134
00:18:09,281 --> 00:18:10,480
Maintain the barrier!

135
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,120
I said I wouldn't give you time.

136
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,561
Mofang.

137
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,200
I'm alright. Don't worry.

138
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,080
Everyone, hold on!

139
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:25,776
Your Lordship.

140
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,720
You deserve to die.

141
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:58,224
Withdraw.

142
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:06,800
(Her power...)

143
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,032
Withdraw.

144
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:19,720
You insulted Her Holiness

145
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:26,801
and killed my soldiers.
I shall not spare you!

Her Lordship has been swallowed by it.

156

How come only one
from the Divine Realm has come?

170
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:30,352
Xingyun?

171
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,561
ShenLi, time to eat.

172
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:52,521
Xingyun, I want to eat
the food you make.

173
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:58,736
I miss you.

174
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:05,401
Sir, our lord is already betrothed.

175
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:07,960
This might be inappropriate.

176
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,840
How about leaving her to me?

177
00:25:10,561 --> 00:25:11,600
Where are the barracks?

178
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,360
May I ask who you are?

179
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:19,080
Xingzhi of the Zhishui Pavilion
in the Extranatural Heaven.

180
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,681
The Extranatural Heaven.

181
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:28,120
The Extranatural Heaven.

182
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,641
Apologies. It's been a long time
since I came to this realm.

183
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,960
I got lost, so I am late.

184
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:39,080
You can leave our lord to...

185
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,144
No need.

186
00:25:42,521 --> 00:25:46,080
You haven't answered my question yet.
Where are the barracks?

187
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,041
It's over there.

188
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,161
Quite a character.

189
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,472
Hungry?

190
00:26:53,936 --> 00:27:00,848
No, just a bit tired.

191
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,681
It's alright. Rest here.

192
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,360
Xingyun, where are you going?

193
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,208
Xingyun!

194
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,152
Someone.

195
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,360
What is the matter, Your Lordship?

196
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,761
H-H-Help me up.

197
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,208
Please don't move.

198
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:26,960
Forget it.

199
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,801
T-T-That one said you must stay in bed.

200
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:33,480
Those military physicians' instructions
are always the same. Just ignore them.

201
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,048
My wounds will heal very soon.

202
00:28:37,108 --> 00:28:40,521
How is Mofang's condition?

203
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:43,600
Your Lordship,
shall I go get the general?

204
00:28:45,801 --> 00:28:48,881
You... I won't eat you.

205
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,120
Your Lordship.

206
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,456
Are you okay?

207
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:09,801
You should be asking yourself that.

208
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,041
It's my incompetence that caused you
to be seriously injured.

209
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:25,200
I don't blame you.
Look, I'm injured too.

210
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:31,320
I vaguely remember arguing with
Her Holiness about this the other day.

211
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,921
I said Lord Xingzhi
from the Extranatural Heaven

212
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:36,561
only sealed the Chimei.
What was so great about that?

213
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,120
He had us guard the seal
over the Xutian Abyss for him.

214
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Now it seems
I really shouldn't have said that.

215
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,001
There are thousands
of them in the abyss.

216
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,881
By sealing them,

217
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:57,801
Lord Xingzhi has done us a great favor.

218
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:02,240
I deserve death.

219
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,480
You keep saying you that.

220
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,761
If we go by what you're saying,

221
00:30:05,761 --> 00:30:09,840
I would have to atone for
my mistakes with countless deaths.

222
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,521
Those men died in battle

223
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,480
because I failed

224
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:20,240
to protect them.

225
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,960
I know you value friendship and loyalty,

226
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,600
but you don't have to take
all the responsibility upon yourself.

227
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:35,041
There are times
when even the strongest can't hold on,

228
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:44,320
so no one will blame you.

229
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,024
Stand up.

230
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,080
You don't understand.

231
00:31:15,921 --> 00:31:18,720
I am actually blaming myself.

232
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:32,561
Because you're hurt, I blame myself.

233
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,641
Mofang, you...

234
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,264
Your Lordship.

235
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:16,401
Actually, I have been
into you for a long time.

236
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Did the poison affect your brain?

237
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,521
There must be something wrong with you.

238
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:47,440
No, it's just that I like you.

239
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,904
It's not possible.

240
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,128
It really isn't possible.

241
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,440
I order you to immediately purge
these thoughts from your mind.

242
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,200
Not even a tiny bit.
This is a military order.

243
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,760
Yes.

244
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,200
Your Lordship, it may not be convenient
for you to enter now.

245
00:33:45,881 --> 00:33:46,960
Why?

246
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,120
Because she's...

247
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,681
Your Lordship, you...

248
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,512
Xingyun.

249
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:54,841
Your Lordship, this is Lord Xingzhi
from the Extranatural Heaven.

250
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:57,001
He came to help us reinforce
the seal of the Xutian Abyss.

251
00:34:58,521 --> 00:34:59,600
Xingzhi.

252
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,601
Have you been to the Mortal Realm?

253
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:21,584
Do you know Xingyun?

254
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,744
No.

255
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,801
Your vitals are much better.

256
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,440
I have long heard
that you're brave and good in battle.

257
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:26,321
Your heroism impressed me today.

258
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,680
But no matter how strong you are,
you can't overexert yourself.

259
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,680
Even if it is for the Immortal Realm,
you should take good care of yourself.

260
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,601
(Such courteous words.)

261
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,768
Thank you.

262
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:00,400
(He is Xingzhi, the last ancient god.)

263
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,440
(He says he is not Xingyun.)

264
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,841
(Yes, Xingyun is already dead.)

265
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:15,880
(Don't care about who he was
and who he will be.)

266
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,521
(Isn't that what I said myself?)

267
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:30,640
I'm going to stay here
for some more days.

268
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:34,081
It's been 1,000 years
since I last came here.

269
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,480
I don't know how things have changed.

270
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,160
I need to survey the terrain here

271
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:42,880
before I enter the Xutian Abyss
to remake the seal.

272
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:48,601
Could you guide me later, Lord Bicang?

273
00:37:57,081 --> 00:37:59,561
If you need someone to lead the way,

274
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,761
there are other soldiers
familiar with the area.

275
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:05,720
Her Lordship is seriously injured.
It's inconvenient for her to move.

276
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,761
You don't need to worry.

277
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:12,200
I will heal her wounds.

278
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,601
Within three days,
she will be able to move freely.

279
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,680
Having her lead the way
will not harm her body.

280
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,880
Moving around more
is also beneficial to her body and mind.

281
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:32,640
Your Lordship,
I'd like to be your guide.

282
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,400
I just want her to do it.
