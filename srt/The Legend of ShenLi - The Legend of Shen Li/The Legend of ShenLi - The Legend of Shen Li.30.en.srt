00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,152
=Episode 30=

3
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,584
This is just the first day.

4
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,460
There are eight days to go.

5
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,448
Are you okay?

6
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:46,576
Fine.

7
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:50,355
I'm so kind-hearted.

8
00:02:51,676 --> 00:02:53,196
I will risk my life to save you.

9
00:03:35,795 --> 00:03:37,396
Are you feeling unwell now?

10
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:39,440
No.

11
00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:41,676
I just feel strange

12
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:43,836
inside myself.

13
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:46,608
How so?

14
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:52,720
I can't quite describe it.

15
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,795
I just feel a lot better.

16
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:58,928
That's good.

17
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:02,576
Ms. Jin,

18
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:04,956
I have a question.

19
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,036
The Azure Sea Pearl

20
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:10,715
belongs to me.

21
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:12,995
I was born with it in my mouth.

22
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:16,116
Why does its scorching power

23
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,876
clash with my spiritual power?

24
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:22,475
Born with the pearl?

25
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:29,235
So you're Lord Bicang!

26
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:34,436
You were born

27
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:36,475
with this power.

28
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,635
In my opinion,

29
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:41,596
it must be the techniques
you learned later

30
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:42,836
that clash with it.

31
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:45,836
That's why the two powers cannot merge.

32
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,716
The techniques I learned later?

33
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,876
(I learned those all from Her Holiness.)

34
00:04:54,195 --> 00:04:55,795
(And the Azure Sea Pearl
was given by her.)

35
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,396
(Since Her Holiness knew
about the Azure Sea Pearl,)

36
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:01,596
(she must have known
the spiritual power inside me)

37
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:03,396
(would clash with the power
of the Azure Sea Pearl.)

38
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:05,488
(If so,)

39
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:07,676
(why did she teach me)

40
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:09,716
(like that?)

41
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,696
You came to see me at this late hour.

42
00:05:26,696 --> 00:05:28,116
Aren't you afraid she will be jealous?

43
00:05:37,276 --> 00:05:38,315
Your Sword-Forging Platform

44
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,436
isn't as good as before?

45
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,876
You're so blunt.

46
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,556
Could you lack weapons?

47
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,432
Hers.

48
00:05:59,355 --> 00:06:01,116
This should be a spear, right?

49
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:03,515
It must have been a treasure before.

50
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:05,915
But how did it break into this state?

51
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:09,616
Your Excellency,

52
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:11,275
you can't blame

53
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:13,356
my Sword-Forging Platform
for your failure.

54
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:16,035
It's you who failed it

55
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:18,192
because of your wound.

56
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:25,195
I never expected you

57
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:26,836
to become infatuated.

58
00:06:30,128 --> 00:06:31,184
I met her.

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,168
What can I do?

60
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,996
But the girl's background

61
00:06:37,996 --> 00:06:40,276
is not simple.

62
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,396
Don't worry.

63
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:50,116
I know.

64
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:53,035
But this spear...

65
00:06:53,716 --> 00:06:55,036
In my opinion,

66
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:57,515
it can only be reforged
in the Extranatural Heaven

67
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:58,640
that is rich in spiritual energy.

68
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:45,840
Miss,

69
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:49,235
I saw many wounds on you.

70
00:07:49,876 --> 00:07:51,156
So impressive.

71
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:56,156
These scars,

72
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,476
each symbolize honor.

73
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:00,556
Truly impressive.

74
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:02,596
Nah.

75
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:04,355
I don't want the stars
of the Extranatural Heaven.

76
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,556
I want to find a husband for you.

77
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:13,936
Miss,

78
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:16,635
look how closely
His Excellency watches over you.

79
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:23,280
Start the treatment.

80
00:08:25,716 --> 00:08:28,116
I was just joking, you know.

81
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,036
The two of you are quite well-matched.

82
00:08:30,036 --> 00:08:31,596
Both of you are boring.

83
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:28,528
Miss,

84
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:32,176
I have been thinking
about something for many days,

85
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:33,875
and I think I should tell you.

86
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:37,520
Say it.

87
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:45,755
Have you noticed

88
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:48,875
the burning power inside you

89
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,476
doesn't seem to be
just spiritual or divine energy?

90
00:09:52,476 --> 00:09:55,116
Also, you told me before

91
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:57,435
the source of that power
was the Azure Sea Pearl.

92
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,036
I'll take a wild guess.

93
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:03,736
I think it's more like

94
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,195
a demon's inner core.

95
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:06,896
Demon?

96
00:10:19,356 --> 00:10:21,115
Look, this is my inner core.

97
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:28,276
You just leave your inner core
lying around so casually?

98
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:30,476
As far as I know,

99
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,396
if a demon loses its inner core,

100
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,096
it would die, right?

101
00:10:35,716 --> 00:10:37,836
I'm no longer an ordinary demon.

102
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:39,675
Do not judge me by normal standards.

103
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:43,636
You'd better keep it well.

104
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:45,356
Alright, if you say so.

105
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,995
Haven't you ever felt

106
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:54,236
your origins are somewhat mysterious?

107
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:58,128
I only know

108
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:00,195
I was born on the battlefield.

109
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:02,864
My parents were both

110
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,755
in the army of the Immortal Realm.

111
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,716
I was raised by Her Holiness.

112
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,676
For thousands of years,

113
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:10,476
nobody has ever questioned my origins.

114
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:13,036
Nor have I ever doubted it.

115
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:16,176
Perhaps

116
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,635
Her Holiness hides
a lot of things from you.

117
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:21,256
After you're healed, go ask her

118
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:22,320
and you might learn something.

119
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:28,916
This is the last treatment.

120
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:31,995
The weather today...

121
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,996
Gentlemen, I shall take my leave.

122
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,435
Bro, take care.

123
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:43,356
Let's go too.

124
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,435
Another day spent waiting in vain.

125
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:47,664
Let's come back tomorrow.

126
00:11:47,664 --> 00:11:48,816
Let's go.

127
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:16,956
It's too fierce.
You can't go up. Head back.

128
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:29,356
The familiar feeling.

129
00:12:30,555 --> 00:12:31,596
I didn't expect

130
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,156
they would be here too.

131
00:12:37,596 --> 00:12:39,755
(What a surprise.)

132
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:19,956
What an unusual day.

133
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:22,396
Some crazy ones are coming

134
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,276
to my turf to get them killed?

135
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:25,276
They're tough to deal with.

136
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,928
You mustn't be interrupted.

137
00:14:27,596 --> 00:14:29,476
No matter what happens,
His Excellency is here.

138
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:32,675
Calm your mind.

139
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:46,036
It seems a bit hard to handle.

140
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:48,216
But do not be afraid.

141
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:49,836
I'll go out and deal with them

142
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:50,864
and then come back for you.

143
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,956
I will go with you.

144
00:14:52,956 --> 00:14:55,296
You don't have a weapon
and spiritual power hasn't recovered.

145
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:56,400
You can't go.

146
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,936
Before you are fully healed,

147
00:14:58,936 --> 00:15:00,276
rest here and recover.

148
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:02,224
I'll do it.

149
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:42,635
Go bring me the Golden Serpent Demon.

150
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,836
I've lived for so many years,

151
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:21,916
but I've never seen anyone
who has the nerve

152
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,555
to run wild on my turf.

153
00:16:24,156 --> 00:16:25,276
You have not lived

154
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:27,236
thousands of years for nothing.

155
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:35,956
So you're the one who wants to die?

156
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,032
(So her inner core is here.)

157
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:45,776
Who's there?

158
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,075
(This person is still alive!)

159
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:00,275
(He's much stronger)

160
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,956
(than he was a few days ago.)

161
00:20:02,896 --> 00:20:03,956
(I can't fight him head-on.)

162
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:09,936
ShenLi.

163
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:11,920
Watch out!

164
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:03,435
Go grab her inner core.

165
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:13,040
Xingzhi.

166
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,728
You're awake.

167
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:18,996
Ms. Jin said

168
00:23:19,596 --> 00:23:22,395
this is where she discarded
her evil thoughts and desires.

169
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:23,996
She has placed a seal here.

170
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:26,795
It won't be easy to get out, I guess.

171
00:23:30,636 --> 00:23:32,035
She does know how to pick a place.

172
00:23:33,155 --> 00:23:35,435
This is a sealed land

173
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:36,795
formed by nature.

174
00:23:37,756 --> 00:23:38,795
And considering her seal,

175
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:40,720
it's hard to leave.

176
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:42,596
Here is

177
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,555
a good place to seal a demon.

178
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:49,456
Ms. Jin told me

179
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:52,476
what contended
with the spiritual power inside me

180
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:54,448
might be demonic power.

181
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:56,996
She could tell.

182
00:23:58,516 --> 00:23:59,636
You've been with me for so long.

183
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:02,320
Haven't you noticed?

184
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:10,915
Why didn't you ever mention it to me?

185
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,008
Enough.

186
00:24:17,716 --> 00:24:18,996
Everyone has their own reasons.

187
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,520
So be it.

188
00:24:26,352 --> 00:24:27,376
Are you okay?

189
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:29,195
Are you all still alive?

190
00:24:30,315 --> 00:24:32,976
A bunch of fools came outside just now.

191
00:24:32,976 --> 00:24:34,136
They were not hard to deal with,

192
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:35,436
but it wasn't easy, either.

193
00:24:35,436 --> 00:24:37,116
It took me a long time,

194
00:24:37,116 --> 00:24:38,716
and they caused you
to fall into this place.

195
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,876
Since you're here, let us out.

196
00:24:42,756 --> 00:24:45,396
Your Excellency,
you've put me in a difficult position.

197
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,236
I've set a seal here
for thousands of years.

198
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,476
It's not so easy to break.

199
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:51,956
This entrance only allows entry.

200
00:24:52,675 --> 00:24:55,016
If you want to get out, you'll have to
reach this formation's core.

201
00:24:55,016 --> 00:24:56,560
Only from there can you leave.

202
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,676
It's on the back hill.

203
00:24:57,676 --> 00:24:59,556
Okay, I'll go over there
to wait for you.

204
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:01,155
She still needs treatment.

205
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:03,344
Let's go.

206
00:25:03,956 --> 00:25:05,876
It's okay. I can hold on.

207
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:07,315
Alright, I'll carry you.

208
00:25:08,688 --> 00:25:09,712
Come.

209
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:40,624
You are injured.

210
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:42,608
No.

211
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:46,716
Did you get this injury in the East Sea?

212
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:48,304
It's nothing.

213
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,475
Stop carrying me. Put me down.

214
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:52,795
Don't move.

215
00:25:52,795 --> 00:25:53,836
I can walk by myself.

216
00:25:56,784 --> 00:25:57,808
Don't be stubborn.

217
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,155
It's alright. Let's find
the formation's core soon.

218
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:03,760
I can walk on my own.

219
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:06,555
So

220
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:09,996
all we lack is the Azure Sea Pearl now.

221
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:21,195
Xingzhi was injured
back when freezing the East Sea.

222
00:26:22,275 --> 00:26:26,275
And ShenLi is half-crippled
with little strength.

223
00:26:27,315 --> 00:26:31,195
It is a good opportunity today.
Let's go find ShenLi

224
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,155
and seize

225
00:26:33,996 --> 00:26:36,195
the Azure Sea Pearl.

226
00:26:57,936 --> 00:26:59,088
Where are we?

227
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:01,104
The land of snakes.

228
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:08,035
Xingzhi,

229
00:27:08,035 --> 00:27:09,596
how much longer will it take?

230
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:11,248
I'm feeling

231
00:27:12,275 --> 00:27:14,236
unusually hot.

232
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,395
You must merge
with the Azure Sea Pearl now.

233
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:26,992
It can't wait anymore.

234
00:27:27,756 --> 00:27:29,675
Go sit over there. Go.

235
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,504
Tell me

236
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:41,476
how she treated you.

237
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:50,116
Letting the cold energy
circulate through my veins

238
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:52,716
to help me merge
with the Azure Sea Pearl.

239
00:27:56,464 --> 00:27:57,520
Okay.

240
00:28:27,728 --> 00:28:28,776
Xingzhi.

241
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:31,136
Close your eyes and calm your mind

242
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,235
so that my energy

243
00:28:32,235 --> 00:28:33,396
can easily

244
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:34,716
travel through your circulatory system.

245
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:39,996
Why go to such lengths?

246
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:44,688
Who?

247
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:45,776
Calm your mind.

248
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:46,864
Someone is talking.

249
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:50,516
The energy here is not pure.

250
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:53,016
Affected by the miasma of puppets,

251
00:29:53,016 --> 00:29:54,195
it has become turbid.

252
00:29:55,915 --> 00:29:57,275
So, you must remain calm and composed.

253
00:29:58,395 --> 00:29:59,440
Do not be affected by it.

254
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:15,676
He's healing your wounds

255
00:30:15,676 --> 00:30:16,996
and transmitting his energy to you.

256
00:30:18,356 --> 00:30:20,116
The wound on his back
has split open again.

257
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:22,956
To merge it into yourself,

258
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:25,155
the easiest way
is through physical contact.

259
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:31,696
(Nonsense. No way!)

260
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,116
Why not?

261
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:36,155
(He is a god, bearing
the weight of the world.)

262
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,032
(He can't indulge in personal stuff.)

263
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,095
Whether he can do it
or not is his concern.

264
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:45,236
What does it have to do with you?

265
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:46,356
You are ShenLi.

266
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:48,996
No one says
you can't have personal feelings.

267
00:30:49,756 --> 00:30:51,336
Since he needs to restrain himself,

268
00:30:51,336 --> 00:30:53,155
- why don't you take the initiative?
- Get lost!

269
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:08,076
It would prevent him
from violating the Natural Law

270
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:10,356
and satisfy your own personal desires.

271
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,296
Right in this cave.

272
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:13,756
No one will know.

273
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,395
You always repress yourself

274
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,035
and restrain yourself,

275
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:24,555
wholeheartedly devoted
to protecting the Immortal Realm

276
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:27,476
and the entire world.

277
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:30,836
Have you ever lived a day for yourself?

278
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:34,395
Just this once in your life.

279
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:36,432
Right here.

280
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:38,876
No one will know.

281
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:42,035
Even the Natural Law
cannot blame Xingzhi.

282
00:31:42,836 --> 00:31:44,336
It's you

283
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:46,315
who can't help but do it.

284
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:48,476
You love him very much.

285
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,195
He loves you deeply, too.

286
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:53,716
You love him very much.

287
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:56,395
He loves you deeply, too.

288
00:31:57,075 --> 00:31:58,155
You know what?

289
00:32:00,656 --> 00:32:01,776
ShenLi.

290
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:03,716
Look at it.

291
00:32:05,795 --> 00:32:06,896
ShenLi.

292
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,328
Look this way.

293
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:12,368
ShenLi.

294
00:32:32,236 --> 00:32:33,315
You can't stop me!

295
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,035
Even if today

296
00:32:35,756 --> 00:32:36,836
I am backlashed by divine power

297
00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:38,516
and have my bones scraped,

298
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:41,356
you still can't stop me!

299
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:48,816
(In the past,)

300
00:32:49,956 --> 00:32:51,915
(I underestimated how vast
the Three Realms were.)

301
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:55,395
(But now,)

302
00:32:58,795 --> 00:32:59,856
(I can't even)

303
00:33:01,636 --> 00:33:03,075
(thoroughly search)

304
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:05,315
(the East Sea.)

305
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:11,888
Xingzhi.

306
00:33:13,636 --> 00:33:16,116
As you heard, he froze the East Sea.

307
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,116
It was also the cause
of the wound on his back

308
00:33:19,116 --> 00:33:20,596
and the scar on his heart.

309
00:33:22,395 --> 00:33:25,795
And even more, it's what he can't bear
to look back on and can't forget.

310
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:29,416
This is the result

311
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:30,915
of your departure.

312
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:35,236
Isn't being alone

313
00:33:36,435 --> 00:33:37,476
for thousands of years enough?

314
00:33:38,356 --> 00:33:39,596
Natural Law created gods.

315
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,636
If it doesn't want you to get emotional,

316
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:44,956
why does it bestow emotions
and desires upon you?

317
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,356
In the Extranatural Heaven,
other ancient gods

318
00:33:47,876 --> 00:33:48,956
were gone one by one,

319
00:33:49,476 --> 00:33:50,996
leaving you with eternal solitude.

320
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:52,435
Why can't we break it?

321
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:55,195
Why can't we defy the Natural Law?

322
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:58,636
(You're luring me.)

323
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:00,795
(You let me see it.)

324
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,556
(What are your intentions?)

325
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:03,915
What I can see

326
00:34:04,555 --> 00:34:06,096
and what I can let you see

327
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:07,996
are one's desires and thoughts.

328
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:11,115
These are Xingzhi's desires.

329
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,796
His haunting nightmares.

330
00:34:14,915 --> 00:34:15,952
And I am

331
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:18,716
your desire.

332
00:34:19,915 --> 00:34:21,595
Keep ShenLi here.

333
00:34:22,516 --> 00:34:24,276
Keep ShenLi here.

334
00:34:25,716 --> 00:34:27,475
I mirror the one

335
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:28,835
who you want to be

336
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:32,048
but are afraid to be.

337
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:35,115
Keep ShenLi here.

338
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:49,915
You must calm your mind.

339
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,504
Do you understand?

340
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:53,552
I'm sorry.

341
00:34:55,195 --> 00:34:56,355
Why do you apologize to me?

342
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:00,435
If only we had never met

343
00:35:01,756 --> 00:35:02,756
each other,

344
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:06,704
I had never loved you

345
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,328
and we had never...

346
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:16,080
Li,

347
00:35:17,556 --> 00:35:18,672
I have lived for so long,

348
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:21,355
for tens of thousands of years,

349
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:24,675
but what I am most grateful for

350
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:27,440
is having met you.

351
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:31,236
But my appearance in your life

352
00:35:34,195 --> 00:35:35,595
brought you divine punishment.

353
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:41,635
I received the punishment

354
00:35:43,796 --> 00:35:45,236
not because I met you,

355
00:35:46,096 --> 00:35:47,184
but because

356
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:50,352
I lost you.

357
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:14,516
I have long wanted to do this.

358
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,448
Li,

359
00:36:40,688 --> 00:36:41,776
I think

360
00:36:43,476 --> 00:36:44,656
we need to show some restraint.

361
00:36:45,796 --> 00:36:46,896
I am very calm.

362
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:49,875
I know very clearly what I am doing.

363
00:36:50,915 --> 00:36:51,920
Don't stop me.

364
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:57,264
If I chose wrong,

365
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,875
that's my mistake.
