=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,216
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:49,824
My jade cup isn't so bad.

4
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:01,392
Your Excellency.

5
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:04,945
Your Excellency has
been away for quite a while.

6
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:08,105
Please take seat.

7
00:02:14,545 --> 00:02:15,564
On my way here,

8
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:17,424
I heard you heaving sighs.

9
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:20,665
Anything on your mind, Heavenly Lord?

10
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,784
The Divine Realm is peaceful.

11
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,065
Only your reports from the lower realm

12
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:28,524
would alert me.

13
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,504
Nothing else.

14
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:37,025
To tell you the truth,

15
00:02:37,984 --> 00:02:39,945
I was heaving sighs

16
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:41,105
because I saw a jade cup

17
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,505
at Lord Tianyuan's palace

18
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:43,745
a few days ago

19
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:44,864
and was overjoyed.

20
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:47,845
I got a cup myself

21
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,005
and wanted to exchange with him.

22
00:02:49,005 --> 00:02:50,224
But he also values

23
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,385
his jade cup

24
00:02:51,385 --> 00:02:53,545
and wouldn't give it up.

25
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:57,185
(Compared with the Immortal Realm,)

26
00:02:58,064 --> 00:03:00,305
(life in the Divine Realm is
indeed much more leisurely.)

27
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:05,105
I have no particular hobbies

28
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:08,245
but collecting small crafts.

29
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,805
It's truly regrettable

30
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:11,424
that my wish couldn't be fulfilled.

31
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:14,424
If I were to order him to give it to me,

32
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:16,624
it'd be unbecoming for me.

33
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:19,144
It's really distressing.

34
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:25,224
What should not be obtained
should be let go.

35
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:27,585
I hope that

36
00:03:27,585 --> 00:03:29,265
you won't be obsessed over such a thing.

37
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:32,905
Do not indulge yourself.

38
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,145
In my long life,

39
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:39,925
I've always told myself

40
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,504
to be free from desires.

41
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:44,745
But that's only easy
when you have no desire.

42
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:46,604
If there is something you desire,

43
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:48,385
it's hard to extricate oneself.

44
00:03:48,385 --> 00:03:50,105
Your whole heart is filled with desire

45
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,305
and you don't know

46
00:03:53,064 --> 00:03:54,665
whether to advance or retreat.

47
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:05,424
Knowing well it's wrong,

48
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:07,665
yet you can't let go.

49
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,305
When you decide to cut it off,

50
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,105
you still feel reluctant.

51
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:17,265
The purer the heart,

52
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:21,072
the easier it is to be obsessed.

53
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,344
I can understand your feelings,

54
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:27,585
Heavenly Lord.

55
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,184
Did Your Excellency
come to the lower realm

56
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:34,945
to seek something you have not obtained?

57
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:41,024
It must not be.

58
00:04:41,024 --> 00:04:42,685
You are the last of the ancient gods.

59
00:04:42,685 --> 00:04:44,345
If you have desires,

60
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:46,344
it'd be a great disaster
for the three realms.

61
00:04:47,024 --> 00:04:48,945
No need to worry.

62
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,545
I was just kidding.

63
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:55,405
The last of the ancient gods

64
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,904
must have a purer heart
than us, the Divine.

65
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:01,624
The Hundred Flowers Banquet
is to be held soon.

66
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,705
If Your Excellency has no duties
in the Extranatural Heaven,

67
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,665
why not stay in the Ninth Heaven?

68
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,464
Good.

69
00:05:13,184 --> 00:05:15,585
I haven't seen those old friends
for a long time.

70
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,665
He was so brave then.

71
00:05:21,665 --> 00:05:23,064
- Is that so?
- Yes.

72
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,545
Goddess.

73
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:26,545
You three are all here?

74
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:29,224
Long time no see, Goddess.

75
00:05:30,344 --> 00:05:31,344
Come have a seat.

76
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:34,464
I heard you have been working hard
on the Hundred Flowers Banquet.

77
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:38,085
The Banquet is a major event
in the Divine Realm.

78
00:05:38,085 --> 00:05:40,825
It is my honor to be of help.

79
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:42,145
Why are you three here?

80
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:46,024
Mingshu told me in detail
about His Excellency subduing demons

81
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:48,224
(Fuhua Deity, Divine Realm)
in Jinxiu City. We were all enthralled.

82
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,705
(Mingshu Deity, Divine Realm)
I heart that you

83
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:52,305
delivered invitations
to the Immortal Realm, Goddess.

84
00:05:52,305 --> 00:05:54,945
- Did you see His Excellency?
- I did.

85
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:58,325
Did those in the Immortal Realm

86
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,464
show little respect, Goddess?

87
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:03,124
Not really, only Lord Bicang ShenLi

88
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:04,184
was a bit aggressive.

89
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,705
(Baoqin Deity, Divine Realm)
How audacious.

90
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:10,105
How dare she be rude to the Goddess?

91
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,485
Now that she is betrothed
to Lord Furong,

92
00:06:13,485 --> 00:06:15,224
she forgot her place.

93
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,665
I've heard

94
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:19,004
that ShenLi has no parent.

95
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,224
She was picked up from a battlefield

96
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:21,544
and also grew up on the battlefield.

97
00:06:21,544 --> 00:06:22,884
She must have no manners.

98
00:06:22,884 --> 00:06:24,204
Do not take her to heart, Goddess.

99
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:25,205
Right, don't mind her.

100
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:27,545
I've heard

101
00:06:27,545 --> 00:06:28,585
ShenLi

102
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:29,985
went to the Mortal Realm
to avoid marriage

103
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:33,665
and fell in love with a mortal
who resembles His Excellency.

104
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:37,345
She even pestered His Excellency
in the Immortal Realm.

105
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:38,385
His Excellency...

106
00:06:38,385 --> 00:06:39,905
His Excellency must be
extremely annoyed.

107
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:43,024
Of course. But there are also rumors

108
00:06:43,784 --> 00:06:45,904
saying that His Excellency
treats her differently.

109
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:47,985
- Ungrounded rumors.
- Ungrounded rumors.

110
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:52,865
Exactly, I think it's her foolish
infatuation with His Excellency.

111
00:06:53,504 --> 00:06:56,165
She must have heard that the Goddess

112
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,705
had been saved
by His Excellency as a child

113
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:58,784
and holds grudges against you.

114
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:01,865
I didn't know about that.

115
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:04,965
Thankfully, His Excellency
has come to the Divine Realm.

116
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:08,345
He came here?

117
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,425
Grandfather invited him

118
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:10,464
to the Hundred Flowers Banquet.

119
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,265
He's staying in the Western Garden.

120
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,624
He's in the Divine Realm?

121
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,825
No wonder the air here

122
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,145
is so pure recently.

123
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:24,945
I must breathe in more to cultivate.

124
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,480
Me too.

125
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:32,024
Why don't we go to the Western Garden?

126
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,665
We can't disturb His Excellency.

127
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:35,785
We won't disturb him.

128
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:37,665
We just want to be closer to him.

129
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,945
The flowers in the Western Garden
bloomed, right?

130
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,545
- That's right.
- Let's go.

131
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,744
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

132
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:45,064
Please.

133
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,624
Let's go then.

134
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:52,385
- Let's go.
- Wait for me.

135
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:54,000
Hurry up.

136
00:08:42,744 --> 00:08:43,744
This melody?

137
00:08:45,145 --> 00:08:46,825
Is His Excellency playing music?

138
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:50,025
It sounds like leaf music.

139
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:53,385
I've never heard this melody
in the Divine Realm.

140
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:55,785
It's truly moving.

141
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,665
It's rare to hear him play a tune.

142
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,265
Indeed.

143
00:09:01,265 --> 00:09:02,385
This melody

144
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:05,624
has a touch of sorrow and sadness.

145
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:07,984
What are you saying?

146
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:09,285
How can his tune

147
00:09:09,285 --> 00:09:10,825
be sorrowful and sad?

148
00:09:11,345 --> 00:09:12,485
You must have misunderstood.

149
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,064
I practice the music technique.
How could I mistake it?

150
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:17,624
The hint of regret

151
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:19,744
in his tune

152
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,504
is like a lover who
has missed his loved one.

153
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:24,624
With every sound,

154
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:27,385
it saddens one's heart.

155
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:28,424
If he is sorrowful,

156
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:29,885
it must be for the three realms.

157
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,125
Do not speak nonsense

158
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,585
and limit him to romance.

159
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,744
It's no use explaining to you.

160
00:09:48,945 --> 00:09:50,104
There are quite a few techniques

161
00:09:50,104 --> 00:09:51,385
for dispelling miasma.

162
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,304
It isn't dull learning them.

163
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:56,844
If I were to dispel the miasma
in Jinxiu City again,

164
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:58,304
I'd do it better than before.

165
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:05,104
I, Lord Furong,

166
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,424
am a genius gifted by heaven.

167
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:09,424
You can't enter, Goddess.

168
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:10,904
Please don't, Goddess.

169
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,225
His Lord is bathing, Goddess.

170
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:14,424
You really can't go in.

171
00:10:14,424 --> 00:10:15,585
Goddess, don't.

172
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:16,705
- Have you gone mad?
- You can't enter.

173
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:18,525
How are you speaking to your sister?

174
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:19,805
How are you treating me, your brother?

175
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:20,825
I'm bathing.

176
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:22,624
- Goddess.
- Stay here.

177
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,885
What? Don't hit me.

178
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,424
I haven't frolicked with the deities.

179
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:38,225
Nor have I seen your friends.
I didn't do anything.

180
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,425
Don't accuse me
because of your prejudices.

181
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:41,744
If you lay a hand on my friends,

182
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,440
I will break your legs.

183
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:46,744
So you didn't come for that.

184
00:10:49,184 --> 00:10:52,025
Then speak quickly. I'm bathing.

185
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:55,825
Back in the Immortal Realm,

186
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,905
how was the relationship
between Lord Xingzhi

187
00:10:58,504 --> 00:10:59,945
and Lord Bicang ShenLi?

188
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:03,364
How was it? It was just like that.

189
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,104
- Like what?
- Just like that.

190
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,825
- Like what?
- Just like that, I told you.

191
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:09,264
Haven't you seen them
in the Immortal Realm?

192
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:11,465
- Tell me the truth.
- I am telling the truth.

193
00:11:11,465 --> 00:11:12,544
What exactly do you want to ask?

194
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,184
My beloved brother,

195
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,785
come here.

196
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,184
Just tell me.

197
00:11:24,345 --> 00:11:26,184
Well,

198
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,864
was there anything strange

199
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:30,624
between them?

200
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,064
Strange?

201
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,200
Like what?

202
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,104
In what way?

203
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:43,825
Like how did they usually get along?

204
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:45,945
How did they talk?

205
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,465
Did they seem close?

206
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:50,045
Especially, were they often together?

207
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,472
Just them.

208
00:11:57,345 --> 00:11:58,585
Well,

209
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:02,785
ShenLi always looked unhappy.

210
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:06,585
His Excellency was always smiling.

211
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:09,825
But his smile made me nervous.

212
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:12,864
They talked normally.

213
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,465
They did seem quite close,

214
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:17,584
but not exceptionally close.

215
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,984
As for them being alone,

216
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:23,064
I wouldn't know

217
00:12:23,064 --> 00:12:24,784
when they were alone.

218
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,664
But I often saw them appear together.

219
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:32,705
Appear together?

220
00:12:35,864 --> 00:12:37,625
Like when they rescued me
in the Mortal Realm

221
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,064
and captured me in the Immortal Realm.

222
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,385
Why do you ask?

223
00:12:51,945 --> 00:12:53,264
Mind your own business.

224
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:03,104
(Is it that I'm overthinking it?)

225
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:04,544
(Or is Furong too stupid?)

226
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:12,304
Lord Wenliu,
please go leave Ink Portrait.

227
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:15,445
The Ink Portrait Technique

228
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:16,505
seems to have improved again.

229
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,104
Exactly.

230
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:19,524
The portraits are even clearer now.

231
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,184
You can even see each strand of hair.

232
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:24,445
Don't talk about hair.

233
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,665
Lord Wuyuan's hair

234
00:13:25,665 --> 00:13:26,905
has thinned again.

235
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:36,465
It's so late.

236
00:13:37,304 --> 00:13:38,385
Why is Bei Xiaoyan still not here?

237
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:42,824
Did he get too absorbed
in counting money

238
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:44,336
and forget the time?

239
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:54,165
Lord Muyi has arrived.

240
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,225
Lord Muyi.

241
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:57,265
- Please, Lord Muyi.
- Lord Muyi, please write your name.

242
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:58,480
Okay.

243
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,226
(Lord Muyi)

244
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,785
- Let's do it together.
- Okay.

245
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:14,239
(Lord Muyi, Central Garden)

246
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,827
(Third Prince of the Northern Sea,
Bei Xiaoyan)

247
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:31,265
Where is my suitcase?

248
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:33,984
Who was that?

249
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:35,205
So rude.

250
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:37,304
Why not slow down when overtaking?

251
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:39,424
Shut up and look for my suitcase.

252
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:40,825
My treasures!

253
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:48,304
We wouldn't have met
if it weren't for the Banquet.

254
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:08,592
Stop there.

255
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,664
May I know who you are?

256
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:14,280
(Lord Wuyuan, Divine Realm)

257
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:17,204
Lord Bicang from the Immortal Realm.

258
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:19,184
I attend the Banquet
on behalf of Her Holiness.

259
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:22,825
Any problem?

260
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:24,112
No.

261
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:27,624
I was not aware
that Your Lordship was coming today.

262
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:31,945
I didn't send anyone to welcome you.
My apologies.

263
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:41,520
It's all right.

264
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,744
Your Lordship, please write your name.

265
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,981
(ShenLi)

266
00:16:08,104 --> 00:16:09,648
(ShenLi)

267
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:11,664
(ShenLi)

268
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:14,465
ShenLi? The one from the Immortal Realm.

269
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,905
The Immortal Realm never
attended the Banquet.

270
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:18,945
Why did they send someone this time?

271
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:21,328
Who knows?

272
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:23,536
ShenLi!

273
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,585
ShenLi!

274
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:30,145
What?

275
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:31,280
You've arrived.

276
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:34,945
I'll take you inside.

277
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:37,345
What are your intentions?

278
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:38,785
What intentions could I possibly have?

279
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:40,984
Come, I'll take you inside.

280
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,085
Since when did
Lord Furong and Lord Bicang

281
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,385
become so close?

282
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:50,864
That doesn't quite match the rumors
from the Immortal Realm.

283
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:52,705
Come.

284
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,704
Make way.

285
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:57,304
Welcome Lord Bicang ShenLi.

286
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:00,912
Not bad, right?

287
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:03,324
What is this?

288
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:04,465
This is the Ink Portrait Technique

289
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:05,925
of our Divine Realm.

290
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,144
You can take it as a souvenir.

291
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:14,304
(Mingshu Deity, Divine Realm)
So it's Lord Bicang ShenLi.

292
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:15,984
Heard a lot about you.

293
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:17,285
What's with your tone?

294
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:19,325
Don't pick up my sister's bad habits.

295
00:17:19,325 --> 00:17:21,505
- You...
- What? Just draw. And do it well.

296
00:17:26,064 --> 00:17:27,865
- How many people?
- Just one.

297
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,505
One? You didn't bring any attendants?

298
00:17:31,144 --> 00:17:32,656
Can't I come without one?

299
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,304
That's not what I mean.

300
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,505
Just draw. What are you dawdling for?

301
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,496
Smile.

302
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:00,105
Your Divine Realm puts a lot of thought

303
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:01,625
to such useless matters.

304
00:18:03,745 --> 00:18:05,040
Do I?

305
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,685
ShenLi, go rest at my residence.

306
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,064
I'm waiting for my friend.

307
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:13,425
Lu Qing, come.

308
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,724
My Lord.

309
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:16,064
Take Lord Bicang to my residence.

310
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:18,416
Go.

311
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:20,664
This way, please.

312
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:25,005
Third Prince, we're running out of time.

313
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,805
Shall we take a shortcut?

314
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,185
It might be windier.

315
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:29,425
The road might be bumpier.

316
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,465
What do you know?

317
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:32,184
Only these things

318
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:33,184
are truly important.

319
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:35,784
My gold leaves.

320
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,384
My coral.

321
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,424
My pearl necklace.

322
00:18:43,505 --> 00:18:46,405
And my hand... Hand?

323
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,016
Hey...

324
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:56,905
Your dress is really pretty.

325
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:59,264
Right? It's for the Ink Portrait.

326
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:02,105
- Who is this?
- No idea.

327
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:12,745
(The air in the Divine Realm)

328
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:14,585
(is much better than
in our Immortal Realm.)

329
00:19:16,264 --> 00:19:19,105
(There are such beautiful
places in the world.)

330
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:24,264
(If only the people of
the Immortal Realm could see it.)

331
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:26,672
Your Lordship, please.

332
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:33,264
I thought she was fierce and bossy.

333
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:36,724
But she seems a young lady
dressed rather handsomely.

334
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:37,825
Keep your voice down.

335
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:39,265
Who knows what she's like?

336
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,592
Let's go.

337
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:42,704
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

338
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,424
Your Lordship, this is the maid arranged
for you by Lord Furong.

339
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,536
Yingge.

340
00:19:52,384 --> 00:19:54,032
(Yingge, Divine Realm)
Your Lordship.

341
00:19:55,264 --> 00:19:56,825
Thank you.

342
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:57,825
Your Lordship, please.

343
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,625
(Ever since I arrived,)

344
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:04,985
(these malicious glances toward
the Immortal have not stopped.)

345
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:19,584
Everyone else has arrived.

346
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,985
Why is Bei Xiaoyan still not here?

347
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:37,785
Didn't you go to my residence?

348
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:39,408
Why are you here again?

349
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:41,225
Your residence is too noisy.

350
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,568
I want to have some peace.

351
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:46,384
My place is better than here.

352
00:20:46,904 --> 00:20:48,745
And much more exquisite
than your palace.

353
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:50,896
It's alright.

354
00:20:51,985 --> 00:20:53,865
After we get married,

355
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,345
this will be your home.

356
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:58,024
You can get familiar with it.

357
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,728
Don't be courteous with me.

358
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:01,664
What are you after?

359
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,904
You accepted this marriage?

360
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:08,688
I did.

361
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:16,625
But I have something

362
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:18,664
to discuss with you.

363
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,584
Say it.

364
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:30,865
Look.

365
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:33,825
Even though we both
have accepted this marriage,

366
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,465
you have no romantic feelings for me,

367
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:36,985
nor I for you.

368
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,024
This is a forced match.

369
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,792
We know this very well.

370
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:41,865
Getting married is a must.

371
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:42,985
At our position,

372
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,024
we have to go through with it,
no matter with whom.

373
00:21:48,144 --> 00:21:51,424
So it's better to get this settled.

374
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,225
The wedding ceremony will
make us sworn siblings.

375
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:55,384
We will call each other buddy.

376
00:22:02,784 --> 00:22:03,784
How about you call me father?

377
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,144
Let's make it a fertility marriage.

378
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,288
Don't take advantage of me.

379
00:22:15,144 --> 00:22:17,384
After we get married, we're family.

380
00:22:18,064 --> 00:22:19,904
We'll be like brothers,
without any romantic feelings.

381
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:23,245
I've drafted a prenuptial agreement.

382
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:24,425
If you think it's acceptable,

383
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:25,505
let's sign it first.

384
00:22:29,424 --> 00:22:30,448
Here.

385
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:34,625
If you sign this celestial contract,

386
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,345
after we marry, we will be brothers.

387
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:39,845
I don't care if you have
someone in your heart,

388
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,505
and you don't interfere
if I see someone else.

389
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:45,825
I won't sign it.

390
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,345
Why not?

391
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:50,664
What's wrong with being brothers?

392
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,844
After we get married,
we'll work together as one.

393
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:55,144
If there are any difficulties,

394
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:57,505
you'll go the tough way,
and I the soft way.

395
00:22:57,505 --> 00:22:58,605
Our partnership will be called

396
00:22:58,605 --> 00:22:59,705
the Heavens' Demon King.

397
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:00,816
Who would dare to provoke us?

398
00:23:01,784 --> 00:23:02,985
- Do you dare?
- No.

399
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:06,640
I won't sign it.

400
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:10,904
But why?

401
00:23:20,304 --> 00:23:22,024
Is it

402
00:23:22,664 --> 00:23:23,696
because

403
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:30,679
you have feelings for me?

404
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,264
Why do you look at me like that?

405
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:41,616
Just sign it.

406
00:23:43,424 --> 00:23:45,825
I am certain that I'll never
have feelings for you.

407
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:49,024
So this is meaningless to me.

408
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:54,024
After getting married,

409
00:23:54,024 --> 00:23:56,625
if you want to love someone,
I won't interfere.

410
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,424
But if you take advantage of others,

411
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:01,744
I will beat you just the same.

412
00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:38,304
Goddess.

413
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,905
Look, I've drawn His Excellency.

414
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,625
Does it capture the likeness?

415
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:45,445
Yes, it has a third of his charm.

416
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:46,965
Only a third?

417
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:48,424
It looks exactly alike.

418
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:57,224
Goddess.

419
00:24:57,224 --> 00:24:59,904
How is the piece I composed for him?

420
00:25:02,664 --> 00:25:04,112
Yes.

421
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:08,880
Not bad.

422
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:14,024
Why are you so distracted?

423
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:17,072
It's nothing.

424
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:31,544
It's His Excellency's tune.

425
00:25:35,745 --> 00:25:37,424
It's not.

426
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:38,904
This playing sounds unskilled.

427
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,168
It's not His Excellency.

428
00:25:42,264 --> 00:25:43,664
This sound is very close.

429
00:25:44,264 --> 00:25:45,304
It's coming from

430
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:47,784
Lord Furong's Mansion.

431
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:50,945
Furong's Mansion?

432
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,544
It's indeed coming from there.

433
00:26:24,345 --> 00:26:25,904
How could someone there

434
00:26:25,904 --> 00:26:27,064
know His Excellency's tune?

435
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:39,465
Who is playing this tune?

436
00:26:42,625 --> 00:26:44,105
It sounds a bit unskilled,

437
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:50,945
but the tune is very touching.

438
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:56,144
My Lord.

439
00:26:57,105 --> 00:26:58,416
- Be quiet.
- My Lord.

440
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:01,345
I am listening to the tune.

441
00:27:01,345 --> 00:27:02,825
My Lord, leave the tune.

442
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:04,825
Youlan Goddess is coming in a rage

443
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,125
with a group of deities.

444
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,345
They are looking for Lord Bicang.

445
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:12,705
In a rage?

446
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:14,585
What do they want with ShenLi?

447
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,904
I don't know, but it looks frightening.

448
00:27:18,465 --> 00:27:19,728
Oh no.

449
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:21,945
My sister must be overthinking

450
00:27:21,945 --> 00:27:23,625
and came for trouble with her friends.

451
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:25,144
Her friends? Who?

452
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:28,225
How can you not know that
in the Divine Realm?

453
00:27:29,184 --> 00:27:31,585
I just serve you, My Lord.

454
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:38,065
Many deities in our realm
admire His Excellency.

455
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:39,124
With my sister as the leader,

456
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:40,264
they have established a school

457
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:42,964
to study his speech and behavior,

458
00:27:42,964 --> 00:27:45,705
so that their skills will be refined
and their demeanor more graceful.

459
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,465
They also have a tea gathering
every seven days

460
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,064
in my sister's flower garden

461
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:50,664
where they discuss Lord Xingzhi.

462
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:52,544
Lord Xingzhi?

463
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,105
They write poems and books,

464
00:27:56,105 --> 00:27:57,264
compose music, write lyrics,

465
00:27:57,264 --> 00:27:59,024
and paint pictures for Lord Xingzhi.

466
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,725
Cultivate diligently

467
00:28:27,725 --> 00:28:29,405
to live up to the beauty of life.

468
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:31,125
Strive hard in practice

469
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,085
so as not to waste time.

470
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:34,345
In the Divine Realm,

471
00:28:34,904 --> 00:28:36,065
only His Excellency

472
00:28:36,065 --> 00:28:37,664
is a tiny bit more popular than me.

473
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:39,825
But the deities who like me

474
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:40,864
all want me to belong to them.

475
00:28:40,864 --> 00:28:42,705
They don't.

476
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:45,424
They just hope that all the deities
would admire His Excellency.

477
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,440
Note,

478
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:50,065
admire him, not like him.

479
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:51,225
Not love, nor possession.

480
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:56,184
Because they think
no one is good enough for him.

481
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:01,945
When my sister returned
from the Immortal Realm,

482
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,345
she must have misunderstood.

483
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:08,225
The deities who admire His Excellency

484
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:09,904
tend to overthink upon hearing rumors.

485
00:29:09,904 --> 00:29:11,065
Then...

486
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:13,105
My sister is in a rage.

487
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:14,144
ShenLi is a tough character too.

488
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:18,885
No, I have to help ShenLi.

489
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:20,345
Lest a bloodbath occurs in my residence.

490
00:29:21,784 --> 00:29:22,960
Let's go.

491
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:48,208
Make way.

492
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:51,965
Sister!

493
00:29:51,965 --> 00:29:53,205
Sister, what are you doing?

494
00:29:53,205 --> 00:29:55,184
What's wrong, sister?

495
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:58,225
Is ShenLi playing a tune
in your residence?

496
00:29:58,865 --> 00:30:00,105
What about the tune?

497
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:01,304
Lord Xingzhi composed the tune.

498
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:02,404
Why would she know it?

499
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:03,865
- Right, why?
- Right, why?

500
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,225
Lord Xingzhi composed the tune.

501
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:13,625
Tell me, where is ShenLi?

502
00:30:16,904 --> 00:30:18,264
In the Immortal Realm, were she and

503
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:21,465
His Excellency...

504
00:30:21,465 --> 00:30:23,665
Sister, do not speculate.

505
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:26,285
I was there too, what could
possibly happen between them?

506
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:27,325
But that tune...

507
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,904
His Excellency played
that tune to me too.

508
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:30,745
I'm not good with music
and didn't remember it.

509
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:35,945
It's true.

510
00:30:35,945 --> 00:30:37,424
Why would I deceive you?

511
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:40,185
Besides, ShenLi is a guest in our realm

512
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:41,385
and she is staying at my residence.

513
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:42,784
If you come to accuse her

514
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:43,785
without any reason,

515
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:45,345
what if Grandfather finds out?

516
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:53,685
Go back then, you're overthinking it.

517
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,225
It's all good
in the two realms, just go.

518
00:30:58,225 --> 00:30:59,664
Please, Goddess.

519
00:31:00,304 --> 00:31:01,465
- Just go home.
- Please.

520
00:31:01,465 --> 00:31:02,945
She is a guest. What are you all doing?

521
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,816
- Please.
- Please.

522
00:31:11,825 --> 00:31:14,865
Answer me, when and where and why

523
00:31:14,865 --> 00:31:16,105
did he play this tune for you?

524
00:31:18,425 --> 00:31:19,745
One evening
at the Lord Bicang's Mansion,

525
00:31:19,745 --> 00:31:22,144
he was in the mood and played it for us.

526
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:23,945
- How was the weather that day?
- Overcast and windy.

527
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,424
- And after playing?
- We all rested.

528
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:27,784
- For how long?
- I slept for quite a while.

529
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:30,264
- I wouldn't know about them.
- What did you do the next day?

530
00:31:30,864 --> 00:31:32,104
I wandered around the Immortal Realm.

531
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:33,705
- What about ShenLi?
- She went to train troops.

532
00:31:33,705 --> 00:31:35,865
- How was the weather that day?
- Overcast and windy.

533
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:46,625
Fine, I'm off.

534
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,064
My Lord, did you lie to the Goddess?

535
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,585
I did it for the peace of the world

536
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:14,784
and to protect my residence.

537
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,384
But what if her intuition is correct?

538
00:32:18,985 --> 00:32:21,225
Then Lord Bicang and Lord Xingzhi are...

539
00:32:25,304 --> 00:32:29,184
I am the top lover of the three realms.

540
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,585
Could I not know what feelings are?

541
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:32,745
Could I possibly have mistaken?

542
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:34,784
It's nothing. Don't overthink.

543
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:37,144
Don't let my sister mislead you.

544
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,544
I feel

545
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:48,784
that something is not right.

546
00:32:49,465 --> 00:32:50,625
Me too.

547
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:53,005
When we were at Lord Furong's mansion,

548
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,184
he acted

549
00:32:54,184 --> 00:32:55,664
strangely and evasively.

550
00:32:56,745 --> 00:32:58,264
When the Goddess said

551
00:32:58,264 --> 00:33:00,185
that Lord Xingzhi composed the tune,

552
00:33:00,185 --> 00:33:03,745
Lord Furong seemed surprised
and didn't appear to be familiar with it.

553
00:33:04,585 --> 00:33:07,705
Do you think he was covering for ShenLi?

554
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:13,705
There must be something
going on with her.

555
00:33:14,585 --> 00:33:16,844
- In any case.
- His Excellency must not be tainted.

556
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:20,184
- Make her leave.
- But do not tarnish his reputation.

557
00:33:20,985 --> 00:33:22,625
Nor our own reputation.

558
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:26,805
Without tarnishing anyone's reputation,

559
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:27,825
how do we punish her?

560
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:35,424
If she can get Lord Furong to help her,

561
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:37,184
we can too.

562
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,352
The meal, Your Lordship.

563
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:54,825
This is what you're serving me?

564
00:33:55,424 --> 00:33:56,424
What else do you want?

565
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:59,184
Your maid has fallen ill.

566
00:33:59,184 --> 00:34:00,304
I have come to replace her.

567
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,144
Is there also fake medicine
in your realm?

568
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:48,864
You must make the shopkeeper compensate.

569
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:06,705
The person who dares to poison me

570
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:07,824
only has this little courage?

571
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,505
The Divine Realm indeed fosters fools.

572
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:14,344
How dare you?

573
00:35:14,344 --> 00:35:16,125
A despicable Immortal like you

574
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,664
is not worthy of Lord Furong.

575
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:23,424
You like him that much?

576
00:35:24,824 --> 00:35:27,384
How about I'll take you to see
the Heavenly Lord?

577
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,344
You properly express
to the Heavenly Lord

578
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:32,505
your affections for Furong

579
00:35:33,344 --> 00:35:36,144
and let him grant a marriage
for you, who is worthy of Furong.

580
00:35:36,664 --> 00:35:37,785
Does that sound good?

581
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:38,960
You...

582
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:48,785
(This poison wasn't
supposed to harm me.)

583
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:51,945
(But combined with
the medicine I consumed,)

584
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,025
(it's taking effect on me.)

585
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:27,472
Come.

586
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,104
That's all you've got?

587
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:35,184
Someone like you doesn't deserve

588
00:36:35,184 --> 00:36:36,604
Lord Furong.

589
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:38,672
That's right.

590
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:43,344
You bunch of girls in the Divine Realm

591
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:46,465
truly deserve a beating.

592
00:36:49,265 --> 00:36:50,285
How could you?

593
00:36:50,285 --> 00:36:51,824
You were heavily poisoned.

594
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:54,104
Having been tormented
by Lord Furong for so long,

595
00:36:56,104 --> 00:36:57,785
I will show you today

596
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:02,384
what an unyielding hero is.

597
00:37:11,465 --> 00:37:13,104
15,330.

598
00:37:13,104 --> 00:37:14,225
15,331.

599
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,065
15,332.

600
00:37:17,344 --> 00:37:18,664
15,333.

601
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:20,664
15,334.

602
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,265
Who is it?

603
00:37:26,265 --> 00:37:27,824
I was about to break the record!

604
00:37:28,545 --> 00:37:29,545
Anyone harbored a ghost?

605
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:32,225
My Lord!

606
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:37,065
My Lord, there are deities

607
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:38,304
who went to Lord Bicang

608
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:39,888
for trouble.

609
00:37:40,824 --> 00:37:42,424
Let's go have a look.

610
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:47,624
Get lost!

611
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:59,144
Quickly.

612
00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:03,888
ShenLi.

613
00:38:07,424 --> 00:38:09,008
What are you doing?

614
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:13,745
Three ignorant deities
came courting death.

615
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:16,904
- Do you recognize this?
- This is...

616
00:38:19,824 --> 00:38:21,360
I killed them.

617
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:31,364
You killed them?

618
00:38:31,364 --> 00:38:32,912
And then

619
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:38,256
you roasted them?

620
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:48,080
What...

621
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:00,944
