00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,088
I think

4
00:01:44,756 --> 00:01:45,835
we need to show some restraint.

5
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:47,600
I am very calm.

6
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,195
I know very clearly what I am doing.

7
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:53,200
Don't stop me.

8
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,512
If I chose wrong,

9
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:01,195
that's my mistake.

50
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,596
Where is that place?

51
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:30,672
(My power)

52
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,355
(is back?)

(I feel)

(I'm even stronger than before.)

55
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:46,036
Today,

56
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,395
it was all my fault.

57
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:50,876
You don't need to blame yourself.

58
00:05:53,115 --> 00:05:55,955
First, I am not blaming myself.

59
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:58,800
Second,

60
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,196
what's your fault?

61
00:06:03,235 --> 00:06:05,636
Third, I know what I am doing.

62
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:07,716
I have been very clear-headed.

63
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:13,488
You are crazy?

64
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,436
I guess so.

65
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,675
Since the moment
you died in the East Sea,

66
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,835
I seem to have not been quite myself.

67
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:34,416
No.

68
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,515
I can go crazy, others can,

69
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,075
and even the Three Realms can.

70
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:41,316
But you hold their lives.

71
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:43,664
You mustn't go crazy.

72
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,456
But I

73
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,356
have long since fallen into an abyss.

74
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:53,395
I struggled.

75
00:06:54,128 --> 00:06:55,196
I refused.

76
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,208
But heaven

77
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,275
just never spares me.

78
00:06:58,864 --> 00:06:59,952
Li,

79
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,128
tell me.

80
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:04,400
What should I do?

81
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:10,196
If I had just fallen for you

82
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,756
without doing anything against heaven,

83
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:14,876
I would not have suffered
the retribution.

84
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:26,876
It is not the time to talk about this.

85
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,835
Let's first think of a way out.

86
00:07:30,436 --> 00:07:31,835
Ms. Jin said someone was attacking.

87
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,916
I fear it's...

88
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:34,928
ShenLi,

89
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:36,496
I have lived for so long

90
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,675
and never met a woman like you before.

91
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:40,912
What's on your mind?

92
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:44,240
You're acting like

93
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,355
nothing has happened

94
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:47,920
and get to business

95
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,996
so immediately!

96
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,436
I didn't pay attention before,

97
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:12,236
but this time,
seeing those puppet-like people

98
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:13,756
emitting miasma again

99
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:17,175
reminds me of the past.

100
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,636
Chimeis once caused chaos
in the Immortal Realm.

101
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:22,768
You must have heard of it, right?

102
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:24,784
Yes.

103
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,235
Thousands of Chimeis appeared
in the Immortal Realm.

104
00:08:29,264 --> 00:08:30,275
That was not a coincidence.

105
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,316
They were created by Liuming,
your previous lord,

106
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:36,316
through secret techniques.

107
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:47,876
Liuming deemed the Divine incompetent,

108
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:51,956
unwilling to share heaven with them

109
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:55,760
and desiring to destroy them.

110
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:01,155
However, it met with strong opposition
from the court officials

111
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,715
who argued
it would affect the Immortals.

112
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:08,355
Liuming harbored discontent.

113
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:13,155
He secretly made thousands of Chimeis
to attack the Divine Realm.

114
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,636
But there were too many

115
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,996
and they were too strong

116
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:22,276
to keep under control,

117
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,355
thus leading to a disaster.

118
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,595
The Immortals couldn't resist
and sent a message to the Divine Realm.

119
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:29,716
The Heavenly Lord came

120
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:32,396
to ask me to seal the Chimeis.

121
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:37,436
In the war
against the Scorpion-Tailed Fox,

122
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:40,636
our warriors suffered

123
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:42,448
a devastating defeat.

124
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:02,516
One can imagine

125
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:05,355
how terrifying it was

126
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:07,504
to face thousands of Chimeis.

127
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,436
And they were all created
by a single person.

128
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:12,176
And if you hadn't sealed

129
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:14,196
that person,

130
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,555
he would have harmed all beings.

131
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:22,355
When I came to the Immortal Realm

132
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,915
and battled the Chimeis
for the first time,

133
00:10:26,115 --> 00:10:27,235
I had no idea what they were.

134
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:29,392
But I discovered

135
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:32,155
they were hard to kill
with swords and spells.

136
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:34,396
Even if they were killed,

137
00:10:34,956 --> 00:10:36,716
they would turn into black smoke

138
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:39,035
and get devoured by nearby Chimeis

139
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,956
for more strength.

140
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,235
If that was the case,

141
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:47,316
sealing them was the fastest method.

142
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:49,712
I want to apologize

143
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:54,076
for what happened before.

144
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:04,144
Have you thought of something?

145
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,192
What?

146
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:08,656
Extremely difficult to kill.

147
00:11:09,475 --> 00:11:10,512
Black miasma.

148
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:12,516
Acting insane.

149
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:36,196
Those puppets
and the black-clothed pursuers

150
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:39,475
are similar to Chimeis.

151
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,555
When we first encountered them

152
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:46,675
in Jinxiu City,

153
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:49,636
perhaps they were not yet perfected.

154
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:53,276
But repeated encounters

155
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:55,152
made me feel

156
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,200
the person who created them

157
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,056
had made much progress.

158
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:01,392
Fu Sheng.

159
00:12:02,675 --> 00:12:04,675
Why did he know how to create Chimeis

160
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,115
and why could he use
your Water Halting Spell?

161
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:09,072
What exactly does he want to do?

162
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:12,176
In my opinion,

163
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,796
Fu Sheng may not fully know

164
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:16,475
the method for creating Chimeis.

165
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:19,355
Otherwise, he could just create one.

166
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:21,555
Why would he bother

167
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:24,396
making those half-finished puppets?

168
00:12:25,756 --> 00:12:26,756
Surely, he knows something.

169
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:29,436
But I remember Liuming was killed by me,

170
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:32,115
so there shouldn't be
anyone remembering it.

171
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:34,056
As for the Water Halting Spell,

172
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:35,255
I think...

173
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,956
It was the Ice Forming Spell,
as you said.

174
00:12:37,915 --> 00:12:38,928
Correct.

175
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:41,536
Without divine power,

176
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:43,076
how can one cast divine spells?

177
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:46,375
As for how they got to know them,

178
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,355
do you still remember Gu Chengjin?

179
00:12:49,584 --> 00:12:50,608
Yes.

180
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,396
Gu Chengjin, Jing Yan,

181
00:12:53,956 --> 00:12:55,456
was Qingye who fell for someone

182
00:12:55,456 --> 00:12:56,555
and was stripped of divinity.

183
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,288
He was your best friend.

184
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:00,976
Yes.

185
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:05,115
I created the Water Halting Spell,

186
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,636
but I did it to Qingye.

187
00:13:08,876 --> 00:13:10,115
And when he was Gu Chengjin,

188
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:11,952
Fu Sheng

189
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:13,936
was around.

190
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:19,516
Perhaps he managed to spy on

191
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:21,516
the memories Qingye had as a god.

192
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,792
The Water Halting Spell.

193
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,235
He might have learned a bit of it.

194
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:27,824
Looking back now,

195
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:30,555
he did a lot of things covertly,

196
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,436
like burning down your yard

197
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:36,595
and plotting He's madness.

198
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:42,928
What do you think

199
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:44,836
was his purpose

200
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:47,155
behind all this?

201
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:52,115
His goal was the Xutian Abyss.

202
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,355
Back then, the Chimeis escaped

203
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:11,715
and severely wounded the border guards.

204
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,155
Soon after, you came
to the Immortal Realm to reseal it.

205
00:14:27,856 --> 00:14:28,976
Not long after,

206
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:31,516
many Diviners
in the Mortal Realm were captured.

207
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:34,915
I do not know their specific purpose,

208
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,956
but it must be related
to Fu Sheng's half-finished puppets.

209
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:39,792
Let me out!

210
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,035
Let me out!

211
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,024
Who are you?

212
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:44,196
What are you doing?

213
00:14:44,196 --> 00:14:45,316
Let me out!

214
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:47,376
Let me out!

215
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:48,432
Let me out!

216
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,475
Let me out!

217
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:51,888
I was in the Jinxiu City.

218
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:53,516
Let me out!

219
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:55,035
Let me out!

220
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,836
I fought Zixia
who was turned into a puppet.

221
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:02,448
I suppose

222
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:04,976
he learned the methods
of creating Chimeis

223
00:15:04,976 --> 00:15:06,555
from the Xutian Abyss.

224
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,756
(All those things back then)

225
00:15:11,516 --> 00:15:13,276
(appeared to be just as they were,)

226
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:16,115
(as if they happened naturally,)

227
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:18,235
(but there was actually someone)

228
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:20,235
(manipulating them)

229
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,915
(behind the scenes.)

230
00:15:24,196 --> 00:15:26,715
Did you know all this early on?

231
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,555
I didn't realize it

232
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:37,475
until I got so many clues.

233
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:40,336
We...

234
00:15:41,076 --> 00:15:42,224
We gotta get out.

235
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:45,355
I gotta return to report
to Her Holiness soon

236
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,184
to devise a countermeasure.

237
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:51,196
1,000 years ago,
after I sealed the Chimeis,

238
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:52,752
I was too tired

239
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,516
to govern the Immortal Realm anymore.

240
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:57,436
Your master, Shen Muyue,

241
00:15:58,155 --> 00:15:59,276
became your current lord.

242
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:01,636
I don't know much about her,

243
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:04,996
but I am sure she is
hiding something from you.

244
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:10,996
Her Holiness might deceive me,

245
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:12,956
but she will never harm me.

246
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:14,704
I trust her.

247
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:19,996
If you trusted me like that,

248
00:16:21,488 --> 00:16:22,512
that would be great.

249
00:16:23,888 --> 00:16:24,944
It's not the same.

250
00:16:27,115 --> 00:16:29,096
She is both a teacher
and a mother to me.

251
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,756
Without her, I wouldn't
have survived to this day.

252
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:32,756
So,

253
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,076
even if she deceives me all my life

254
00:16:36,016 --> 00:16:37,040
and takes my life,

255
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:38,992
I can just give my life to her.

256
00:16:41,475 --> 00:16:43,355
How could I let you
give your life to her?

257
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:47,216
Now,

258
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:50,996
how can I bear to see that?

259
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,595
Didn't Ms. Jin say she would come?

260
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:29,796
Why is there no sign of her at all?

261
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:31,632
Is she in trouble?

262
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,036
Don't worry about that.

263
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:36,156
When it comes to

264
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,336
the skill of escaping,

265
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:38,516
she is second to none.

266
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:41,996
I managed to get away

267
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,556
and came down to save you,

268
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:45,955
only to hear you say this.

269
00:17:46,676 --> 00:17:48,396
I'm so sad.

270
00:17:51,472 --> 00:17:52,556
I'm unhappy.

271
00:17:53,276 --> 00:17:55,255
You must apologize to me.

272
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:57,276
Otherwise, I will not help you.

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
If so,

274
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:00,896
I will not apologize.

275
00:18:00,896 --> 00:18:01,936
You go back yourself.

276
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:05,996
It seems you want
to stay with her a bit longer.

277
00:18:05,996 --> 00:18:07,475
No way.

278
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,996
Enough. Hurry up.

279
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:12,528
Take us out.

280
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,408
Let's go.

281
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,355
Did he do anything

282
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:29,516
to you just now?

283
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:33,776
No.

284
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:38,000
No?

285
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:40,715
His Excellency

286
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:42,856
is decent.

287
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:44,796
These evil thoughts can't affect him.

288
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:49,552
Hurry.

289
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,392
Li,

290
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:55,516
your power has recovered?

291
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:57,195
How did you do it?

292
00:19:12,048 --> 00:19:13,104
Watch out!

293
00:19:19,636 --> 00:19:20,676
What are these things?

294
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:25,315
This is really bad now.

295
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,120
This is impossible.

296
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:29,115
Where did it get such great strength?

297
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:31,075
It even broke through my seal.

298
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:48,336
I guess

299
00:19:49,475 --> 00:19:50,916
they absorbed

300
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:53,355
our emotions and desires.

301
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,200
Your Excellency,

302
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,075
yours were so intense.

303
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,595
You have truly troubled me.

304
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:17,396
What is that?

305
00:20:17,396 --> 00:20:18,856
Why are you so afraid?

306
00:20:18,856 --> 00:20:19,916
I am not afraid at all.

307
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:22,435
My wicked thoughts have accumulated

308
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:24,075
in this place for thousands of years.

309
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:27,315
Over time,
they have congealed into a form.

310
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:30,475
It's like my doppelganger.

311
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:32,835
So it is quite clear
about my weaknesses.

312
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:35,115
If that's the case,

313
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,276
you can't confront it.

314
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:38,288
I'll deal with it.

315
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,176
Li,

316
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:42,496
you're like a man.

317
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:43,616
Just talk

318
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,195
and don't do unnecessary things.

319
00:20:51,396 --> 00:20:52,456
Don't worry about me.

320
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:53,595
I can handle it.

321
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:55,896
Its ability to influence
people's thoughts

322
00:20:55,896 --> 00:20:57,355
is what makes it a real headache.

323
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:01,036
When you were inside,

324
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:02,276
you surely fell for it.

325
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:12,876
Alright.

326
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,076
Now I'm going to catch it
and won't see you out.

327
00:21:15,076 --> 00:21:16,716
Just go down this road to get out.

328
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm off.

329
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:19,796
Oh, right.

330
00:21:19,796 --> 00:21:21,315
When I was outside just now,

331
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,076
I got into a fight with a bunch
of people covered in black smoke.

332
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:26,355
After the fight, I found

333
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,276
my inner core had been taken away.

334
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:32,215
Although it is not important to me,

335
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:34,076
why should I just let them
have it for nothing?

336
00:21:34,076 --> 00:21:36,596
I don't care. You gotta
teach them a lesson

337
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,075
and retrieve it for me.

338
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:39,920
I'm off.

339
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,008
Fu Sheng.

340
00:21:50,715 --> 00:21:51,955
Why did they take her inner core?

341
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:59,835
Things will reveal
themselves in time. Let's go.

342
00:22:35,632 --> 00:22:36,656
Who?

343
00:22:57,392 --> 00:22:58,448
Mofang?

344
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:01,424
Lord Shen,

345
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:03,664
long time no see.

346
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:05,680
This is...

347
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:08,560
Fu Sheng?

348
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,696
Possession.

349
00:23:09,696 --> 00:23:12,156
Mofang is now possessed by Fu Sheng.

350
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:18,480
Fu Sheng,

351
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:20,955
we will settle all the scores.

352
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:23,475
A crippled Lord Bicang

353
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,156
and a severely injured ancient god

354
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:29,276
want to settle scores with me?

355
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,835
On what grounds?

356
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:36,276
Now is not the time for me to fight you.

357
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:38,955
But who told you she was crippled?

358
00:23:53,876 --> 00:23:55,075
(Merged with the power
of the inner core.)

359
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:57,235
(This is the true ShenLi,)

360
00:23:58,544 --> 00:23:59,676
(standing up straight.)

361
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:01,835
(Even if the sky has fallen,)

362
00:24:02,516 --> 00:24:05,195
(she can still stand on her own.)

363
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:43,195
(It seems she has completely merged
with the Azure Sea Pearl)

364
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:44,996
(and become so formidable.)

365
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:47,276
(Now, this body)

366
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:48,916
(is no match for her.)

367
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:24,235
You lowly beings.

368
00:25:25,115 --> 00:25:26,435
How dare you profane the god?

369
00:25:45,475 --> 00:25:47,396
They haven't done anything to me yet,

370
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:49,595
and you're already so enraged.

371
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,195
They always see you as a pushover.

372
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:54,916
Let's go after him.

373
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:56,336
He's been hit by your flames.

374
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:57,916
He won't go far. Let's go.

375
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:05,835
The fog in this forest is weird.

376
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:09,075
This must be their trick.

377
00:26:11,355 --> 00:26:13,315
Go find him and ask him
about Fu Sheng's plot.

378
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:15,824
Let's split up.

379
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:22,224
Too anxious.

380
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:33,636
Did you see that?

381
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:37,776
She showed no mercy towards you.

382
00:26:37,776 --> 00:26:39,075
Shut up!

383
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:41,556
Young master,
everything you've done for her

384
00:26:42,235 --> 00:26:43,676
is simply not worth it.

385
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:44,796
I told you to shut up!

386
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:49,328
Who?

387
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,768
Why do you help me?

388
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:25,756
You saved her.
She doesn't wish to kill you.

389
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:27,636
I'm just going along with her.

390
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:33,796
She always has
a tough exterior but a soft heart.

391
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:36,036
Do you think you know her very much?

392
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:38,676
You are but a latecomer.

393
00:27:40,516 --> 00:27:41,680
But I've won her over.

394
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:46,416
You don't understand her.

395
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:13,876
Her Holiness's disciple?

396
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:15,696
You're just lucky

397
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,556
to be taken as a disciple
by Her Holiness.

398
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:18,756
You don't deserve it.

399
00:28:23,796 --> 00:28:25,636
You're just fortunate
to be born into privilege.

400
00:28:25,636 --> 00:28:27,036
There's nothing to be proud of.

401
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:34,435
- Great!
- Great!

402
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:00,516
By using my body as a formation

403
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,355
and my blood as the catalyst,

404
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:04,156
I pay tribute to all life.

405
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:07,115
Mortals are granted the power
of the Five Elements.

406
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:23,568
Help!

407
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:27,195
Help me, Master!

408
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:32,304
ShenLi.

409
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,355
Help!

410
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,475
You've disappointed me greatly.

411
00:29:35,036 --> 00:29:36,355
You're even practicing evil spells!

412
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,076
I know I was wrong. Help me!

413
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:41,456
Master.

414
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:42,715
Shut up!

415
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:43,715
Learning these evil spells

416
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,036
will only ruin your future.

417
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:46,955
This pain

418
00:29:48,075 --> 00:29:49,156
will help you remember.

419
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,835
You can't even manage
to follow the heterodox paths.

420
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:25,835
ShenLi,

421
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:28,756
You're really not
living up to your title

422
00:30:28,756 --> 00:30:30,255
as Her Holiness's disciple.

423
00:30:30,255 --> 00:30:31,636
Mofang, get out of my sight!

424
00:30:37,756 --> 00:30:38,835
How can you command me?

425
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:10,656
That sound is from the Dragon Mastiff.

426
00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:11,816
It is Liuming's mount.

427
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:13,836
It was sealed by Her Holiness
1,000 years ago.

428
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:14,955
How could it possibly escape?

429
00:31:15,636 --> 00:31:17,355
Someone has lifted the seal.

430
00:31:18,156 --> 00:31:20,415
Li, I will hold back
the Dragon Mastiff for a while.

431
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:21,696
You lead them out

432
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:22,916
and go back for reinforcements.

433
00:31:31,632 --> 00:31:32,752
Where is Grumpy?

434
00:31:32,752 --> 00:31:33,796
Who?

435
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:34,864
Mofang.

436
00:31:37,075 --> 00:31:38,192
Mofang is over there.

437
00:31:46,036 --> 00:31:47,835
Stick close.
Don't fall behind. Follow me.

438
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:10,396
General!

439
00:32:15,876 --> 00:32:16,976
General!

440
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:22,835
Don't just stand there.
Come help me carry him.

441
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:36,176
Aren't you very strong?

442
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:37,264
Show it.

443
00:32:39,276 --> 00:32:40,756
(She was doing it to save me.)

444
00:32:41,676 --> 00:32:43,315
(She's not as bad as I imagined.)

445
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:07,756
Don't try to harm our people!

446
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:12,016
♪With my fervor,
I draw forth a beam of light♪

447
00:33:12,016 --> 00:33:15,516

448
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:19,115

♪A blazing glance from the heart♪

453
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:39,396
Since then, I have been
with Her Lordship on the battlefield.

454
00:33:41,516 --> 00:33:42,516
If it hadn't been for you...

455
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:48,115
You're right.

456
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:49,996
Without Xingzhi,

457
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:52,876
you would have a chance.

458
00:33:53,796 --> 00:33:55,256
It's all because of this ancient god

459
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:57,396
that things ended up like this today.

460
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:01,036
- Listen to me. Open the Xutian Abyss.
- Shut up.

461
00:34:01,036 --> 00:34:03,456
- Shut up.
- And release the Chimeis.

462
00:34:03,456 --> 00:34:05,435
ShenLi will be at your disposal.

463
00:34:05,435 --> 00:34:07,636
Shut up!

464
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,875
So you played a part

465
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:13,715
in getting yourself into this situation.

466
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,704
Xingzhi.

467
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,136
Xingzhi.

468
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,288
Xingzhi!

469
00:34:35,836 --> 00:34:36,936
Why did you let him go?

470
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:39,036
Didn't you let him go once before?

471
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:42,096
Only this once.

472
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:43,915
In return for his saving me.

473
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:48,036
Next time, I will show no mercy.

474
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:19,475
What is that?

475
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:20,675
Falling rocks
from the Extranatural Heaven.

476
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,235
Falling rocks?

477
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:28,195
It seems I need
to go back and check it out.

478
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:32,195
Do you want to come with me?

479
00:36:33,072 --> 00:36:34,160
Of course, we must go back.

480
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:36,356
Hurry up. Don't dawdle!

481
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:02,480
Stop there!

482
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:09,056
Who are you? How dare you
trespass on the Divine Realm?

483
00:37:09,056 --> 00:37:10,496
I'm a maid of Lord Bicang.

484
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:12,076
I've come to see Lord Xingzhi.

485
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:13,715
Show me your permit.

486
00:37:14,475 --> 00:37:16,595
I don't have it.
I am simply here to see Lord Xingzhi.

487
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:18,376
He took away
Lord Bicang's Red Plume Spear.

488
00:37:18,376 --> 00:37:19,616
That is Her Lordship's relic.

489
00:37:19,616 --> 00:37:20,775
It belongs to our realm.

490
00:37:20,775 --> 00:37:22,435
I'm here to ask
His Excellency to return it.

491
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,236
Without a permit,

492
00:37:24,236 --> 00:37:25,616
you're not allowed in,

493
00:37:25,616 --> 00:37:26,756
let alone seeing

494
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:27,984
His Excellency.

495
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,616
Go back.

496
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:32,315
I won't go back
without Her Lordship's spear.

497
00:37:32,315 --> 00:37:34,096
If you don't go back,
we still won't let you in.

498
00:37:34,096 --> 00:37:35,696
Do you intend to loiter here?

499
00:37:35,696 --> 00:37:38,216
I don't care. I must take
Her Lordship's spear.

500
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,516
How dare you

501
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:40,836
act like this here?

502
00:37:57,715 --> 00:38:00,395
Your Holiness, these are
the memorials from all over the realm.

503
00:38:06,516 --> 00:38:07,568
One more thing.

504
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:08,635
Her Lordship's...

505
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:15,076
Her Lordship's maid, Rouya,

506
00:38:15,076 --> 00:38:16,435
seems to have gone to the Divine Realm

507
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:18,415
to get back Her Lordship's broken spear

508
00:38:18,415 --> 00:38:19,715
from Lord Xingzhi.

509
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,675
Should I bring her back?

510
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:28,715
Let her do it.

511
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,056
Yes.

512
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:45,756
Her Holiness didn't ask us

513
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,875
to bring her back, did she?

514
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:51,408
Her Holiness

515
00:38:52,316 --> 00:38:53,715
certainly misses Her Lordship too.

516
00:38:55,756 --> 00:38:57,756
She hopes Rouya can
retrieve that broken spear.

517
00:38:58,516 --> 00:38:59,664
Even though

518
00:38:59,664 --> 00:39:00,796
(Memorial)

519
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:01,936
she knows it's impossible.

520
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:04,675
One must always hold on to hope.

521
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:08,036
Yes, if the person can't return,

522
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:10,192
getting her thing back

523
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:12,912
will do.

524
00:39:18,516 --> 00:39:20,556
I'm asking you. Where is His Excellency?

525
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:26,396
His Excellency
is in an unstable state of mind.

526
00:39:26,396 --> 00:39:27,476
I told you to watch over him

527
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:28,635
in case something might happen.

528
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:30,955
Now rocks are falling
from the Extranatural Heaven,

529
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:33,576
and you're telling me
you don't know where he is!

530
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:34,672
Have you recently

531
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,435
gone down
to the Mortal Realm for fun again?

532
00:39:39,356 --> 00:39:41,155
I thought you had grown up.

533
00:39:42,475 --> 00:39:43,475
I promised His Excellency.

534
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:45,155
Just do whatever you want.

535
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,836
Those rocks are falling.

536
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:50,576
Do you know how dangerous that is?

537
00:39:53,675 --> 00:39:54,756
If you don't say it today,

538
00:39:55,356 --> 00:39:56,432
I will certainly not spare you.

539
00:39:57,756 --> 00:39:59,035
Anyway, those rocks only fall

540
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:00,636
upon the wilderness of the Mortal Realm.

541
00:40:00,636 --> 00:40:01,715
They haven't caused much damage.

542
00:40:02,435 --> 00:40:04,396
I'll do my best to protect
His Excellency's carefree times

543
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:05,695
and never divulge his whereabouts.

544
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,736
You!

545
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:09,036
I'm pissed off!

546
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:29,816
Miss, are you all right?

547
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:31,116
You all just wait.

548
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,335
A demon!

549
00:40:36,335 --> 00:40:37,392
Run!

550
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:43,276
Lord Bicang! I can't believe it's her.

551
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:45,535
She's alive? I'll inform
the Heavenly Lord.

552
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:46,640
Go ahead.

553
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,624
Are you heading
to the Extranatural Heaven?

554
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:49,676
Please wait.

555
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:52,176
You acted
rather impulsively at the East Sea

556
00:40:52,176 --> 00:40:53,356
and shook the Extranatural Heaven.

557
00:40:53,356 --> 00:40:54,996
It may not be a good time to return.

558
00:40:57,116 --> 00:40:58,175
Has anyone been hurt?

559
00:40:58,175 --> 00:40:59,396
It was just a few falling rocks.

560
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:00,435
No Diviner was hurt.

561
00:41:01,076 --> 00:41:02,716
But they've punched
a hole in the Ninth Heaven

562
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:03,756
and fell into the lower realm.

563
00:41:03,756 --> 00:41:05,395
Fortuitously,
it didn't harm the mortals.

564
00:41:09,316 --> 00:41:11,195
Your Excellency, please wait!

565
00:41:14,276 --> 00:41:15,796
Please wait.

566
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:17,195
How can it be? ShenLi?

567
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:18,875
- ShenLi!
- Your Excellency.

568
00:41:18,875 --> 00:41:19,952
- She's still alive.
- You...

569
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:21,836
- He found her!
- You shouldn't have.

570
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,516
Lord Bicang is a real calamity.

571
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,455
Has His Excellency

572
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:29,316
fallen for her tricks?

573
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,435
Maybe it's plotted
by the Immortal Realm.

574
00:41:32,435 --> 00:41:33,456
