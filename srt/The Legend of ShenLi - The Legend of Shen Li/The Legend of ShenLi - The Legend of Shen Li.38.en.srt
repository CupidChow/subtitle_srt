00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:41,157

for a power

that can contend with the Natural Law.

36
00:04:49,516 --> 00:04:50,576
I was born

37
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,796
as a god with an innate duty.

38
00:04:55,477 --> 00:04:56,637
But it is time

39
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:59,676
for me to retire from it.

00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,396

00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:21,877
But you do.

44
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,717
Not as a god, but as Xingzhi.

45
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:28,880
As you.

46
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:35,396
Don't you have a reason to live on?

47
00:05:42,276 --> 00:05:44,037
My only reason to live on

48
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:48,516
is you.

49
00:05:52,037 --> 00:05:53,796
You don't know how to take care of

50
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,356
or feel for yourself.

51
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,396
If possible,

52
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:09,157
I-I'd like to take care of you
and feel for you

53
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,116
on your behalf.

54
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:17,136
That's right.

55
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:20,317
You must do what you say.

56
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,717
You must do what you say.

57
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:39,877
I'm spitting blood.

58
00:06:42,356 --> 00:06:43,376
Today,

59
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:46,064
I did

60
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:48,157
go wild.

61
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,956
I'm like that cuckoo

62
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,597
who spits blood while crying.

63
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:58,877
I became one of your kind.

64
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:11,076
How come

65
00:07:11,076 --> 00:07:12,637
you're still in the mood for jokes?

66
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:17,197
Smile for me.

67
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:45,917
That was horrible.

68
00:08:09,877 --> 00:08:10,992
Li.

69
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,437
Is that the light you saw

70
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,157
in your dreams?

71
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:21,552
No.

72
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,888
No.

73
00:08:26,236 --> 00:08:28,717
I want you to
look for that light with me.

74
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:31,920
Sorry.

75
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:35,437
Sorry.

76
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:38,637
Sorry.

77
00:08:43,277 --> 00:08:44,336
You will

78
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,104
definitely

79
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,397
find that light one day.

80
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:01,680
No.

81
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:05,837
You...

82
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:08,057
You know very well

83
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:10,877
that I'm only trying to find you

84
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:15,716
basking in the sunlight.

85
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,077
Where do I find someone just like you?

86
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:49,916
Look, Xingzhi.

87
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:54,352
The Natural Law

88
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:57,236
finally acknowledged your divine status

89
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,476
and made you

90
00:10:04,476 --> 00:10:07,317
a wave of energy within the cosmos

91
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:10,517
to co-exist with all creatures

92
00:10:14,637 --> 00:10:16,676
to the end of the world.

93
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,796
I can never see you again.

94
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:51,056
The divine light.

95
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:53,156
Lord Xingzhi passed away.

96
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:12,796
We bid you farewell.

97
00:11:14,277 --> 00:11:16,716
We bid you farewell, Your Excellency.

98
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:36,036
Lord Bicang, His Excellency
has ascended to heaven.

99
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:37,648
His body can't remain

100
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:41,576
in the lower realm
without a divine consciousness.

101
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,197
All the ancient gods were cremated

102
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,417
with the True Samadhi Fire

103
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,837
after they passed away.

104
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:48,837
Please entrust Lord Xingzhi

105
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:50,896
to me.

106
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,264
No.

107
00:11:55,877 --> 00:11:56,916
We must cremate

108
00:11:57,837 --> 00:11:59,876
his revered body
with the True Samadhi Fire

109
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,697
to ensure the safety of the world.

110
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:02,864
When he was alive,

111
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,437
you asked him
to protect the Three Realms

112
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,317
and the common people.

113
00:12:09,156 --> 00:12:10,156
Now that he's deceased,

114
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:12,757
you won't even spare his remains.

115
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,152
Snatch him

116
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,236
from my hands if you can.

117
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,476
If you manage to cremate him,

118
00:12:29,397 --> 00:12:31,397
I, ShenLi, will surely

119
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:33,796
launch a fire attack

120
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,236
and scorch
your Divine Realm to the ground!

121
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,437
Lord Bicang, you're being absurd!

122
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:03,596
Grandfather.

123
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:04,777
Lord Xingzhi

124
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,397
had been shackled
for the beings of the Three Realms.

125
00:13:08,837 --> 00:13:10,277
It's time to set him free.

126
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:24,397
Heavenly Lord, please show mercy.

127
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:31,568
Grandfather.

128
00:13:32,317 --> 00:13:33,437
Lord Xingzhi passed away.

129
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:35,596
But all of us witnessed

130
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,077
that he wished to be with Lord Bicang.

131
00:13:39,757 --> 00:13:41,156
You have always respected him.

132
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,337
Why don't you show him

133
00:13:43,337 --> 00:13:44,916
respect and tolerance once more?

134
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:56,517
Grandfather, please show mercy.

135
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:58,517
Please show mercy.

136
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,637
Please show mercy.

137
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:08,528
Grandfather.

138
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:16,784
Fine.

139
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:19,504
Fine.

140
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,816
Heavenly Lord.

141
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:27,216
You're free now.

142
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:38,768
Let's go.

143
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,356
They're gone.

144
00:14:52,356 --> 00:14:54,476

What do you think?

217
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,897
Well,

218
00:21:16,897 --> 00:21:19,477
you haven't seen
how Her Lordship trains the troops.

219
00:21:19,477 --> 00:21:21,116
This is hardly anything yet.

220
00:21:22,037 --> 00:21:24,716
You'll have to join the training.

221
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:27,757
I should train as well?

222
00:21:27,757 --> 00:21:29,596
Be a role model, alright?

223
00:21:30,397 --> 00:21:31,472
Never heard of it?

224
00:21:33,236 --> 00:21:34,596
It seems life has been

225
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:37,356
too easy in the Divine Realm.

226
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,136
But...

227
00:21:46,116 --> 00:21:47,152
This is not enough?

228
00:21:49,997 --> 00:21:51,977
Thank you for sending generals

229
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,316
to help us rectify military discipline.

230
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,208
Please don't mention it.

231
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:58,416
We should be thanking you

232
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,576
for your spiritual stones

233
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:01,917
that helped us restore
the Immortal Realm so fast.

234
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:04,257
Thank you for helping us

235
00:22:04,257 --> 00:22:05,397
during a time of need.

236
00:22:07,037 --> 00:22:08,316
The Three Realms

237
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,032
are of the same origin.

238
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:18,277
Do you have any hobbies, Your Holiness?

239
00:22:25,997 --> 00:22:27,184
I only train troops.

240
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:32,816
Right.

241
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,877
How is Lord Bicang doing?

242
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:44,432
She is slowly

243
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,236
getting over it.

244
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,076
That's good.

245
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:51,536
That's good.

246
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,236
What you just mentioned...

247
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,917
How does it work?

248
00:23:03,917 --> 00:23:05,436
This?

249
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:06,596
This is really fun.

250
00:23:06,596 --> 00:23:07,997
You just rub it every day.

251
00:23:07,997 --> 00:23:09,577
It gets brighter and brighter.

252
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:11,037
Here, Your Holiness.

253
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:12,277
This is for you.

254
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:13,877
What does it do?

255
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:14,956
I should just rub it?

256
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:16,297
It gets smoother as you rub it.

257
00:23:16,297 --> 00:23:18,077
How is this more fun
than leading troops?

258
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:19,297
Of course, it is.

259
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,517
Rub it as if you're polishing it.

260
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:22,637
I have plenty of these.

261
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,436
- I have one this big.
- Really?

262
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:25,997
- I rub it all day.
- For real?

263
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:27,376
- Yeah.
- Sounds boring.

264
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:29,328
I'm too busy training troops.

265
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:30,416
That's so boring.

266
00:23:30,416 --> 00:23:31,440
- That's fun!
- Right?

267
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,464
It's not fun.

268
00:24:47,716 --> 00:24:49,037
(The Legend of ShenLi)
This book

269
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,517
is written by Youlan's sisters

270
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:53,877
and instructed by Youlan and me.

271
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:56,156
It records

272
00:24:56,156 --> 00:24:58,356
your story in detail.

273
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:00,757
It will be

274
00:25:00,757 --> 00:25:03,037
a comprehensive record
of you and Lord Xingzhi.

275
00:25:03,917 --> 00:25:04,917
It was sold out

276
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:06,637
the moment it was out.

277
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,157
It took me great effort to get one.

278
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:10,192
You can have it.

279
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:13,036
Flip through it whenever you miss

280
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:14,137
His Excellency

281
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,184
lest you forget him.

282
00:25:15,184 --> 00:25:16,596
I won't forget him.

283
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:22,637
So many years have passed.

284
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:25,116
The two realms have reconciled.

285
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,076
But you haven't moved on.

286
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:28,797
Why should I move on?

287
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:34,836
Don't you have something

288
00:25:36,157 --> 00:25:37,397
to do these days?

289
00:25:38,196 --> 00:25:40,216
Your grandfather
entrusted the troops to you

290
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:41,836
to pacify the North Sea.

291
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,557
You don't seem to care about it.

292
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,757
Enough, no more lectures.

293
00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:01,168
ShenLi.

294
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:08,752
ShenLi.

295
00:26:09,557 --> 00:26:11,716
If you hadn't run away

296
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:13,557
at the very beginning

297
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:15,157
and had just married me,

298
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,797
would you be less suffering right now?

299
00:26:20,016 --> 00:26:21,040
No way.

300
00:26:21,677 --> 00:26:23,436
First, I'm not suffering now.

301
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:25,136
Secondly,

302
00:26:25,637 --> 00:26:27,997
you've been idling
for too long that you dare to

303
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:30,596
make such a reckless assumption.

304
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:39,557
I see.

305
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:40,597
Being your buddy

306
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:41,637
is easier than marrying you.

307
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:43,664
I'll leave the book here.

308
00:26:43,664 --> 00:26:44,688
Enjoy.

309
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,288
I'm off.

00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:56,517
"He assigned Lord Bicang
to Furong out of jealousy."

311
00:26:57,557 --> 00:26:58,917
What a mess.

312
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:10,877
It's almost

313
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:12,976
been a year.

314
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:15,316
The world changes.

315
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:17,196
How time flies.

316
00:27:45,517 --> 00:27:46,608
Who is it?

317
00:27:47,728 --> 00:27:48,752
Slacking off again?

318
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:50,768
Have you gained weight again?

319
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:52,037
Stop talking nonsense!

320
00:27:52,956 --> 00:27:54,657
You Diviners are so annoying!

321
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:56,177
So annoying!

322
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:58,397
I'm leaving. Take care of your master.

323
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,276
Of course. I know!

324
00:28:00,276 --> 00:28:01,424
Annoying.

Your traces are still there.

329
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,476
But they are getting fewer.

Lord Furong wrote a book for us.

00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:30,896
I'll read it to you.

375
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,157
♪How I wish to immerse in your fondness♪

376
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:58,163
♪This passion will never fade away♪

377
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:18,117
I told you not to run around.

378
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:19,477
In the blink of an eye,

379
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,617
(Zhou Family Troupe)
Lord Xingzhi emerged,

380
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:23,017
cleansed the miasma,

381
00:33:23,017 --> 00:33:24,596
and killed all the Chimei.

382
00:33:26,877 --> 00:33:28,316
What happened after that?

383
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:31,076
And then he met Lord Bicang.

384
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:34,192
This color suits you.

385
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:36,316
This one?

386
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:37,357
Then I'll get this one.

387
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:38,416
Alright.

388
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:41,037
Here you are. Take care.

389
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:43,557
Wait for me.

390
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,056
So naughty.

391
00:33:48,368 --> 00:33:49,488
Thank you.

392
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:53,168
Here you are.

393
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:25,797
Boatman, shall we go?

394
00:34:26,476 --> 00:34:27,476
Yes, right away.

395
00:34:28,396 --> 00:34:30,437
This is fate.

396
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,697
Fate arrives without reason.

397
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:35,557
And it's hard to force it.

398
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:15,417
Do not get entangled.

399
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:18,396
No more connections from now on.

400
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,944
Hold it.

401
00:35:46,716 --> 00:35:48,757
They came from the Divine Realm again?

402
00:35:50,676 --> 00:35:52,317
They want you back in charge.

403
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:54,897
I've told them.

404
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:55,916
I said that

405
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,476
you are just an ordinary Diviner.

406
00:35:57,997 --> 00:35:59,037
But they wouldn't listen.

407
00:35:59,636 --> 00:36:02,157
Next time, I'll deal with it.

408
00:36:02,157 --> 00:36:03,676
There won't be a next time.

409
00:36:03,676 --> 00:36:05,396
I have offered my spear as a sacrifice.

410
00:36:06,117 --> 00:36:07,757
I'll talk to Furong one day.

411
00:36:08,676 --> 00:36:10,837
No one will come to
our Xingyun Courtyard again.

412
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:13,328
Alright.

413
00:36:14,896 --> 00:36:15,952
Li.

414
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:18,296
You never asked

415
00:36:18,296 --> 00:36:19,636
how I came back.

416
00:36:21,636 --> 00:36:22,636
Aren't you curious?

417
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,136
Of course I am.

418
00:36:26,676 --> 00:36:27,856
But I don't dare to ask.

419
00:36:28,837 --> 00:36:29,936
Why not?

420
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:32,396
What should I do

421
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:34,117
if I asked and found out

422
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:36,368
this was all a dream?

423
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:39,277
Do the ancestral gods'

424
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:42,037
spiritual tablets

425
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:44,597
in the Western Garden

426
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:46,864
still have a golden light?

427
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:50,597
I went to clean up.

428
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:53,168
The light is gone.

429
00:36:55,517 --> 00:36:56,528
Could it be...

430
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,236
My old friends used

431
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:01,857
their last bit of strength

432
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:03,117
to save me from

433
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:05,136
the Natural Law.

434
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:07,917
This experience of life and death

435
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,277
made me realize

436
00:37:10,277 --> 00:37:11,977
why the Natural Law

437
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:13,476
gave the ancient gods human forms.

438
00:37:14,156 --> 00:37:15,184
Why?

439
00:37:15,837 --> 00:37:16,880
Because it wants

440
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:19,436
the ancient gods to make mistakes

441
00:37:20,636 --> 00:37:21,916
and lose their divinity

442
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:24,597
for human nature to emerge.

443
00:37:26,837 --> 00:37:27,916
The disappearance of gods

444
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,128
is the will of heaven.

445
00:37:32,357 --> 00:37:33,677
I'm certainly not

446
00:37:33,677 --> 00:37:35,037
as powerful as I was before.

447
00:37:36,956 --> 00:37:38,000
Don't you mind it?

448
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,357
Of course not.

449
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:41,757
I fell in love with

450
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,357
a sickly mortal in the first place.

451
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:47,037
We're just back to square one.

452
00:38:28,277 --> 00:38:29,328
ShenLi.

453
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:34,156
I think you still owe me two wishes.

454
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:37,904
By the East Sea.

455
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:40,784
What are your wishes?

456
00:38:41,476 --> 00:38:42,576
The first wish is

457
00:38:43,597 --> 00:38:45,357
that you'll pick grapes for me

458
00:38:46,277 --> 00:38:47,517
every summer from now on.

459
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:49,200
That's easy.

460
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:51,077
As for the second wish...

461
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,916
Are you making two wishes today?

462
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,357
Yeah, because the second wish

463
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,196
will take a very long time to fulfill.
