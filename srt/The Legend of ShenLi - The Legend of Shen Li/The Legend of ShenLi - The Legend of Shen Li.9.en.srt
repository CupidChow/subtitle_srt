00:01:36,004 --> 00:01:39,296
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:47,887
Your Excellency,
I'd like to be your guide.

4
00:01:55,328 --> 00:01:56,807
I just want her to do it.

5
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:12,992
Thank you in advance

6
00:02:17,727 --> 00:02:19,248
for the next three days.

7
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:29,472
So it's settled.

8
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:14,624
Your Lordship.

9
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:26,464
Stop. Forget it.

10
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:35,208
Oh, no, it's time
to clean Her Lordship's room.

11
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,792
(Military Camp outside the Xutian Abyss,
Immortal Realm)

12
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:56,288
You said that 1,000 years ago,
you left four items here

13
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,007
as the secondary seal
for the Xutian Abyss.

14
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:00,256
But the soldiers patrolling the area

15
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,668
do not know about them.

16
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:04,768
Do you still remember
where they were placed?

17
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:09,488
Of course, one is on the mountaintop,
one is at the bottom of the lake,

18
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:11,776
and the remaining two...

19
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:14,880
Try moving.

20
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:26,448
For such an injury,

21
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:28,568
it would take at least
half a month to recover before.

22
00:04:29,448 --> 00:04:32,047
But you healed me in just three days.

23
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,647
Now it's almost fine.

24
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:40,128
What's up?

25
00:04:43,128 --> 00:04:46,207
I didn't expect someone
as powerful as you to be shy.

26
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,128
I just want to check

27
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:51,888
whether the small joints
of your left pinky finger are okay.

28
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:58,448
Just squeeze my hand firmly.

29
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,128
Any discomfort?

30
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:08,367
No, I'm afraid I will crush it
if I apply too much force.

31
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:11,487
Feel free to do it.

32
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:13,632
You can't break my hand.

33
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:17,216
(Right, the one sitting before me)

34
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,248
(is Lord Xingzhi
from the Extranatural Heaven,)

35
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:21,288
(who's immortal,)

36
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:24,096
(not like that mortal Xingyun)

37
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,444
(who could be killed with just a pinch.)

38
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,568
(Though I know they are
two different people,)

39
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,367
(it is really too hard
to control my thoughts.)

40
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,487
Alright, you've recovered quite well.

41
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:52,192
So,

42
00:05:52,964 --> 00:05:56,320
could you take me around this afternoon?

43
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,388
Afternoon?

44
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,432
Evening is fine too.

45
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:03,227
No, let's stick to the afternoon.

46
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,256
Okay.

47
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:40,088
There is only one high mountain
on the south of the camp.

48
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,487
Though it's of little use now,

49
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:43,328
for hundreds of years,

50
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:45,732
it had kept the miasma at bay.

51
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:50,327
Today we came out late,

52
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:52,647
so we can't go to places with lakes.

53
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,207
Let's head to the forest here.

54
00:06:59,688 --> 00:07:00,704
Wait for me.

55
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:22,647
(He walks so slowly.)

56
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,376
Let's go.

57
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,728
Let's go to the forest.

58
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,344
Okay.

59
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:44,727
This place is close to the camp,
but far from the Xutian Abyss.

60
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:46,967
The soldiers are not
familiar with this area.

61
00:08:47,648 --> 00:08:49,607
That's why the map
only goes halfway up the mountain.

62
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,008
There is pervasive miasma here.

63
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:55,927
If you fly, you won't be able
to find a place to land.

64
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,967
So we'll have to find
our own way up the mountain.

65
00:09:02,248 --> 00:09:03,264
Your Excellency.

66
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:08,576
Lord Xingzhi.

67
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:13,328
Is he lost again?

68
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,448
Which direction should we go?

69
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,240
This way.

70
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,568
So annoying. Go away.

71
00:10:39,128 --> 00:10:41,328
It has been infected with miasma.

72
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,232
I just burn it.

73
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:50,568
Many things in this mountain

74
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:52,128
have changed due to the miasma.

75
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:55,888
It won't bite.

76
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,828
Even ordinary people can handle it.

77
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:59,768
It's not easy to live in this mountain.

78
00:11:00,407 --> 00:11:04,368
Since it didn't do anything wrong,

79
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,440
killing it is unjust.

80
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,108
It should be punished

81
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,124
only after it has actually done
something wrong.

82
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:17,927
As for me,

83
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,876
I rather like

84
00:11:20,896 --> 00:11:23,607
to manage it before issues escalate.

85
00:11:30,407 --> 00:11:33,927
If so, life would be too boring.

86
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:39,360
It's already quite boring.

87
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:07,648
Let's move on.

88
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:40,568
Taking a leisurely walk

89
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,248
in the moonlight has its own pleasure.

90
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,088
Lord Bicang, don't be so anxious.

91
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:08,648
It's rare to see such moonlight
in the Xutian Abyss.

92
00:13:11,487 --> 00:13:12,512
We've reached the mountaintop.

93
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,232
It's been hard work.

94
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:37,807
It's a blessing for us
to receive His Excellency's grace.

95
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:04,128
The power of ancient gods.

96
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,607
Look, the moon has come out.

97
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:11,328
It's a blessing for us
to receive His Excellency's grace.

98
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:13,088
The miasma has dissipated.

99
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:14,328
I haven't seen the moon for ages.

100
00:16:23,688 --> 00:16:27,167
(After setting off in the afternoon,
he drew the seal on the mountain,)

101
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,128
(used the power of the moonlight
to clear the miasma from the mountain,)

102
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:33,208
(and awakened the sealed things.)

103
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:37,528
(He had such thorough arrangements,
but he did not reveal a bit.)

104
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:43,167
(He had planned it out
from the very start.)

105
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:48,384
Lord Bicang.

106
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:58,847
Look, this is a leaf grown
in the Xutian Abyss.

107
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,407
A leaf in the Xutian Abyss.

108
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,888
These green leaves
are really full of vitality.

109
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,552
It would be great

110
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:19,408
if the children nearby could see
such leaves in the future.

111
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,207
Would you like to sit up in the tree?

112
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:34,144
May I?

113
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:38,080
It won't break, will it?

114
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:49,447
If it breaks, I will make one again.

115
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:43,967

Mofang. What are you doing there?
Take it.

136
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:40,544
What are you looking at?

137
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,016
Why is this so light?

138
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,087
Don't you have injuries?

139
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:54,487
I diluted it with some water for you.

140
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,536
Do you think Lord Xingzhi

141
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:08,516
bullied Her Lordship?

142
00:22:12,327 --> 00:22:14,847
His Excellency does seem a bit odd.

143
00:22:15,727 --> 00:22:19,008
But think about that refreshing spirit.

144
00:22:19,008 --> 00:22:21,727
If it had been us
who went with His Excellency,

145
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:25,447
we'd probably have got weak knees.

146
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,160
I understand.

147
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:31,248
I couldn't get it before,

148
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,808
but now I see the moonlight

149
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:35,928
and feel this gentle breeze,

150
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:41,648
so I understand Xingzhi, but...

151
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,788
The moon has come out.

152
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:47,847
The matter should be finished.
How come the two haven't come back yet?

153
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:58,607
Be tactful. Don't be so blunt.

154
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:01,447
What exactly do you like
about Her Lordship?

155
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,056
What do I like?

156
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:25,847
I like everything about her.

157
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:36,160
They're back.

158
00:23:48,087 --> 00:23:49,408
Oh, no.

159
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:55,728
Thank you for restoring the Forest Seal.

160
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:56,768
It's nothing.

161
00:23:58,864 --> 00:24:01,088
Did you know before Her Lordship
was brought back by Her Holiness,

162
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:03,588
she once fell for a mortal?

163
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:05,468
Really? That's something new.

164
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:08,668
Her Holiness,
Generals Qingyan and Chirong,

165
00:24:08,668 --> 00:24:10,908
and many other generals went together
to corner Her Lordship.

166
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,408
My great-uncle was there too.

167
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,616
I heard that before leaving,

168
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,892
Her Lordship even kissed that mortal.

169
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:20,288
For real?

170
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:22,048
Her Lordship, Lord Bicang?

171
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,328
Right.

172
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:25,607
My great-uncle saw it with his own eyes.

173
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:27,847
How could I lie to you?

174
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:29,727
I never knew that side of Her Lordship.

175
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:34,112
I've also heard that His Excellency

176
00:24:34,112 --> 00:24:36,048
resembles that mortal.

177
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:37,152
What are you talking about?

178
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:40,267
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

179
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:41,408
You're in such high spirits.

180
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:45,152
My feet

181
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:46,248
started moving on their own.

182
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:48,248
Run a few laps.
Don't come back until dawn breaks.

183
00:24:49,136 --> 00:24:50,336
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

184
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:58,367
I didn't expect your soldiers
to be so fond of gossip.

185
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:00,800
Sorry about that.

186
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:29,824
Someday I will definitely play
some music for you.

187
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:30,848
Just wait.

188
00:25:31,528 --> 00:25:32,576
Alright, I will.

189
00:25:40,576 --> 00:25:41,628
Mofang.

190
00:25:41,628 --> 00:25:42,656
Your Lordship.

191
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:47,168
Her Holiness is not aware
of my outing this time.

192
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:50,648
Why don't you go back
and report it to Her Holiness,

193
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:53,408
and also take the opportunity
to heal your wounds?

194
00:25:55,327 --> 00:25:56,447
You want me away, Your Lordship?

195
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:03,128
Understood.

196
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,327
Your injuries...

197
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:09,528
(Forget it. I'd better not be
too kind to him.)

198
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,512
Be careful on your way back.

199
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,728
Your Lordship, you needn't worry about

200
00:26:25,728 --> 00:26:26,756
what I said before.

201
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,168
I'll regulate my feelings.

202
00:26:30,648 --> 00:26:35,447
Please maintain your composure
despite their striking resemblance.

203
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:41,056
I know.

204
00:26:54,207 --> 00:26:56,788
Your Holiness,
word from the Xutian Abyss.

205
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:58,544
The Scorpion-Tailed Fox
was killed by Lord Bicang.

206
00:26:58,912 --> 00:26:59,948
How is Li?

207
00:26:59,948 --> 00:27:01,928
Her Lordship was hurt,
but it was not serious.

208
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:05,428
And Lord Xingzhi
went to the Xutian Abyss.

209
00:27:05,428 --> 00:27:06,848
His Excellency is currently restoring

210
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:09,087
the seal of the Xutian Abyss
under the guidance of Her Lordship.

211
00:27:09,808 --> 00:27:12,868
Lord Xingzhi has been elusive
for 1,000 years.

212
00:27:12,868 --> 00:27:13,952
And he has now arrived.

213
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,008
I guess His Excellency
still cares about the matter of Chimei.

214
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:20,640
The two of you may leave.

215
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:22,688
- Yes.
- Yes.

216
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:35,264
I'm leaving, Your Lordship.

217
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,940
(Throughout these thousands of years,)

218
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,487
(it has been hard to meet
someone who likes me)

219
00:27:47,327 --> 00:27:48,727
(and has the courage to confess.)

220
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:52,087
(It just happened at the wrong time.)

221
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:54,288
(If I fell for someone,)

222
00:27:55,128 --> 00:27:57,087
(I would surely give him my all.)

223
00:27:58,288 --> 00:27:59,648
(Although the future is uncertain,)

224
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:02,447
(currently, I'm still
in love with someone.)

225
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:04,967
(Even though he is dead,)

226
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:07,847
(I cannot like someone else.)

227
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:11,628
(Because doing so would
betray my previous feelings)

228
00:28:11,628 --> 00:28:13,528
(and it'd also be unfair
to the affections of others.)

229
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:15,528
(And Furong still bothers me.)

230
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,528
(Forget it.)

231
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:22,528
(Today, I shall take Lord Xingzhi
to restore another seal.)

232
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:25,367
(The air outside the Xutian Abyss
will become better.)

233
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,248
(It will make the soldiers happier too.)

234
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:30,752
(It's been ages)

235
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,687
(since I was this eager
to do something.)

236
00:29:07,648 --> 00:29:08,768
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

237
00:29:45,207 --> 00:29:46,687
Do you realize what time it is?

238
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:52,048
Did you blow the leaf?

239
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,607
Down to business, among the two seals
you mentioned yesterday,

240
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:31,327
we have visited the Forest Seal.

241
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,048
We'll go to the Water Seal in the lake.

242
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:35,207
There is only a lake to the west.

243
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:41,008
Yesterday, the miasma
was cleared from the mountaintop.

244
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:45,447
Now it is clear. We just need
to ride the clouds there.

245
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,248
Let's go. Don't be late.

246
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:03,728
Your Lordship, please wait. Her Holiness
is using the Distant Shadow technique

247
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,408
and wants to see Lord Xingzhi
for a moment.

248
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:07,687
Distant Shadow. Her Holiness is injured.

249
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,487
Please hurry, Your Excellency.

250
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:24,287
Your Holiness, as you are unwell,

251
00:31:24,287 --> 00:31:26,567
you should not exhaust yourself
by using Distant Shadow technique.

252
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:33,727
This is Lord Xingzhi.

253
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:41,128
I'm sorry for not greeting you

254
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,808
when you came to the Immortal Realm.

255
00:31:44,607 --> 00:31:48,008
It's fine. My arrival was quite sudden.

256
00:31:48,687 --> 00:31:49,888
I am unwell,

257
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:52,967
so I can't go
to the Xutian Abyss to see you.

258
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,468
Please forgive me.

259
00:31:55,468 --> 00:31:59,487
You're too polite. Lord Bicang
has already conveyed your regards.

260
00:32:02,168 --> 00:32:03,487
Thank you for your understanding.

261
00:32:04,768 --> 00:32:06,408
You might not know

262
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,928
Lord Bicang has left her mansion
on her own for several days.

263
00:32:11,248 --> 00:32:14,327
She should return
to the Capital City now.

264
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:17,768
That's bad news.

265
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:21,327
Lord Bicang is currently
helping me with a favor.

266
00:32:25,087 --> 00:32:26,567
Would you mind me

267
00:32:27,607 --> 00:32:30,888
sending another general to assist you?

268
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:34,327
No, but...

269
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,392
Your Holiness.

270
00:32:37,928 --> 00:32:39,068
I cannot return yet.

271
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,567
This is an order.

272
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:44,168
Your Holiness, I've already agreed
to guide His Excellency.

273
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:45,408
I will keep my word.

274
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:47,327
Nonsense.

275
00:32:47,327 --> 00:32:50,188
Your Holiness, I know
what you're worried about.

276
00:32:50,188 --> 00:32:52,288
Here, I promise

277
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:55,207
after this matter is settled,
I'll return as soon as possible.

278
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:58,928
Since Lord Bicang insists on helping me,

279
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,408
it will not be proper for me to decline.

280
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,327
If you trust me,

281
00:33:04,888 --> 00:33:06,568
once the matter here is concluded,

282
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:10,008
I will personally escort
Lord Bicang back to the Capital City.

283
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:13,447
You don't need to worry.

284
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,367
No, you don't have to.

285
00:33:18,607 --> 00:33:19,687
I'll still take ShenLi...

286
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:25,447
Are you unwilling
to keep Lord Bicang here?

287
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:42,408
Since it is your request,
I will keep her here.

288
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,768
Once this matter is settled, you...

289
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:47,928
I will return as soon as I can.

290
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:56,288
Lord Bicang, it seems that Her Holiness

291
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:58,768
really does not want you
to assist me here.

292
00:34:01,168 --> 00:34:02,687
Let's go to the Water Seal.

293
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:15,447
You just used
the Distant Shadow technique.

294
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,048
It consumes a lot of energy.

295
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:20,008
You're still unwell.

296
00:34:22,288 --> 00:34:23,360
It does not matter.

297
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:29,848
You two, go outside the Xutian Abyss
and follow ShenLi.

298
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:32,848
Before she returns,

299
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,687
she must not be alone with Lord Xingzhi.

300
00:34:36,687 --> 00:34:37,768
- Yes.
- Yes.

301
00:34:40,808 --> 00:34:41,856
Wait.

302
00:34:47,088 --> 00:34:48,088
Don't go.

303
00:34:50,927 --> 00:34:52,008
You don't need to go now.

304
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,048
Have someone
watch over the Xutian Abyss.

305
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,808
Report to me immediately
if anything is wrong.

306
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:00,864
- Yes.
- Yes.

307
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:24,127
What's wrong? Let's go.

308
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:26,207
Her Holiness seemed a bit strange.

309
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:30,667
Is that something you need to point out?
Anyone can see it.

310
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:34,167
It seems Her Holiness doesn't want
the two of them to act together

311
00:35:34,808 --> 00:35:37,407
(To the Heavenly Lord)
and is even very wary of Lord Xingzhi.

312
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:41,687
I've heard before creating
Chimei, the previous Her Holiness

313
00:35:42,368 --> 00:35:44,768
was also very wary of the ancient gods.

314
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,927
If you were heard by others,
you'd have you beheaded.

315
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:49,967
Don't say I didn't warn you.

316
00:35:51,927 --> 00:35:54,048
Don't meddle in Her Holiness's affairs.

317
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:55,936
Let's go, brother.

318
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,276
(Please tell me if Lord Xingzhi descended
to lower realms a few months ago?)

319
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,588
Let's go in the water.

320
00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:18,656
What?

321
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:26,088
The soldiers never do it
during their regular patrols.

322
00:36:28,207 --> 00:36:29,328
I don't have a map of the area.

323
00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:31,848
I won't find the way and can't help you.

324
00:36:32,647 --> 00:36:35,927
If you want to go in it, do it yourself.

325
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:37,788
I'll wait on the shore.

326
00:36:37,788 --> 00:36:39,248
Can you swim?

327
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:41,472
No.

328
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:45,760
The water-repelling spell?

329
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:47,936
I can't either.

330
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,336
Are you afraid of water?

331
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:57,248
Are you afraid?

332
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:02,016
You are.

333
00:37:07,568 --> 00:37:10,207
In that case, I'll lead you
by holding your hand.

334
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:15,808
You can go in the water on your own.
I shall not go.

335
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:57,687
Why are you so nervous?

336
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,088
Just breathe as if you are on land.

337
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:08,088
Am I not doing well
with the water-repelling spell?

338
00:38:15,368 --> 00:38:16,384
Relax.

339
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:20,448
You!

340
00:38:33,808 --> 00:38:36,848
Let go of me! You are unreasonable.

341
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:40,447
Once you let go of me,
the spell will become ineffective.

342
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:43,048
Then you'd be in trouble.

343
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:54,768
What's the point
of dragging me into the water?

344
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:56,608
Let me up.

345
00:39:00,248 --> 00:39:03,407
Because I'm a bit scared on my own.

346
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,848
You've lived for ages

347
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:36,927
and been through a lot.

348
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:40,927
Are you telling me you're afraid of
just this pond of water?

349
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:43,328
You must be joking with me.

350
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:03,808
(He must have had a plan.)

351
00:40:05,127 --> 00:40:06,687
(He took me in the water for a reason.)

352
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,528
Nothing happened on the way here.

353
00:40:14,207 --> 00:40:15,232
We've arrived.

354
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:51,887
It seems trickier than I imagined.

355
00:41:14,447 --> 00:41:16,808
Get up. Time to work.

356
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,280
♪Snow scatters
across the heavens and earth♪

357
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:52,472
♪The dazzling light
envelopes the city with hope♪
