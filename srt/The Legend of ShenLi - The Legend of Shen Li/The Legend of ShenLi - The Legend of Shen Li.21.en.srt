1
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,204
=Episode 21=

3
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:07,511
(His cooking techniques)

4
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:08,650
(haven't changed at all.)

5
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,690
(That's not his room,)

6
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,210
(but I often see him coming out of it.)

7
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,592
Do you

8
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,811
like the dishes?

9
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,690
Is your wound healing?

10
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:58,512
If you are bored,

11
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,210
play with the White Spirit Divine Beast.

12
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,731
It won't hurt you again.

13
00:03:08,811 --> 00:03:11,410
I have so much to tell you,

14
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:18,011
but I shouldn't.

15
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:24,171
And you won't give me the chance.

16
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,251
So this is how it feels

17
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,570
to be caught in the middle.

18
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,030
(Could there be)

19
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,770
(some rare treasure in that room?)

20
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,931
(God, Qingye.)

21
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,331
(God, Luoxing.)

22
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,690
(God, Guanyue.)

23
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,690
(So this is where)

24
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:39,731
(the ancient gods are enshrined.)

25
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,810
Greetings, Your Excellencies.

26
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:55,536
(God, Qianji)

27
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,352
Qianji?

28
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:28,810
A new God was born.

29
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:30,832
Any bestowed names?

30
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,632
(Extranatural Heaven, Qianji)
Natural Law named him Xingzhi.

31
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:37,648
Xingzhi?

32
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,144
Good name.

33
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:43,056
What is his mission?

34
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:44,970
It's really strange.

35
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,250
Natural Law didn't give
any divine revelation.

36
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:29,040
Little Xingzhi.

37
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:31,970
I'm the ancient god Qingye.

38
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:35,531
From now on, we are family
in the Extranatural Heaven.

39
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,464
Xingzhi?

40
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:44,851
This is Xingzhi as he was just born.

41
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,144
These are

42
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,370
memories left by ancient gods.

43
00:08:53,744 --> 00:08:54,768
Is there more?

44
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:07,408
Xingzhi.

45
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,731
It's just a divination contest.

46
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:11,291
It's not so shameful to lose to Qingye

47
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,424
by a single vote.

48
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,490
By a single vote?

49
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:17,771
So who did you vote for?

50
00:09:20,891 --> 00:09:22,691
What would you do if I didn't

51
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:23,824
vote for you?

52
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,528
Let me show you something.

53
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,728
What is it?

54
00:09:34,091 --> 00:09:35,331
Go wash up.

55
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:45,904
Xingzhi.

56
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,831
Little Xingzhi. So naughty.

57
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:51,920
Come on.

58
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:54,832
Childish.

59
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,688
Is there more?

60
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,530
(The ancient gods must be enshrined)

61
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,011
(somewhere of utmost tranquility.)

62
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:08,891
(Is it really fine to set up)

63
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,971
(such an important place)

64
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,848
(in a random room?)

65
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,011
(Life has been easy on the Diviners.)

66
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,771
(They should at least set up a barrier.)

67
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,291
You can't just come in here.

68
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,011
Haven't I told you before?

69
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,671
I can leave right now.

70
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,752
It's too late.

71
00:10:53,136 --> 00:10:54,170
It's not a big deal.

72
00:10:55,152 --> 00:10:56,208
Now that you're here,

73
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:57,930
let's pay respects.

74
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,651
Nobody has come

75
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,730
to visit them in a while.

76
00:11:37,331 --> 00:11:38,331
It's the same as

77
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:39,952
the Extranatural Heaven.

78
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:41,971
They usually

79
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:43,490
stay put in the formations

80
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:45,136
of constellations.

81
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,291
I think they roamed around

82
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:49,130
because you came here.

83
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:50,771
They look happy.

84
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,730
(He is really happy now.)

85
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:21,011
(What I see are the names
inscribed on the tablets.)

86
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,090
(But Xingzhi sees)

87
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,610
(his former friends)

88
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,730
(who can never return.)

89
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,291
(He has lived forever.)

90
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,131
(No one knows exactly)

91
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:33,651
(how many years he has lived.)

92
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,171
- (He is revered as a God,)
- Easy.

93
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,411
(receiving the highest honor,)

94
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,211
(residing amongst the vast stars)

95
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,750
(in the Extranatural Heaven,)

96
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,930
(and watching over the world.)

97
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,370
(But no one can keep him company.)

98
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,130
(He stands too high,)

99
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:51,291
(beyond anyone's reach.)

100
00:13:28,651 --> 00:13:29,651
Do you feel lonely?

101
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,160
Why would you ask that?

102
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,451
I don't know how you feel.

103
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:42,891
But if one day,

104
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,771
Her Holiness, Rouya,

105
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:47,851
my generals and subordinates

106
00:13:50,451 --> 00:13:52,050
end up as memorial tablets,

107
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:54,640
and I have to

108
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,730
guard the empty Immortal Realm alone,

109
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,651
I surely won't make it.

110
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,528
You'll get used to it.

111
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,730
I shoulder heavy responsibilities.

112
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:09,891
Be the loneliness

113
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:10,960
or life and death,

114
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,211
it's beyond my control.

115
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,311
Shouldn't

116
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:16,911
the ancient gods have everything

117
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:18,050
under control?

118
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:21,040
One might say so.

119
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:24,570
But I am the exception.

120
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,370
With such great power, a God shall not

121
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,771
be swayed by emotions.

122
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,272
I believe

123
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,640
you know that.

124
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,651
Besides, life and death

125
00:14:41,331 --> 00:14:42,651
are beyond my control

126
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,810
until it comes to the day
when my life ends,

127
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:48,951
and I shall return

128
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:50,170
to nature forever.

129
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,291
Otherwise, I can't die.

130
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:55,331
The day your life ends?

131
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,851
Even ancient gods can die?

132
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,808
Of course.

133
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,651
Everything that lives

134
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,690
must also perish.

135
00:15:07,952 --> 00:15:09,008
Although

136
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,810
my lifespan is long,

137
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,891
when my life ends,

138
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,130
I will follow the Natural Law

139
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,451
and become energy
between heaven and earth

140
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,091
to merge into nature.

141
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:22,411
My form may perish,

142
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:24,091
but my divine power

143
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:27,331
remains to keep guarding all creations.

144
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,752
So you're saying

145
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,490
that these gods

146
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:37,810
all met their end

147
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:41,211
and became energy within the cosmos?

148
00:15:52,432 --> 00:15:53,488
Among them,

149
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:55,216
30% percent

150
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,848
died in due course.

151
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,570
The other 70%

152
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:03,011
encountered mishaps
before their lifespan ended.

153
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:05,331
They broke the Natural Law

154
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,331
and were demoted

155
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,930
and banished

156
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:12,570
into the Mortal Realm
to go through all sorrows.

157
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,451
They lost their divine forms

158
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:17,570
and divine powers.

159
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:19,771
The spells they left

160
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,730
during their lifetime

161
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:25,130
vanished for good.

162
00:16:38,192 --> 00:16:39,250
These memorial tablets

163
00:16:39,891 --> 00:16:41,411
were left by the Natural Law

164
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,490
as a keepsake

165
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,211
for the others out of mercy.

166
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:49,130
And I watched those around me

167
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,370
leave one by one.

168
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,370
The memorial tablets

169
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,971
increased in number here.

170
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,890
In other words,

171
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,231
the gods who followed the Natural Law

172
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,610
could keep
their divine power in the world.

173
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,011
But those gods
stripped of their divinity

174
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,291
would leave nothing behind.

175
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,751
If anything happens to you one day,

176
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:14,850
the Xutian Abyss...

177
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:18,090
The Xutian Abyss

178
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,531
is a space I've torn open.

179
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,576
If I were

180
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,330
stripped of divinity,

181
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,490
and lost divine power
to maintain spells,

182
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,610
it would disappear.

183
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:30,670
Then thousands of

184
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,411
Chimei like Scorpion-Tailed Fox
would escape.

185
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:34,032
It won't happen.

186
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:37,531
They will disappear
along with the Xutian Abyss.

187
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,120
But meanwhile,

188
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,771
the Immortal Realm
will be implicated and fall

189
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:43,590
alongside the abyss.

190
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,656
Why?

191
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:47,850
It's extremely hard

192
00:17:48,691 --> 00:17:49,831
to create

193
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,250
such a vast space

194
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,051
even for a god.

195
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:55,931
So I borrowed

196
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,970
the power of the five elements

197
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,531
and used my divine power

198
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,071
to create the Xutian Abyss.

199
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,051
From that moment on,

200
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,411
the Immoral Realm will

201
00:18:06,411 --> 00:18:07,691
survive or perish

202
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,771
with the Xutian Abyss.

203
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:10,931
How could you do something

204
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:12,531
that could endanger my peer?

205
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,350
Our realm suffers if anything

206
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,891
happens to the Xutian Abyss.

207
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,411
If I hadn't done so,

208
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,571
your realm would have ceased to exist.

209
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:30,096
I know.

210
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,250
To gain certain benefits in a battle,

211
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:35,130
we must make sacrifices.

212
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:38,051
But such sacrifices...

213
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,610
Nothing shall happen to you.

214
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,011
Absolutely nothing.

215
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:51,771
You must live long
and die in due course.

216
00:18:55,472 --> 00:18:56,528
Of course.

217
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:58,192
Moreover,

218
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,090
I'm the only god left

219
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,000
in the Extranatural Heaven.

220
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:04,411
I'm maintaining this place

221
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:06,610
with my divine power alone.

222
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,610
If I were no longer here,

223
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,811
the Extranatural Heaven

224
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,520
would collapse.

225
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:15,471
Stars would fall,

226
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:17,291
all crashing upon the world.

227
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,071
It would surely endanger

228
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,571
all the living creatures.

229
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:33,291
There is only one god left
in the Three Realms.

230
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:35,891
No one can bear the cost of losing him.

231
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:40,210
(Youlan was right.)

232
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,411
(Nothing should happen to Xingzhi.)

233
00:19:43,771 --> 00:19:45,691
(No one can bear
the cost of losing him.)

234
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,571
(Because he is no longer himself.)

235
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:51,811
(Such a heavy responsibility)

236
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,291
(is truly difficult to bear.)

237
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:06,896
Therefore,

238
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,600
ShenLi,

239
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,248
I can't fall in love with you.

240
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,250
Stop kidding.

241
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,392
How dare I still

242
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,171
fantasize about you at this point?

243
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:43,171
So please

244
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:45,291
stop teasing me every now and then.

245
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,616
But I can't control it.

246
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,531
I can't control

247
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:58,960
the urge to tease you.

248
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:02,576
(This guy...)

249
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,360
What do you mean?

250
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,490
You said you couldn't
afford to fall in love.

251
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,291
But you're also

252
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,370
saying that to lure me.

253
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,931
You pushed me away and pulled me back.

254
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:17,840
Are you sick in the head?

255
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,560
I guess

256
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,440
I am a bit sick.

257
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:30,811
(Is that a confession?)

258
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,771
(He was so ambiguous.)

259
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:37,330
(But the meaning was so clear.)

260
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,651
(He should contain himself.)

261
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,130
(But he said he couldn't do it.)

262
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,592
(Then...)

263
00:21:44,592 --> 00:21:45,744
In that case,

264
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:50,691
I will surely cure you.

265
00:21:52,051 --> 00:21:53,970
It's not something I can control alone.

266
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,144
But I have no choice.

267
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,691
A god entrusted
with heavy responsibilities

268
00:21:58,691 --> 00:21:59,891
is acting like a hooligan.

269
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,576
Then let me handle it.

270
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,011
I can sever any tie.

271
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,850
I appreciate it.

272
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:14,704
I hope you can

273
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,531
treat the problem
rather than the symptoms.

274
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:19,210
I won't let you down.

275
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:24,656
Your Lordship,

276
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:27,330
I have one more favor to ask.

277
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,330
I don't know

278
00:22:33,171 --> 00:22:34,291
how much longer I can live.

279
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,811
If my divine form

280
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,931
dissipates one day,

281
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,090
leaving behind a tablet,

282
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:44,651
I hope that you can

283
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:47,651
come to visit me in your free time.

284
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,851
Why me?

285
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,040
Because

286
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:56,720
you found this place.

287
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:08,490
Your Excellency will live long.

288
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,610
I may not be alive then.

289
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,610
If even you were gone by then,

290
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,691
then this desolate world

291
00:23:19,891 --> 00:23:21,011
would be rather

292
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:22,931
too cruel to me.

293
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,171
(I know very well)

294
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,130
(that memories don't last long.)

295
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,304
Once that day comes,

296
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,288
I hope she can

297
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,171
come to see me

298
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:45,968
often.

299
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,610
She'll remember me a bit longer.

300
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:56,400
If she

301
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,771
forgot about me in no time,

302
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:04,051
how lonely I would be.

303
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,728
♪Under the same starry sky♪

304
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:09,456
♪I return with my wishes♪

305
00:24:09,456 --> 00:24:13,712
♪Soaring through the azure seas and sky♪

306
00:24:19,651 --> 00:24:20,891
I don't believe I'll starve

307
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,090
in this vast Divine Realm.

308
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:50,171
Their peach is not so big.

309
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,550
Indeed, our peaches are not big.

310
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,651
But they are sweet.

311
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,490
Try one if you don't believe me.

312
00:25:00,571 --> 00:25:02,850
So I can eat as much as I like?

313
00:25:08,336 --> 00:25:09,456
Help yourself.

314
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,931
(What on earth does she want?)

315
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,210
(Is she hoping
I could choke on the peaches?)

316
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,811
(Or will she frame me
for stealing these?)

317
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,651
Youlan said I could have it.

318
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:31,632
I'm not stealing it, huh?

319
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,351
Please don't say that.

320
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,391
Feel free to take it

321
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:35,504
since you're allowed.

322
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:21,891
The wine in the Divine Realm

323
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,291
is a bit too strong.

324
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:43,011
(Oh no, the Hundred Flowers Banquet
has started.)

325
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,011
(I'm representing the Immortals.)

326
00:26:45,651 --> 00:26:47,130
(It's a disgrace to be late.)

327
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,850
(He didn't wake me up.)

328
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,352
Forget it.

329
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,130
Don't think of him even as my roommate.

330
00:27:21,051 --> 00:27:22,051
Already feasting.

331
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:30,610
You rarely attend
the Hundred Flowers Banquet.

332
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,011
Please take a seat.

333
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,531
The white jade chair is cold.

334
00:28:36,112 --> 00:28:37,171
I'd rather not sit.

335
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:38,970
Since when do you fear the cold?

336
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,064
Come on.

337
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,171
Look, whose carriage is that?

338
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,330
It looks amazing.

339
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,051
I don't know, but it's really pretty.

340
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:19,051
What is this? So impressive.

341
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,350
- Be careful.
- What's wrong?

342
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,490
- What's that power?
- No idea.

343
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,791
- What's happening?
- What's that?

344
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,904
What's going on here?

345
00:30:20,691 --> 00:30:22,171
Powerful fireballs!

346
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,730
(If I weren't a phoenix,)

347
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,670
(I'd have been burned to ashes)

348
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,771
(under such pressure.)

349
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:29,648
Report!

350
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,391
Heavenly Lord, there's a fire attack
at the Western Garden.

351
00:30:34,391 --> 00:30:35,451
It's on fire.

352
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:36,464
Western Garden?

353
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,571
It enshrines the ancient gods' tablets.

354
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,304
Lord Bicang is also there.

355
00:30:41,968 --> 00:30:42,992
Your Excellency...

356
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:44,730
Where did he go?

357
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:46,864
Let's go.

358
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:00,811
(I am here.)

359
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:02,771
(No one shall undermine
the dignity of the gods.)

360
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,970
Xingzhi and those fools.

361
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:12,691
They didn't even

362
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,210
set up a barrier for this place.

363
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:17,008
And it's been so long.

364
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:19,130
Hasn't anyone noticed this?

365
00:31:54,011 --> 00:31:55,351
These idle Diviners

366
00:31:55,351 --> 00:31:56,970
have been living too cozily.

367
00:31:58,171 --> 00:31:59,730
If the Immortals launch an attack,

368
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:02,891
(it won't take us a day)

369
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:04,970
(to defeat these good-for-nothings.)

370
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,672
He threw them back.

371
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:27,891
(Now I get why)

372
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,291
(Gods are not allowed to have feelings.)

373
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:32,330
(If such a great force)

374
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,130
(is used for personal emotions,)

375
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:36,850
(the world will be a mess.)

376
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:48,912
ShenLi.

377
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,408
Do you have a death wish?

378
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:52,976
I won't die.

379
00:33:53,651 --> 00:33:54,768
I'm just

380
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,691
a bit tired.

381
00:33:57,771 --> 00:33:59,371
You exhausted yourself

382
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,571
just for this room.

383
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:02,896
What were you thinking?

384
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,944
I can't let you...

385
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,650
I can't let you lose the keepsakes.

Your Excellency.

395
00:35:02,011 --> 00:35:03,024
Don't come over.

396
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:07,170
I'll take Lord Bicang
for treatment right now.

397
00:35:34,736 --> 00:35:35,824
Compared to

398
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:37,571
His Excellency,

399
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:40,391
Lord Bicang who appears so strong

400
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:41,650
is actually so vulnerable.

401
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:44,771
ShenLi can also be vulnerable.

402
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,711
How dare they attack

403
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:48,930
the Divine Realm?

404
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:50,608
Investigate thoroughly.

405
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:52,688
Understood.

406
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:14,650
Three days have passed.

407
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,011
We've dispatched groups of troops.

408
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:21,371
It was a serious attack.

409
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:23,811
Yet nobody was caught.

410
00:36:24,571 --> 00:36:26,170
It seems that the Diviners

411
00:36:27,091 --> 00:36:29,291
have been complacent for too long.

412
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,930
All of you

413
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:34,291
have become undisciplined.

414
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,250
It's time for a rectification.

415
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:45,136
Heavenly Lord.

416
00:36:48,531 --> 00:36:49,552
Heavenly Lord.

417
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,520
The investigation
has seen some progress.

418
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,611
I'm listening.

419
00:36:54,611 --> 00:36:58,031
We tracked the fireballs
Lord Xingzhi threw back

420
00:36:58,031 --> 00:37:00,611
and discovered traces of the invaders
in the northern corner.

421
00:37:01,584 --> 00:37:02,672
It's just that...

422
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:03,760
What?

423
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,210
It's just that

424
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:09,210
no one was alive when we got there.

425
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:11,971
They were lying there, dead.

426
00:37:11,971 --> 00:37:14,170
And yet it took you
so long to find them.

427
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:15,291
I feel ashamed.

428
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:17,136
Continue.

429
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,371
Who had the guts

430
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,391
to launch an attack

431
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:22,331
on the Divine Realm?

432
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:23,728
The North Sea Clan.

433
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:24,791
The North Sea Clan?

434
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,490
How is that possible?

435
00:37:29,091 --> 00:37:30,170
The North Sea Clan.

436
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:36,890
They have always been gentle-natured.

437
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:40,611
They've never
instigated a war in all ages.

438
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:45,051
There must be a reason why they attacked

439
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,571
the Divine Realm like crazy.

440
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,024
Wuyuan.

441
00:37:51,024 --> 00:37:52,071
Here.

442
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:54,611
Look into it at the North Sea
and return quickly.

443
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,752
Understood.

444
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,431
Furong seems to have

445
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:03,730
put some thought into
where ShenLi is recuperating.

446
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:18,631
Why should I rest
for such a minor injury?

447
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,891
What a waste of time.

448
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:21,008
Let me out.

449
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,450
You're not going anywhere

450
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:26,384
before you recover.

451
00:38:28,851 --> 00:38:30,970
Those fireballs
weren't as fierce as imagined.

452
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:35,410
It's just that I lost my spiritual power

453
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,531
in the Cleansing Pool.

454
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,640
I'm fine now.

455
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:45,351
If the memorial tablets
hadn't emitted energy,

456
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:46,531
and my friends

457
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,890
hadn't protected you with divine power,

458
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,611
you think you could

459
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:53,450
speak to me as you are now?

460
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,736
I see.

461
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,970
The spiritual power
from the tablets protected me.

462
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:14,811
These ancient gods are amazing.

463
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:17,410
They've been reduced to tablets,

464
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:19,811
yet they still protected me.

465
00:39:20,571 --> 00:39:21,851
In that case,

466
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:22,890
please convey

467
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,170
my gratitude the next time

468
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:27,890
you visit them.

469
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,810
Besides, since they protected me,

470
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,371
I should be alright.

471
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,451
I can go out.

472
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:34,544
No.

473
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,091
Why do you keep me locked up?

474
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:49,970
Why do you have to go out?

475
00:39:51,571 --> 00:39:52,851
It's been three days.

476
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,611
You still haven't caught the mastermind.

477
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,650
You sent someone to investigate it.

478
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,611
Let's say they left two days ago.

479
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:01,431
They could have made a dozen trips

480
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:02,931
back and forth to the North Sea.

481
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:04,971
Don't tell me the investigators

482
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:07,011
have fallen into the water
and gotten lost.

483
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,008
What are they doing?

484
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:14,771
The Diviners are taking their time.

485
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:17,051
Why are you in a rush?

486
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,171
I'm going blind if you

487
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:19,210
keep locking me up.

488
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,792
If it were the old days,

489
00:40:23,792 --> 00:40:24,851
I would grab my spear

490
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,371
and wipe out those scoundrels.

491
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,056
The way I see it,

492
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,008
you are infuriated

493
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:34,960
because you got bullied

494
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,210
and want to get even with them.

495
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:40,496
