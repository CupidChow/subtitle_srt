=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,214
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:00,739
Young master, why resist me?

4
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:05,099
I will not lend you my body again.

5
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,579
If it weren't for my power of revival,

6
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:12,779
we'd have long perished in the East Sea,

7
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:16,178
burned to death by ShenLi!

8
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:43,299
Your Lordship.

9
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:48,579
I used all my strength

10
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:51,658
to protect you.

11
00:02:55,098 --> 00:02:57,299
Yet this is how you treat me.

12
00:02:57,898 --> 00:02:59,378
You shouldn't have acted behind my back.

13
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:02,539
You shouldn't have harmed ShenLi.

14
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:03,859
Ridiculous.

15
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:09,658
Have you forgotten

16
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,538
our past?

17
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:58,818
God.

18
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:00,176
Xingzhi.

19
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:07,658
Young Master, remember him.

20
00:04:08,538 --> 00:04:10,258
The ancient god, Xingzhi.

21
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,179
A thousand years ago,

22
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,459
Xingzhi created Xutian Abyss
to trap my master.

23
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:25,019
Had I not rescued the Young Master,

24
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,498
we'd never have seen this day.

25
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:31,859
Young Master was sickly as a child.

26
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:34,098
It was I

27
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:38,759
who nurtured you with my heart blood
for three hundred years,

28
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,818
thus ridding you of your illness.

29
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:44,818
Young Master.

30
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,859
I know

31
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:48,818
that my heart blood has a strong smell.

32
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:51,179
But only by drinking it,

33
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,339
will you get better.

34
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,459
Only then can you open Xutian Abyss

35
00:04:56,778 --> 00:04:58,019
to rescue your father.

36
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,058
Can I rescue my father?

37
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,304
Yes.

38
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:39,619
Come, have a seat.

39
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:40,619
Come.

40
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,539
Let me pour you a drink.

41
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:43,658
Fill it up.

42
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:46,378
Mofang, you must gulp it today.

43
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:49,099
Drink up.

44
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,219
Cheers.

45
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,280
Cheers.

46
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,938
I sent you to join
the Immortal Realm's army

47
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,619
in order to rescue the master.

48
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:07,778
Yet you have repeatedly
sabotaged my plans for ShenLi.

49
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:11,899
If ShenLi marries into the Divine Realm,

50
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:14,938
the Xutian Abyss will
be without a guard.

51
00:06:15,859 --> 00:06:18,319
That gives us an advantage.

52
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,459
Oh, young master,

53
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,218
why did you let her hurt you

54
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,579
to help her elope?

55
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:18,098
The wound caused by the Red Plume Spear

56
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,218
is hard to heal.

57
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,600
Just endure it.

58
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:46,979
Oh, young master,

59
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,378
are you blinded by a romantic affair?

60
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:55,179
We've depended on each other
for so many years.

61
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,938
Is our grand plan

62
00:07:57,938 --> 00:08:00,818
going to be ruined by ShenLi?

63
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:05,139
I told you

64
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:07,579
to stay away from ShenLi.

65
00:08:15,658 --> 00:08:17,258
Why didn't you show this mercy

66
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:21,098
when you left the royal capital?

67
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:24,538
I clearly remember

68
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:32,359
there was a general who tried
to save you from the puppet.

69
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,379
But it was you

70
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:36,538
who killed him with a sword.

71
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:42,299
And your closest comrade.

72
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,499
Stop.

73
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:45,719
- I won't!
- Stop!

74
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,739
- If you have forgotten,
- I told you to stop!

75
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:48,939
I will make you remember.

76
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,098
Stop!

77
00:08:50,098 --> 00:08:51,179
Remember it!

78
00:09:04,656 --> 00:09:05,859
General.

79
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,538
The miasma is too heavy.

80
00:09:07,538 --> 00:09:08,979
- Let's take cover.
- Yeah.

81
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:06,898
You opened the rift in the Xutian Abyss.

82
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:11,338
Congratulations, young master.

83
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,018
Soon,

84
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:15,499
you will rule the world.

85
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,778
But the power is not strong enough.

86
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,538
The one escaped

87
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,218
is a relatively weak one.

88
00:10:57,778 --> 00:10:59,299
You...

89
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,979
Young master, you are Liuming's child.

90
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,138
You've kept it from the Immortal Realm

91
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:09,859
and acted in secret.

92
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,578
What an unfortunate coincidence.

93
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:19,299
He figured it out.

94
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:23,739
You've deceived us for so many years.

95
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:28,819
You know what to do, young master.

96
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:40,619
What are you waiting for?

97
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,979
For him to summon
more people for you to kill?

98
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,578
I have told you

99
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,499
that you mustn't be
soft-hearted and hesitant.

100
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:01,859
Have you forgotten what I taught you?

101
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:04,979
Have you also forgotten

102
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:08,379
who you are?

103
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:17,499
You failed Her Holiness
and Her Lordship.

104
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,979
Now is not the time to make a choice.

105
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:31,619
Fate made choices for you
the moment you were born.

106
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:36,658
You cannot change

107
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,259
the blood in your veins.

108
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:43,819
Your blade

109
00:12:45,859 --> 00:12:48,739
has long been destined
to point in a certain direction.

110
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,419
If he's alive,

111
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,578
you can never return
to the Immortal Realm.

112
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:54,619
Her Holiness's golden seal is useless.

113
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,379
We must find another way.

114
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:11,658
Did General Mofang of the Immortal Realm

115
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:13,778
die today?

116
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:26,658
Since the killing has started,

117
00:15:27,898 --> 00:15:29,138
we can't stop now.

118
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,632
ShenLi...

119
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:40,338
I've said it before,

120
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:42,192
ShenLi must not be harmed.

121
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:59,504
Young Master,

122
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:02,658
that's no longer up to you.

123
00:16:22,499 --> 00:16:23,760
Young Master,

124
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:26,739
you should rest for a few days.

125
00:16:43,338 --> 00:16:44,592
Young Master,

126
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:48,698
do you remember it now?

127
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,179
And how did you deceive ShenLi?

128
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,499
You've done

129
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:04,739
so many things

130
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:08,698
and kept them hidden.

131
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,698
You can't turn back anymore!

132
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,218
Alright, Young Master.

133
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:02,298
Since you are so stubborn,

134
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:06,298
since you have lost your resolve,

135
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:12,218
this body that I've revived for you

136
00:18:14,979 --> 00:18:20,859
might as well be put to use for me.

137
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,539
(My inside is empty,)

138
00:19:45,578 --> 00:19:46,818
(without a trace of spiritual power.)

139
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:50,098
(I'm like a mortal
who has never cultivated.)

140
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,458
The one inside woke up.

141
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,448
Go inform the master.

142
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,179
It's strange.

143
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,938
The master has stayed
in the room for so long,

144
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,939
using just this one formation
to trap Lord Bicang.

145
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,379
If I rashly go there...

146
00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:09,559
Just shut up

147
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,619
and obey my order.

148
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,878
If our negligence causes
any inconvenience,

149
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:15,139
we won't be able to
bear the consequences.

150
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,178
Go.

151
00:20:17,178 --> 00:20:18,178
Go on.

152
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,178
If they want to refine something,

153
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:23,178
you should just give it to them.

154
00:20:23,818 --> 00:20:24,938
What's stopping you?

155
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:28,178
This formation is constantly
drawing your blood.

156
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,379
Even I find it disgusting.

157
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:32,818
Take a look at me.

158
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,919
The noble Third Prince of
the North Sea, Bei Xiaoyan.

159
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,539
I've even given them my inner alchemy.

160
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:37,779
Now I'm still alive and kicking.

161
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,578
Knowing the person who shares
my misfortune is unhappy

162
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,019
puts my mind at ease.

163
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,899
Lord Bicang, ShenLi.

164
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,098
You can hear today?

165
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,659
You can talk as well.

166
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:58,359
You rarely have such
a beautiful start to your day.

167
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,698
Can't you speak more cautiously?

168
00:21:01,098 --> 00:21:02,259
In a place like this,

169
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,338
no start would be beautiful.

170
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:10,139
I hope

171
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,178
that I'm without five senses every day.

172
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:24,859
Well, you just can't see.

173
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,659
How about your sense of smell?

174
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:29,058
And your sense of touch?

175
00:21:29,058 --> 00:21:31,698
If you had no sense of touch,
it'd be better.

176
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:35,178
Thanks to you,

177
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:39,578
three of my five senses
have been restored today.

178
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:43,019
Touch is one of them.

179
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:48,539
Then you have to bear with it.

180
00:21:49,418 --> 00:21:51,679
I don't want to hear your screams

181
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:52,759
when the formation is activated.

182
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,779
It would frighten me.

183
00:21:57,818 --> 00:21:59,818
It has been three months

184
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,298
since the battle on the sea.

185
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,888
Three months.

186
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:10,739
It'd be fine if we were
in the mortal world.

187
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:15,178
If this is in the Divine Realm
or the Immortal Realm,

188
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:19,418
the world would have
changed drastically.

189
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,178
ShenLi.

190
00:22:36,178 --> 00:22:37,776
Your Excellency.

191
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,458
Your Excellency,
you have finally awakened.

192
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:46,352
Come, take it slow.

193
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:51,698
Your Excellency,

194
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:53,659
your injuries caused by the Natural Law

195
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:54,878
left us completely helpless.

196
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:56,759
We had to take you back to
the East Sea Dragon Palace.

197
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,298
It's been three months.

198
00:22:58,298 --> 00:22:59,659
- We were worried to death.
- Yes.

199
00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:03,859
- Did you find it?
- Yes.

200
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:09,659
During the three months
when you were unconscious,

201
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,899
I sent countless defrosted soldiers

202
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:14,699
and finally found remnants
of that broken spear

203
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,619
at a place under the sea.

204
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,459
The Immortal Realm's soldiers
identified it

205
00:23:19,459 --> 00:23:22,379
as the spear of Lord Bicang.

206
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,239
They even wanted it back.

207
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:26,419
I managed to convince them

208
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:27,999
to leave it here for you.

209
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:29,418
Right here.

210
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,499
Slow down, Your Excellency.

211
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:32,979
Those in the Immortal Realm probably
think you have died in battle.

212
00:24:36,019 --> 00:24:38,298
I wonder how Her Holiness is recovering.

213
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:40,739
Has the order been
restored in the Capital?

214
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:46,298
Are Rouya and Shush crying?

215
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:49,552
And...

216
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:52,899
(His Excellency
in the Extranatural Heaven,)

217
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,418
(how does he feel about it?)

218
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:59,379
(Has he lost some composure?)

219
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:05,818
(Xingzhi bears too much
on his shoulders.)

220
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,418
(He cannot lose his composure.)

221
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:12,899
(Even if all Three Realms grieve,)

222
00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:16,218
(he must not show
the slightest emotion.)

223
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,739
(This is the attitude befitting a god.)

224
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:26,019
Back then, I tried so hard to avoid it.

225
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,979
But eventually, it can't be avoided.

226
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:33,859
Had I known this day would come,

227
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:39,979
I should have been nicer

228
00:25:41,779 --> 00:25:43,216
to ShenLi.

229
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:47,418
I should at least protect her
from such heavy injuries.

230
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:51,298
Even if it will be known

231
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:54,619
by all three realms,

232
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,298
all deities from past and present,

233
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,688
and the Natural Law.

234
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:09,619
The three realms do know it now.

235
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:18,576
Unfortunately,

236
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:22,098
she can no longer hear it.

237
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,539
Even Lord Bicang

238
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,418
doesn't know how she was brought in

239
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:34,539
or where this place is.

No wonder they use

00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:43,779
Only that can suppress
the scorching flame within you.

256
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:47,058
You made this place so hot.

257
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,739
What's worse is your five senses

258
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,936
and your vocal cords.

259
00:27:55,139 --> 00:27:57,659
Every day some senses disappear.

260
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:00,438
One day you cannot see,

261
00:28:00,438 --> 00:28:02,599
and the next day you cannot hear

262
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,739
or speak.

263
00:28:03,739 --> 00:28:05,219
Or like today,

264
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:07,179
you have three senses left.

265
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:08,659
It changes every day.

266
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:09,904
How thrilling.

267
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,128
Indeed.

268
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:17,338
It's a great bother.

269
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:22,416
But either way, I'm in a cage.

270
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:26,178
My five senses are
not important anymore.

271
00:28:29,058 --> 00:28:30,259
I've already gotten used to it.

272
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:33,818
Haven't you?

273
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:36,599
With no power,

274
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,619
we are helpless here.

275
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:40,578
Sometimes when
the formation is activated,

276
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:43,019
I even feel fortunate

277
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:45,539
that my sense of touch
occasionally disappears.

278
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,899
The more they try to torture me,

279
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:54,578
the less I feel.

280
00:28:58,418 --> 00:29:00,698
And a sense of superiority
arises in my heart.

281
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:58,859
How do you feel, Your Lordship?

282
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,904
Fu Sheng.

283
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:08,619
(He is still alive.)

284
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:18,379
So your name, Fu Sheng,

285
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:21,818
comes from your power of revival.

286
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,418
On the way here,

287
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,298
I heard that Your Lordship
often loses your five senses.

288
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:32,058
Now that I see you,

289
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,519
you cannot see,

290
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,418
but your hearing has recovered.

291
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:40,938
(The battle at the East Sea)

292
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:44,139
(made them suffer heavy losses too.)

293
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,739
(For now, they can't
go out and do evil.)

294
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:51,298
(If I can contact the Divine Realm,)

295
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,818
(no matter how useless
their troops are,)

296
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:59,779
(the soldiers of the Immortal Realm
can increase their combat power tenfold)

297
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,698
(if they can take those weapons.)

298
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:05,539
(If I could go back...)

299
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:47,218
(I probably can no longer go back.)

300
00:31:51,938 --> 00:31:53,019
It's been three months.

301
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:55,698
I'm running out of patience.

302
00:31:56,338 --> 00:32:00,698
Are you still not willing to
hand over the Azure Sea Pearl?

303
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:02,539
Azure Sea Pearl.

304
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:09,379
If you have the ability,

305
00:32:10,818 --> 00:32:12,139
then spare me the talk.

306
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:15,098
It's been three months.

307
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:18,578
Can you refine me?

308
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:21,338
I beg you, be silent.

309
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:22,698
Don't provoke him any further.

310
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:30,698
Your Lordship's element is fire,

311
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,399
and possesses the body of a phoenix.

312
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,679
The rebirth above the East Sea

313
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,879
has merged the Azure Sea Pearl
into your blood.

314
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:40,698
No flames of this world

315
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:43,859
can hurt you.

316
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:49,058
Indeed, this small formation
cannot refine you.

317
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:51,298
If Your Lordship does not cooperate,

318
00:32:53,698 --> 00:32:55,539
then don't blame me for being rude.

319
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:08,899
Third Prince, do not be afraid.

320
00:33:09,979 --> 00:33:11,139
You are not like her.

321
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:13,938
You hold nothing back from us.

322
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:16,619
