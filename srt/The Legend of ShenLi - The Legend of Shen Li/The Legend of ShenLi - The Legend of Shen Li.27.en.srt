=Episode 27=

3
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,301
Thank you, Mr. Yu Yi,

4
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,860
for removing the iron from my limbs.

5
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,780
I really appreciate it.

6
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,220
I don't want to bother you any further,

7
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:54,381
yet I'm still unable to move,

8
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:57,540
I still need you to take care of me
for a few more days.

9
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:00,048
It's fine.

10
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:05,820
I make my living on the sea.

11
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,661
Your injuries are severe.

12
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,240
I haven't been able
to work for many days

13
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,461
because I've been looking after you.

14
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,461
I gotta get back

15
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:15,741
to work now.

16
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,980
I will compensate you for your loss.

17
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:22,301
It's not a matter of money.

18
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,700
Time flows away like water.

19
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,496
You wasted

20
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,661
my time.

21
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,901
(I should have ignored him.)

22
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,620
Didn't you promise

23
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,248
to grant me

24
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,381
a wish?

25
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,460
Everything is best

26
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,500
in pairs.

27
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,456
Could you please

28
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:52,301
grant me another one?

29
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,064
What do you want?

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,841
Even if I say it now,

31
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,500
you may not be able to fulfill it.

32
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:01,488
Can I not

33
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:03,184
tell you for now?

34
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,140
Then I'll try my best

35
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,824
to help you heal.

36
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,541
Are you a man of many words?

37
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,941
Before the iron was removed,

38
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,481
you made me feel like

39
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,981
any extra word

40
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,580
could be your last breath.

41
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,620
So I didn't talk a lot with you.

42
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,512
But now...

43
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,720
I want you

44
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,101
to grant me another wish.

45
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,301
(Even if I don't agree,)

46
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,420
(he won't throw me out.)

47
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,552
Alright.

48
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:43,661
I'll grant you two wishes.

49
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:46,920
As long as it's within my power,

50
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,980
I will do it.

51
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,060
Do you drink water regularly?

52
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,901
Any water here?

53
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,541
Of course. Just wait.

54
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,584
I haven't finished it.

55
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,141
You seem to be an idler.

56
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,420
No conical hat or straw raincoat.

57
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,740
No fishing net or rod.

58
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:54,701
And the house is empty.

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,541
Little sign of domestic life.

60
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,861
It feels like no one lives here.

61
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,941
I have everything you mentioned.

62
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,720
Outside.

63
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:14,640
Outside.

64
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,780
Do you have anything to eat at home?

65
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:20,432
I'm hungry.

66
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,900
What do you want to eat?

67
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,200
Since you make your living from the sea,

68
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,060
you must have got some fish, right?

69
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:28,720
I would like to eat fish.

70
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,941
Just grill me some fish.

71
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,741
Sorry.

72
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:45,060
I've eaten up all the fish.

73
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,100
Please wait. It won't take long.

74
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,176
I will catch some right now.

75
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,421
Xingzhi, serves you right.

76
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,661
There are so many fish in the sea.

77
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,581
It shouldn't be difficult to catch

78
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,392
a couple that we can eat.

79
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,900
This is good.

80
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,541
Dragon King,

81
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,981
His Excellency...

82
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:53,181
What's wrong now?

83
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,600
He is casting a net in the sea.

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,881
Casting a net.

85
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,180
Why is he doing that?

86
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,541
Perhaps to catch something.

87
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,981
His Excellency cast a net.

88
00:07:02,981 --> 00:07:04,941
His Excellency himself cast a net.

89
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,460
Surely he's not fishing
for merely fish or shrimp.

90
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,941
Of course not.

91
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,384
Go.

92
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:16,141
Go and replace

93
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:17,941
the worthless stuff in his net

94
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:19,721
with these treasures.

95
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,821
Let His Excellency choose
whatever he likes.

96
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,061
How clever!

97
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,200
Not that clever.

98
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,500
What are you doing? Follow me.

99
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:51,728
Not even one.

100
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:11,856
Where is the fish?

101
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,936
There is fish.

102
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
In your heart?

103
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,300
Or in your stomach?

104
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,581
Do you think

105
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,740
I have no sense of taste

106
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,360
so I don't deserve it?

107
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,792
There will be some tomorrow.

108
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:55,660
Your Excellency.

109
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:57,328
Where's my fish?

110
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,384
Fish?

111
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:20,848
Your Excellency,

112
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,461
how about this one?

113
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,500
She is in her prime
with a lovely appearance.

114
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,540
This is our specialty.

115
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,500
Would it taste good when stewed?

116
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:41,540
That would be a waste, wouldn't it?

117
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,341
Get me two fish,

118
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,280
one for grilling

119
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,461
and one for stewing.

120
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:53,420
Okay, I will.

121
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,592
How's the soup?

122
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,381
Today, both my sense
of taste and smell are just fine.

123
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,461
Mr. Yu Yi, thank you.

124
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,461
Today, there's also pan-fried fish.

125
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,701
Pan-fried fish?

126
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,860
I can't move my limbs right now.

127
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,941
What if the bones
get stuck in my throat?

128
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:10,221
Did you use to pick out

129
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:12,221
fish bones with your eyes?

130
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,408
You can spit them out.

131
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:17,968
But

132
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,536
I am

133
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,584
a helpful man.

134
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,200
Have a taste.

135
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,100
I knew your cooking skills
were unparalleled.

136
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,136
You knew?

137
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,352
More.

138
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,856
Here it comes.

139
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
But speaking of which,

140
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,141
this is the first time we've met.

141
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,980
Could it be that you've accepted

142
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,060
my services too calmly?

143
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,941
You command me

144
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,100
so adeptly.

145
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:49,264
Mr. Yu Yi,

146
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,901
you are a great person.

147
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,060
The fish is gone.

148
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,661
Why not keep up the good work

149
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:57,712
and go fishing again?

150
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,944
Are you

151
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,420
driving me away

152
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,040
from my house?

153
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,300
Is that so?

154
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,344
Time flows away like water.

155
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,420
I'm not gonna make you waste your time.

156
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:15,056
Go.

157
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:18,864
All right.

158
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,060
(Xingzhi left.)

159
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,056
(I shall begin.)

160
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,701
What are you doing?

161
00:15:46,701 --> 00:15:48,261
What are you doing here?

162
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,941
Don't I need privacy?

163
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,112
Privacy?

164
00:15:52,781 --> 00:15:54,561
Who are you talking to?

165
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:56,921
I am your sister. There's nothing
about you I haven't seen.

166
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,881
You've slept in again. Hurry and get up.

167
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,080
Hurry up.

168
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,461
Do you have nothing to do every day?

169
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,500
You come here to bother me.

170
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,520
I come to bother you for a reason.

171
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,568
Put on your clothes.

172
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,581
You have nothing to do all day.

173
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:11,321
Why don't you go to see His Excellency?

174
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,336
Go now.

175
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,341
Didn't I do it just a while ago?

176
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,781
I just went to that realm
and felt too depressed.

177
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:18,980
I still haven't recovered from it.

178
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,781
I feel dizzy and muddled every day.

179
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:21,872
I'll sleep a bit more.

180
00:16:21,872 --> 00:16:23,141
No more sleeping!

181
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:24,540
Go!

182
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,961
- I haven't put on my shoes yet.
- Fine.

183
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:27,980
Go now.

184
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,008
Go.

185
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,200
What brings you here?

186
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,261
You don't want me here?

187
00:16:58,261 --> 00:16:59,312
You're very welcome.

188
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,141
If it wasn't for His Excellency,
I wouldn't bother coming.

189
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,981
My Lord,

190
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,260
His Excellency is no longer here.

191
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,360
He's gone out again
with that broken spear?

192
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,420
That's not it.

193
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:14,300
His Excellency is so infatuated.

194
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:15,861
No.

195
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:18,741
His Excellency has gone ashore.

196
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,041
He even returned last night.

197
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,552
He asked me for two fish.

198
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:26,561
Fish?

199
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,180
Right, His Excellency

200
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,801
wanted one grilled and one stewed.

201
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,961
I thought the grilled one
wouldn't be tasty,

202
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:34,301
so I gave him a fried one.

203
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,461
A fried hairtail

204
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,941
and a stewed leopard coral grouper.

205
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,540
The latter one is...

206
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,981
Where are you going?

207
00:17:57,461 --> 00:17:59,900
Your Excellency!

208
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,660
Lord Xingzhi!

209
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,221
Didn't the Dragon King say
he was around here?

210
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:09,008
Your Excellency!

211
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:11,248
Your Excellency!

212
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,264
Your Excellency!

213
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,088
Where did he go?

214
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:16,912
Your Excellency!

215
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:20,816
Your Excellency.

216
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,704
Your Excellency.

217
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:24,496
Your Excellency.

218
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:47,696
Be quiet.

219
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:57,936
Your Excellency,

220
00:18:58,621 --> 00:18:59,632
you look like

221
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,660
a fisherman so much.

222
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,260
Your Excellency, why are you...?

223
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,221
Why are you here?

224
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,296
There's a demon.

225
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,080
Demon, come out and meet your death!

226
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,821
Where is the demon?

227
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:26,941
Demon.

228
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,912
Demon.

229
00:19:29,581 --> 00:19:30,608
Come out and meet your death!

230
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,260
- Demon.
- Can you stop it?

231
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:34,341
I just want you to be quieter.

232
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,344
There's no demon.

233
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:37,232
Come here.

234
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,721
Your Excellency, why are you here?

235
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,180
You've made
the Dragon King of the East Sea

236
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,401
think too much and made them scared.

237
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,461
I found ShenLi

238
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:55,420
by the sea.

239
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:57,136
I see.

240
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,660
Who? ShenLi?

241
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,960
Yes.

242
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,656
Your Excellency,

243
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,941
let's go back
to the Divine Realm to get treated.

244
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,221
Now you

245
00:20:31,221 --> 00:20:32,660
don't look like an ancient god at all!

246
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,861
I think it's quite nice.

247
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,304
Nice?

248
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:42,768
Very good.

249
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,501
S-S-She's really...

250
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,040
Yes.

251
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,161
Her injuries are very severe now.

252
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,341
She needs a good rest.

253
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,184
I got it.

254
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:25,501
And right now,

255
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,941
I don't want to tell anyone about this.

256
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:30,140
Right.

257
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,741
Given the way you acted before,

258
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,821
if other Diviners
know ShenLi is still alive,

259
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:36,701
it will cause quite a stir!

260
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,900
Should we inform Her Holiness?

261
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:52,656
During this time,

262
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,272
I want to be selfish.

263
00:21:58,341 --> 00:21:59,408
At least here,

264
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:02,512
it's just me and her.

265
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:09,424
Trust me.

266
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,601
Before you leave,

267
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:12,701
I will keep this matter secret.

268
00:22:13,341 --> 00:22:14,461
I will also help you cover it up

269
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,941
in front of the Dragon King
and other Diviners.

270
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:21,776
Thank you very much.

271
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,260
My pleasure.

272
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:27,701
But, anyway,

273
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:28,900
you saved ShenLi again.

274
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,101
Was she very happy

275
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:31,120
when she saw you?

276
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,741
I didn't save her.

277
00:22:36,501 --> 00:22:37,701
I just brought her back.

278
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,472
ShenLi

279
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,741
still doesn't know who I am now.

280
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:47,621
What does it mean?

281
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,736
Haven't you said it too?

282
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:53,900
I look very much like a fisherman now.

283
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,941
I've cast a spell on myself.

284
00:23:02,101 --> 00:23:03,441
Moreover, now

285
00:23:03,441 --> 00:23:04,464
she can't see

286
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:06,288
or hear.

287
00:23:07,701 --> 00:23:08,861
Her injuries are that severe?

288
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:11,060
I don't want her to know

289
00:23:11,856 --> 00:23:12,881
my identity for now.

290
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:13,936
Why?

291
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:18,981
I don't know how to face her.

292
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,180
So even you

293
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,861
would be this cautious.

294
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:32,816
Well,

295
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:36,180
you look quite like a fisherman too.

296
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,641
I'm cooperating with you.

297
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:40,981
What if ShenLi recognizes me?

298
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,184
Actually,

299
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,104
I think it's quite good.

300
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,741
Yes, it's really quite good.

301
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,101
(Good thing I can see today.)

302
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,432
Luotian!

303
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:46,320
Luotian!

304
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,260
(His Excellency has awakened,)

305
00:25:59,981 --> 00:26:01,020
(and he's injured now.)

306
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,140
( I can't be of much help,)

307
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,701
(but my sister has got
so many ancient tomes.)

308
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:06,540
(Perhaps I would find some methods.)

309
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,152
What are you looking for?

310
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:23,741
A medical book for His Excellency.
Don't disturb me.

311
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:27,441
I've looked through
all the books at home,

312
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,540
only to find one
that might be of some use.

313
00:26:31,101 --> 00:26:32,112
Is it useful?

314
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,461
No idea. I just made a talisman
and haven't tried it.

315
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,941
Give it to me,
and I'll try it on His Excellency.

316
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
Alright, let's go together. I'm done.

317
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,112
No need.

318
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,224
You mustn't go.

319
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:48,701
Why can't I go?

320
00:26:50,941 --> 00:26:51,984
Well...

321
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,221
Just in case our grandfather needs you.

322
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:57,180
The Divine Realm is in such chaos.
You are indispensable.

323
00:26:58,621 --> 00:26:59,741
Give me the talisman. I'll go.

324
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:03,861
Anything happened in the East Sea?

325
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:06,192
No.

326
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,741
What could happen there?
It's very peaceful.

327
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:11,621
So you've got
His Excellency into trouble?

328
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,240
You troublemaker.

329
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,540
You can't even do one thing right.

330
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,136
What can I do to His Excellency?

331
00:27:17,648 --> 00:27:18,801
His Excellency is very well.

332
00:27:18,801 --> 00:27:19,900
So you just want to suspect me?

333
00:27:20,621 --> 00:27:22,461
Fine, keep
the medicinal talisman for yourself.

334
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:26,576
I...

335
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,312
This...

336
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,072
This is ShenLi.

337
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:53,360
She...!

338
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:17,101
My brother.

339
00:28:44,368 --> 00:28:45,424
Why did you hit me?

340
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,501
I hit you?

341
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,461
I was trying the talisman on you.

342
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,288
The talisman?

343
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,961
I wanted to let you
try out the talisman.

344
00:28:57,961 --> 00:28:59,461
Who would have thought
its power was so great

345
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:00,660
that it knocked you out?

346
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,060
The talisman was on my forehead.

347
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,112
But the back of my head hurts?

348
00:29:06,341 --> 00:29:07,521
I'm your sister.

349
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:08,848
Would I lie to you?

350
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:09,861
Besides,

351
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:12,140
did I need to knock you out
just because I was angry?

352
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:20,528
Hurry up.

353
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,741
The talisman is not ready yet.

354
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:23,801
I'm done talking to you.

355
00:29:23,801 --> 00:29:25,180
Hurry and go to take care of

356
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,288
His Excellency for me.

357
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,048
Go.

358
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:37,821
Since they want seclusion,

359
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:38,941
I won't go.

360
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,260
Look after them for me.

361
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:43,501
I'd better wait
until the talisman is ready.

362
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,800
Otherwise, my behavior

363
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,780
would expose His Excellency's location.

364
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:36,656
If that's the case,

365
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,941
how can I still hold
a spear in the future?

366
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:44,260
How can I protect my clan?

367
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,072
What's wrong?

368
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:05,040
Did I hit you?

369
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:08,368
It's fine.

370
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,736
Due to my physical issues,

371
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:12,900
I've been a bit anxious lately.

372
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:17,360
Understood.

373
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,520
Where are you hurt?

374
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,336
Here?

375
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:29,520
No.

376
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:32,841
Here?

377
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:33,904
It's not that either.

378
00:31:40,221 --> 00:31:41,328
I'm sorry.

379
00:31:41,328 --> 00:31:42,540
I poked you in the eye.

380
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,072
It's okay.

381
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:00,944
It's this.

382
00:32:15,581 --> 00:32:17,621
I'll try to hold it back in the future.

383
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,952
There's no need.

384
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,832
You don't need to hold back.

385
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:30,640
With me,

386
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,592
you don't have to hold it back.

387
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
You can do whatever you want.

388
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:55,184
What's the matter?

389
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,088
I...

390
00:33:02,341 --> 00:33:03,344
I...

391
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:07,312
I...

392
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,480
I need to use the restroom.

393
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:18,540
I'll support you.

394
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,001
No need. I...

395
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:21,260
Let me help you. Come on.

396
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:23,261
It's not the first time.

397
00:33:23,261 --> 00:33:24,361
What are you embarrassed about?

398
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:25,424
Let's go.

399
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,941
You don't need to, really.

400
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:29,221
Come on.

401
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,088
Don't be stubborn.

402
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,456
Come on.

403
00:34:11,741 --> 00:34:12,816
(Training in such a way,)

404
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,021
(I've recovered quite fast.)

405
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:17,941
(But my five senses
haven't fully recovered.)

406
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,660
(Sometimes, I rely on my eyes)

407
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,100
(and ears without the sense of touch.)

408
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,701
(Sometimes, I can't hear)

409
00:34:26,261 --> 00:34:28,541
(and it sharpens my sense of smell.)

410
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:31,344
(During this time,)

411
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,301
(all five senses have improved.)

412
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,660
(It's really a blessing in disguise.)

413
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:57,900
(Turns out he never left.)

414
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:01,620

in his own way.)
