00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:39,056
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,848
What are you looking at?

4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,368
Nothing.

5
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:56,880
Nothing?

6
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,800
Nothing.

7
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,720
I couldn't sleep so I walked in the yard
and picked up a leaf for you.

8
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,784
I've placed it in your book.

9
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,448
Where's the book?

10
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:08,439
It's on the table over there.

11
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,456
Which one?

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,360
The one on the table.

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,424
Which one is that?

14
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,759
Just the one on the table.

15
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,919
- You...
- Which one on the table?

16
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,840
H-How dare you.

17
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,599
W-When have I ever lied to you?

18
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,559
Just the one on the table.

19
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,319
I'm going to bed.

20
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,224
(First quarter past the Si hour,
the 20th of the 6th month, Age 18)

21
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:08,240
(On the third month, my parents
fell ill and died. Age 5.)

22
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,880
(What exactly is his background?)

23
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,319
(If he is truly from the Divine
or Immortal Realm,)

24
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,639
(would he have to disguise himself
as a mortal to deceive me?)

25
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,560
(He made up a really believable past.)

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,039
(But if not, why could he
use those techniques?)

27
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,560
(But he has no trace
of spiritual power in his body.)

28
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,920
(He's just an ordinary mortal.)

29
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:40,840
(What exactly has a mortal done wrong)

30
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,880
(to live such a poor life?)

31
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,120
(What a harsh retribution.)

32
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:50,599
(Well, I might as well
treat him kindly during this time.)

That scoundrel. I'm the eldest
young master of Qingsheng City.

55
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,879
He is just born of a concubine.

56
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,440
How dare he talk back to me
in front of our father? How dare he?

57
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,879
He just wants to snatch my position
as the future city lord.

58
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,120
Who is the future city lord? I am.

59
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,536
I...

60
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,136
Bin.

61
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,624
- Master.
- Where's the diviner?

62
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,199
Didn't you say he would come on his own?

63
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,120
Didn't you say if we left him hanging,
he'd come by himself? Where is he now?

64
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:05,160
Let's leave him hanging longer?

65
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,880
I... If I continue doing it,
I'll be done for.

66
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:16,000
I can't wait any longer.
I shall see him in person tomorrow.

67
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,560
Get lost!

68
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,320
With this strength, the dough

69
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,720
will have quite a chewy texture.

70
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,072
Smells good.

71
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,799
Cluck Cluck, can you do me a favor?

72
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:13,639
Help me take down that meat.

73
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,040
It's hung a bit high. I can't reach it.

74
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,040
You can even do this.

75
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,160
Do you want to have it cut?

76
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,224
Yes.

77
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,519
Could you clean up

78
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,199
the kitchen for me after cooking?

79
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,320
Do you know who you
have been ordering around these days?

80
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:50,760
I don't know who you are.

81
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,280
How could I possibly know?

82
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,720
Cluck Cluck.

83
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,808
What's wrong now?

84
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:49,000
I-It's cut so well.

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,239
What's so surprising about it?

86
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,720
The meal is almost ready. Wait to eat.

87
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,720
(There must be something off
with this small courtyard.)

88
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,616
(What on earth is going on?)

89
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:35,476
(Who drew this?)

90
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,479
(I'm Lord Bicang. I blushed
because of a mere mortal?)

91
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,896
(Spring brings overflowing water,
Summer clouds resemble peaks.)

92
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,760
Cluck Cluck, time to eat.

93
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,520
How many times
have I told you? my name is ShenLi.

94
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,080
If you call me
like an animal one more time...

95
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,039
ShenLi, time to eat.

96
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,039
My Lord, your wound has healed.

97
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,440
Li, go to train the troops.

98
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,520
My Lord, let's go to battle.

99
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,880
My Lord, it is time to set off.

100
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,919
My Lord, let's go for a martial contest.

101
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,320
My Lord, it's time to discuss matters.

102
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,599
My Lord, time to go to the barracks.

103
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,200
(No one has ever tried)

104
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,440
(putting my name
and such casual words together.)

105
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,208
What's the matter?

106
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,359
This is the first time
someone has connected my name

107
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:48,039
with having a meal.

108
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:54,880
Isn't that just a very ordinary
and casual phrase?

109
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,320
This is the last piece of meat.

110
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
If you ruin it,
you'll have to compensate.

111
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:05,040
Go ahead.

112
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,184
How is it?

113
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:13,904
It's so good.

114
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,200
From now on, you'll be my cook.

115
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,464
It's my honor.

116
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
Hurry and eat. We'll have guests later.

117
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:53,488
Who is it?

118
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,320
Go buy meat after you're done.

119
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,080
You want me to take
such a big piece of gold to the market?

120
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,719
Aren't you afraid
I'll be arrested? This won't do.

121
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So demanding.

122
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,880
So many people have come,
but I've prepared only one teacup.

123
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,919
How dare you are so rude
to the eldest young master!

124
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,960
Show some respect for him.

125
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,080
You all wait outside.

126
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,679
Yes. Let's go.

127
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,200
It's really not easy to see you.

128
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,640
It's easier to see you.

129
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,919
I've heard you have supernatural powers
and can foresee the future.

130
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:37,359
So could you please
make a divination for me?

131
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,599
In what respect?

132
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,656
Well...

133
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,320
It seems you don't know me very well.

134
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,440
I am the eldest young master
of Qingsheng City.

135
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,039
If you can accurately
divine for me today,

136
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,320
I will endow you with glory
and wealth for the rest of your life.

137
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,679
That sounds very tempting.

138
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,848
But I won't do it.

139
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,000
Don't be ungrateful.

140
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:12,799
It would be effortless for me
to flatten this little courtyard today.

141
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,839
You came all the way here today

142
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,279
just to know when you can
assume the position of the city lord.

143
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,400
But the lifespan of the old city lord
is tied to the fate of the entire city.

144
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,440
It's not that I don't want to.
It's that I truly can't.

145
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,640
You said just now you'd flatten
this place. It will not be easy.

146
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,279
If you want to level this place
by sitting, that might be possible.

147
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:48,304
I...

148
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,159
How dare you!

149
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,599
Master, are you alright?

150
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,808
Leave or die.

151
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:23,472
Go!

152
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,279
How dare you? Do you know who I am?

153
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,359
I am the eldest young master
of Qingsheng City.

154
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,200
No matter how many times you come,

155
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,520
I can still kill you. Understand?

156
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,599
Spare my life!

157
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
Are you stupid?

158
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,679
You act powerful
and inscrutable in front of me,

159
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,640
but today,
you got bullied by a stranger.

160
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,712
I am not as powerful as you.

161
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,679
Nor am I as formidable as you imagine.

162
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,560
I am just a mortal.

163
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,479
In the end, I shall die too.

164
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,239
I cannot leave this worldly life behind.

165
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:40,640
(A mere mortal. He can even be scalded
by just a bit of water.)

166
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,440
(Although he can predict the future
and appears omnipotent,)

167
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:46,719
(he is just flesh and blood)

168
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,039
(and can be easily killed.)

169
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,839
(Where does he get so much confidence?)

170
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:04,880
Did I make matters worse?

171
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,152
I've caused you trouble.

172
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,679
Not exactly. Anyway,
I caused this mess at first.

173
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,599
You just added a little fuel.

174
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,520
What exactly did you say to that person?

175
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,640
Let me summarize it.

176
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,120
Basically, he wanted me to work for him.

177
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,320
I refused, so he threatened
to flatten this place.

178
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
I laughed, saying
he could only do it by sitting.

179
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:37,839
He was annoyed that I laughed at
his size, and he hit me.

180
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,559
Turns out that commenting on
someone's figure is a taboo.

181
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,856
(Serves his right.)

182
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,280
That person is stubborn and arrogant.

183
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,959
And he constantly wants
his father and brother to die early.

184
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,319
If Qingsheng City falls into his hands,
I fear the world will not be at peace.

185
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,559
Don't you dislike divination?

186
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,599
This isn't divination.

187
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,079
It concerns the fate of a city.

188
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:11,359
Even if I wanted to,
I wouldn't be able to foresee anything.

189
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:14,439
But I have figured out his character.

190
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,959
As for the future,
I can let it slowly go that way.

191
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,079
ShenLi, could you
go fetch some water for me?

192
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,439
I'm going to make medicine.

193
00:19:27,439 --> 00:19:30,479
I need to take care of my wound,
or I might be disfigured.

194
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,280
You sure are expert at giving orders.

195
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,359
Your bandage is wet.
Let me change it for you.

196
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,439
No need. It's not wet. It's fine.

197
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,719
The wet bandage will affect your wound.
I'll help you change it.

198
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,712
Change it.

199
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,839
Here you are.

200
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,079
You've seen through me again.

201
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,439
I have a headache.

202
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,120
This burn hurts,
and I also have a headache.

203
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,680
It's killing me.

204
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,800
You're trying to feign weakness
to get through this again.

205
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,400
It really hurts.
How can it hurt this much?

206
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,920
Let it hurt. I don't care.

207
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,160
You go to rest. I'll do it.

208
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,336
How do I deal with the herbs?

209
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,896
Let me do it.

210
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,839
What would you do
if I was not here today?

211
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,160
You're not one for fighting,
but you acted tough.

212
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,920
I wouldn't act like that
if you weren't here.

213
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,432
But you were here, weren't you?

214
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,760
You look much tougher than me,

215
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,120
making me seem
so easy-going in comparison.

216
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,319
Your fierce vibe

217
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,800
is truly impressive and cool.

218
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,320
Am I wrong?

219
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,640
No one has ever praised me like that.

220
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,359
That just shows they don't have
the same discerning taste as me.

221
00:23:12,688 --> 00:23:13,744
It's so hot.

222
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:16,199
ShenLi, grab that cloth for me.

223
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,199

Even men aren't this hard on themselves.

The burn ointment is ready.
You should apply some too.

240
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,439
When I said you were
a disciple of a divine lord,

241
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,040
you got so petty
that you angered me with meat.

242
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,800
Today, that bunch bullied you.

243
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,839
How come I didn't see you get angry?

244
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,680
Is it because I'm easy to bully?

245
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,839
Of course I was angry.

246
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,199
It's just that dealing with him
is something I can't rush.

247
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:27,280
You wanna deal with him?

248
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,839
Isn't he the eldest young master
of Qingsheng City?

249
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,040
Looks like I have no chance.

250
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,959
But I could try making
someone else do the job.

251
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,000
Make me do it for you?

252
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,839
I can't always bother you.

253
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,280
There are other ones.

254
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,000
What do you plan to do?

255
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:53,680
No rush. Revenge
is like taking medicine.

256
00:26:01,616 --> 00:26:02,672
You should be patient.

257
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,680
I just want to ask you.
Don't you find it too sweet?

258
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,439
No, I like sweet things.

259
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,959
Is it because life has been too bitter?

260
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,840
You get me.

261
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,520
ShenLi.

262
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,600
What is it?

263
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,000
Accompany me out tomorrow, will you?

264
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,800
Why should I go just because you ask?

265
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:51,120
Because I'm cute.

266
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,839
I'm the eldest young master of Qingsheng
City and the future city lord.

267
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,719
Can't believe I got beaten by someone.

268
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:06,000
Even my father never hit me.

269
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,168
Be gentle.

270
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,079
No, I must avenge this grudge.

271
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,839
Fu Sheng? Go get Fu Sheng for me.

272
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,400
- Yes.
- Go.

273
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,280
Go down a bit.

274
00:27:29,684 --> 00:27:31,856
(Jinyue Mansion, Qingsheng City)

275
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,959
Master, our spy reported your brother
went to a small courtyard in the west

276
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:47,199
to find a diviner named Xingyun.

277
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,880
There are rumors
that the person can foretell the future.

278
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:55,800
My brother has gone mad
coveting the position of city lord.

279
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,280
He even believed some rumors.

280
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,120
Strangely, your brother
seemed to be driven out.

281
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:05,280
Upon return, he beat up
all the guards who had followed him.

282
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:22,000
(Jinyue Mansion)

283
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,040
The Jinyue Mansion.

284
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,719
The old city lord of Qingsheng City
has two sons,

285
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,239
but the future city lord
has not been decided.

286
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:32,120
He is preoccupied with
the thoughts of his deceased wife,

287
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,239
so he is very indulgent towards her son.

288
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,120
But Gu Chengrui is arrogant
and overbearing, unfit for the position.

289
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:47,120
This is the residence
of his younger brother, Gu Chengjin.

290
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,160
He is completely
different from Gu Chengrui.

291
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:54,079
Many ministers strongly recommend
him to be the future city lord.

292
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,400
Over the years, a lot of resentment
has accumulated between the two.

293
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,640
It's best to use him

294
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,400
to deal with Gu Chengrui.

295
00:29:06,719 --> 00:29:09,640
You seem indifferent,
but in reality, you know everything.

296
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,160
Before last night,
I really didn't know anything.

297
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:18,680
But to deal with him,
we need to prepare in advance.

298
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,359
Who is in front of the mansion?

299
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm Xingyun, a diviner.
I request an audience with Mr. Gu.

300
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,719
A diviner? How daring.

301
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,839
Do you know

302
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,479
I detest you swindlers most?

303
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,559
If so, you may address
me as a strategist.

304
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:50,319
I have a plan for you.

305
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:52,079
It could help you achieve great things.

306
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,808
Why should I trust you?

307
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:57,959
Yesterday, your brother
came to me for it but failed.

308
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,199
If you're interested,
we can discuss further in the mansion.

309
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:26,544
(Gu Chengjin, Second Young Master
of Qingsheng City)

310
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,760
Yang Zheng, take them to the backyard.

311
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:05,160
Yes. This way please, both of you.

312
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,712
Sickly fella.

313
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:33,359
Xingyun, what's wrong?

314
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:40,496
- What are you thinking about?
- Nothing.

315
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:44,912
It's as if I saw an old acquaintance.

316
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,120
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

317
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:52,839
In a while, I will present
my plan to Mr. Gu.

318
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,559
Wait for me outside for a moment.

319
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:01,439
Alright. I won't get too involved
in the matters of the mortal world.

320
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,400
But if you can gain the protection
of Gu Chengjin in the future,

321
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,079
I can leave with peace of mind.

322
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,239
You're really heartless,
thinking only of leaving me.

323
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,599
I'm not as heartless as you.

324
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,920
What are you doing?
Don't touch my lotus flowers.

325
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,400
Your skirt...

326
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
- Over there.
- It...

327
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,920
Who's there? Who is bullying Miss He?

328
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,792
No, not at all.

329
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:00,839
I didn't.

330
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,040
She's even forcing Miss He.

331
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,656
Come, you guys, protect Miss He.

332
00:35:04,656 --> 00:35:06,760
- We're coming.
- Don't come over here.

333
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,280
Come on. Go get people.

334
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,880
- We're coming.
- Come help Miss He.

335
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,984
This way.

336
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,000
You mortal women
value your reputation above all.

337
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,368
It wouldn't be good
if the guards see you like this.

338
00:35:16,368 --> 00:35:17,392
We're coming.

339
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:19,319
How about I take you away from here?

340
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:20,912
- Hurry up.
- Where are we going?

341
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
We can only make an underground escape.

342
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,400
Under what?

343
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,504
Underground.

344
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:30,000
Come on, right here. It's her.

345
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,640
How dare you abduct
Miss He? How audacious.

346
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
- Yeah.
- Let her go.

347
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,136
Release Miss He at once.

348
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,199
- Let her go.
- Let her go now.

349
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,199
- Release her.
- Yeah.

350
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:41,392
What's all this noise?

351
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,200
Her skirt fell off.
Have your guards leave.

352
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,544
Leave here.

353
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,976
- Yes.
- Yes.

354
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:57,808
What happened?

355
00:35:59,759 --> 00:36:00,839
My belt fell off.

356
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:08,279
I'll take you back now. Come on.

357
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,192
(Jinyue Mansion)

358
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,599
You're always getting
yourself into some mess.

359
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,039
You couldn't have taken
a fancy to that girl, could you?

360
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,728
Are you out of your mind?

361
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,880
I'm just curious
why Mr. Gu keeps a demon.

362
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,400
But never mind.
It's none of my business.

363
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,519
Why didn't you take
the opportunity to stay in the mansion?

364
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,528
- You...
- Master Shen,

365
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:03,440
see how good Mr. Gu is.

366
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:06,200
He gave me so much money. Look.

367
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:09,200
Today, we can buy meat.

368
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:11,316
(Land of Outstanding People)

369
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,319
(How can I leave?)

370
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,559
(Well, considering the days
we've spent together, I'll protect him)

371
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:29,400
(for a few more days.)

372
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,280
Wait for me.

373
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:50,319
Shi, it's been three years.

374
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:55,759
(Ye Shi)
If you don't wake up, I'll grow old.

375
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,839
But it will be soon, right?

376
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,559
You'll wake up very soon.

377
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,759
(My wife, Ye Shi)
Shi, I'll come to see you tomorrow.

378
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,599
Gu Chengjin.

379
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,599
Close the door now.

380
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:47,120
Gu Chengjin.

381
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,559
Are you busy
with official affairs again?

382
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,440
Why haven't you slept? It's so late.

383
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,319
I miss you. I can't sleep.

384
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,799
Can I keep you company while you read?

385
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,519
I promise I'll be good.

386
00:39:12,112 --> 00:39:13,136
Really?

387
00:39:14,096 --> 00:39:15,152
Yes.

388
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,408
Okay.

389
00:39:23,796 --> 00:39:25,264
@(XXX)

390
00:39:25,904 --> 00:39:27,559
I feel most at ease by your side.

391
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,384
Master.

392
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:44,304
Master.

393
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,799
The Jinyue Mansion.
They picked a great place.

394
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:53,440
It's no use hiding anywhere
after giving me such a humiliation.

395
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,319
Those two have really got
something. How about...?

396
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:56,496
How about what?

397
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:02,519
You're useless, and you even
want me to let go of them?

398
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,759
I didn't say that.

399
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,839
Then how about what?

400
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,599
How about we just don't mess with them?

401
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,872
I...

402
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:12,464
- I take my leave.
- Get out of my sight.

403
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:13,960
- I don't want to see you again.
- Thank you.

404
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,120
Get out of my sight.

405
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,840
Sir.

406
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,992
Master,

407
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,920
why are you so angry?

408
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,720
Sir, there is something you don't know.

409
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:30,864
Two demons...

410
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,519
Two demons bullied me!

411
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:38,359
They can even use
demonic techniques, you know?

412
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:41,160
A stick flew at me and hit me.

413
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,039
It hit me on the bottoms.
It really hurt me.

414
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,720
You don't have to panic.

415
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,920
Those are merely common spells.

416
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,880
C-Common spells?

417
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,680
I guess they are just ordinary people
with supernatural powers.

418
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:03,680
I'll get some sorcerers
to get rid of them.

419
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,319
Good. That would be very good.

420
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,880
I'll make those two regret it.

421
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,799
They hit my bottoms.

422
00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:24,799
(I probably won't see the fruit ripen.)

423
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,839
(The food Xingyun makes is so good.)

424
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:32,039
(The fruits he plants
must be sweet as well.)

425
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,240
(I must leave within three days.)

426
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,720
(No matter what happens to Xingyun,)

427
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,559
(I can no longer stay here.)

428
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,559
(It would only make things worse.)

429
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:47,799
(He can avoid Gu Chengrui
in the Jinyue Mansion,)

430
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:52,160
(but how can a mortal cope with
threats from Immortal Realm?)

431
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:56,839
(Without the marriage arrangement,
I wouldn't have to flee.)

432
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,359
(Nor would I need
to leave in such a hurry.)

433
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:03,799
(I could...)

434
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:12,160
Shen Li, I've changed the formation here
to an extremely fierce one.

435
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:15,240
It is particularly powerful at night.

436
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,720
You'd better not come
to the front courtyard.

437
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,559
If you go out, let me know.
I'll accompany you.

438
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,799
Why did you change it?

439
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,559
Just to make us sleep
soundly without worry.
