00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,184
=Episode 39=

3
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,280
Li.

4
00:01:59,794 --> 00:02:01,195
Have you ever felt

5
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:02,475
something incompatible

6
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,095
between us?

7
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:05,168
Not at all.

8
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,315
We're inseparable like yin and yang.

9
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:11,056
Really?

10
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,755
Look at you.

11
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,035
You don't have a trace
of softness in you.

12
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:19,275
I'm saying.

13
00:02:19,994 --> 00:02:22,754
You're yin, I'm yang,
and together we're in harmony.

14
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:23,994
A perfect match.

15
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:28,955
If you put it like that,

16
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:30,960
it's not bad.

17
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,955
I bet it's someone
from the Immortal Realm.

18
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:39,675
Do Lord Bicang
and Lord Xingzhi live here?

19
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,555
I'm the maid of Ms. Jin
from North Snowy Mountain.

20
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:44,635
Ms. Jin?

21
00:02:44,635 --> 00:02:45,680
I thought

22
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:47,874
she fell in love with

23
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,074
a mortal cultivator

24
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:53,155
and has been troubled for years.

25
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:54,815
Why did she send someone

26
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:56,154
to look for us?

27
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,560
Greetings, Your Lordship.

28
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,354
My lady sent me
to deliver an invitation.

29
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:05,904
Invitation?

30
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:07,994
Is it for her birthday?

31
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:10,874
She must be
tens of thousands of years old.

32
00:03:11,728 --> 00:03:13,616
(Invitation)

33
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:15,344
A wedding?

34
00:03:16,434 --> 00:03:17,552
That's right.

35
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,074
With that mortal cultivator?

36
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,195
Next month? So sudden.

37
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,675
Our lady specifically told me

38
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,615
to remind you to bring

39
00:03:30,615 --> 00:03:33,715
the star from the Extranatural Heaven

40
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:34,994
that you owed her.

41
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:37,035
I shall take my leave.

42
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:38,874
Okay, thank you.

43
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:51,135
The place has collapsed.

44
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:52,794
Where can we find her a star?

45
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,755
Can't we just give her any random rock?

46
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,352
That's not nice.

47
00:03:58,994 --> 00:04:00,435
After all, it is her wedding.

48
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:01,755
It's a rare event.

49
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,634
ShenLi, let me ask you.

50
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,514
Do you know what it's like

51
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:10,735
to hold the star
of the Extranatural Heaven

52
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:11,792
in your hands?

53
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:13,995
No, I don't.

54
00:04:13,995 --> 00:04:15,115
That's it.

55
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,515
Just give her a rock

56
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:19,955
and tell her it was
from the Extranatural Heaven.

57
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:23,335
She doesn't have anything
to compare it with.

58
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,355
She'll surely

59
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,634
be thrilled.

60
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:28,074
It's not about that.

61
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:31,395
Don't you feel guilty about it?

62
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:34,864
Do I?

63
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,720
Don't you?

64
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:40,955
Never mind, forget it.

65
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:43,435
Can you handle

66
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,234
the cold of the snowy mountains?

67
00:04:45,914 --> 00:04:47,875
My divine power is much diminished,

68
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:49,815
but still,

69
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:51,634
this is the body of a former god.

70
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:55,935
You should know

71
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,155
that I've recovered.

72
00:04:59,395 --> 00:05:01,194
But you can't ride the clouds.

73
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:03,074
We must hurry and set off.

74
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:05,794
It's been so long. I do miss her.

75
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,995
But she's getting married.

76
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:13,194
Don't you find it hard

77
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:15,754
to link Ms. Jin

78
00:05:16,395 --> 00:05:18,715
to the word "marriage"?

79
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,315
I see her

80
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:24,675
as a woman who remains aloof
from the mundane world.

81
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:28,074
How can she be linked
with something so worldly?

82
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:30,955
Think from another perspective.

83
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:36,754
How much courage would it take

84
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:40,474
to cast aside one's life,
accept another person,

85
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,995
and even change

86
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,715
one's way of living?

87
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,215
I thought you were in good health.

88
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:21,215
Why would I be dressed in layers then?

89
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,224
You think it's fun?

90
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:25,335
Come on.

91
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:27,675
I'm cold. Won't you offer some warmth?

92
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:31,920
So insensitive.

93
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,155
I can't walk like this.

94
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:38,314
You have no choice.

95
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:41,234
It's so cold, Li.

96
00:06:45,474 --> 00:06:46,514
Is it that cold?

97
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,074
It's cold.

98
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:57,264
It's cold.

99
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:18,544
Sister.

100
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:21,634
My lady.

101
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:23,995
Sister, you're finally here.

102
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,515
It's been years

103
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:28,514
and you make me envious
the moment you arrive.

104
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,275
I suddenly feel so cold.

105
00:07:33,395 --> 00:07:34,995
Fine, it's my fault.

106
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,875
I was in a rush, okay?

107
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,835
Why is your inner energy so weak?

108
00:07:44,435 --> 00:07:45,755
I guess I've been too busy.

109
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:46,768
It's alright.

110
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:50,115
His Excellency
doesn't look as robust as before.

111
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:52,795
It's freezing outside.

112
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:53,795
Let's not stay here.

113
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:54,800
I'll take you inside.

114
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,952
Hurry up.

115
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,715
You haven't visited
for such a long time.

116
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:04,875
I've missed you terribly.

117
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:06,895
Well, we're here now.

118
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:07,955
Stay for a few more days.

119
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,675
Ms. Jin, check out my treasure.

120
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,914
I'm not interested.

121
00:08:12,514 --> 00:08:14,175
Don't look at me that way.

122
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:16,335
I'm about to get married.

123
00:08:16,335 --> 00:08:17,775
My husband will be jealous.

124
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,194
Wait, Ms. Jin.

125
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,354
Are you really getting married?

126
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:22,875
I've been doing business here every day.

127
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:25,555
But I've never seen
your husband. Where is he?

128
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:26,995
That's right.

129
00:08:26,995 --> 00:08:29,395
Don't tell me he doesn't care about you.

130
00:08:35,074 --> 00:08:36,715
I've hidden him away

131
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,235
from a folk person like you.

132
00:08:43,674 --> 00:08:45,795
I have honored guests today.
I won't talk business.

133
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:46,864
You may leave.

134
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:48,815
But...

135
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:50,475
It's your fault! Watch it!

136
00:08:51,235 --> 00:08:52,534
You took someone by force?

137
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:53,584
I came for nothing.

138
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:56,240
Let's go.

139
00:08:59,554 --> 00:09:01,535
It was just a bit of coercion.

140
00:09:01,535 --> 00:09:03,815
He and his sect members were injured.

141
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:05,194
I promised to save them

142
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,035
to have him marry me.

143
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:10,448
I didn't exactly

144
00:09:11,114 --> 00:09:12,314
force him, right?

145
00:09:13,235 --> 00:09:14,288
Besides,

146
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,395
I think that

147
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,074
he is into me.

148
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:21,994
(I heard on the way here that)

149
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:24,434
(she'd been pursuing him
for over a decade,)

150
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:25,754
(but he never gave in.)

151
00:09:26,754 --> 00:09:28,235
(He must be very stubborn,)

152
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,874
(proud and dignified.)

153
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:32,395
(But he's getting coerced.)

154
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:34,375
(Is he really into her)

155
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,874
(as she said?)

156
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:37,840
You did well.

157
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:40,655
I bet he likes you.

158
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:43,355
Otherwise,
he wouldn't agree to marry you.

159
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:46,575
Anyway, in my opinion,

160
00:09:46,575 --> 00:09:48,634
you'd better make him yours now

161
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:50,595
lest things change.

162
00:09:52,114 --> 00:09:53,514
Good point, Your Excellency.

163
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:56,735
Take this millennia-old
snow fox's fur coat.

164
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,314
It's much better than your coat.

165
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,554
Then I will take it.

166
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:03,600
Take it.

167
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,694
Your room is ready.

168
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,495
Come on, let me explain everything.

169
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:08,554
- My lady.
- What's wrong?

170
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,616
Mr. Mu coughed again.

171
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:11,696
Wait for me in the room.

172
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,674
How do you know that man likes Ms. Jin?

173
00:10:21,808 --> 00:10:22,896
I don't.

174
00:10:24,194 --> 00:10:26,554
Why do I care if he likes her or not?

175
00:10:27,114 --> 00:10:28,494
Let her pester that man.

176
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,434
It's better than letting her bother you.

177
00:10:33,754 --> 00:10:34,768
You are mine.

178
00:10:38,314 --> 00:10:39,315
Here, put it on.

179
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:40,432
Selfish.

180
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,344
Shameless.

181
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:49,114
Zichun, get up.

182
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:25,040
Are you not feeling well?

183
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:30,736
(Mu Zichun)

184
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:37,074
Are you showing concern for me?

185
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,634
I'm truly delighted.

186
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,035
Don't flatter yourself.

187
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,035
You told me that

188
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:50,235
you sent my sect members away

189
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,314
because they were cured.

190
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:53,456
Would they

191
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,194
be having issues like me?

192
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,088
Zichun,

193
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:10,715
I'm used to being alone.

194
00:12:12,634 --> 00:12:14,775
Thus, I don't explain things to others.

195
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,920
Nor do I lie.

196
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,395
But I seem to
make all the exceptions for you.

197
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:30,155
Your sect members' injuries

198
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:33,634
may be tricky for mortals,

199
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,955
but not for me.

200
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:38,915
I said they were cured.

201
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:40,674
So they were cured.

202
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:48,624
That's it.

203
00:12:50,314 --> 00:12:51,475
There is nothing I can do

204
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,395
if you don't believe me.

205
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,554
Staying in is not good for you.

206
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,035
It's sunny outside today.

207
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:12,575
Rest for a while

208
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,595
and come out for a walk.

209
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:47,194
My lady, are you alright?

210
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:51,760
I'm fine.

211
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,255
We have guests today.

212
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,874
Our lady welcomed them in person.

213
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,215
Our lady rarely pays so much attention

214
00:14:17,215 --> 00:14:18,256
to someone.

215
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:20,615
I caught a glimpse from a distance.

216
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,314
That man was very charming

217
00:14:22,835 --> 00:14:24,175
and way more attractive

218
00:14:24,175 --> 00:14:25,715
than the one in our yard.

219
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,434
What an aura.

220
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:29,634
I heard that

221
00:14:29,634 --> 00:14:31,754
he was quite close to our lady.

222
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,035
Really?

223
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:35,815
It seems that
our guy has upset our lady again.

224
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,374
It happens every other day.

225
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,475
Our lady's patience will be worn out.

226
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:41,715
And with this guest here,

227
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,715
will the wedding take place?

228
00:14:46,074 --> 00:14:47,354
We can't possibly

229
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,915
guess what our lady is thinking.

230
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:10,915
I took care of that evil energy
and saved him

231
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:13,515
out of a moment of kindness.

232
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:14,835
And that gave me

233
00:15:15,475 --> 00:15:17,355
these annoying mortal feelings.

234
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:19,600
Put the tripe in there.

235
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:26,155
So you saved him.

236
00:15:26,674 --> 00:15:27,955
Then, he should be

237
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:29,904
fond of you,

238
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,514
not the other way around.

239
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:32,955
Yeah. Right?

240
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:35,595
He should have been fond of me first.

241
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:37,194
That's what I thought.

242
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:40,015
But he's just a blockhead.

243
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:41,754
You're obsessed.

244
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:43,754
Maybe you don't like him.

245
00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:46,928
Is that so?

246
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,914
Actually, I don't know.

247
00:15:52,914 --> 00:15:55,114
I just wanted to tease him at first.

248
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,395
But the more he resisted,

249
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,595
the less I wanted to give up.

250
00:16:01,514 --> 00:16:02,575
And just like that,

251
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,715
it's been twenty years.

252
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:05,515
At this point,

253
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:08,114
I don't know
if it's an obsession or love.

254
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:15,434
Let's leave that aside.

255
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:16,955
It's been twenty years.

256
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:19,994
I should have won him over, anyway.

257
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,895
But this mortal is like a glacier.

258
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:25,194
I couldn't melt him
with the True Samadhi Fire.

259
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:27,434
Yet, I've found his weak spot.

260
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:29,475
His sect ran into trouble.

261
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:31,475
Only then did I coerce him
into marrying me.

262
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:41,595
Sister, my heart aches so.

263
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,715
The tripe is ready. Dig in.

264
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,035
Is he in love with someone?

265
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,055
Or

266
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,314
does he have a reason
he can't be with you?

267
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:53,835
Has he ever mentioned anything?

268
00:16:55,074 --> 00:16:56,155
Never?

269
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:59,395
You think everyone would have a reason

270
00:16:59,395 --> 00:17:01,194
to remain emotionless
like His Excellency?

271
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,408
She's right.

272
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:06,115
Not everyone

273
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,955
can be as enduring as I am.

274
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,755
You've become increasingly

275
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,560
shameless.

276
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:18,384
You flatter me.

277
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,034
Mu Zichun

278
00:17:29,034 --> 00:17:31,915
was brainwashed by the teachings

279
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:33,034
of the mortal cultivators.

280
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,895
He insists that humans
and demons are different.

281
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:37,034
He refuses to believe

282
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,674
that I'm just into him.

283
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,115
When I forced him to marry me,

284
00:17:41,115 --> 00:17:43,274
he asked me seriously,

285
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:45,194
"What exactly do you want?"

286
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:48,355
I won.

287
00:17:48,355 --> 00:17:49,424
What...

288
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:53,520
Come on.

289
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:03,888
Come on.

290
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,815
He asked me what exactly I wanted.

291
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:11,515
Didn't he see
the rare treasures in my grand hall?

292
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:12,795
A mere mortal

293
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:14,794
had the nerve to ask me what I wanted.

294
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,874
But I didn't even get angry.

295
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:18,034
I just told him,

296
00:18:19,194 --> 00:18:20,515
"My dear, I want you."

297
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,254
Isn't it very sweet?

298
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:26,194
But he answered with a serious face,

299
00:18:28,394 --> 00:18:30,034
"Never serious. Talking nonsense."

300
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,474
Listen to what he said.

301
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,074
Then he turned around and left.

302
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:36,835
I was...

303
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:38,755
I was heartbroken.

304
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,855
Why don't you

305
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,595
see his dull reactions

306
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,280
as a type of

307
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:49,072
shy expression?

308
00:18:50,515 --> 00:18:52,755
I have quite a lot
of dealings with the Divine.

309
00:18:53,394 --> 00:18:54,448
The Divine

310
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:58,935
who started as mortal cultivators

311
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:00,235
are mostly

312
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:01,635
dull, uninteresting,

313
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:03,394
and deeply repressed.

314
00:19:04,674 --> 00:19:06,155
He might feel that

315
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,434
you were teasing him

316
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:09,635
and he couldn't do it to you.

317
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:11,995
So he ran away.

318
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:16,575
So in your opinion,

319
00:19:16,575 --> 00:19:17,914
what is this man thinking?

320
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:20,434
He's not in love with someone.

321
00:19:21,115 --> 00:19:23,674
Nor does he despise you.

322
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:25,712
What he can't let go

323
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:27,794
is just his stubbornness.

324
00:19:28,314 --> 00:19:30,515
In that case, let's give it a try.

325
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:32,400
How?

326
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:34,675
He has been indifferent to you

327
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:35,728
for 20 years.

328
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,314
So he is used to accepting things.

329
00:19:39,794 --> 00:19:41,635
Then take back everything

330
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:42,875
you have given him

331
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,016
and leave him with nothing.

332
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:45,995
Think about it.

333
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:47,234
What have you

334
00:19:47,234 --> 00:19:48,494
given him over the years?

335
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:49,875
Let's take them back one by one.

336
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:54,274
(He's not really helping her, right?)

337
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:56,755
(He just finds it amusing.)

338
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:58,875
(So full of tricks.)

339
00:20:06,115 --> 00:20:07,115
Excuse me.

340
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,955
I won again.

341
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:11,674
You must be cheating.

342
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:13,274
Did you hide something?

343
00:20:14,352 --> 00:20:15,395
Come on, let me see.

344
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:18,194
How come you've never lost?

345
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:20,944
Again.

346
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,674
It seems like I never gave him anything

347
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:30,914
and yet it seems

348
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:33,434
I've given him everything I have.

349
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:35,955
Then take it back.

350
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:38,448
Be in love with

351
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:39,674
someone else for now.

352
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:42,352
Like whom?

353
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:45,520
It has to be me then.

354
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,074
No, I'll do it.

355
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:54,995
What are you looking at? You are mine.

356
00:21:01,584 --> 00:21:02,672
My lady.

357
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,715
Feel free to love me.

358
00:21:12,595 --> 00:21:13,595
What time is it?

359
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,914
I haven't checked on him today.

360
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:17,674
You do that every night?

361
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,534
He's injured.

362
00:21:20,534 --> 00:21:21,552
Will he die?

363
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,344
Not really.

364
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:24,995
Then don't go.

365
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:28,635
Don't forget what we just said.

366
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,224
From now on,

367
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:31,975
take everything back

368
00:21:31,975 --> 00:21:33,115
and leave him with nothing.

369
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:36,595
Not going tonight

370
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:38,715
would be winning the first battle.

371
00:21:41,296 --> 00:21:42,320
Cheers.

372
00:21:43,674 --> 00:21:44,688
Alright.

373
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:52,475
I meant to teach her husband a lesson,

374
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:55,034
but it turned out to cost me my wife.

375
00:21:55,955 --> 00:21:57,034
It's so not worth it.

376
00:21:57,955 --> 00:21:59,595
You were just toying with them.

377
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:01,755
How could I just watch you?

378
00:22:02,715 --> 00:22:03,794
I would be so upset.

379
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:07,794
What should I do?

380
00:22:11,034 --> 00:22:13,554
Our upright Lord Bicang has turned evil.

381
00:22:13,554 --> 00:22:14,695
Ever since I met you,

382
00:22:14,695 --> 00:22:15,794
I've started to turn evil.

383
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,995
Will it work?

384
00:22:24,835 --> 00:22:25,936
Of course.

385
00:22:27,475 --> 00:22:28,515
I know what it's like

386
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:31,115
to lose my love better than anyone.

387
00:22:31,914 --> 00:22:32,976
Don't I?

388
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:54,635
(It was)

389
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:55,995
(such a rare night of peace.)

390
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,154
(She's been pestering me)

391
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,515
(ever since she brought me here.)

392
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:04,355
(Now I actually feel)

393
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,194
(so weird to be left alone for a day.)

394
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:11,074
(Even my heart feels empty.)

395
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:14,355
(She welcomed the guest in person.)

396
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,434
(Is he an old friend?)

397
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:18,955
(Are they very close?)

398
00:23:20,154 --> 00:23:21,274
(What is he like?)

399
00:23:22,256 --> 00:23:23,312
My lady.

400
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,395
These red plum blossoms

401
00:23:25,395 --> 00:23:26,515
are truly delightful.

402
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:29,674
How come I didn't see

403
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,195
such beautiful scenery
the last time I visited?

404
00:23:32,195 --> 00:23:33,215
What a pity.

405
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:34,674
Li, why don't you

406
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,655
stay with me here if you like it?

407
00:23:36,655 --> 00:23:37,744
Alright.

408
00:23:40,314 --> 00:23:41,392
Zichun.

409
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:48,784
He is...

410
00:23:50,074 --> 00:23:51,995
He is my fiancé.

411
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:53,008
Mu Zichun.

412
00:23:53,008 --> 00:23:54,755
Zichun, this is Li.

413
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,115
(Who is this man)

414
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:02,955
(to Ms. Jin?)

415
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:07,235
Ms. Jin,

416
00:24:07,235 --> 00:24:08,554
do you resent me

417
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:11,115
for leaving you ruthlessly back then?

418
00:24:11,955 --> 00:24:13,034
We finally met

419
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:16,154
and you're already
marrying someone else.

420
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:23,115
Can you feel

421
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:26,755
it trembling from the pain?

422
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:36,475
Li.

423
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,715
What are you talking about?

424
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,995
Zichun is here.

425
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:48,314
(I may have had doubts before,)

426
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,475
(but judging from that look,)

427
00:24:50,475 --> 00:24:51,595
(I can put my mind at ease)

428
00:24:52,475 --> 00:24:53,995
(and focus on this drama.)

429
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:00,515
If you're truly in love,

430
00:25:01,355 --> 00:25:02,416
then so be it.

431
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:05,434
But I've heard that

432
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:06,995
this man doesn't

433
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,274
love you at all.

434
00:25:10,515 --> 00:25:12,034
Why would you force it?

435
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:14,254
What does it have to do

436
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:15,312
with you, anyway?

437
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:18,074
Your remark is out of line.

438
00:25:19,568 --> 00:25:20,624
Is that so?

439
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:22,715
In that case,

440
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:26,960
I shouldn't trust the rumors
spread by the servants, huh?

441
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:28,624
In fact,

442
00:25:29,475 --> 00:25:31,434
you do care about Ms. Jin?

443
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:34,635
It's none of your business.

444
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:35,955
Of course, it is.

445
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,274
This is the woman I love.

446
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:42,715
I won't let her

447
00:25:43,674 --> 00:25:44,995
suffer the slightest harm.

448
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:51,794
If you do not truly love her,

449
00:25:53,355 --> 00:25:55,235
I, ShenLi, won't give up on her.

450
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:58,154
Even if I have to do it by force,

451
00:26:00,875 --> 00:26:02,314
I will snatch her

452
00:26:02,314 --> 00:26:03,794
away from you.

453
00:26:15,394 --> 00:26:16,755
Where have you been all these years?

454
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:19,115
Do as you wish.

455
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:22,128
Anyway,

456
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:24,875
I'm merely a prisoner.

457
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:30,928
Don't go.

458
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:37,136
Li.

459
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:38,832
Forget it.

460
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:41,074
This is too embarrassing.

461
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,875
Really? I find it quite effective.

462
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:51,056
My lady.

463
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:52,074
How about

464
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:53,648
we make a bet?

465
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,216
What's the wager?

466
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:57,795
I will make Mu Zichun

467
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:59,835
admit his love for you
before your wedding.

468
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:01,360
Do you believe me?

469
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:05,794
I couldn't make him
confess his love in 20 years.

470
00:27:07,914 --> 00:27:09,115
But if

471
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:10,355
we were to bet,

472
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:12,835
I hope I could end up

473
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,314
utterly defeated.

474
00:27:24,314 --> 00:27:25,360
It will surely

475
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:27,120
end up as you wish.

476
00:27:27,632 --> 00:27:28,688
However,

477
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:30,256
if you lose,

478
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:33,115
what treasure will you give

479
00:27:33,115 --> 00:27:34,274
to ShenLi?

480
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,995
Why did you disguise
as a plum blossom here?

481
00:27:38,515 --> 00:27:39,674
To not miss out on the fun.

482
00:27:41,314 --> 00:27:42,935
You haven't changed at all.

483
00:27:42,935 --> 00:27:44,074
So calculating.

484
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:48,235
Well, I think,

485
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,755
you've seen too many treasures

486
00:27:51,475 --> 00:27:52,554
to fancy anything.

487
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:54,715
But I just

488
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,915
happen to have

489
00:27:55,915 --> 00:27:57,424
an ancient jade pendant.

490
00:27:57,424 --> 00:27:58,554
It can help

491
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,755
injured gods
regulate their energy and recover.

492
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,575
His Excellency

493
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:05,575
wouldn't have fancied it in the past.

494
00:28:05,575 --> 00:28:07,755
But now, it can be

495
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:08,935
a real treasure.

496
00:28:08,935 --> 00:28:11,414
If you obtain this pendant
and wear it all the time,

497
00:28:11,414 --> 00:28:14,074
you may regain
your divine power someday.

498
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:15,856
Really?

499
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:17,552
Why didn't you tell me?

500
00:28:18,515 --> 00:28:20,275
I wouldn't hide it from you.

501
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:22,314
I was hiding it from His Excellency.

502
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:27,314
I shall do my best to get the treasure.

503
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:30,034
To settle this matter,

504
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:32,835
I shall play my part tomorrow.

505
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:49,914
You really

506
00:28:49,914 --> 00:28:51,074
had fun and took advantage

507
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:53,674
of the situation.

508
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,464
Ms. Jin

509
00:28:57,074 --> 00:28:58,274
suffers quite a loss.

510
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:01,795
But I think she's quite happy

511
00:29:01,795 --> 00:29:03,554
to let us gain the advantage.

512
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:05,835
After all, she's the one

513
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:07,504
who benefits in the end.

514
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:14,595
You are yin

515
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:17,355
and I am yang today.

516
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:20,355
It feels

517
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,755
very much like

518
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,074
our good old days.

519
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:32,515
Li, are you used to it?

520
00:29:35,235 --> 00:29:36,240
Yeah.

521
00:29:38,154 --> 00:29:40,115
Li, do you like it?

522
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,144
Yeah.

523
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:50,674
Is that how you love Ms. Jin?

524
00:30:54,715 --> 00:30:56,995
Li, who is this man?

525
00:30:57,554 --> 00:30:58,635
Why is he so mean?

526
00:30:59,344 --> 00:31:00,475
Don't overdo it.

527
00:31:01,154 --> 00:31:02,448
I may not keep up.

528
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:03,515
I trust you.

529
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,314
How dare you playboy

530
00:31:07,995 --> 00:31:09,835
claim that you won't let her suffer?

531
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:11,835
She's going to suffer

532
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:13,154
if she finds out about it.

533
00:31:14,512 --> 00:31:15,568
Then,

534
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:17,595
she can suffer a bit.

535
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:21,904
You were lying to her.

536
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,554
That's right, I was lying.

537
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,394
So what? It's none of your business.

538
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:31,875
I'm a playboy. So what?

539
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:34,434
I was lying to her. So what?

540
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:36,336
Why do you care?

541
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:38,416
That's right.

542
00:31:39,515 --> 00:31:40,934
I'm only after

543
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:42,115
her vast fortune.

544
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,994
I just want to trick her.

545
00:31:44,994 --> 00:31:46,275
Once I obtain

546
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,474
all her gold and treasure,

547
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:49,755
I'll divorce her.

548
00:31:52,048 --> 00:31:53,072
Right.

549
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:56,715
And you'll provide for me
with her vast wealth.

550
00:31:56,715 --> 00:32:00,074
That's right, I'll provide for you
with her vast wealth.

551
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:06,955
What does it have to do with you?

552
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:11,194
I know you don't like her.

553
00:32:11,835 --> 00:32:12,875
Good for you.

554
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,715
I will let you go

555
00:32:15,715 --> 00:32:16,784
once I marry her.

556
00:32:17,328 --> 00:32:18,755
Isn't that what you want?

557
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:20,394
Why are you upset?

558
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:22,955
You despicable man!

559
00:32:25,072 --> 00:32:26,128
Stop.

560
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:31,055
How scary.

561
00:32:31,055 --> 00:32:32,080
Don't be scared.

562
00:32:39,408 --> 00:32:40,464
Do not fall for

563
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:42,672
someone like him.

564
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:47,515
Who should I fall for?

565
00:32:48,835 --> 00:32:49,840
You?

566
00:32:57,235 --> 00:32:58,554
I don't mind him wanting something.

567
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,034
At least, I have a chance.

568
00:33:02,194 --> 00:33:04,235
He's better than those
who desire nothing,

569
00:33:04,794 --> 00:33:06,635
and offer me nothing.

570
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:08,464
You...

571
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:17,995
Do you know what you're doing?

572
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,120
What?

573
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:23,955
Falling for the wrong guy?

574
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:28,074
Isn't it what I've done with you?

575
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,128
What?

576
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:32,794
I'm only allowed to fall for you,

577
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,434
and not anyone else?

578
00:33:37,394 --> 00:33:38,674
You were so reluctant.

579
00:33:39,674 --> 00:33:40,995
Now that you've recovered

580
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:43,835
after so many years,

581
00:33:44,835 --> 00:33:45,968
just leave.

582
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:53,794
I've been pestering you for years.

583
00:33:53,794 --> 00:33:54,864
I'm tired of it.

584
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:57,392
I have finally

585
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:00,074
found a way out.

586
00:34:09,475 --> 00:34:10,608
I will let you go.

587
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:16,435
Pack up your things

588
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:17,584
and go back.

589
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,235
You won't be pestered anymore.

590
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,394
It seems that

591
00:34:34,995 --> 00:34:36,755
you are still deeply in love with me.

592
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,776
See?

593
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,175
I've made myself clear.

594
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:25,475
But he didn't react.

595
00:35:29,275 --> 00:35:30,416
It seems,

596
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:31,534
Your Excellency,

597
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:33,055
you can't win the reward.

598
00:35:33,055 --> 00:35:34,194
I'm going to win.

599
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:36,688
It's not for sure.

600
00:35:37,394 --> 00:35:38,515
Ask your attendant

601
00:35:39,315 --> 00:35:41,555
to pack his things
and send them down the mountain.

602
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,248
Tell him that

603
00:35:44,035 --> 00:35:45,136
you've found your destiny

604
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,795
and can't keep him here.

605
00:35:48,592 --> 00:35:49,680
See if he agrees.

606
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:51,408
That won't do.

607
00:35:51,914 --> 00:35:54,394
Ms. Jin worked hard
to keep Mu Zichun around.

608
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:56,715
We can tell him to leave

609
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:57,834
but we can't throw him out.

610
00:35:58,515 --> 00:35:59,715
Otherwise, her effort

611
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:00,914
would be in vain.

612
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,200
What do you think?

613
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:08,715
What can I think?

614
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:12,035
I've said everything I could say.

615
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:16,275
Let him go if he wants to.

616
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:18,192
I'm really tired.

617
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:20,834
I thought it would be nice

618
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,075
to force him to marry me.

619
00:36:23,235 --> 00:36:24,674
But now that you've tested him,

620
00:36:24,674 --> 00:36:26,275
I'm not so sure about it anymore.

621
00:36:27,696 --> 00:36:28,755
If I really have to

622
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:30,515
spend thousands of years

623
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:31,795
with someone who doesn't

624
00:36:31,795 --> 00:36:33,235
care about me at all,

625
00:36:34,256 --> 00:36:35,312
then I might as well

626
00:36:35,955 --> 00:36:37,394
just remain single

627
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:39,035
and enjoy my life alone.

628
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:46,595
I'll tell them to pack up his things

629
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:47,696
and kick him out.

630
00:37:01,674 --> 00:37:03,235
They have feelings for each other.

631
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:08,194
But this mortal cultivator
is too pedantic.

632
00:37:09,914 --> 00:37:12,555
Are we going to let them part like this?

633
00:37:14,955 --> 00:37:16,080
Do you think

634
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,995
I would let things

635
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:20,176
develop like that?

636
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:22,795
What are you up to now?

637
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:25,744
Just knock out

638
00:37:26,434 --> 00:37:29,134
Ms. Jin in a while.

639
00:37:29,134 --> 00:37:30,192
Why?

640
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:35,354
No more questions.

641
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:19,795
You don't need to comfort me.

642
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:30,640
What are you doing?

643
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:34,896
Helping you.

644
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:38,834
My lady! What did you do, Miss?

645
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,394
Your master

646
00:38:42,434 --> 00:38:44,075
is killed by Lord Bicang.

647
00:38:45,634 --> 00:38:47,235
The entire North Snowy Region

648
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:49,555
now belongs to Lord Bicang.

649
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:52,080
And you have

650
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:54,515
become her subordinates.

651
00:38:57,075 --> 00:38:58,096
Why don't you run?

652
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:01,075
Our lady has been murdered.

653
00:39:01,584 --> 00:39:02,634
Our lady has been murdered.

654
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:03,874
What are you trying to do?

655
00:39:04,715 --> 00:39:05,874
Our lady has been murdered.

656
00:39:05,874 --> 00:39:07,154
Our lady has been murdered.

657
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:08,914
- What happened?
- Our lady has been murdered.

658
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,275
What happened?

659
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:11,755
Go! Get someone!

660
00:39:11,755 --> 00:39:12,915
Our lady has been murdered.

661
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:14,032
Just grab

662
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,394
Ms. Jin's neck and once someone

663
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:18,755
comes to save her,

664
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:21,275
exchange a few moves with that person

665
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:24,154
and let him take her away.

666
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:26,415
Then we can

667
00:39:26,415 --> 00:39:28,675
go home with the reward.

668
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:29,955
How do you know

669
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:31,275
things will go as you said?

670
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:35,515
I have been as annoying as him.

671
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:42,672
I'll grab her.

672
00:40:09,114 --> 00:40:11,354
(I bet he was ready to be killed)

673
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,035
(when he fought for her.)

674
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:21,254
How are we going to

675
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:22,315
deal with the aftermath?

676
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,368
The aftermath?

677
00:40:26,434 --> 00:40:27,594
Is that our concern?

678
00:40:35,275 --> 00:40:36,368
Zichun.

679
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:39,674
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

680
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:43,315
I...

681
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,368
Are you hurt?

682
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,475
Rest assured, I will heal you.

683
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:58,515
I think Li only knocked me out.

684
00:41:14,475 --> 00:41:16,114
I-I see what happened.

685
00:41:17,674 --> 00:41:18,815
Zichun, don't be mad.

686
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:20,315
I didn't come up with this.

687
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,394
What I said still counts.

688
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:31,984
Thank goodness.

689
00:41:33,315 --> 00:41:34,384
Thank goodness.

690
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,595
My lady.

691
00:42:42,595 --> 00:42:44,354
This is the star
from the Extranatural Heaven

692
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,975
sent by Lord Bicang and Lord Xingzhi.

693
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:47,235
Congratulations.

694
00:42:53,914 --> 00:42:55,154
Who wants their fake stone?

695
00:43:01,275 --> 00:43:02,320
Leave it here.

696
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:09,434
Tell them that

697
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:10,515
this marriage

698
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:12,194
is the best gift they have offered.

699
00:43:12,795 --> 00:43:14,000
I really appreciate it.

700
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:16,496
Also,

701
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,354
this jade pendant is my gift for them.

702
00:43:19,995 --> 00:43:21,040
Understood.

703
00:43:31,394 --> 00:43:32,515
Ms. Jin is married.

704
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:34,768
So happy.

705
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:40,912
Do you want

706
00:43:41,594 --> 00:43:42,640
a wedding ceremony?

707
00:43:52,515 --> 00:43:53,594
We haven't

708
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:56,235
had a wedding yet.

709
00:43:57,154 --> 00:43:58,235
I used to find it

710
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:00,055
troublesome

711
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,075
and unnecessary.

712
00:44:02,315 --> 00:44:03,955
But I watched the ceremonies

713
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:05,808
and suddenly felt that

714
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:08,715
it would be nice to

715
00:44:08,715 --> 00:44:09,995
introduce my beloved one

716
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:13,035
to everyone I know.

717
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,664
Li.

718
00:44:20,995 --> 00:44:22,075
Will you marry me?

719
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:25,755
I'll organize a wedding

720
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:28,315
blessed by a hundred thousand deities.

721
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:37,872
Alright, then.

722
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:41,555
But you'll need to hurry.

723
00:44:42,914 --> 00:44:43,995
I won't look nice

724
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,035
in a dress with a belly.

725
00:45:01,114 --> 00:45:02,154
It is so rare

726
00:45:02,154 --> 00:45:04,594
to see you so stunned.

727
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:26,000
Li.

728
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,496
Master Shen.

729
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:34,534
Master Shen, wait for me.

730
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:36,755
