1
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,911
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,444
It seems trickier than I imagined.

4
00:01:59,564 --> 00:02:01,884
Get up, time to work.

5
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:10,876
Be good.

6
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:05,372
Well done.

7
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:08,563
Will there be fish here?

8
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:10,844
Of course.

9
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,203
Where and what

10
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,283
are the other two seals?

11
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:21,224
One of them is
right on the training ground

12
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:22,763
in your military camp.

13
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:26,003
Tell your people
to excuse themselves once we return.

14
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:27,580
I'll reinforce the seal.

15
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:32,844
The other one is the fine steel chain
that pulls the Xutian Abyss.

16
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:35,563
It's right at the entrance to the abyss.

17
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:42,604
Wood on the mountaintop.
Water in the lake.

18
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:47,524
Earth in the camp.
Metal in front of the Xutian Abyss.

19
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:49,532
What about fire?

20
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:55,643
It's hard to apply the double seal
without all five elements.

21
00:03:57,884 --> 00:04:00,003
I will naturally find the fire element

22
00:04:00,604 --> 00:04:03,604
once I take care of those two seals.

23
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:04,604
Rest assured.

24
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,164
I've come to the Immortal Realm.

25
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:11,524
I'll naturally restore
the peace to the Xutian Abyss. Let's go.

26
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:35,868
You found out.

27
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,603
I just remembered
the water-repelling spell

28
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:47,524
stopped requiring hand-holding
about a thousand years ago.

29
00:04:48,724 --> 00:04:51,643
It was working just fine.

30
00:04:54,603 --> 00:04:57,124
It's been so long and I forgot about it.

31
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:11,004
(Stop thinking about it.
Xingyun has passed away.)

32
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,643
This is the Earth Seal?

33
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:32,860
That's right.

34
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:56,363
Then, please start restoring the seal.

35
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:02,084
Come back. The restoration of this seal
is not as easy as you think.

36
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:05,444
I shall not be interrupted.

37
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:07,123
Keep an eye out for me.

38
00:06:07,123 --> 00:06:08,684
I don't want anyone to disturb me.

39
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,204
Who would disturb you?

40
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:18,244
(Why did I feel a bit uncomfortable?)

41
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,244
The restoration of Earth Seal
is now complete.

42
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:41,363
Let's go to the Xutian Abyss.

43
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,404
I shall return to the capital
for punishment once we're done.

44
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:04,724
Three seals have been restored.

45
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:06,684
But the miasma here

46
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:10,244
is still smothering
those who wish to approach.

47
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,964
One can imagine just how bad it was

48
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,244
before the restoration.

49
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,004
(Totally identical.)

50
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:47,292
What's wrong?

51
00:08:49,484 --> 00:08:53,044
Nothing. The situation here
is a tiny bit worse

52
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:57,404
than I imagined, but it doesn't matter.

53
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:31,803
Relax. They can't come out.

54
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:11,484
(I must slay the gods.)

55
00:11:12,364 --> 00:11:15,203
(I must slay the gods.)

56
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:21,803
(I must slay the gods.)

57
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:24,572
ShenLi.

58
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:00,700
It is...

59
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:02,812
The aura of filth.

60
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:14,683
The Scorpion-Tailed Fox swallowed you
during the fight, which infected you

61
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,484
with miasma.

62
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:19,044
You're from Immortal Realm,

63
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:22,084
and that makes you
more susceptible to miasma.

64
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,323
But it's okay. Don't worry.

65
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,284
I cleared the miasma for you just now.

66
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:35,803
(The Forest Seal drove away
evil spirits and removed the filth)

67
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:37,563
(to stabilize your energy.)

68
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:43,100
(Then, the Water Seal purified your mind)

69
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,763
(and helped you remain calm and composed.)

70
00:12:48,844 --> 00:12:51,724
(Finally, I cleared your miasma
with the profound strength)

71
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:53,763
(of the Earth Seal.)

72
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:02,844
That's why I must lead the way.

73
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:05,916
Just for that?

74
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,883
Yeah, just for that.

75
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,643
The Fire Seal
lies inside the Xutian Abyss.

76
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,003
You are clear of miasma now.

77
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:32,443
So you don't have to come with me.

78
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:37,243
Feel free to reorganize
your troops in the camp.

79
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:41,203
I shall return
to the Divine Realm once I'm done.

80
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,404
And I will not trouble you any further.

81
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:57,203
Thank you for helping
the Immortal Realm, Your Excellency.

82
00:14:30,443 --> 00:14:32,763
What is it? Just talk.

83
00:14:34,268 --> 00:14:35,292
Your Lordship.

84
00:14:35,964 --> 00:14:39,604
How could you just
let His Excellency leave?

85
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:44,123
He wanted to leave.
How could I possibly stop him?

86
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:49,604
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I would have spoken to him.

87
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:53,203
What's going on?
It's just been a few days.

88
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,724
Don't tell me he's won your heart.

89
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:06,123
You sound more and more
astonishing these days.

90
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:10,364
How could a dignified man like me
entertain such thoughts?

91
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:14,723
I just think that the capital
is threatened by the miasma.

92
00:15:14,723 --> 00:15:16,704
If His Excellency could make a visit,

93
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:19,044
even if he doesn't cast spells
to clear the miasma,

94
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,284
he can keep the capital
clean for some days.

95
00:15:22,404 --> 00:15:25,524
Besides, I've promised my wife

96
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,364
we'd watch the bright moon.

97
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:34,940
I shall take my leave.

98
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:05,564
What's up?

99
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:11,084
I didn't expect someone
as powerful as you to be shy.

100
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:24,163
I came here even though I knew
you wouldn't be here.

101
00:17:31,004 --> 00:17:34,724
Is there something wrong with me?

102
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:00,163
This aura is so familiar.

103
00:18:32,956 --> 00:18:33,980
Kill her.

104
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,484
(Inside the Xutian Abyss)

105
00:18:37,923 --> 00:18:39,244
Kill her.

106
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:42,724
Kill her.

107
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:43,804
Shut up.

108
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:50,024
Kill her...

109
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,068
Shut up.

110
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,004
Kill her.

111
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:47,043
Is this the Xutian Abyss?

112
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,644
Clever, Your Lordship.

113
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,084
Then why are you here?

114
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,604
I've restored the seals.

115
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:03,403
But a couple of Chimei held me back.

116
00:20:03,964 --> 00:20:06,563
I've put in much effort
to restore the seals

117
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,504
in the past few days.

118
00:20:08,504 --> 00:20:11,523
They took advantage of it
and got the better of me.

119
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:15,724
Are you injured?

120
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,244
The miasma has been pervasive
in the Xutian Abyss for many years.

121
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:24,124
I couldn't manage to escape it yet.

122
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:28,124
So, I'm strolling around
with nothing better to do.

123
00:20:31,323 --> 00:20:32,884
The dangerous Xutian Abyss

124
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:37,604
is just a casual place
for you to take a stroll.

125
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,323
My worries seem unnecessary.

126
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,403
You are not strolling
here like me, right?

127
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:53,364
I have no such interest.

128
00:20:57,244 --> 00:20:59,323
I was just patrolling with my soldiers

129
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:05,403
and came here. I got too close.

130
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:10,124
Then, a strange force dragged me in.

131
00:21:20,523 --> 00:21:23,244
Even you got dragged in?

132
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:28,163
These Chimei are truly interesting.

133
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,404
Not at all.

134
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,244
Is there a way to get me out of here?

135
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:40,124
Tomorrow, I'm returning
to the Immortal Realm capital

136
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,644
with General Shangbei.

137
00:21:43,004 --> 00:21:47,068
If they find me missing in the morning,
they will surely think...

138
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:53,044
They will surely think
I have run away from the marriage.

139
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:57,163
It'd be chaotic again.

140
00:21:59,004 --> 00:22:01,724
Too bad we can't get out now.

141
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:12,844
It's over. I'm doomed.

142
00:22:13,443 --> 00:22:15,244
Why can't you act like a grown-up?

143
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:18,004
You ran away again under my watch?

144
00:22:18,844 --> 00:22:20,563
What the heck?

145
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:23,364
They're going to kill me.

146
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:28,043
Her Lordship ran away again.

147
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,524
She lost 500 years
of cultivation last time

148
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,844
and Her Holiness
locked her up in the Xueji Palace.

149
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,964
How dare she run away again?

150
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:41,163
She didn't just run away
from marriage this time.

151
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:45,163
Lord Xingzhi
hasn't returned either, has he?

152
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,803
He just restored the seal

153
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:50,084
and disappeared into thin air.

154
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:54,403
And Her Lordship
happened to have run away.

155
00:22:55,923 --> 00:22:57,283
You're saying...

156
00:22:58,523 --> 00:23:01,244
The two of them must have...

157
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,443
Eloped?

158
00:23:02,443 --> 00:23:03,884
Keep it down.

159
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:07,863
Look, doesn't His Excellency

160
00:23:07,863 --> 00:23:10,403
resemble the mortal
Her Lordship once liked?

161
00:23:11,604 --> 00:23:13,844
Her Lordship has been leading
him around.

162
00:23:14,364 --> 00:23:15,764
Here and there...

163
00:23:16,476 --> 00:23:17,563
Here and there...

164
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,563
Here and there...

165
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,043
And that's it.

166
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:21,644
She found her new love.

167
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:22,803
He became a substitute.

168
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,484
She has fallen for him.

169
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:29,764
I'm even speculating...

170
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:31,683
Enough with your speculation.

171
00:23:33,764 --> 00:23:34,844
- Forgive us.
- Forgive us.

172
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:37,203
We accept any punishment.

173
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:38,404
How can you talk nonsense

174
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:40,043
about His Excellency and Her Lordship?

175
00:23:41,436 --> 00:23:42,544
We apologize.

176
00:23:42,544 --> 00:23:44,244
All three of you.

177
00:23:44,244 --> 00:23:45,964
Run 200 laps around the camp.

178
00:23:48,284 --> 00:23:49,304
- Yes.
- Yes.

179
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,364
Wait.

180
00:23:54,964 --> 00:23:56,604
Repeat your speculation

181
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,443
for me.

182
00:24:01,563 --> 00:24:05,724
General, in the beginning,
maybe they didn't get together.

183
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:08,283
- But they got along, right?
- And they eloped.

184
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,124
They got together.

185
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,704
Do you remember earlier...

186
00:24:11,704 --> 00:24:13,484
- It just happened...
- They were...

187
00:24:25,484 --> 00:24:28,523
Lord Xingzhi, I'm not joking with you.

188
00:24:29,283 --> 00:24:31,604
We can't tell the time in Xutian Abyss.

189
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,044
General Shangbei

190
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:36,683
may have returned by the time we get out

191
00:24:37,764 --> 00:24:39,424
and filed a complaint to Her Holiness.

192
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,964
I'd be punished again.

193
00:24:43,043 --> 00:24:45,124
I would accept it if I did run away.

194
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:49,563
But it'd be unfair to be punished

195
00:24:50,683 --> 00:24:52,084
for something I didn't do.

196
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:56,043
Do I look like I'm lying?

197
00:24:58,844 --> 00:25:00,764
You never do even if you are lying.

198
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:07,043
Then let me tell you. We can't get out.

199
00:25:09,644 --> 00:25:10,724
Is it fun to tease me?

200
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,084
Yeah.

201
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:19,264
Do you think I'm always lying to you?

202
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:20,884
Weren't you?

203
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:23,443
I had to lead the way.

204
00:25:24,043 --> 00:25:25,872
We had to hold hands
when use water-repelling spell.

205
00:25:26,364 --> 00:25:29,884
I had to keep an eye out for you.
Weren't those lies?

206
00:25:34,043 --> 00:25:38,124
It makes some sense
when you put it that way.

207
00:25:39,323 --> 00:25:40,424
Didn't you realize

208
00:25:40,424 --> 00:25:44,964
that everything I did was to
remove the miasma from your body?

209
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:50,163
Don't you appreciate it?
Aren't you grateful?

210
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:53,724
Thank you for saving me.

211
00:25:54,523 --> 00:25:56,283
So, can we get out now?

212
00:25:59,884 --> 00:26:00,964
You are so stubborn.

213
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:07,323
I didn't intend to scare you with this.

214
00:26:10,364 --> 00:26:11,484
It's...

215
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:16,668
I got wounded by a demon
when I was working on the Fire Seal.

216
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,704
They wanted to disturb
my power of tranquility

217
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,043
to weaken the power of the seal.

218
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:29,283
But they didn't know
once the seal was formed,

219
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:33,163
it wouldn't disappear
even if I died here

220
00:26:34,283 --> 00:26:36,443
unless 1,000 years had passed.

221
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:39,764
The Xutian Abyss is the first seal.

222
00:26:40,964 --> 00:26:42,244
However, such a vast seal

223
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:47,443
can't be sustained for long,
even by divine power.

224
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:52,964
(Therefore, I took
the five elements from nature.)

225
00:26:52,964 --> 00:26:54,923
(The spirit wood from the mountain peak,)

226
00:26:58,124 --> 00:26:59,683
(the spiritual beasts from the lake,)

227
00:27:04,244 --> 00:27:05,884
(and the earth from underground)

228
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:11,563
(formed a cage, locking Chimei within.)

229
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:15,364
(Then, I formed a second seal.)

230
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,043
For the second seal,

231
00:27:23,124 --> 00:27:26,364
I placed the Fire Seal
within the Xutian Abyss,

232
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:29,604
to merge dual seal.

233
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:32,844
First, those who wish to break the seal

234
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,244
can't destroy dual seal

235
00:27:35,964 --> 00:27:38,803
from inside and outside at once.

236
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:40,764
It wins more time

237
00:27:40,764 --> 00:27:42,644
for the seal protectors.

238
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:49,683
Then, the first seal relies on
the mountains, waters, and earth.

239
00:27:50,764 --> 00:27:53,323
The power of nature makes it
more robust and enduring.

240
00:27:56,724 --> 00:28:01,844
But such power is not inexhaustible.

241
00:28:03,004 --> 00:28:04,203
It's been 1,000 years.

242
00:28:04,964 --> 00:28:06,884
Such power has almost been depleted.

243
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,964
So I came here to reinforce the power,

244
00:28:10,964 --> 00:28:12,724
which can strengthen the seal.

245
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,044
After the dual seal,

246
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:19,443
this place is supported
by the energy of heaven and earth.

247
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:23,403
It follows the way of nature
to lock away the miasma.

248
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:30,884
So, I can't leave before I recover.

249
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:33,364
As for you,

250
00:28:36,844 --> 00:28:41,244
I have removed
the toxic miasma from your body.

251
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:46,084
But, the Xutian Abyss is
filled with miasma.

252
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:50,764
You are an Immortal,
so you can't purify yourself.

253
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:52,523
And you are so susceptible to miasma.

254
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,884
The miasma doesn't do much to you.

255
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:01,724
But the seal keeps you trapped here.

256
00:29:03,884 --> 00:29:05,864
I can't detoxify you

257
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:07,443
before I recover.

258
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:10,884
As for you...

259
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:13,043
Just tell me when you will recover.

260
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:19,443
It won't take long.
Maybe after a stroll or two.

261
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:26,923
So, you don't have to worry.

262
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:30,443
If we get out late,

263
00:29:31,244 --> 00:29:33,323
I'll accompany you
to the Immortal Realm Capital

264
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:36,203
and explain to Her Holiness.

265
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:40,403
I'm sure she won't blame you.

You...

When ancient gods like you fall asleep,

286
00:31:08,644 --> 00:31:11,164
can your divine consciousness
take a human form

287
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:13,163
and live its life in the Mortal Realm?

288
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:15,036
Perhaps.

289
00:31:24,043 --> 00:31:25,052
What's wrong?

290
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:34,124
Nothing. You sometimes
remind me of someone I know.

291
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:44,860
Really?

292
00:31:46,923 --> 00:31:51,244
It's not common
to find someone similar to me.

293
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:55,612
Exactly.

294
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:04,283
Lord Bicang, it may not be good
to be obsessively attached

295
00:32:05,244 --> 00:32:06,803

Thank you for your kind advice.

300
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:35,964
I heard you ran away from the marriage.

301
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:39,644
Is there anything wrong with Furong?

302
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:43,184
Would you like someone
with all the scandals

303
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:44,604
to be your partner?

304
00:32:45,283 --> 00:32:47,103
You issued the order for our marriage

305
00:32:47,103 --> 00:32:48,764
and got me into serious trouble.

306
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,523
I'm curious. Why did you
marry me off to him?

307
00:32:54,084 --> 00:32:55,100
Because...

308
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,523
Is the water turning cold?

309
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:10,164
Get me some snacks.

310
00:33:10,164 --> 00:33:11,260
Yes.

311
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:15,044
My lord...

312
00:33:15,044 --> 00:33:16,092
Stop there.

313
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:21,124
Don't contaminate my sacred
bathing place with all the dirt.

314
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:25,864
My lord, news came from
the Immortal Realm that Lord Bicang

315
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:27,864
had killed the Chimei that escaped

316
00:33:27,864 --> 00:33:29,403
from the Xutian Abyss.

317
00:33:31,364 --> 00:33:33,964
What? So soon?

318
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:36,784
Not only that, I also heard that

319
00:33:36,784 --> 00:33:39,124
she was enshrouded
in dark energy like an Asura

320
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:42,004
during her battle with the Chimei.

321
00:33:44,844 --> 00:33:46,704
With a slash of her blade,

322
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:48,484
she severed the Chimei in half.

323
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:59,204
She opened her mouth wide

324
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,364
and devoured Chimei on the spot.

325
00:34:02,203 --> 00:34:05,323
Her eyes turned red from the feasting.

326
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,723
C-Come here.

327
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:20,988
She devoured the Chimei?

328
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:27,864
She... Others say that
she was devoured by the Chimei,

329
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:29,844
and carved her way out.

330
00:34:30,604 --> 00:34:33,323
Anyway, she was drenched in blood,
with a deadly aura.

331
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:42,884
And the Heavenly Lord sent a message,

332
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:46,404
telling you to spend some time
with Lord Bicang in the Immortal Realm.

333
00:34:50,323 --> 00:34:52,723
Help me get dressed.

334
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:55,484
I have to talk to Grandfather. Hurry.

335
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,572
Alright.

336
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,036
(To the Heavenly Lord)
(Please tell me if Lord Xingzhi descended)

337
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:00,816
(to lower realms a few months ago?)

338
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:02,164
That's impressive.

339
00:35:06,644 --> 00:35:07,883
Do you remember what

340
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:10,684
Lord Xingzhi told us
on the day he returned?

341
00:35:11,523 --> 00:35:14,164
He wanted you to cover for him
if anyone inquired about

342
00:35:14,164 --> 00:35:15,884
his travels to the lower realm.

343
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:20,103
Back then, I wondered

344
00:35:20,103 --> 00:35:22,364
why he would say that.

345
00:35:22,884 --> 00:35:24,644
And it was a strange request.

346
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:27,523
Now, I get it.

347
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:32,604
He had foreseen it all.

348
00:35:34,124 --> 00:35:37,404
Why would Her Holiness
inquire about Lord Xingzhi?

349
00:35:38,084 --> 00:35:40,364
Is there another disturbance
in the Immortal Realm?

350
00:35:41,884 --> 00:35:42,972
It's hard to tell.

351
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,323
His Excellency has given me a warning.

352
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:48,763
So he is fully aware of it.

353
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:53,404
All we need to do is act along
and stay out of trouble.

354
00:35:55,084 --> 00:35:57,204
There must be
a solid reason why he wants

355
00:35:57,884 --> 00:36:00,763
a marriage alliance
between Furong and Lord Bicang.

356
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:05,563
Furong was causing quite a scene.
I was thinking about delaying it.

357
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,283
But this letter convinced me

358
00:36:08,283 --> 00:36:11,483
that we must not ruin
His Excellency's plans.

359
00:36:14,523 --> 00:36:17,244
No! Grandfather!

360
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:22,164
Please don't do this. Grandfather!

361
00:36:22,164 --> 00:36:26,243
Please don't do this!

362
00:36:28,523 --> 00:36:32,024
Don't do this.
I-I don't want to spend any time with ShenLi.

363
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:35,283
I-I'm just a loser
who doesn't know love.

364
00:36:35,283 --> 00:36:39,003
Stop wailing. You always howl
like a pig being slaughtered.

365
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:41,883
Can't you train yourself more

366
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,364
to enhance your cultivation?

367
00:36:44,444 --> 00:36:45,723
Then you can howl less

368
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:47,424
to be less embarrassing

369
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:48,483
when ShenLi beats you up.

370
00:36:48,483 --> 00:36:52,043
Please, no! Grandfather!

371
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:54,804
Don't be so pessimistic!

372
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:55,964
You're the worst.

373
00:36:58,803 --> 00:36:59,804
Don't slide over.

374
00:37:22,884 --> 00:37:27,444
She ate the Chimei. All bloody.

375
00:37:29,444 --> 00:37:33,084
She's going to eat me. Help...

376
00:38:00,483 --> 00:38:04,283
Stay back...

377
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:08,684
What's wrong? Are you sick?

378
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,803
Come on, take your medicine.

379
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:15,204
This is the blood from your heart.

380
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:23,844
