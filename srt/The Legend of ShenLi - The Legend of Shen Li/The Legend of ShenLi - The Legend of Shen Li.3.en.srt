00:01:36,148 --> 00:01:39,248
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:44,657
You want to let them stay
a bit longer, don't you?

4
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:49,137
Even if just for a moment.

5
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,417
But my formation won't last long.

6
00:02:05,057 --> 00:02:09,296
Do you know that by staying
by her side for more than a decade,

7
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:12,177
you've already shortened her lifespan?

8
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:30,697
More than a decade? You've been
with me for more than a decade?

9
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:26,192
Yunniang.

10
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:21,816
Sanlang, is that true?

11
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:29,657
If you remain in the mortal realm,

12
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:34,816
not only will you harm her,
but you will also have nowhere to go.

13
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:40,457
Naturally, this is your choice to make.

14
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:06,657
Sanlang, don't go!

15
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:10,497
Sanlang, where are you?

16
00:05:12,616 --> 00:05:15,297
Don't go, Sanlang.

17
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:21,256
Even if it shortens my life,
I want to be with you.

18
00:05:23,776 --> 00:05:26,256
Sanlang!

19
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,536
Sanlang.

20
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,024
I am willing to go.

21
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:25,577
I can place the formation,
but I have no power.

22
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:27,728
Can you help me?

23
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:31,656
Yes, this is the only spell

24
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:35,216
I will not fail no matter what.

25
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,777
I summon the River
of Forgetfulness in my name.

26
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,408
Madam.

27
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:09,656
He did this for you to live better.

28
00:09:14,536 --> 00:09:20,376
I know. He wanted to
set my mind at ease.

29
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:43,664
Why are you laughing?

30
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,704
You saved someone.

31
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:50,057
But you don't seem very satisfied.

32
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:57,216
This unsatisfying result
has been decided

33
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,737
fifteen years ago.

34
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:04,376
You seem to be deeply moved.

35
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:07,537
I've been to the battlefield.

36
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,816
I've seen too many die
on the battlefield.

37
00:10:13,736 --> 00:10:19,897
Not everyone is fortunate enough
to ascend to immortality.

38
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:34,137
I don't know whether what
I said to her is right or wrong.

39
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:39,056
But if I had family or a lover,

40
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,200
when I were to leave,

41
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:46,736
I'd wish for them to forget me soon.

42
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:49,936
Because the past is an illusion.

43
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:52,977
Only the future can be called life.

44
00:10:57,176 --> 00:11:01,657
Silly, only the present
can be called life.

45
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,536
You're right.

46
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:12,457
I thought you were
indifferent to people.

47
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,936
But you're willing to help when needed.

48
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:21,520
I just wanted to help you. Let's go.

49
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:30,577
Save me!

50
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:33,137
How did you fall?

51
00:11:33,137 --> 00:11:34,816
Can't you swim?

52
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,696
- No.
- I can't, either.

53
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:38,977
Think of something!

54
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:44,097
If you can't swim,
why do you live by the water?

55
00:11:47,936 --> 00:11:49,017
Well, fine.

56
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,017
Why did you have to pull my hair?

57
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:52,097
Why did you fall into
the water while walking?

58
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:55,736
It already happened.
Do you have to blame me?

59
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:57,936
Of course.

60
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:04,017
Aren't you afraid of water?

61
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:10,777
This is the last time.
I've already turned into a human.

62
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,816
I should go. I won't serve you anymore.

63
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:26,777
Why did I transform back?

64
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:27,888
What have you transformed into?

65
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:33,696
Stop laughing. You're a drowned rat too.

66
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,217
Don't. How dare you?

67
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:44,816
I saw it with my own eyes.

68
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:47,577
Is it true?

69
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,017
I wouldn't dare to deceive you, Sir.

70
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,097
My sister was crazy a few days ago.

71
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:57,897
Now, she's become normal again.

72
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,496
I witnessed the miracle
that night with my own eyes.

73
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:02,936
The glowing light was visible
for miles around.

74
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,457
The Divine turned his chicken
into a beautiful woman,

75
00:15:05,457 --> 00:15:07,577
and then turned her back into a chicken.

76
00:15:12,816 --> 00:15:13,904
That's interesting.

77
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:15,977
(Gu Chengrui, Eldest Young Master
of Qingsheng City)

78
00:15:15,977 --> 00:15:17,296
You may leave.

79
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:18,384
Yes.

80
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:21,168
Bin.

81
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:23,506
Bring that person here.

82
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,656
Let's see what he is capable of.

83
00:15:25,616 --> 00:15:27,331
- Yes.
- Go.

84
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,616
More massage, okay?

85
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,272
(This is strange.)

86
00:15:51,736 --> 00:15:52,977
(Why can't I transform again?)

87
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:56,017
(I succeeded that night.)

88
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:59,577
(And my spiritual power
has almost recovered now.)

89
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:01,816
(Why can't it work?)

90
00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:12,097
You've been holding onto
this rag since this morning.

91
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,097
What are you doing?

92
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,777
I'm altering clothes for you.

93
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:16,736
Getting ready for your human form.

94
00:16:17,337 --> 00:16:20,176
My clothes are too big for you.

95
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,217
Such ugly tailoring, I won't wear it.

96
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,456
You will.

97
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:29,417
You've been fussing about all morning.
Aren't you hungry?

98
00:16:30,928 --> 00:16:31,984
I am.

99
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:34,512
Wait.

100
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:58,897
I haven't asked you yet.

101
00:16:59,897 --> 00:17:04,417
You're a mortal without spiritual power,
but you can divine the secrets of heaven.

102
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:07,017
And you know so many formations.

103
00:17:09,537 --> 00:17:11,457
Who exactly are you?

104
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:13,168
A good person.

105
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:16,897
In my opinion, you're just a weirdo.

106
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,457
Weird temperament, weird behavior.

107
00:17:21,017 --> 00:17:23,217
Look at me.

108
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:25,977
I can speak and even turn into a human.

109
00:17:28,977 --> 00:17:30,936
You're neither curious nor afraid,

110
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:32,616
and you even keep me at home.

111
00:17:34,376 --> 00:17:37,457
Have you figured out my identity?

112
00:17:38,897 --> 00:17:41,657
Divination is not a good skill.

113
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,337
I don't want to do it, either.

114
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:47,657
I didn't ask because I didn't want to.

115
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:51,977
Fate is all planned out for people.
Too many questions are pointless.

116
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:55,536
We just need to know
we won't harm each other.

117
00:17:57,657 --> 00:18:00,616
Are you an unlucky
disciple of some deity

118
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,517
who descended to undergo tribulations?

119
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:05,616
Do not overthink.

120
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:10,897
I just want to prove that I am not
some deity's unlucky disciple

121
00:18:10,897 --> 00:18:12,248
who descended to undergo tribulations.

122
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:15,577
Prove? What do you mean?

123
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:21,256
Where is the meat? Spit it out.

124
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:24,897
Spit it out! I haven't
had a single bite.

125
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:28,696
You scum, I haven't had a bite yet.

126
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:31,217
You ate it all? Spit it out!

127
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:34,897
Spit it out, and give it back!

128
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:39,817
Give it back! Darn it!

129
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,040
Coming.

130
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:58,057
Sir, my master invites you for a visit.

131
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:01,376
I reckon you're at the wrong door.

132
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,552
We know who we are looking for.

133
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:08,537
Sir, please come with us.

134
00:19:09,137 --> 00:19:10,537
I don't like being forced.

135
00:19:14,576 --> 00:19:16,976
I don't like wasting time on words.

136
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,536
- Take him.
- Let's go.

137
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,216
- Get up.
- What are you doing?

138
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,464
How dare you.

139
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:35,120
Who is there?

140
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:41,736
Who are you lackeys?

141
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:44,157
How dare you bully my...

142
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:47,642
My servant?

143
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:50,376
Looking for your demise?

144
00:19:52,576 --> 00:19:54,137
Miss, you speak boldly.

145
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:59,216
By the order of the eldest young
master of Qingsheng City,

146
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,917
we came to invite
this gentleman to our residence.

147
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:03,897
Be sensible, Miss.

148
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:05,488
Sensible?

149
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,976
(Order)

150
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:16,736
Then teach me how to spell them.

151
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:25,856
Whoever wishes to see my servant,

152
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:28,736
I don't care who he is,

153
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:29,904
tell him to come by himself.

154
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:31,632
Let's go.

155
00:20:37,177 --> 00:20:42,336
Since when did I become
your servant? Funny.

156
00:20:47,576 --> 00:20:48,656
What is this?

157
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:55,537
What is this?

158
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,768
A stone.

159
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:00,496
Want to get beaten up again?

160
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:09,976
You saw through my tricks.

161
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:15,984
Fine, this is the stone placed
over the focal point of the formation.

162
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:17,937
Why place a stone on the formation?

163
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,017
To suppress its power.

164
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,104
For what?

165
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:32,976
When the stone was removed
and no longer suppressed its power,

166
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:37,376
you turned into human form
in an instant, didn't you?

167
00:21:39,096 --> 00:21:41,336
Keeping a distance between men
and women is my principle.

168
00:21:42,096 --> 00:21:45,256
It is also one of the most important
reasons why I put this stone here.

169
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:50,456
It's not good for us
to live under the same roof,

170
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:53,297
is it?

171
00:21:57,976 --> 00:21:58,976
When did you place it?

172
00:22:02,057 --> 00:22:03,057
It's been a while.

173
00:22:03,057 --> 00:22:04,144
When?

174
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:10,417
The first night you arrived.

175
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:22,864
In other words,

176
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:30,960
I should have regained
my human form long ago.

177
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:41,744
You had no idea

178
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:46,177
how much this stone
has damaged my dignity.

179
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:51,456
No, you should have known it.

180
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:56,137
You probably secretly laughed at me,

181
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,817
wanting to see how much
longer I would struggle.

182
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:03,657
The only way to quell
my hatred is to kill you.

183
00:23:06,096 --> 00:23:07,456
Having suffered this great humiliation,

184
00:23:09,177 --> 00:23:10,616
I will make you pay for it.

185
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:12,240
Come out.

186
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,984
My arm!

187
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:24,417
You grabbed me so violently.

188
00:23:30,697 --> 00:23:32,817
My arm seems to be broken.

189
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,057
I did save your life once, remember?

190
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,256
Cluck Cluck, was it necessary
to break my arm?

191
00:23:43,017 --> 00:23:47,256
It broke? Are you mortals made of paper?

192
00:23:48,057 --> 00:23:52,176
I did use a stone
to suppress the formation,

193
00:23:53,236 --> 00:23:55,137
which caused your humiliation.

194
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:58,697
But it was unintentional.

195
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:01,336
Do you have to break my arm?

196
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:06,657
Why are you so cruel to me?

197
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,537
(This person is already frail.)

198
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:17,456
(Did he really suffer a serious injury?)

199
00:24:22,777 --> 00:24:26,897
(Weak, slow, he's close to death.)

200
00:24:31,616 --> 00:24:36,897
It hurts so much. I'm going to die.

201
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:42,496
You should pay for laughing at me.

202
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:45,336
I can't let you die so easily.

203
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:01,680
I can do it myself.

204
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:05,777
Are you trying to make me feel sorry?

205
00:25:07,376 --> 00:25:12,496
No, you did hurt me just now.

206
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:16,856
I just wanted to experience
what it's like to be taken care of.

207
00:25:18,456 --> 00:25:20,777
It seems I was asking for too much.

208
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:22,096
It's more than that.

209
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,417
Having deceived me for so long,

210
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:26,537
you still dream that
I'd take care of you?

211
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:40,017
Give me a reason to keep you alive.

212
00:25:43,137 --> 00:25:44,208
Stop it already.

213
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:48,937
Oh, there's half a piece
of meat left in the kitchen.

214
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:50,777
Wait for me.

215
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:53,336
I'll make you a bowl
of meat soup. Just wait.

216
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:57,897
No need. The medicine
is ready. Just rest.

217
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,417
Considering you've saved me before,

218
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,417
I won't hold grudges against you.

219
00:26:05,576 --> 00:26:06,672
Let's part ways.

220
00:26:08,272 --> 00:26:09,317
What did you say?

221
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:11,456
I said after your recovery...

222
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,137
I have a headache.

223
00:26:18,256 --> 00:26:20,496
Your arm is broken.
What's with the headache?

224
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:24,297
I've been in poor health
since childhood.

225
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:26,976
No matter where I get hurt,
my head also aches.

226
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:33,657
That means you're used to it.
Just bear with it.

227
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:39,057
As the saying goes,
it's fate that brings people together.

228
00:26:39,657 --> 00:26:42,657
I have few relatives and no neighbors.

229
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:47,057
After you leave,
please inform the officials

230
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:51,777
to come and collect my body
in ten to fifteen days.

231
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,736
It's just a broken arm. You won't die.

232
00:26:57,777 --> 00:26:59,576
You deities know not
the suffering of mortals.

233
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:03,856
I won't be able to work
with my arm anymore.

234
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:08,336
I can't go to the mountains,
nor can I do chores.

235
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:13,697
Those villains will surely come back
to take revenge after you leave.

236
00:27:15,456 --> 00:27:19,616
Forget it. I don't expect you
to take this responsibility.

237
00:27:20,657 --> 00:27:21,856
Just go then.

238
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:25,216
Let me perish by myself. Just go.

239
00:27:44,216 --> 00:27:46,177
I'll stay until your injury is healed.

240
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,417
I knew you are a good person,
Cluck Cluck.

241
00:27:57,817 --> 00:28:00,297
My name is ShenLi.
Don't call me that again.

242
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:06,496
ShenLi? Doesn't sound
like a woman's name.

243
00:28:07,216 --> 00:28:09,657
Xingyun doesn't sound
like a man's name, either.

244
00:28:09,657 --> 00:28:10,800
That's just right.

245
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:14,356
You're yang and I'm yin.
We can get along.

246
00:28:15,017 --> 00:28:17,336
I don't know. You are too thick-skinned.

247
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:19,952
Not that thick.

248
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:00,276
(The Eldest Young Master's Mansion,
Qingsheng City)

249
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:13,336
You three can't even beat a woman?

250
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:17,456
Young Master, that woman is
not someone we can handle.

251
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,616
She could break our token
with bare hands!

252
00:29:20,616 --> 00:29:24,336
Nonsense. How can anyone break
our token with bare hands?

253
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:29,200
Look.

254
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,297
Where is Master Fu Sheng?

255
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:58,336
Master Fu Sheng seems busy
recently and has not visited.

256
00:30:00,376 --> 00:30:03,137
Young Master, they seem
to live in poverty

257
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:04,736
in that dilapidated house.

258
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:08,496
They must have acted so

259
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:10,496
to make themselves more well-known.

260
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:13,256
Why not wait for a while

261
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,777
and decide the next step
after Master Fu Sheng is back?

262
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:20,496
That makes sense.

263
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:23,096
Anyone would want a better life,

264
00:30:23,616 --> 00:30:26,417
even those with special skills.

265
00:30:27,616 --> 00:30:29,137
You're absolutely right, Young Master.

266
00:30:31,017 --> 00:30:34,376
If we no longer send people to them,

267
00:30:34,937 --> 00:30:37,496
they might even come
to us by themselves.

268
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,056
You may leave.

269
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:45,657
- Thank you, Young Master.
- Thank you, Young Master.

270
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,096
This is quite interesting.

271
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:25,456
ShenLi, would you do me a favor
after you finish skimming the duckweed?

272
00:31:27,297 --> 00:31:29,137
Move that jar for me, will you?

273
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:32,976
I can't lift it by myself.

274
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,088
Where to?

275
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:51,216
Over there, it looks better there.

276
00:32:08,496 --> 00:32:09,584
Here?

277
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:15,496
Not so good, over there then.

278
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:24,817
After you put it over there,
stay away from the wall.

279
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,017
Don't break it.

280
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,152
Have you said enough?

281
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:35,216
Headache.

282
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:01,776
Here?

283
00:33:03,777 --> 00:33:05,616
Not particularly ideal, either.

284
00:33:14,537 --> 00:33:19,496
My jar!

285
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,072
(Capital City, Immortal Realm)

286
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,288
(Mofang's Mansion)

287
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:53,017
(The marks previously
left on Her Lordship.)

288
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:55,792
Take care.

289
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:06,017
(Why is Her Lordship using magic
in the lower realm?)

290
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:08,417
(What if her identity gets exposed?)

291
00:34:12,912 --> 00:34:13,968
Mofang.

292
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,224
You're up.

293
00:34:19,216 --> 00:34:20,736
General Shangbei, why are you here?

294
00:34:21,937 --> 00:34:23,137
Can't I come?

295
00:34:24,736 --> 00:34:27,297
I carried you back
when you were seriously injured.

296
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:30,256
I kept watching over you
on the most critical night.

297
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:32,592
Where are you going?

298
00:34:35,056 --> 00:34:36,112
Just a walk.

299
00:34:37,297 --> 00:34:40,137
You're pale as a ghost
and your injuries aren't healed yet.

300
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:41,777
Come, have a rest.

301
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:43,017
Sit down. You shouldn't move about.

302
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,736
Here, have some tea.

303
00:34:48,657 --> 00:34:51,336
You shouldn't go anywhere.
Just rest at home.

304
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:53,736
Something brought you here, right?

305
00:34:56,697 --> 00:35:01,456
Mofang, if you know
the whereabouts of the Lord,

306
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:05,057
you must not conceal it.

307
00:35:07,376 --> 00:35:09,057
General Shangbei, I really don't know.

308
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:13,177
Alright, that's good.

309
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:23,297
I'm done with the firewood,
the cupboard,

310
00:35:23,297 --> 00:35:24,736
and the bed.

311
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:26,537
What else do you want me to do?

312
00:35:26,537 --> 00:35:30,417
Then I'll speak frankly.

313
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:34,777
Great, just say it, anything.

314
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:39,336
I broke your arm,
so I'll take full responsibility.

315
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:43,728
What else?

316
00:35:49,217 --> 00:35:54,417
The fallen leaves should be cleared.

317
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:58,497
Okay.

318
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,288
Hold on.

319
00:36:03,016 --> 00:36:04,016
What now?

320
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:07,248
Well,

321
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:14,457
I usually pick up the leaves by hand.

322
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:31,257
Why did you throw something away again?
There's nothing left.

323
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:33,497
You've been idling here all day.

324
00:36:34,616 --> 00:36:35,697
Are you messing with me?

325
00:36:37,616 --> 00:36:39,952
Not this time.

326
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:41,680
So you were before?

327
00:36:45,177 --> 00:36:47,296
Not this time anyway.

328
00:36:58,704 --> 00:36:59,760
Follow me.

329
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:20,737
These leaves must be pressed
before they can be placed inside a book.

330
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,257
The fallen leaves in the courtyard

331
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,256
(Three quarters past Wu hour,)
are placed one by one

332
00:37:34,256 --> 00:37:35,816
( the 1st of the 5th month, Age 18)
into my books.

333
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:43,728
(Two quarters past Shen hour,
the 6th of the 5th month, Age 18)

334
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,400
(Three quarters past Xu hour,
the 5th of the 5th month, Age 18)

335
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:50,016
You recorded the time
when the leaves fell.

336
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:51,600
Yes.

337
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,536
(Three quarters past Xu hour,
the 5th of the 5th month, Age 18)

338
00:37:55,536 --> 00:37:56,576
What does "18" represent?

339
00:37:58,856 --> 00:38:00,897
My age at that year.

340
00:38:03,737 --> 00:38:07,096
You don't use the year number,
but your age.

341
00:38:07,816 --> 00:38:08,944
That's quite unique.

342
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:11,440
All of these?

343
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:17,056
Yes, they are all tombstones
for fallen leaves.

344
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:19,296
Doesn't it make this room
a graveyard for fallen leaves?

345
00:38:21,776 --> 00:38:22,864
Indeed, it does.

346
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:26,697
(Two quarters past Shen hour,
the 6th of the 5th month, Age 18)

347
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:27,776
Leaves would fall every year.

348
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,697
You collect these fallen leaves,

349
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:34,512
record the time and
preserve them in those books.

350
00:38:35,124 --> 00:38:40,457
It's time-consuming and laborious.
What's the point?

351
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:45,360
There is none.

352
00:38:46,737 --> 00:38:50,457
It's just to pass the time.

353
00:38:57,776 --> 00:39:00,977
Summer is approaching.
The grapes are almost ripe.

354
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:05,257
You like eating grapes?

355
00:39:06,737 --> 00:39:13,697
No, it's just because no branch
of grapes bears only one fruit.

356
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:25,680
(This mortal can hear me
speaking in my true form,)

357
00:39:26,376 --> 00:39:29,497
(predict the future,
and also place formations.)

358
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:35,536
(His every move seems
to intend to keep me here.)

359
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:39,536
(Did I truly encounter him by chance?)

360
00:39:40,457 --> 00:39:43,737
(I must look into him. He could be
a spy from the Immortal Realm.)

361
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:48,016
Have a taste.

362
00:39:51,616 --> 00:39:53,336
Didn't you say they are not ripe yet?

363
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:07,937
It's so sweet. Have a taste.

364
00:40:34,937 --> 00:40:37,776
(30th of the 7th month, Age 16.)

365
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,292
(Nine thousand two hundred
and thirty-nine grapes.)

366
00:40:43,336 --> 00:40:46,937
(Thirty-nine thousand
two hundred and eleven seeds.)

367
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:53,576
(9th of the 8th month, Age 16,
rain more than three inches.)

368
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,880
(Why record all these?)

369
00:40:57,908 --> 00:40:59,156
(He had no better thing to do?)

370
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:11,984
(Age 5, in the 3rd month,
my parents died of illness.)

371
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:14,024
(With the help of friends and neighbors,)

372
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:16,257
(a coffin was made
with eighteen pine boards.)

373
00:41:16,257 --> 00:41:19,937
(They were buried three li north of
the solitary mountain outside the city.)

374
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:21,627
(Age 5, in the 5th month,)

375
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:23,307
(my younger brother
also contracted the illness.)

376
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:24,816
(Friends and neighbors feared it.)

377
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,977
(Fortunately, my parents
already had a coffin.)

378
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:28,977
(It could be opened
to bury him along with them.)

379
