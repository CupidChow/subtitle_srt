00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,120
=Episode 23=

3
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,523
My lord, the Water Halting Spell
has no effect on her.

4
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:21,040
Get her!

5
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,504
You petty thieves!

6
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:57,602
How dare you
try stealing the spell of a god?

7
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:02,122
Your Lordship, you seem
to be greatly concerned about the matter

8
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,762
of that god.

9
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:23,824
Mofang?

10
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:28,523
Who permitted you to do this?

11
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,123
I am at fault.

12
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,563
It's just that the object
carried by Lord Bicang

13
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:37,322
is something we must obtain.

14
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:39,363
I can't refrain from taking it.

15
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:41,243
I deceived you

16
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:44,683
because I worried
you would dwell on the past

17
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,482
and harbor unnecessary kindness.

18
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:49,843
So it's better for me
to eliminate her first

19
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,963
and rid us of this future worry.

20
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:57,803
Tell me. Who permitted you to do this?

21
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:04,123
I took the initiative.

22
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,162
But Lord Bicang

23
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,322
must die today.

24
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:24,816
Go away.

25
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,280
Today,

26
00:05:27,923 --> 00:05:30,403
Lord Bicang must die.

27
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:31,536
I said "Go away"!

28
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:40,976
Alright.

29
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:44,843
Then, young master,

30
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,243
please forgive me
for defying your orders.

31
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:55,472
Young master?

32
00:05:58,704 --> 00:05:59,728
Your Lordship.

33
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:01,872
Young master...

34
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:04,962
(The happening of something like this)

35
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,403
- indicates that...
- There is a mole.

36
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:11,243
Someone not very familiar
with the layout of the capital

37
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:14,323
would not retreat

38
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:15,643
so quickly.

39
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:17,488
So it turns out

40
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:21,008
to be you.

41
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,008
Upon reflection of the past,

42
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:31,504
I still remember

43
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,363
that it was I who promoted you

44
00:06:33,923 --> 00:06:35,162
to be a general back in the capital.

45
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,602
Over the past 300 years,

46
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:39,243
I've fought with you

47
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:40,843
no less than dozens of times.

48
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:43,120
And we've shared a camaraderie

49
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:45,403
that has withstood life and death.

50
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:47,882
I've trusted you

51
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,282
and regarded you as a brother.

52
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:53,168
I, ShenLi,

53
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:54,803
have treated you well.

54
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,722
Her Holiness has treated you well.

55
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:58,963
And the Immortal Realm
has never harmed you.

56
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,482
Yet you massacred my people,

57
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,363
slaughtered my generals,
and harmed Her Holiness,

58
00:07:05,282 --> 00:07:06,762
sinning by endangering
the Immortal Realm.

59
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:09,424
Tell me,

60
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,482
should I kill you or not?

61
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:24,162
Endangering the Immortal Realm?

62
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:26,682
The current Immortal Realm

63
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:28,743
is restricted by the Divine Realm

64
00:07:28,743 --> 00:07:30,602
and is no different from a puppet.

65
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:33,882
My young master is extremely noble.

66
00:07:34,923 --> 00:07:37,042
If it weren't
for the compelling situation,

67
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:40,762
he wouldn't have lowered himself
to hide in today's Immortal Realm.

68
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:45,442
Speaking of someone
who endangers the Immortal Realm,

69
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,523
the one you now serve

70
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:54,803
is the real sinner.

71
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:57,002
She is utterly cowardly.

72
00:08:05,363 --> 00:08:06,448
Shut up.

73
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,376
Your Lordship,

74
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:14,512
it's all my fault

75
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:16,482
for deceiving you.

76
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:21,282
I know my sins are unforgivable.

77
00:08:29,762 --> 00:08:30,923
Since you've admitted your sins,

78
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,323
you have no right
to call me 'Your Lordship'.

79
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:41,262
Young master, don't belittle yourself.

80
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:42,722
You haven't sinned at all.

81
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,003
The ones at fault
are those blind, loyal fools.

82
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:48,823
We went to great lengths
to infiltrate the capital,

83
00:08:48,823 --> 00:08:50,743
all for the Azure Sea Pearl.

84
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,003
Now I am certain

85
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:54,163
that the Azure Sea Pearl is on ShenLi.

86
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:57,523
This is the only pearl of its kind
in the world.

87
00:08:57,523 --> 00:08:59,003
If we cannot seize this pearl,

88
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:03,402
our plans for a thousand years
will be ruined in an instant.

89
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:06,482
I hope you will not
let emotions affect your judgment.

90
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,763
Please prioritize the overall situation.

91
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,528
Go!

92
00:10:04,923 --> 00:10:06,402
Wishing to take my thing?

93
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:08,496
First, leave your life behind.

94
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:33,808
Let me go.

95
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:35,803
Do you care

96
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:37,962
about the overall situation?

97
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,162
Once ShenLi's breath
is gone in the water

98
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,243
and I retrieve
the Azure Sea Pearl from her,

99
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:55,282
I'll leave her useless corpse

100
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,162
for you as a memento.

101
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:01,103
Let her go!

102
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:02,192
Impossible!

103
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:05,443
We are so close to success.

104
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:07,282
How am I supposed to give up?

105
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:08,722
What if I insist you let her go?

106
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:11,683
Then you'll have to do it

107
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:14,003
over my dead body.

108
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:39,722
Today, I shall trample
over your dead boy.

109
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:04,482
You should die for the soldiers
of the Immortal Realm.

110
00:13:16,203 --> 00:13:17,296
If I could just die,

111
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:19,408
that would be fine.

112
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:39,563
Do you really want to kill me?

113
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,203
To you, I indeed deserve to die.

114
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:54,962
Your Lordship, it's dangerous here.

115
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:58,363
If you want to kill me,
first leave this place.

116
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,496
Your Lordship,

117
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:02,576
the southeast

118
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:04,923
has no guards monitoring.

119
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:06,963
Just go quickly.

120
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:08,883
How can I trust you?

121
00:15:09,602 --> 00:15:10,672
Just go.

122
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,296
Hurry!

123
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:20,688
Since you don't trust me,

124
00:15:23,443 --> 00:15:25,443
please forgive me for my disrespect.

125
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:46,096
Your Lordship!

126
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,560
The Azure Sea Pearl

127
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:11,162
is mine.

128
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:37,402
(The Immortal Realm should be safe now.)

129
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:42,896
(The mastermind is dead,)

130
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,483
(and the Xutian Abyss is also fine.)

131
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:03,760
(It seems)

132
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:05,522
(I can't go back anymore.)

133
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,112
(But at least,)

134
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,443
(I've protected many smiles)

135
00:18:11,683 --> 00:18:13,122
(and the Immortal Realm's people.)

136
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:25,522
(If there's any regret,)

137
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,483

(Cluck Cluck,)

139
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,923
I thought you wouldn't come back.

140

I didn't expect you

141
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,042
to wait for me to come home here.

142
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:39,122

00:23:57,242 --> 00:23:58,803
Your Holiness, rest assured.

189
00:23:58,803 --> 00:24:00,723
Her Lordship has returned
from the Divine Realm

190
00:24:00,723 --> 00:24:02,162
and is now confronting the enemy.

191
00:24:06,762 --> 00:24:08,683
Your Holiness, please calm down.

192
00:24:09,603 --> 00:24:10,640
She is not allowed to go.

193
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:18,443
Quickly call her back.

194
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,936
Your Holiness,

195
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,242
General Shangbei has returned
from the front lines

196
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:27,843
and has waited outside
for quite some time.

197
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:35,342
- Quickly, let him in.
- But...

198
00:24:35,342 --> 00:24:36,432
Go quickly.

199
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,656
Yes.

200
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:39,056
Your Holiness.

201
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,203
Lord Bicang

202
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:29,882
sacrificed herself

203
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:34,122
to eliminate formidable foes
for the Immortal Realm.

204
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,776
She

205
00:26:40,723 --> 00:26:42,723
has perished in the East Sea.

206
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:47,402
I am incapable.

207
00:26:48,963 --> 00:26:51,762
Having seen Her Lordship
and the enemy perish together,

208
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,963
I failed to lend a hand for rescue

209
00:26:57,002 --> 00:26:58,843
but only managed
to bring back Her Lordship's

210
00:26:59,803 --> 00:27:00,880
relics.

211
00:27:09,683 --> 00:27:10,736
Her Lordship...

212
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:14,343
It can't be.

213
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:15,923
I also don't want to believe it.

214
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:21,882
But I witnessed it with my own eyes.

215
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,683
She perished

216
00:27:31,323 --> 00:27:32,882
with the enemy?

217
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:36,400
Yes.

218
00:27:42,402 --> 00:27:43,522
There is another matter.

219
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,723
When I arrived,

220
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:50,083
I heard the enemy leader calling out

221
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,496
the Water Halting Spell.

222
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:56,203
I dare to speculate

223
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:58,963
that the scourge of our realm

224
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:01,303
could be...

225
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:02,512
Stop speculating

226
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:05,683
about this matter.

227
00:28:07,723 --> 00:28:08,784
Li

228
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,282
died fighting for the Immortal Realm.

229
00:28:15,122 --> 00:28:16,402
She protected the Immortal Realm.

230
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:20,203
She prevented the Immortal Realm

231
00:28:22,282 --> 00:28:23,603
from being plunged

232
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:26,843
into an abyss of misery
for a thousand years.

233
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:30,832
Her bravery

234
00:28:33,762 --> 00:28:35,563
should be known
to all under the heavens.

235
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,184
Yes.

236
00:28:45,042 --> 00:28:46,096
Yes.

237
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:00,976
General Shangbei,

238
00:29:02,683 --> 00:29:04,762
you were a witness
to this battle of the East Sea.

239
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:08,362
Please take the trouble
to go to the Divine Realm.

you've come
to pay respects to Grandfather.

263
00:31:11,344 --> 00:31:12,423
You are so obedient.

264
00:31:12,423 --> 00:31:14,003
You aren't brewing
some mischief again, right?

265
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:15,162
What mischief could I brew?

266
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:16,683
We still haven't found out

267
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:18,062
what happened to the Immortal Realm.

268
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:19,202
I come here every day

269
00:31:19,202 --> 00:31:20,242
to wait for a result.

270
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,083
You care about the Immortal Realm?

271
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:24,242
Could it be because of ShenLi?

272
00:31:26,864 --> 00:31:27,920
I've thought it through.

273
00:31:28,496 --> 00:31:29,552
I can't escape the marriage.

274
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,863
So I might as well fulfill my duties.

275
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,753
I've made it clear to her
that we can be sworn siblings.

276
00:31:33,753 --> 00:31:35,248
We can each
lead our own lives regardless.

277
00:31:35,248 --> 00:31:36,563
- Nonsense.
- General Shangbei.

278
00:31:37,136 --> 00:31:38,242
Please tell them that I'm here.

279
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:39,344
- General Shangbei.
- Please wait.

280
00:31:44,848 --> 00:31:45,936
No need for such formalities.

281
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:48,443
Why have you come to the Divine Realm?

282
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,563
Have you found out anything
about the attack last time?

283
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:58,480
The evildoers

284
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:01,042
have already been executed.

285
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,702
I told you, ShenLi is formidable.

286
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:03,760
She solved it so quickly.

287
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:10,882
Then, how is Lord Bicang now?

288
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,088
I am here

289
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:17,282
to meet the Heavenly Lord
under an order.

290
00:32:18,642 --> 00:32:19,760
I can't delay further.

291
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,152
Excuse me.

292
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:32,042
Why is he dressed in plain clothes?

293
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:34,803
It couldn't be that ShenLi

294
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:36,603
has suffered
another serious injury, right?

295
00:32:41,603 --> 00:32:43,683
Thank you for the medicine,
Heavenly Lord.

296
00:32:44,882 --> 00:32:46,603
Her Holiness has now awakened.

297
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:49,963
Those who sneak attacked
the Divine Realm and Immortal Realm

298
00:32:49,963 --> 00:32:51,042
have been annihilated by

299
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:55,923
Lord Bicang from the Immortal Realm.

300
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,402
Her Holiness specially
sent me to report this,

301
00:33:00,963 --> 00:33:02,882
hoping to ease your mind.

302
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:05,402
Very good.

303
00:33:07,282 --> 00:33:10,203
I didn't expect that Lord Bicang
had such great abilities.

304
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,242
Where is Lord Bicang now?

305
00:33:14,522 --> 00:33:15,882
She has earned merit in this battle.

306
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:19,083
I will reward her handsomely.

307
00:33:22,563 --> 00:33:24,522
Thank you for your generosity.

308
00:33:26,563 --> 00:33:28,963
However, there's no need.

309
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:42,192
Her Lordship

310
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:45,323
has fallen in battle at the East Sea.

311
00:33:47,683 --> 00:33:48,784
Fallen in battle?

312
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:03,042
What brought you here, Your Excellency?

313
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:09,362
Who were you speaking of just now?

314
00:34:11,642 --> 00:34:14,003
ShenLi, Lord Bicang
of the Immortal Realm,

315
00:34:14,602 --> 00:34:17,283
fell at the East Sea yesterday.

316
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:49,328
That's absurd.

317
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:51,824
You shouldn't

318
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:54,842
report such news without verification.

319
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:57,882
Your Excellency,

320
00:34:57,882 --> 00:35:00,203
communications between realms
won't be reported

321
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,043
if not verified.

322
00:35:02,562 --> 00:35:03,642
If it turns out to be false,

323
00:35:04,642 --> 00:35:05,808
I'm willing

324
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,443
to accept the punishment
of thunderous strikes.

325
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:22,523
Do not make oaths before the deities.

326
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:24,592
They will come true.

327
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:26,523
Your Excellency,

328
00:35:27,443 --> 00:35:28,592
I would rather

329
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:32,043
have the punishment
of thunderous strikes.

330
00:35:35,472 --> 00:35:36,560
Where is her body?

331
00:35:37,683 --> 00:35:40,402
Her Lordship fell into the East Sea

332
00:35:41,402 --> 00:35:43,162
and perished along with the enemy.

333
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,040
Her body

334
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:47,602
vanished into the East Sea

335
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:49,763
and can't be retrieved.

336
00:35:56,752 --> 00:35:57,843
Well...

337
00:35:57,843 --> 00:35:58,992
Where in the East Sea?

338
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:02,283
The sea is boundless.

339
00:36:03,523 --> 00:36:05,443
We couldn't pinpoint the exact location.

340
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:07,322
No one knows

341
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:10,283
where Her Lordship's body actually is.

342
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:34,863
Yesterday, at the Extranatural Heaven,

343
00:36:34,863 --> 00:36:36,443
I detected a disturbance
in the flow of energy.

344
00:36:37,322 --> 00:36:38,842
There must be trouble
in the lower realm.

345
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,443
I wish to descend and investigate.

346
00:36:43,122 --> 00:36:45,362
What do you say?

347
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:47,763
It's up to you.

348
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:56,443
Your Excellency, you care for the world.

349
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:58,723
Please also take care of yourself.

350
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:13,648
I

351
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:17,003
heard the enemy's call in the East Sea.

352
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:19,802
He used the Water Halting Spell.

353
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:23,162
In the whole world,

354
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:25,882
only Lord Xingzhi

355
00:37:27,483 --> 00:37:28,923
is versed in the Water Halting Spell.

356
00:37:30,842 --> 00:37:31,923
Water Halting Spell?

357
00:37:33,523 --> 00:37:35,003
How did they learn

358
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:37,122
the spell of a god?

359
00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:06,362
ShenLi? ShenLi?

360
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:08,496
ShenLi?

361
00:38:12,602 --> 00:38:13,744
ShenLi?

362
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:33,808
ShenLi?

363
00:38:40,802 --> 00:38:41,872
ShenLi!

364
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:51,152
