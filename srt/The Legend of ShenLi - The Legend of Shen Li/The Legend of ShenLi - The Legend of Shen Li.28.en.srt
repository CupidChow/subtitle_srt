00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,248
=Episode 28=

3
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,812
(Different from the initial smell,)

4
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:19,211
(the scent of the sea breeze
he bore back then,)

5
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:21,611
(was without a hint of fishiness,)

6
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:24,452
(as if he had been in the sea breeze)

7
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:25,971
(for months.)

8
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:30,012
(Now he has all sorts of smells,)

9
00:02:31,012 --> 00:02:34,131
(salt, fishiness, and blood.)

10
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:37,292
(He takes the role
of a fisherman seriously.)

11
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:42,012
(Just like when he was
in the Mortal Realm.)

12
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,652
(Though he has the memories
of the Divine Realm,)

13
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,812
(he is only focused on his work)

14
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,652
(as a mortal at that time.)

15
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:51,532
(His broad-mindedness)

16
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:54,012
(is truly admirable.)

17
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,991
What's with His Lord lately?

18
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,331
He steers clear of women

19
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,611
and has started to improve himself.

20
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:58,372
As a heavenly grandson

21
00:03:59,092 --> 00:04:00,532
with exceptional talents,

22
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:03,611
which His Excellency praises me for,

23
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:06,372
I must not waste my talents.

24
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,691
My Lord, you've grown up.

25
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:23,248
Furong.

26
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,291
Why are you here and not taking care

27
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,291
of His Excellency?

28
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:31,412
I'm waiting for your medicinal charm.

29
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:45,840
Hurry up.

30
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,532
The goddess takes to heart

31
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:54,532
His Excellency's matters.

32
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:57,092
It's amazing

33
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:58,951
how quickly she prepared it.

34
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,812
No wonder she's always
been good at studying.

35
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,972
Your Excellency!

36
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:54,832
Your Excellency!

37
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,008
ShenLi.

38
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:31,120
Li.

39
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,852
Li?

40
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:38,160
Lili?

41
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:46,064
ShenLi.

42
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,976
Let's talk outside.

43
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,092
Your Excellency.

44
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:56,771
ShenLi can stand up?
She recovers quickly.

45
00:07:58,096 --> 00:07:59,111
What did you come?

46
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,112
For serious matters.

47
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,372
Why is Your Excellency so nervous?

48
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:05,691
You told me last time

49
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:07,092
that ShenLi cannot see or hear.

50
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:08,652
I saw that she didn't respond.

51
00:08:09,652 --> 00:08:11,011
ShenLi! Lord Bicang!

52
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:12,688
Stop shouting.

53
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:16,891
Coincidentally, she can
neither see nor hear today.

54
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:19,692
It changes?

55
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,171
Did I just make a blunder?

56
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:26,252
Speak up, what brings you here?

57
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,648
Well…

58
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:33,692
My sister is working hard on charms

59
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:35,871
to help tend to your wounds.

60
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,552
I know you're taking care of ShenLi.

61
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,012
But you mustn't forget
your own injuries.

62
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:42,372
You have frozen the East Sea
for ten days and nights

63
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:43,802
and have repeatedly
used the Tracing Spell.

64
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:45,531
This backlash from the Natural Law

65
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:46,531
is not to be underestimated.

66
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:53,744
I appreciate her effort.

67
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:58,252
Your Excellency,
your wound is on the back.

68
00:08:58,252 --> 00:08:59,592
It's inconvenient
to tend to it yourself.

69
00:08:59,592 --> 00:09:00,772
Shall I help you?

70
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,400
Wait for me.

71
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,192
It's time to eat.

72
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,848
Take a sniff.

73
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,208
Does it smell good?

74
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:53,008
Take it.

75
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:03,088
Over there.

76
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,072
Your Excellency, your wound

77
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,651
has recovered a lot in three months,

78
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:25,252
but it's still very serious.

79
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:27,772
You must be very careful.

80
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:19,600
ShenLi.

81
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,576
(ShenLi.)

82
00:11:39,728 --> 00:11:40,772
(Up to now,)

83
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,731
(I still fear the next time
I open my eyes,)

84
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,252
(I will find it was all just a dream.)

85
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:49,328
(How I wish)

86
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,772
(that time could stop at this moment.)

87
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:53,712
(You will always be here,)

88
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:55,692
(and I will always be with you.)

89
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,928
(But your wounds)

90
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,816
(must be healed.)

91
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:03,728
(Don't your wounds)

92
00:12:04,651 --> 00:12:05,712
(need healing too?)

I'll go and see

111
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:21,904
how the local fishermen work.

Dragon King!

Dragon King, His…

116
00:13:38,512 --> 00:13:39,611
Dragon King, His Excellency…

117
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,612
What's wrong now?

118
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,012
He's cast his net again.

119
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:45,360
What did he catch?

120
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,052
Seawater.

121
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,192
Seawater?

122
00:13:51,332 --> 00:13:54,052
Then put some fish in his net.

123
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:56,312
Putting fish isn't enough.

124
00:13:56,312 --> 00:13:57,851
We need to add something else.

125
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,932
But last time he only wanted fish.

126
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:02,592
Just fish.

127
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,452
He didn't even want the merfolk,
let alone treasures.

128
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,176
Dragon King.

129
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,372
He did not want it last time,

130
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:13,291
but not necessarily this time.

131
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:15,112
His Excellency

132
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:17,132
can't always want fish, can he?

133
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,496
That makes sense.

134
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,212
Indeed.

135
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,332
Then, in addition to the fish,

136
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:28,032
stuff in some treasures.

137
00:14:28,032 --> 00:14:30,052
Right, treasures.

138
00:14:30,052 --> 00:14:31,772
Okay, quickly.

139
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,491
Bring some treasures.

140
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:34,772
Yes.

141
00:14:34,772 --> 00:14:35,856
Hurry up.

142
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:42,651
No, I must do it myself.

143
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:44,592
Let's go.

144
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:33,520
Didn't catch any fish?

145
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:45,971
(Xingzhi may have caught the fish,)

146
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:47,892
(but the Dragon King pulled it back)

147
00:15:48,692 --> 00:15:50,012
(and changed it for these.)

148
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,264
Why have you come?

149
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:55,572
I came to see how fishing works.

150
00:15:57,932 --> 00:15:58,960
But,

151
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:02,132
it seems no fish were caught today.

152
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:05,051
No.

153
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:07,091
I didn't want fish today.

154
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:08,972
I specifically came

155
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,252
for these treasures.

156
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,252
(He tells lies with no difficulty.)

157
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:18,800
So many treasures.

158
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:22,192
Well,

159
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:24,892
I'll take a few to sell.

160
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,452
These aren't of much use.

161
00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:29,892
I'll throw them into the sea.

162
00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:33,012
Don't. Let me choose one.

163
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:39,012
(Xingzhi never accepts gifts.)

164
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,372
(We should take one or two)

165
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,651
(from these sent by the Dragon King)

166
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,360
(for courtesy's sake.)

167
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,411
(But if we accept all these,)

168
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:49,372
(the implication would
be quite different.)

169
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:11,824
Come.

170
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:14,128
Come bask in the sun.

171
00:17:15,856 --> 00:17:16,880
I'm quite formidable.

172
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:18,832
It's fine.

173
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:39,212
Be careful.

174
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,024
Have you decided?

175
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,411
I'll have that rock.

176
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:51,440
This one?

177
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:01,632
Later on at the market,

178
00:18:01,632 --> 00:18:02,652
we'll exchange the pearls

179
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:03,728
for some fish.

180
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,011
Then we'll go home to eat.

181
00:18:14,771 --> 00:18:16,692
Sir, take a look at my fish.

182
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,544
I'll see that one.

183
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:20,784
Hold on.

184
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:42,800
(Wang Bao)

185
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:57,552
Collect his stall fee.

186
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:58,608
Alright.

187
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:00,752
I have no money.

188
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,512
Where's the money?

189
00:19:03,024 --> 00:19:04,080
Search this side.

190
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,092
Why are you so tall?

191
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:06,256
That side.

192
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,732
Fished up pearls again, brother?

193
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:18,032
Don't you know me?

194
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:23,171
The village chief's eldest son,
Wang Bao.

195
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:27,131
I see you exchange pearls
for fish every day.

196
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,972
I figured you don't like these pearls.

197
00:19:31,492 --> 00:19:33,411
I have many fish at home.

198
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:35,291
Just exchange with me.

199
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:38,291
These and those on your boat,

200
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:39,344
give them all to me.

201
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:42,411
No, I'll throw them away.

202
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:43,568
How dare you?

203
00:19:45,692 --> 00:19:47,332
I am the village chief's eldest son.

204
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:49,552
You would rather throw it away
than give it to me.

205
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:50,651
You have a problem with me?

206
00:19:51,171 --> 00:19:53,572
That means you have a problem
with the village chief.

207
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:55,891
Better not mess with me.

208
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,672
Excuse me.

209
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:02,864
Stop there!

210
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:05,651
Can't you hear me speaking to you?

211
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:37,251
You impolite tramp.

212
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:40,932
Your woman is quite something.

213
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:45,872
You have good taste too.

214
00:20:46,576 --> 00:20:47,664
Thank you.

215
00:20:48,492 --> 00:20:50,572
Let me introduce myself,
I am the village chief's…

216
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,972
Is my face swollen too?

217
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:27,492
Why do you stare at me like this?

218
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:31,271
No, I just

219
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:33,371
didn't expect you to be so direct.

220
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:37,891
(Xingzhi)

221
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:41,011
(is not the kind who
plays dirty tricks.)

222
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:43,568
He was lecherous to you.

223
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:47,856
I suppose so.

224
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:00,976
If it were you,

225
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:03,251
how would you handle it?

226
00:22:04,572 --> 00:22:05,648
Beat him up.

227
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:08,492
In that case,

228
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,768
I just chose

229
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,452
the way you would have chosen.

230
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,448
Aren't you happy?

231
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:22,452
(Is he trying to please me?)

232
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:28,432
I am.

233
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:30,480
Actually, I am happy about it.

234
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,852
(Perhaps only
by putting on this facade,)

235
00:22:39,612 --> 00:22:41,011
(can he be so kind to me.)

236
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:43,692
(He wants me to act without restraint.)

237
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:47,771
(He could also be at ease
for some time.)

238
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:06,864
(There's a noise.)

239
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:10,411
(One, two, three.)

240
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:12,688
(Three mortals)

241
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:14,972
(who haven't even
practiced martial arts.)

242
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:17,771
(How can there be no guard)

243
00:23:18,452 --> 00:23:19,612
(at Xingzhi's courtyard at night?)

244
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,248
What are you two doing?

245
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,584
There's a door right here.

246
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:35,792
Come here.

247
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:40,332
Rock paper scissors.

248
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,572
One, two, three.

249
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:45,892
Good, I won. Do as I say.

250
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,651
You two go to that room.

251
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:49,932
I'll go to this room.

252
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:52,572
Remember, when you see that man

253
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:54,452
who is fishing,

254
00:23:54,452 --> 00:23:55,812
beat him as hard as possible.

255
00:23:55,812 --> 00:23:58,291
If you see that young lady, call me.

256
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:00,720
I will deal with her.

257
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:15,972
A demonic aura!

258
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:36,651
Don't scream, beauty.

259
00:24:37,932 --> 00:24:38,960
Don't scream.

260
00:24:58,736 --> 00:24:59,792
So

261
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:01,692
you sleep in separate beds?

262
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:08,944
You see,

263
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:10,544
I am

264
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:14,572
the village chief's eldest son.

265
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:17,771
I'm so much better

266
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:18,992
than your husband who can only fish.

267
00:25:18,992 --> 00:25:20,932
Beauty, how about this?

268
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:24,176
Tonight,

269
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:28,371
you come with me.

270
00:25:29,732 --> 00:25:31,171
How can you even compare with him?

271
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:33,371
There's a world of difference.

272
00:25:38,212 --> 00:25:41,972
Quite feisty, young lady, I like that.

273
00:25:45,932 --> 00:25:47,411
I have lived a thousand years.

274
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:49,572
It's my first time
being teased like this.

275
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:51,531
This experience is indeed rare.

276
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,092
But the problem is your appearance

277
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:58,531
which doesn't excite me
in the slightest.

278
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:02,064
What did you just say?

279
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:04,912
A thousand years?

280
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:07,932
Come here, I'll tell you.

281
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,131
Don't look, it's filthy.

282
00:26:42,612 --> 00:26:45,212
I can handle this situation.

283
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,344
I know.

284
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:49,392
But today,

285
00:26:49,932 --> 00:26:51,092
you don't have to.

286
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:54,051
Because I will help you.

287
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:35,192
The Azure Sea Pearl is an important
item for rescuing our master.

288
00:27:35,192 --> 00:27:36,411
Yet you, young master,

289
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:41,332
released ShenLi and even
led away the pursuers.

290
00:27:42,492 --> 00:27:43,852
What?

291
00:27:43,852 --> 00:27:45,651
You still want to trap me?

292
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:54,171
You have no intention to kill me,

293
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:57,932
so you can't possibly trap me.

294
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:04,816
Young Master.

295
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:10,891
You've exhausted all your strength
these past few days.

296
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:15,612
Do not struggle anymore.

297
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:17,616
In this world,

298
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,932
only I completely know you.

299
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:24,291
And only I

300
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:28,092
can be your ally.

301
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:46,092
Heiyuan, Heizhi.

302
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:49,831
Yes.

303
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:52,092
Find her and bring her back.

304
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:53,168
- Yes.
- Yes.

305
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,256
(I can't see.)

306
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,328
(I can't hear.)

307
00:29:37,852 --> 00:29:38,992
(I can't speak.)

308
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,456
(I can't feel.)

309
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:44,212
(Have I disappeared?)

310
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:49,212
(I wouldn't even know if I was killed.)

311
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:54,291
(After today,)

312
00:29:54,891 --> 00:29:55,932
(it should be alright.)

313
00:29:58,411 --> 00:30:00,212
(But how long is today?)

314
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:03,732
(I don't even know the time.)

315
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,531
(Has Xingzhi returned?)

316
00:30:07,852 --> 00:30:08,971
(Seeing me like this,)

317
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:10,251
(how will he react?)

318
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:14,371
(What if I can't be healed?)

319
00:30:15,932 --> 00:30:17,051
(What if I remain like this)

320
00:30:18,572 --> 00:30:20,051
(from now on?)

321
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:23,932
(There are so many things left undone.)

322
00:30:25,411 --> 00:30:27,011
(There are so many words left unsaid.)

323
00:30:28,371 --> 00:30:29,692
(And so much regret.)

324
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:33,131
(How can I waste
the rest of my life here?)

325
00:30:43,824 --> 00:30:44,880
ShenLi.

326
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:54,812
Don't be afraid.

327
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:58,812
Don't be afraid, come.

328
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:07,024
Don't be afraid.

329
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:16,732
I am here, Li.

330
00:31:57,492 --> 00:31:59,051
(It's the smell of the sea on him.)

331
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:02,212
(And a faint hint of fragrance.)

332
00:32:04,612 --> 00:32:06,171
(It's a scent unique to Xingzhi,)

333
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:08,371
(the scent of a god.)

334
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:11,171
(It's so reassuring.)

335
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:15,312
You've been here all the time?

336
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:18,932
I have, and I will always be here.

The Blood Seven and
Five-color Flame Lotus?

345
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:55,392
These are both medicines
for the fusion of techniques.

346
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:56,560
What do you need these for?

347
00:32:57,332 --> 00:32:58,576
Just find them.

348
00:33:00,572 --> 00:33:01,584
Your Excellency.

349
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:04,932
These two medicines
are from ancient legends.

350
00:33:04,932 --> 00:33:06,391
Where am I supposed to find them?

351
00:33:06,391 --> 00:33:07,411
I don't care where you go.

352
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:09,008
Find them as soon as possible.

353
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,812
Are you trying to cure ShenLi?

354
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:18,852
I can't stand to see her
so vulnerable anymore.

355
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:26,608
Alright.

356
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:37,840
Have a taste?

357
00:33:45,572 --> 00:33:47,572
Sorry, you are the same kind.

358
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:52,784
Smells great though.

359
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,292
The Blood Seven and
Five-color Flame Lotus.

360
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:09,452
Where am I supposed to find these?

361
00:34:09,452 --> 00:34:10,891
What a headache.

362
00:34:15,331 --> 00:34:16,400
You've worked hard.

363
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:26,611
The Blood Seven and
Five-color Flame Lotus.

364
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:28,972
Where should I go?

365
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:36,851
Perhaps

366
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:38,452
I should sneak a look
at my sister's books.

367
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:46,960
Lord Wuyuan.

368
00:34:49,072 --> 00:34:50,128
Goddess.

369
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,651
Where are you going?

370
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:55,891
I just saw Lord Furong return
from the lower realm again.

371
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,131
His whereabouts
have been erratic lately.

372
00:34:58,651 --> 00:35:00,252
It seems he is hiding something from us.

373
00:35:01,252 --> 00:35:02,632
I am making a medicinal charm.

374
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:04,092
He's helping me find materials.

375
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:05,168
My apology.

376
00:35:05,732 --> 00:35:07,272
Goddess, what is it that you need

377
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,532
that he must be so secretive?

378
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:12,131
It's due to a body condition
that I prefer not to disclose.

379
00:35:12,772 --> 00:35:15,372
We can only rely on family
for certain medicinal herbs.

380
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:17,052
Lord Furong is my blood brother.

381
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:18,832
So…

382
00:35:18,832 --> 00:35:21,651
I apologize, I was overly concerned.

383
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:23,952
No offense intended, Goddess.

384
00:35:24,452 --> 00:35:25,851
You are only doing your job.

385
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:27,664
Thank you for your work.

386
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,452
My luck is favoring me.

387
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:32,131
What can you do without your sister?

388
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,048
You're awake.

389
00:36:52,932 --> 00:36:54,692
I've made some porridge. Have some.

390
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:02,832
Today,

391
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:05,968
I can hear and see.

392
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:09,192
But I have no sense of touch

393
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,252
and no sense of taste.

394
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:13,008
I'll leave it for later.

395
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:21,616
Okay.

396
00:37:22,772 --> 00:37:23,811
I'll go to the market

397
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:25,456
to trade for some things.

398
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:28,656
Go ahead.

399
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,891
(Now, I've invested too many emotions)

400
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:44,972
(on Xingzhi.)

401
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,452
(It's getting beyond my control.)

402
00:37:50,052 --> 00:37:51,592
(After this period,)

403
00:37:51,592 --> 00:37:53,571
(I will then take back all my emotions.)

404
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,648
(But,)

405
00:37:58,532 --> 00:37:59,692
(can they be taken back?)

406
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:03,851
(I have never relied on others so much.)

407
00:38:05,012 --> 00:38:07,611
(Playing with fire is too dangerous.)

408
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:11,440
Come, have a drink.

409
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:13,991
Ever seen her?

410
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,292
No.

411
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:17,252
Have you seen this person?

412
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:18,448
No.

413
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,256
Has anyone seen her?

414
00:38:31,212 --> 00:38:32,252
Wait.

415
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:34,448
What?

416
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:46,331
You are looking for this woman?

417
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,692
What, you've seen her?

418
00:38:49,732 --> 00:38:50,800
I have.

419
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,932
I've seen her.

420
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:54,192
This woman

421
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,452
lives with a demon.

422
00:38:58,608 --> 00:38:59,632
What demon?

423
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:01,192
Just a demon.

424
00:39:01,192 --> 00:39:02,512
What else could it be?

425
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:04,012
It must be the demon that saved her.

426
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:07,611
How dare a third-rate demon oppose us?

427
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:10,768
Where is she?

428
00:39:20,048 --> 00:39:21,104
There's noise.

429
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:22,932
It doesn't sound like

430
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:24,692
those useless ruffians a few days ago.

431
00:39:27,811 --> 00:39:28,816
Who's there?

432
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:32,851
Your Lordship, you've made us
search hard for you.

433
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:37,432
She suffered such serious injuries

434
00:39:37,432 --> 00:39:38,651
in the dungeon.

435
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,371
How could she stand here
with all her limbs unharmed?

436
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:42,960
It's terrifying.

437
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:44,624
Terrifying.

438
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,611
Master Fu Sheng has said

439
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,891
that all her vessels are broken.

440
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:51,932
Now she is but an invalid who
has not yet recovered her powers.

441
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,692
If we don't capture her now,

442
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,411
do you want to be punished?

443
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,932
Has your master never taught you

444
00:40:02,732 --> 00:40:04,032
not to act recklessly

445
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:05,171
when the situation is unclear?

446
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:15,012
You're bluffing.

447
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,212
You just have

448
00:40:16,212 --> 00:40:17,932
a third-rate demon protecting you.

449
00:40:18,972 --> 00:40:20,331
Don't believe her.

450
00:40:20,331 --> 00:40:21,571
She's clearly bluffing.

451
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:23,331
Let's do it.

452
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:36,400
Impossible.

453
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:38,160
This is impossible.

454
00:40:43,012 --> 00:40:44,732
Blocking my Water Halting Spell
so easily?

455
00:40:45,972 --> 00:40:47,056
Water Halting Spell.

456
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:53,851
