00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,267
=Episode 11=

3
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,708
Stay back...

4
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:42,960
Stay away.

5
00:01:45,668 --> 00:01:47,267
What's wrong? Are you sick?

6
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,507
Come on, take your medicine.

7
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:53,827
This is the blood from your heart.

8
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:00,528
What's wrong?

9
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:02,992
What happened?

10
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:06,480
(Divine Realm, Lord Wenliu)
What's up?

11
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:08,048
Furong.

12
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,016
What happened?

13
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:14,256
Hallucination.

14
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,496
It's a hallucination.

15
00:02:18,627 --> 00:02:20,188
I can't go on like this.

16
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:22,028
I just can't.

17
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,248
What a tragic marriage.

18
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,707
The beauty drink I brought you
has gone to waste.

19
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:33,688
Get lost.

20
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:35,707
What's the point of beautifying myself?

21
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:36,987
My life is at stake.

22
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:40,268
And you're making fun of me.

23
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:41,748
Grandfather was right.

24
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,120
You're a fair-weather friend.

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,304
Don't get me wrong.

26
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:46,748
I've been devising plans

27
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:48,668
regarding your marriage.

28
00:02:54,828 --> 00:02:56,707
What plans? Tell me.

29
00:02:58,427 --> 00:02:59,504
Look.

30
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,708
It's a marriage alliance

31
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,627
between the Immortal and Divine realms.

32
00:03:03,188 --> 00:03:04,567
You can't dissuade the Heavenly Lord.

33
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,388
Then you can have ShenLi
pressure Her Holiness.

34
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:09,348
But she has done that.

35
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:10,728
She even ran away and got caught.

36
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:11,828
Make her do it again.

37
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,888
What do you mean?

38
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:18,672
Once you get there,

39
00:03:19,388 --> 00:03:21,408
try your best to displease ShenLi

40
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,108
until she can't take it anymore.

41
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:25,147
Then she will pressure Her Holiness.

42
00:03:27,668 --> 00:03:29,748
It's actually a good idea.

43
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:32,908
But what if I go too far,

44
00:03:33,507 --> 00:03:34,512
and ShenLi

45
00:03:35,056 --> 00:03:36,108
tries to kill me?

46
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:37,268
How dare she kill

47
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:39,467
the Heavenly Lord's grandson?

48
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:41,188
But she dares to eat Chimei.

49
00:03:41,707 --> 00:03:42,800
Am I right?

50
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:51,548
Isn't His Excellency

51
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:52,988
residing in the Immortal Realm?

52
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,388
Hide at his place

53
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,008
if things go wrong.

54
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,428
You are a royal descendant.

55
00:03:57,428 --> 00:03:59,227
He won't leave you in danger.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,088
He...

57
00:04:12,188 --> 00:04:13,347
He won't?

58
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,347
He won't.

59
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:21,228
Whatever. It's going to happen anyway.

60
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:22,787
I must visit the Immortal Realm.

61
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:24,656
At least...

62
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:28,407
At least...

63
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:31,208
I won't die in the bridal chamber
on the wedding night.

64
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,304
Let's go.

65
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,148
Is ShenLi still there?

66
00:04:47,984 --> 00:04:49,040
Yes.

67
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,207
What about His Excellency?

68
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,108
He has restored the seal
of the Xutian Abyss

69
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,787
and may have returned

70
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:55,548
to the Extranatural Heaven.

71
00:04:58,868 --> 00:05:00,428
He left without telling anyone?

72
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:02,248
That's right.

73
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:03,988
No one was sent to search for him?

74
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,148
His Excellency has always been elusive.

75
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:10,032
How dare we inquire.

76
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:12,708
Send someone

77
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,988
to the Divine Realm
and see if he has passed by

78
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:17,948
on his way back.

79
00:05:17,948 --> 00:05:19,068
Yes.

80
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,547
Your Holiness,
it may be inappropriate to inquire

81
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:22,787
about his whereabouts.

82
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,776
How come?

83
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,127
His Excellency restored the seals
for the Immortal Realm.

84
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,347
Naturally, we must
ensure his safe return.

85
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:33,168
Do as I say.

86
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:37,392
- Yes.
- Yes.

87
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,328
His Excellency hasn't descended
to lower realms.

88
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:48,627
(To Your Holiness)
Why are you inquiring about

89
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:49,747
his whereabouts?

90
00:05:50,588 --> 00:05:51,728
We must not

91
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,347
speculate about the heavenly will.

92
00:05:58,388 --> 00:05:59,428
(From now on,)

93
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:02,128
(I'll keep causing trouble
in her mansion)

94
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,888
(until she calls off the wedding.)

95
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:05,347
(How long can she take it?)

96
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:52,108
(I don't know)

97
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:54,307
(how time works in Xutian Abyss.)

98
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:56,588
(There's no direction or purpose.)

99
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,948
(I can't tell how long our walk)

100
00:06:58,948 --> 00:06:59,988
(would take.)

101
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,388
(It makes me look hasty)

102
00:07:03,388 --> 00:07:05,187
(if I keep asking about it.)

103
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,407
(I can't force him to talk)

104
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:09,868
(or sweet-talk him)

105
00:07:09,868 --> 00:07:10,960
(to get an answer.)

106
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:12,787
(What a difficult man.)

107
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,328
Chimei.

108
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,608
Finally, there is someone

109
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,828
who isn't afraid of death.

110
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,068
Do you want to take a look

111
00:07:31,068 --> 00:07:32,627
at the real Xutian Abyss?

112
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,027
Isn't it just a place

113
00:07:35,027 --> 00:07:36,627
where everything looks weird?

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,627
So many Chimei.

115
00:08:21,428 --> 00:08:22,888
You know they've been

116
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:23,988
watching us all along?

117
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,616
Of course.

118
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:53,200
Your Lordship.

119
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:55,248
Does the aura here

120
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,328
make you feel creepy

121
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,367
and uneasy?

122
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,504
Of course.

123
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:01,867
Therefore,

124
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,708
once we get out,

125
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:06,547
don't approach Xutian Abyss alone again.

126
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:12,428
(It took me a huge effort)

127
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,747
(to kill a Scorpion-Tailed Fox.)

128
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:16,987
(Yet he killed a Chimei effortlessly.)

129
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,268
(And he's able to)

130
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:21,067
(stroll leisurely here.)

131
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,547
(It may be easy for ancient gods,)

132
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:26,147
(but it's still quite impressive.)

133
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:27,312
Hold your breath.

134
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:39,627
You said we had to walk around.

135
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,788
Now you're being clever.

136
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,468
You noticed that we didn't walk around.

137
00:09:49,908 --> 00:09:51,056
You tricked me again.

138
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,867
No, we were truly trapped
because of the miasma.

139
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:57,788
(His palm is so cold.)

140
00:09:58,588 --> 00:10:00,187
It would have been difficult to leave

141
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:02,507
if we didn't come out just now.

142
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,560
Therefore,

143
00:10:05,268 --> 00:10:06,507
I pulled a trick.

144
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:08,720
I cast a spell.

145
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,828
It's a bit overwhelming for me.

146
00:10:16,588 --> 00:10:17,908
But rest assured.

147
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,468
I have everything under control.

148
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:25,927
(He's been restoring the seals)

149
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:27,228
(and he got injured.)

150
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,948
(It's too much even for a god.)

151
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,427
(The miasma on his arm must be tricky.)

152
00:10:33,987 --> 00:10:35,908
(That's why
he did not remove it sooner.)

153
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:39,148
(Those Chimei were about to attack us.)

154
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:41,347
(He was forced to dissipate the miasma)

155
00:10:41,347 --> 00:10:43,228
(and escape from the Xutian Abyss.)

156
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:46,588
(It turns out)

157
00:10:46,588 --> 00:10:47,627
(that a powerful god)

158
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:49,747
(can also suffer from injuries.)

159
00:10:51,747 --> 00:10:52,808
(Lord Xingzhi)

160
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:54,067
(also tends to act tough.)

161
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:15,507
Your Lordship. Your Excellency.

162
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,200
You...

163
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,832
What's wrong?

164
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,828
You have been missing for five days.

165
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:23,908
General Shangbei
was looking for you like crazy.

166
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:25,268
He thought you had run off again.

167
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,628
He is rushing back to apologize

168
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:27,788
to Her Holiness.

169
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:29,948
When did he leave?

170
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:30,960
Yesterday afternoon.

171
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,828
The main force lacks mobility.

172
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,488
It's even worse with the injured.

173
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,888
Perhaps we will arrive at the capital

174
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:38,987
sooner than they do.

175
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,680
I shall return now.

176
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,176
What's the rush?

177
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,352
I have everything

178
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:48,228
under control.

179
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,072
Well...

180
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,448
Am I sensing something

181
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,627
because I'm paranoid?

182
00:12:14,187 --> 00:12:16,427
General, I am also paranoid.

183
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:34,228
Her Lordship is here!

184
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,348
Her Lordship is back!

185
00:12:37,228 --> 00:12:38,384
- Your Lordship!
- Your Lordship!

186
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,148
Your Capital City is so lively.

187
00:12:43,547 --> 00:12:45,128
Every time we return in victory,

188
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:46,408
the citizens of the Capital City

189
00:12:46,408 --> 00:12:48,627
greet us with banners and cheers.

190
00:12:50,307 --> 00:12:51,468
After all those victories,

191
00:12:52,228 --> 00:12:54,747
you still enjoy such welcomes.

192
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,927
That's right. I love it.

193
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:00,487
Their smiling faces

194
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:02,188
keep reminding me that I've taken

195
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:03,268
a meaningful course.

196
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,808
You are truly remarkable.

197
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:07,427
I truly admire you.

198
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:10,148
Your Lordship.

199
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,427
I made this for you.

200
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,067
Thank you. Put it on me.

201
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,216
Thank you.

202
00:13:19,788 --> 00:13:20,880
Mother.

203
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,547
Mother, look how pretty Her Lordship is.

204
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,264
Your Holiness.

205
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:36,107
General Shangbei
has sent an urgent message.

206
00:13:42,268 --> 00:13:44,987
Lord Bicang has been
missing for five days.

207
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:54,047
Qingyan, go there now.

208
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,216
Your Holiness.

209
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:58,307
Her Lordship
and Lord Xingzhi have arrived.

210
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,088
Your Holiness.

211
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:07,448
Your Excellency, please forgive me
for not welcoming you

212
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:08,627
in advance.

213
00:14:09,468 --> 00:14:10,480
Don't mention it.

214
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:12,987
I said that I descended

215
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:15,427
to the lower realm

216
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:17,228
only to seal the Xutian Abyss.

217
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:19,708
I did not wish to disturb you.

218
00:14:20,908 --> 00:14:21,987
It's just that Lord Bicang

219
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:24,304
needs a witness.

220
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:29,828
Your Holiness.

221
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,868
I didn't flee from the wedding.

222
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:32,908
I went to the frontier

223
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,228
to kill those Chimei.

224
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:36,708
I wanted to come back
with General Shangbei.

225
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:40,067
But something went wrong.

226
00:15:03,427 --> 00:15:04,667
General Mofang said

227
00:15:05,908 --> 00:15:08,148
you made great contributions
in the battle.

228
00:15:08,747 --> 00:15:10,067
It cancels out your misconduct.

229
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:11,792
I will let you off

230
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:13,468
for defying my order.

231
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:16,656
Thank you, Master.

232
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:23,307
I heard you were struck by miasma.

233
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:24,948
Are you fine now?

234
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:27,747
Lord Xingzhi

235
00:15:27,747 --> 00:15:29,547
has cleared the miasma for me.

236
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:33,840
Thank you, Your Excellency.

237
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:35,568
Don't mention it.

238
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:37,936
Please be seated.

239
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:02,192
Your Excellency.

240
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,368
You came to our rescue

241
00:16:04,368 --> 00:16:06,087
when we were in crisis.

242
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:08,668
Our people are immensely grateful.

243
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:09,872
You are welcome.

244
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:17,268
Are you returning to
the Extranatural Heaven?

245
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:21,028
I'm planning

246
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,148
to stay in the Immortal Realm
for a while.

247
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,468
I came here

248
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:38,667
a thousand years ago,

249
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,028
but it was a brief visit

250
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:43,987
and I didn't learn
about the customs here.

251
00:16:44,788 --> 00:16:45,948
On the way back

252
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:47,600
with Lord Bicang,

253
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,328
I saw colored flags

254
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:51,248
outside each household in Capital City.

255
00:16:51,248 --> 00:16:53,788
Everyone was celebrating the victory.

256
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,388
It struck me profoundly

257
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:59,428
that the Immortal Realm
is quite different

258
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:00,548
from the Divine Realm

259
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:01,788
and the Extranatural Heaven.

260
00:17:02,507 --> 00:17:03,632
Therefore,

261
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:05,488
I plan to stay

262
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:07,108
for a full experience.

263
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:10,748
Would you kindly allow it?

264
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:19,108
It is our honor for you to stay

265
00:17:19,108 --> 00:17:20,228
in the Immortal Realm.

266
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:22,868
But I'm afraid

267
00:17:23,508 --> 00:17:24,656
the poor environment

268
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:26,588
and the tough folks

269
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:27,696
may end up

270
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,387
displeasing you.

271
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:30,992
It's alright.

272
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
But...

273
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:38,227
Your Holiness, you are reluctant

274
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:39,787
to let me stay here, aren't you?

275
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,228
Please don't get me wrong.

276
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,108
I just have some concerns.

277
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:49,868
Since you'd like to stay with us,

278
00:17:51,787 --> 00:17:52,848
Qingyan,

279
00:17:53,748 --> 00:17:56,387
arrange for His Excellency
to stay in the palace.

280
00:17:57,427 --> 00:17:58,576
Yes.

281
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,067
I'd like to settle

282
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:03,748
in Lord Bicang's mansion.

283
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:10,408
ShenLi is a military person.

284
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:12,307
Her servants are clumsy

285
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:15,748
and may not serve you well.

286
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,588
I don't think

287
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:19,984
I know anyone here

288
00:18:20,828 --> 00:18:22,348
apart from Lord Bicang.

289
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,087
I wish

290
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:28,028
she could show me around
and tell me the customs here.

291
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:29,628
There isn't much to see or know about.

292
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:36,628
Please don't mind her.

293
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:39,248
I have spoiled her
since she was a little girl.

294
00:18:39,248 --> 00:18:40,624
Li didn't mean to be disrespectful.

295
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:41,968
Perhaps, you could

296
00:18:41,968 --> 00:18:44,408
stay in the side hall of the palace.

297
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,427
It's quiet there.

298
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,147
I want to stay at Lord Bicang's Mansion.

299
00:18:58,187 --> 00:18:59,216
I don't think

300
00:19:00,588 --> 00:19:02,748
there's a place quieter

301
00:19:02,748 --> 00:19:04,748
than the Extranatural Heaven.

302
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:05,776
I came here

303
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:07,547
for some livelihood.

304
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,264
So you just won't

305
00:19:10,988 --> 00:19:13,307
let me stay
at Lord Bicang's Mansion, right?

306
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:15,427
Do as the host says.

307
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:17,547
- Even ancient gods should...
- ShenLi.

308
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,667
Since His Excellency
wishes to reside here,

309
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:25,424
you must

310
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:27,828
extend the courtesy of the host.

311
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:40,167
Your Excellency,

312
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,588
I'd like to talk to Li in private.

313
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:46,187
Could you please
rest for a while in the side hall?

314
00:19:46,988 --> 00:19:48,048
Of course.

315
00:19:49,228 --> 00:19:50,320
Qingyan.

316
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:53,027
Your Excellency, this way please.

317
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:04,368
Your Holiness,
he's acting like a hooligan.

318
00:20:04,368 --> 00:20:05,387
Why do you indulge him?

319
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:07,216
He is Lord Xingzhi.

320
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:09,072
So what?

321
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:10,108
Stop making a fuss.

322
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,912
This way, please.

323
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:20,348
What makes you sigh?

324
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,576
I'm envious.

325
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:24,528
Of what?

326
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:31,828
The worldly affection.

327
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:38,667
Have you recovered?

328
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:40,432
I'm fine now.

329
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:42,948
He's going to stay with you.

330
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:45,187
Do you need some extra hands?

331
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:48,027
No need, I never intended
to serve him well.

332
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:50,992
Master.

333
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,907
When can I get my parrot back?

334
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,828
Take it away. It's so noisy.

335
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:58,067
Her Lordship is in seclusion.

336
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,080
Shush.

337
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:05,840
Let go of me.

338
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,336
- Don't take it away!
- Behave.

339
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:09,424
Let go.

340
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:11,348
- Stop there!
- I'm going to kill you!

341
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,616
Let go.

342
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:15,828
Yeah, it is a bit noisy.

343
00:21:26,192 --> 00:21:28,366
Why don't you want His Excellency

344
00:21:29,536 --> 00:21:30,705
in your mansion?

345
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:35,600
No specific reason.

346
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:39,440
Is it because

347
00:21:40,787 --> 00:21:43,427
he resembles that mortal
from the Mortal Realm?

348
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:47,664
Master.

349
00:21:53,508 --> 00:21:54,868
It doesn't matter if he does.

350
00:21:55,787 --> 00:21:57,228
I've decided to let go

351
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,508
of the past.

352
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,528
I have decided

353
00:22:06,387 --> 00:22:07,504
to accept Furong

354
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:10,628
and this marriage.

355
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:15,907
The battle against

356
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:17,468
the Scorpion-Tailed Fox

357
00:22:20,828 --> 00:22:22,628
showed me what the Chimei
were capable of.

358
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:24,880
There are more than

359
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:28,108
thousands of them in the Xutian Abyss.

360
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:30,608
Sealing the Xutian Abyss

361
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,067
is more important than I imagined.

362
00:22:33,488 --> 00:22:35,877
Lord Xingzhi can't guard
the Immortal Realm forever.

363
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:38,667
We do need a divine being

364
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,128
with the power of purification

365
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,588
to help us guard the seal.

366
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:47,307
So a marriage alliance

367
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:49,387
is the best solution.

368
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:54,787
Even if he has a bad reputation?

369
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:56,588
Right.

370
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,168
- You call this food?
- Chef Li.

371
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:05,267
Don't take it to heart.

372
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:07,307
I'm done! I swear I'll chop him up!

373
00:23:07,307 --> 00:23:08,988
- Stop it.
- I'm going to chop him up.

374
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,416
- Do you know how to cook?
- Let go!

375
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:13,108
I'm going to chop him up! Let go!

376
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:15,828
Yeah, aim here. Come on.

377
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:19,440
Well...

378
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:21,456
Well...

379
00:23:36,907 --> 00:23:38,096
Li.

380
00:23:38,907 --> 00:23:40,387
I hope you've made

381
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:42,427
a careful decision

382
00:23:44,187 --> 00:23:45,988
instead of an impulsive one.

383
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:48,387
Master, you know me.

384
00:23:50,508 --> 00:23:51,536
You always keep your word.

385
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,067
You have matured a lot after this trip

386
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:57,187
to the Xutian Abyss.

387
00:23:59,427 --> 00:24:00,547
Good for you.

388
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:02,868
It will be

389
00:24:02,868 --> 00:24:04,228
your thousandth birthday soon.

390
00:24:04,948 --> 00:24:06,064
Really?

391
00:24:09,027 --> 00:24:10,868
We don't keep track of those things

392
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:12,880
like the divine beings.

393
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:15,408
I'm surprised that you remember it.

394
00:24:15,408 --> 00:24:16,427
Of course, I do.

395
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:19,948
I remember everything

396
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,064
about you.

397
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,233
Right, did you manage to

398
00:24:35,828 --> 00:24:36,907
see the Xutian Abyss?

399
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,267
Yeah.

400
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:41,868
Did the miasma there do you harm?

401
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,628
Lord Xingzhi has cleared
the miasma for me.

402
00:24:49,787 --> 00:24:51,988
Did he say anything
about your condition?

403
00:24:53,348 --> 00:24:54,448
What?

404
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,628
I said, "Did he say anything
about your condition?"

405
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,712
No.

406
00:25:02,427 --> 00:25:03,568
What's wrong, Master?

407
00:25:07,307 --> 00:25:09,267
Nothing. It's all good.

408
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:18,768
Over here.

409
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:21,104
Why are you so lost?

410
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:23,708
It's because of Lord Xingzhi.

411
00:25:23,708 --> 00:25:24,816
His Excellency?

412
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:26,787
What about him?

413
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:28,068
Is he incredibly handsome

414
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,387
and impressive?

415
00:25:33,468 --> 00:25:35,547
He's identical to that mortal we saw

416
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:37,168
in the Mortal Realm.

417
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,080
Identical?

418
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,228
What do you mean?

419
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:43,547
He looks just like him.

420
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:44,656
He does?

421
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:48,624
It seems

422
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:50,768
he's after Her Lordship.

423
00:25:50,768 --> 00:25:51,787
For real?

424
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,408
Is it possible

425
00:25:58,408 --> 00:25:59,828
that His Excellency is that mortal?

426
00:26:01,748 --> 00:26:02,868
He's still deeply in love

427
00:26:03,468 --> 00:26:05,027
and has followed Her Lordship

428
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:06,808
to the Xutian Abyss and here.

429
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:07,952
That's enough.

430
00:26:09,787 --> 00:26:10,800
Believe me.

431
00:26:11,748 --> 00:26:13,168
My opinion matters not.

432
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:14,288
Most importantly,

433
00:26:14,288 --> 00:26:16,907
I hope you're mistaken.

434
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:17,936
Otherwise,

435
00:26:18,508 --> 00:26:19,588
Her Lordship and our realm

436
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:21,547
will get in trouble.

437
00:26:22,187 --> 00:26:23,216
And us.

438
00:26:24,748 --> 00:26:25,808
We'll be doomed.

439
00:26:27,348 --> 00:26:29,348
We're doomed.

440
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,232
(Lord Bicang's Mansion, Immortal Realm)

441
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:46,448
Your Lordship, please come back.

442
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:48,187
Please come back.

443
00:26:49,828 --> 00:26:51,228
Your Lordship.

444
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:55,568
Rouya.

445
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:00,560
What's the matter, Rouya?

446
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,667
Your Lordship.

447
00:27:04,108 --> 00:27:07,108
Your Lordship,
I'm getting bullied by Chimei.

448
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:09,348
How come there's Chimei in my mansion?

449
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,968
You wretched girl, it's burning hot!

450
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,147
I swear I'll...

451
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:19,152
I'll skin you.

452
00:27:24,688 --> 00:27:25,744
Who are you?

453
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:27,787
Your Lordship, look at him.

454
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,160
Your Lordship?

455
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:33,008
You are ShenLi?

456
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:52,628
So you are ShenLi.

457
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,176
Furong.

458
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:18,027
Hasn't the Heavenly Lord

459
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:20,588
taught you to be properly dressed?

460
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:25,264
Furong?

461
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:30,896
Heavenly Lord's grandson?

462
00:28:37,588 --> 00:28:39,508
Why would such a man live here?

463
00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:42,128
I didn't want it either.

464
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:43,667
But I can't disobey

465
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:45,027
Her Holiness.

466
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:46,948
You just left when you said

467
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:48,307
you went into seclusion.

468
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:54,748
This guy

469
00:28:54,748 --> 00:28:56,588
asks me to do everything for him

470
00:28:56,588 --> 00:28:57,708
and he wants

471
00:28:57,708 --> 00:28:59,348
the bath water to be perfectly warm.

472
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:02,287
Your Lordship, he's troublesome.

473
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:03,508
Can't you just beat him up?

474
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,528
How dare you?

475
00:29:05,187 --> 00:29:07,508
How can a maid speak like this?

476
00:29:09,828 --> 00:29:12,187
My maid is allowed to speak like this.

477
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:17,667
We can talk about it

478
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:19,787
if you're not pleased.

479
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:25,508
I'm just saying.

480
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,144
It's alright.

481
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,988
I didn't know about your stay.

482
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:39,147
And I apologize for that.

483
00:29:40,267 --> 00:29:41,948
But please let me ask you something.

484
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,907
Why did you come for trouble
when you could enjoy yourself

485
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:48,027
in the Divine Realm?

486
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:54,307
Don't you know

487
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:58,108
I've grown quite displeased with you

488
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:01,588
due to our engagement?

489
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:27,907
(T-This is not)

490
00:30:29,348 --> 00:30:31,667
(a woman anyone should marry.)

491
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:42,228
I-I heard

492
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,368
the Chimei have escaped

493
00:30:44,368 --> 00:30:46,987
and the miasma has been rampant.

494
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:50,167
So I came to help cleanse the miasma.

495
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:51,348
How can you be so...

496
00:30:56,528 --> 00:30:57,584
impolite?

497
00:30:58,588 --> 00:30:59,588
You're kidding me.

498
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,760
What do you mean?

499
00:31:05,147 --> 00:31:07,348
Do you know me?
Why do you look down on me?

500
00:31:08,387 --> 00:31:09,508
I'm not bragging.

501
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:10,568
When it comes to

502
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:11,648
the power of purification,

503
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:13,147
- only Lord Xingzhi...
- Enough.

504
00:31:15,988 --> 00:31:17,008
Furong.

505
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,387
Did the Heavenly Lord know

506
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:22,588
about your visit?

507
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:24,748
Of course.

508
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,928
Grandfather also told me
to stay a bit longer

509
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,307
to help the people here.

510
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:30,387
Excuses.

511
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,688
He just wanted you
to bond with Her Lordship.

512
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:34,868
Everyone knows what you're up to.

513
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,608
Fine.

514
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:40,547
Stay if you want.

515
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,268
Your Lordship,
what are you talking about?

516
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:46,320
What do you mean?

517
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:48,108
What don't you get?

518
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:50,648
We can't let him stay.

519
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:52,988
We can't serve him here.

520
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:54,907
From now on,

521
00:31:55,427 --> 00:31:56,496
you'll serve

522
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:58,748
Furong

523
00:31:58,748 --> 00:31:59,988
as if you're serving me.

524
00:32:01,027 --> 00:32:03,508
Go ahead. Clean up a room

525
00:32:03,508 --> 00:32:04,688
for Furong.

526
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,828
But after all,
this is not the Divine Realm.

527
00:32:19,828 --> 00:32:21,267
We don't have so many servants.

528
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:26,948
You heard what I told my maid just now.

529
00:32:27,868 --> 00:32:29,208
She will serve you

530
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,547
as if she is serving me.

531
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:34,408
Not a bit less.

532
00:32:34,408 --> 00:32:36,208
But forget it if you want

533
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:37,264
anything extra.

534
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,067
Get used to your bath water

535
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,408
no matter whether it's freezing

536
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:43,468
or burning.

537
00:32:47,907 --> 00:32:48,912
Furong.

538
00:32:49,787 --> 00:32:51,468
You said you came to help.

539
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:54,547
The moonlight is perfect tonight,

540
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:58,228
and you have taken a bath.

541
00:32:59,067 --> 00:33:00,347
What a pity if you don't

542
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:01,667
purify the surroundings

543
00:33:02,427 --> 00:33:03,440
with your great aura.

544
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:08,848
I happened to see the miasma

545
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:11,948
at the southeastern corner
of the city earlier.

546
00:33:18,672 --> 00:33:19,824
Furong.

547
00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:22,320
Get going.

548
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,712
Your foot.

549
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,427
I'm on it, Your Excellency.

550
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:43,347
Has Furong

551
00:33:43,347 --> 00:33:44,547
ever offended you?

552
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,348
What do you mean?

553
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:50,628
I think you were also bullying him.

554
00:33:52,588 --> 00:33:54,948
I have never bullied anyone.

555
00:33:56,508 --> 00:33:57,648
Is that so?

556
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:04,387
How is he ever going to help the people?

557
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:06,988
It's just an excuse.

558
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:10,708
What has been said

559
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,827
must be done.

560
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,104
Alright.

561
00:34:23,147 --> 00:34:25,948
(I think I did get a bit annoyed.)

562
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:28,656
(What's wrong with me?)

563
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:39,984
The Wordless Heavenly Book.

564
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:54,948
Master, what is this?

565
00:34:56,988 --> 00:34:58,788
It hides something more important.

566
00:35:10,512 --> 00:35:11,600
This is...

567
00:35:12,228 --> 00:35:13,528
This is yours.

568
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,627
The Azure Sea Pearl.

569
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,508
You were born with it in your mouth.

570
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,268
The power of this pearl is immense.

571
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:32,668
You were too young at the time.

572
00:35:32,668 --> 00:35:35,168
It was a great burden for you.

573
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:36,228
So your mother

574
00:35:36,907 --> 00:35:38,147
entrusted it to me.

575
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,748
I knew I was born with the pearl.

576
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:46,347
But I always thought

577
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:48,667
that I had swallowed and digested it.

578
00:35:49,508 --> 00:35:51,667
I didn't know it was taken out.

579
00:35:52,228 --> 00:35:53,627
I claimed that it has

580
00:35:54,187 --> 00:35:55,347
turned into your power

581
00:35:56,308 --> 00:35:58,107
to avoid any potential threat.

582
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,308
And I kept it with me

583
00:36:01,147 --> 00:36:02,427
to return it to you

584
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,587
at the right time

585
00:36:04,508 --> 00:36:06,408
or when you need it.

586
00:36:06,408 --> 00:36:07,587
You once told me

587
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:09,907
that my parents

588
00:36:09,907 --> 00:36:12,508
died in a battle
against Chimei 1,000 years ago

589
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:15,708
and I was born on the battlefield.

590
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:18,068
I have neither seen them,

591
00:36:19,187 --> 00:36:20,427
nor felt their presence.

592
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:25,872
Then,

593
00:36:26,948 --> 00:36:28,028
Master, do you know

594
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,667
if my mother has seen this pearl?

595
00:36:35,187 --> 00:36:36,240
Of course.

596
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:18,708
It is the only thing
of my few belongings

597
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:24,187
that connects me with her.

598
00:37:32,548 --> 00:37:34,347
It can help you
restore your spiritual power.

599
00:37:35,268 --> 00:37:36,848
You lost 500 years of spiritual power

600
00:37:36,848 --> 00:37:38,467
before you went to Xutian Abyss

601
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,907
and thus got severely injured.

602
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,667
I'm giving it back to you

603
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:43,347
just in case

604
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:45,168
something else happens.

605
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:53,667
Rest assured.

606
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:54,788
It will definitely

607
00:37:55,347 --> 00:37:57,187
settle down in your body.

608
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:58,992
It won't disappear.

609
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,508
But I don't want to take it.

610
00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:06,000
Such warmth

611
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:07,788
is something

612
00:38:09,627 --> 00:38:10,988
that comes from my mother.

613
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:13,392
Yes, indeed.

614
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:16,627
It's like her palm.

615
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:19,312
