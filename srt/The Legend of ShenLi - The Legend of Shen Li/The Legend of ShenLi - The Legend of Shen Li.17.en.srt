00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:35,104
=The Legend of ShenLi=

2
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:39,343
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,288
As Gu Chengjin,

4
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,168
the eldest young master
plotted against me.

5
00:01:45,089 --> 00:01:46,320
Later I found out

6
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:49,329
that it was Fu Sheng who advised him.

7
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:56,769
I recall he has been executed.

8
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,208
In this life, who do you think
resembles him?

9
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,440
There is someone.

10
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:28,994
(Young Jing Yan)

11
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,689
(Young Shi Luo)

12
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:00,944
This is for you.

13
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,424
Come.

14
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,096
Be careful.

15
00:03:16,008 --> 00:03:17,168
Hurry.

16
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,368
Over there!

17
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,632
Stop!

18
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,769
Stop! Get her!

19
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,152
Stop there!

20
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:36,368
In retrospect,

21
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,329
Jing Yan's parents' murderer

22
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:41,209
bears some resemblance to Fu Sheng.

23
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,929
Your divine power
cannot last any longer.

24
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:01,289
After this parting,
we may never meet again.

25
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:08,248
Take care, my friend.

26
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,016
Take care.

27
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:25,849
Mr. Jing Yan,

28
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,609
touch the ground with your hand.

29
00:04:41,248 --> 00:04:42,248
What's this?

30
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,088
The purification technique.

31
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:45,648
Your powers have just awakened.

32
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:47,928
It's normal to feel some discomfort.

33
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,309
Go home and rest for now.

34
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:53,409
Soon you'll be able to remove
the miasma for people.

35
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,640
Thank you, Diviner.

36
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,368
How much longer
do you plan to follow me?

37
00:05:20,048 --> 00:05:21,104
Come out.

38
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,969
That's not the Lord Bicang I know.

39
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:32,248
Everyone knows

40
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,488
that you are the only ancient god.

41
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:36,849
What's the matter with Jing Yan?

42
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:41,368
Now, I am the only ancient god.

43
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,849
But a long time ago,

44
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:46,129
above the Extranatural Heaven,

45
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,648
there were other ancient gods.

46
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:51,048
Because it's far too long ago,

47
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,296
not just for you,

48
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,329
even for me,

49
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:57,648
it's too distant to trace back.

50
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:01,729
Jing Yan is also Gu Chengjin.

51
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:04,808
He was once my friend.

52
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:07,368
His name is Qingye.

53
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,528
Silver hair.

54
00:06:08,528 --> 00:06:09,584
Dark pupils.

55
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:24,648
Qianji, do you know?

56
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:26,729
The deities of the heaven

57
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:29,208
made a ranking of
the ancient gods' wisdom.

58
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,328
You are third.

59
00:06:31,328 --> 00:06:32,969
I and Xingzhi took the first two places.

60
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:38,224
Xingzhi.

61
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:40,889
You lost to me by one vote.

62
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,800
Work harder.

63
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:45,009
He was once the wisest deity

64
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,729
of the Extranatural Heaven.

65
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:48,768
Wiser than Your Excellency?

66
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:54,248
I personally think I am wiser than him.

67
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:58,800
You don't believe me?

68
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:00,449
I agree.

69
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,464
What about after?

70
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,849
Why is he no longer a deity?

71
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,289
Because he fell in love
with someone he shouldn't.

72
00:07:22,088 --> 00:07:23,928
He abused divine power

73
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,649
to save his loved one.

74
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:26,768
He defied the Natural Law

75
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:28,912
and was stripped of his divinity.

76
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,328
Who can punish a deity?

77
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,609
Divine power is bestowed by the heavens,

78
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:38,469
and subject to the Natural Law.

79
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:39,768
There will be chaos

80
00:07:40,368 --> 00:07:41,969
if such mighty power

81
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:45,129
is misused.

82
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:49,248
Actually, the Extranatural Heaven

83
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:51,149
doesn't grant much more freedom

84
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:52,528
than the mortal realm.

85
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,889
(Qingye was banished)

86
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:02,889
(to roam in the Mortal Realm.)

87
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:06,768
(But for the ancient gods,)

88
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:08,528
(wandering in the world)

89
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,488
(is hardly a punishment.)

90
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,089
(Thus, the Natural Law made him)

91
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:16,169
(endure the sufferings
of the mortal world)

92
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,328
(and miss his loved one)

93
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,256
(in every life.)

123
00:11:21,729 --> 00:11:24,448
This time he encountered
Jing Xi and Shi Luo again.

124
00:11:28,448 --> 00:11:30,729
Do you know who he truly loves?

125
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:35,008
God knows.

126
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:36,249
Do you really not know?

127
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,249
I have awakened his divinity

128
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:44,128
and given him a little divine power.

129
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:47,088
Let's hope he will sense a clue.

130
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:49,648
But the outcome

131
00:11:50,888 --> 00:11:52,560
depends on fate.

132
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:54,929
We can only hope

133
00:11:55,609 --> 00:11:56,969
that the Natural Law won't be ruthless.

134
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,568
Is he going to miss her again?

135
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:08,128
They are destined to miss.

136
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,648
No.

137
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,648
Qingye was deprived of his divinity,

138
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:17,409
but the heavens can't
watch him all the time

139
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:18,648
to interfere with his life.

140
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:20,929
As Gu Chengjin,

141
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:22,888
he shared life with his wife

142
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,008
but entangled with a demon,

143
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:28,888
which caused the demon to die for him.

144
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,689
This time, as Jing Yan,

145
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:33,369
he grew up with Jing Xi

146
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,309
but fell for Shi Luo,

147
00:12:35,309 --> 00:12:37,049
wavering between these two.

148
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:40,128
Since he wanders in the Mortal Realm,

149
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:43,729
a person's fate is largely
decided by himself.

150
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,369
It's due to his choices,

151
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:47,280
not fate.

152
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:52,049
Do not defend your friend
through the talks of fate.

153
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:56,568
That's an interesting argument.

154
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:58,888
Regardless,

155
00:12:58,888 --> 00:13:00,128
Jing Yan's trial

156
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:02,128
must still be related to romance.

157
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,208
Those are beyond our control.

158
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:08,568
We can only watch this far.

159
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:13,088
Then why did you awaken
his divine consciousness?

160
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,149
Aren't you afraid of being condemned?

161
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:18,289
Qingye is punished by the heaven,

162
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,288
but he has not

163
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:21,969
committed any grave sin.

164
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,448
Awakening a trace of
his divine consciousness does no harm.

165
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,328
The aura is very weak,

166
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:30,029
not even one ten-thousandth
of his former strength.

167
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:32,368
But it's enough

168
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:33,929
to treat those villagers.

169
00:13:34,809 --> 00:13:37,568
To have me condemned is unlikely.

170
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,489
So Diviners do have emotions,

171
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:48,888
they just can't be swayed.

172
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,969
It's about time to head back.

173
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:18,794
(North Academy)

174
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:23,824
I'll go help treating people.

175
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:32,912
Your Lordship.

176
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,508
Lord Furong asked me to inform you

177
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,369
that he has followed your instructions

178
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:38,568
and returned to the Immortal Realm.

179
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:42,328
Before leaving, he made
Jing Yan quite angry.

180
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:44,049
- Feel it.
- I got it.

181
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:46,169
Thank you, Your Excellency.

182
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,328
(For Lord Furong,)

183
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:50,169
(there's only a fraction
of sincerity in helping Jing Xi.)

184
00:14:51,568 --> 00:14:52,689
(Mostly,)

185
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:54,568
(he just wants to
take advantage of her.)

186
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,409
(That silly girl took his words
to heart.)

187
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:00,729
A lecherous person

188
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:02,648
cannot change his nature.

189
00:15:04,688 --> 00:15:06,448
Stop fighting, let me see.

190
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,269
- Let me see it.
- Me first.

191
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,708
Pass it to me quickly.

192
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,729
I want to see it too.

193
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:12,249
Is this the Diviner's handkerchief?

194
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:13,849
Yes, let me touch it.

195
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:17,169
It feels so comfortable.

196
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,736
Is it real?

197
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:26,609
Let me see again.

198
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,809
That is the craft of Zhiyun Deity
from the Heavenly Palace.

199
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,729
It must be from Furong.

200
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:36,809
He is gone,

201
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,308
yet his possession
is still causing trouble.

202
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:43,888
You worry yourself
to bits for the ladies.

203
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:45,849
If one day

204
00:15:45,849 --> 00:15:47,169
I marry Furong,

205
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:50,064
I need to think of a way

206
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:53,049
to stop him from bothering the ladies.

207
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:00,289
- Yueyue, let's go.
- Let's take a look.

208
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,192
A new day.

209
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:04,888
- The new day is coming.
- Yes.

210
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:09,049
- Come, slowly.
- Jinxiu City finally feels lively.

211
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:13,128
It's the new day.

212
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:14,208
It's the new day.

213
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:16,929
Their anticipation for the new day

214
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,008
and hope for the future

215
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,688
are the same as those of the Immortal.

216
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:23,648
Why don't we join them?

217
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,688
We can dispel bad luck.

218
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,009
Fireworks are in the sky.

219
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:29,809
How can it dispel
the bad luck of people?

220
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,080
Let them have fun.

221
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:37,768
Let's follow their customs.

222
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,088
It's a new life.

223
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:45,729
It's a good chance

224
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:46,888
to experience the joys of humans.

225
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,328
You gave them their happy life.

226
00:16:50,888 --> 00:16:52,929
Take it as their way of thanking you.

227
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:04,808
Awesome.

228
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,112
That's amazing.

229
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:29,520
Spectacular.

230
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,609
Amazing.

231
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:55,249
Don't walk in front of me.

232
00:17:56,168 --> 00:17:57,424
Why?

233
00:17:58,321 --> 00:17:59,824
Because...

234
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:03,808

235
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:06,369

stay in front

299

to protect you.

300
00:25:19,129 --> 00:25:21,249
Miss Shi Luo.

301
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:23,609
I thought you had left.

302
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:31,649
What are you weaving, Mr. Jing Yan?

303
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:40,976
Do you remember?

304
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,849
When I was taken away
by a sect as a child,

305
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:48,688
you helped me escape and
taught me to weave grasshoppers

306
00:25:50,208 --> 00:25:51,729
to comfort me.

307
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:02,369
I was just feeling regretful

308
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:06,529
that I didn't properly
say goodbye to you.

309
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,288
Fortunately, you returned.

310
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:12,769
Finally, I can properly

311
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,192
say goodbye.

312
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:24,529
Tomorrow, I plan to
go back with Jing Xi.

313
00:26:25,849 --> 00:26:27,489
This wild girl.

314
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:28,609
If she stays any longer,

315
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:30,088
who knows what she will become?

316
00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:54,769
Mr. Jing Yan.

317
00:26:54,769 --> 00:26:55,769
We'll see

318
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,768
where fate leads us.

319
00:27:02,129 --> 00:27:03,728
Take care.

320
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,840
What is wrong with me?

321
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:06,329
Do not eat

322
00:28:06,329 --> 00:28:07,729
when you walk.

323
00:28:08,408 --> 00:28:10,609
Where did you get this habit?

324
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,489
Lord Furong taught me.

325
00:28:13,088 --> 00:28:15,188
A steamed bun in one hand,
a stuffed one in the other.

326
00:28:15,188 --> 00:28:17,889
He said rules are dead,
but people are alive.

327
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:21,200
A bad habit.

328
00:28:22,849 --> 00:28:24,129
You got sugar all over your mouth.

329
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,488
That's dirty.

330
00:28:31,729 --> 00:28:32,848
Does it taste good?

331
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,369
Yeah, you should try one too.

332
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:40,976
Have one.

333
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:58,448
(Is he going to miss her again?)

334
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:02,489
(They are destined to miss.)

335
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,489
My body has mostly recovered.

336
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,268
I should return to the Immortal Realm.

337
00:29:39,889 --> 00:29:42,369
Why not stay a bit longer?

338
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,789
You can return

339
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:45,969
after the miasma is cleared.

340
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:49,688
It's troubled times.

341
00:29:49,688 --> 00:29:50,889
After Her Holiness knows,

342
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,928
she will make arrangements.

343
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:56,369
I should go back.

344
00:29:58,609 --> 00:29:59,649
The matter of miasma is serious.

345
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:02,160
I will accompany Your Lordship.

346
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:05,232
Okay.

347
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,328
Your Lordship?

348
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,649
Your Lordship.

349
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,449
You have finally returned.

350
00:30:22,449 --> 00:30:24,868
Get up and speak properly.

351
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,009
Your Lordship.

352
00:30:26,009 --> 00:30:27,208
Furong

353
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,228
has come here again.

354
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:29,328
As soon as he arrived,

355
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,628
he's been following General Mofang

356
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:31,949
wherever he goes.

357
00:30:31,949 --> 00:30:33,469
Not only the general's
duties are obstructed,

358
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:36,088
those rumors have also started again.

359
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:38,489
He's intolerable.

360
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:40,649
Your Lordship,
Luotian Goddess has also come.

361
00:30:41,249 --> 00:30:44,288
Who is Luotian Goddess?

362
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:47,529
Luotian Goddess is a title
in the Divine Realm.

363
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:49,969
Her name is Youlan, Furong's sister,

364
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:51,328
Heavenly Lord's granddaughter.

365
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,048
Her Holiness is welcoming her
in the council hall.

366
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:06,969
General Zhufei.

367
00:31:06,969 --> 00:31:08,529
General Zhufei.

368
00:31:08,529 --> 00:31:09,808
Please wait.

369
00:31:11,288 --> 00:31:13,129
General Zhufei,

370
00:31:13,129 --> 00:31:16,729
I just heard something very important.

371
00:31:17,328 --> 00:31:18,389
Do you want to hear it?

372
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:19,609
I don't want to hear gossip.

373
00:31:20,489 --> 00:31:21,849
Let me finish.

374
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,440
Let me talk.

375
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,568
The deity who came to our Immortal Realm

376
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:26,769
to deliver the invitation

377
00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:27,929
to the Hundred Flowers Banquet

378
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:30,208
is honored as Luotian Goddess.

379
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:33,448
Do you know why

380
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:35,408
she has the title of 'Goddess'?

381
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:36,784
I don't want to know.

382
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:38,829
She and Lord Furong

383
00:31:38,829 --> 00:31:40,769
are Heavenly Lord's grandchildren.

384
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,089
But Lord Furong

385
00:31:42,089 --> 00:31:43,969
can only be called Diviner.

386
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:46,048
This title of 'Goddess'

387
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,969
is not to be used lightly.

388
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:49,520
I know.

389
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:52,429
Then you surely don't know

390
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:53,928
her relation to the ancient gods.

391
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:56,168
- General.
- Go away.

392
00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:00,112
Then tell me.

393
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:03,849
Before the chaos of Chimei
in our Immortal Realm,

394
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:05,649
this deity

395
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:06,808
had been bedridden for a long time

396
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:09,428
due to her incomplete celestial roots.

397
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,288
Your Lordship.

398
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:12,328
The illness of the deity

399
00:32:12,328 --> 00:32:15,649
might only be cured by Lord Xingzhi
in the Extranatural Heaven.

400
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,928
But only the ancient gods

401
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:23,328
can arrive at the Extranatural Heaven.

402
00:32:24,168 --> 00:32:26,009
We can only light the blessing lamps,

403
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:29,849
hoping that His Excellency
knows of my hardship.

404
00:32:40,928 --> 00:32:43,529
And he will come to save Youlan.

405
00:32:44,808 --> 00:32:46,129
Let me put it this way.

406
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:48,168
Everyone thought

407
00:32:48,168 --> 00:32:50,009
the deity could not be saved.

408
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:53,548
But guess what?

409
00:32:53,548 --> 00:32:55,449
- I...
- You can't guess.

410
00:32:55,449 --> 00:32:56,889
Coincidentally,

411
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:58,328
Lord Xingzhi

412
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:00,288
came to take her

413
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,649
to the Extranatural Heaven

414
00:33:01,649 --> 00:33:04,088
and cured her.

415
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,649
She's healed.

416
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:07,889
Therefore, those in the Divine Realm

417
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,969
believed that the Youlan Deity
was blessed by Lord Xingzhi.

418
00:33:11,688 --> 00:33:13,829
Heavenly Lord gave her a noble title,

419
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:15,609
Luotian Goddess,

420
00:33:16,408 --> 00:33:18,688
meaning blessings from the sky,

421
00:33:18,688 --> 00:33:20,069
the girl blessed by the gods.

422
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,969
General Shangbei, you talk a lot.

423
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,408
This is called fate.

424
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:27,408
If it weren't for you telling me

425
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:29,068
that ancient gods are
difficult to encounter,

426
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:30,609
I'd have forgotten about this matter.

427
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:33,849
To meet the ancient gods
in our lower realm

428
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,408
is tremendously difficult.

429
00:33:36,168 --> 00:33:38,448
When Lord Xingzhi stayed here

430
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,048
for quite a while,

431
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:42,649
I thought he was going
to settle down here.

432
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,408
General Shangbei, Her Lordship
doesn't like your gossip.

433
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:50,249
Even if Her Lordship were right here,

434
00:33:50,249 --> 00:33:51,628
I'd speak just the same.

435
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:52,669
That deity

436
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:54,489
fell in love with Lord Xingzhi.

437
00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:55,489
- Do you know?
- Shangbei.

438
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,488
Where did you pick up this habit?

439
00:33:57,488 --> 00:33:58,529
Always talking nonsense.

440
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:10,249
Your Holiness, Furong has been found.

441
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,329
I have come to report.

442
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:13,968
Your Excellency.

443
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,508
Greetings, Your Excellency.

444
00:34:15,508 --> 00:34:16,769
I am Youlan, Your Excellency.

445
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:18,688
Greetings, Your Holiness.

446
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,029
You two haven't met.

447
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:27,329
This is ShenLi,
Lord Bicang of the Immortal Realm.

448
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,550
(Luotian Goddess, Youlan of Divine Realm)

449
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:41,089
Why are you accompanying His Excellency?

450
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:46,049
We came back together.
It's not so strange.

451
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:50,489
You're engaged with my younger brother.

452
00:34:51,049 --> 00:34:52,608
Isn't it inappropriate to be around

453
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:54,544
His Excellency?

454
00:35:11,928 --> 00:35:13,089
You might find it hard to believe

455
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:14,309
if I tell you about it.

456
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:15,329
It's just such a coincidence.

457
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:18,189
I wasn't supposed to
be around Lord Bicang.

458
00:35:18,189 --> 00:35:19,288
Just as I was planning

459
00:35:19,288 --> 00:35:20,549
to return to the Divine Realm,

460
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:22,128
I traveled around

461
00:35:22,928 --> 00:35:25,149
and saw that Jinxiu City
was overflowing with miasma.

462
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:26,809
So I went to investigate.

463
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:29,129
Then I encountered
Lord Bicang in the city

464
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:31,249
who was looking for Lord Furong.

465
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:48,969
The miasma is a serious matter.

466
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:51,848
So I joined Lord Bicang to investigate.

467
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:53,849
The events that followed

468
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:55,648
must have been told by Furong.

469
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:01,009
At that time, Lord Bicang
was afflicted with miasma

470
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,729
and couldn't return
to the Immortal Realm.

471
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,569
So I had Furong
come back to report first.

472
00:36:06,168 --> 00:36:08,569
I stayed to help Lord Bicang
to clear the miasma.

473
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:10,368
Thus, there was some delay.

474
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:21,208
(His Excellency)

475
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:24,089
(makes up stories so naturally.)

476
00:36:24,608 --> 00:36:26,569
(Isn't he afraid that I will expose him?)

477
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:34,809
What else would you
like me to explain, Deity?

478
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,769
Just call me Youlan, Your Excellency.

479
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,689
Your Excellency acted
with great discretion.

480
00:36:42,689 --> 00:36:43,909
I overstepped my authority.

481
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:44,928
Please forgive me.

482
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:01,368
What brings you here this time, Deity?

483
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:04,849
The invitation to
the Hundred Flowers Banquet.

484
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,489
The Banquet held once
every three hundred years

485
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:08,149
is set to commence
on the eighteenth of next month.

486
00:37:08,149 --> 00:37:10,769
The Heavenly Lord sent me to
deliver the invitation to Her Holiness.

487
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:14,608
I see. I almost forgot.

488
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:16,929
It wouldn't matter.

489
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:19,389
I will soon ask permission
to go to the Western Garden,

490
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:21,529
light the blessing lamp and
deliver the invitation to you.

491
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,769
Alright, thank you.

492
00:37:27,888 --> 00:37:28,976
Your Holiness.

493
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,429
Regarding the miasma in Jinxiu City,

494
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,769
I have a report to make.

495
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:36,969
May I ask

496
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:39,128
if this matter here has been settled?

497
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:51,569
Then I will take my leave.

498
00:38:01,648 --> 00:38:03,312
Your Excellency isn't leaving?

499
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,888
You are to inquire into
our political affairs?

500
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:13,489
I cannot leave. I've told you.

501
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:16,608
The matter of the miasma is important.
I want to hear about it.

502
00:38:23,608 --> 00:38:24,928
We dare not conceal anything from you.

503
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,329
ShenLi, go ahead.

504
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:32,089
Regarding this miasma,

505
00:38:32,648 --> 00:38:34,209
Furong might not have reported in full.

506
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:36,089
Before we locate the enemy's lair,

507
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:37,648
Earth Diviners have been disappearing.

508
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,069
They have all been
abducted by the enemy.

509
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,089
Yet, no one knows

510
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:42,329
what to do with them.

511
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:43,669
Then, they all claimed

512
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:44,729
that the person who took them

513
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:45,849
carried spiritual energy.

514
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:47,159
They suspect it's from the Immortal Realm.

515
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,729
After my fight with the enemy,

516
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:51,888
I found that the person
did bear spiritual energy.

517
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:54,408
His name is Fu Sheng.

518
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:58,089
May I ask if Your Holiness has heard of

519
00:38:58,089 --> 00:38:59,729
such an individual?

520
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,064
Fu Sheng?

521
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:05,808
I have never heard of

522
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:06,809
such a person before.

523
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,009
He inflicted serious injury on you.

524
00:39:12,688 --> 00:39:13,769
Must be no ordinary person.

525
00:39:14,928 --> 00:39:17,569
The one who wounded me is not him

526
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:20,304
but

527
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,009
Zixia.

528
00:39:26,009 --> 00:39:27,529
Zixia?

529
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:29,729
Zixia's body must have been stolen

530
00:39:29,729 --> 00:39:31,129
and then refined into

531
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:35,049
creatures that are
neither human nor demon.

532
00:39:36,688 --> 00:39:38,448
The creatures are powerful
and know how to cooperate,

533
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:41,289
as if they have become lifeless puppets

534
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,408
that only follow orders.

535
00:39:46,529 --> 00:39:49,049
If such puppets were to be
created by the thousands,

536
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,608
it would be dreadful.

537
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:52,648
Creating puppets?
